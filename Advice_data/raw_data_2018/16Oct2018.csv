2,"Hello all, I'm gonna try to be as concise as possible. I'm a premed major, 2nd year, having a really hard time with one professor. I'm trying to maintain at least a 3.5 GPA this year, and in this particular physics class I can't get anything above a 75% on ANYTHING besides homework. I'm well aware that it is not the professor's fault, I'm just asking if anybody has some tips for adapting to a tougher professor. Currently the class overall average is a 79, which is right where I'm at. I have no problem with homework assignments and labs, but when it comes to lab reports, I find myself using all of my knowledge and effort and still getting a grade of 72. 

TL;DR: does anybody have any tips for beating a tough grader?",16Oct2018,1
3,"The woman on the other side of the street from me, her husband is the chief of police in our town of 1k people, she owns a lawn mowing business that mainly does all the city contracts. A few years before I bought my house the lot next to it had been empty, no buildings just a empty corner lot my neighbor would call the city and complain about the over grown grass once or twice a month. After a few months of her filing complaints she goes to the owner of the lot and offers to mow it in exchange for parking cars, boats, trailers, lot spliters, and what not on the lot at no charge. So she has the lot, and parks all the equipment EXACTLY on my property line, and the line she has with the other neighbor. When I say right on the line, I open my patio door, walk out the 10ft on my concrete patio, while standing on my patio I can reach her cars and trailers. I've asked her about it but she is unwilling to move them. She is kind enough to rotate them weekly so I get to look at a new piece of crap weekly. Do I have any options here, I've filed complaints with the city but no one cares I assume its because I'm really new in the small town and her husband is the chief of police. I'd love any advice, just some more info we are in Montana, all but 3 of her vehicles are registered. I'm wondering if because she uses the trailers for her company she'd have to be in a lot zoned commercial, this one is not. ",16Oct2018,1

5,"Hey, I'm 17 and go to an all boys school. Apart from the odd conversation with a girl I have had no advancements on a relationship.

I have found this girl I really like on Instagram who goes to a different school. She's pretty, funny, same interests and passions - the lot. However we have had literally no contact apart from the fact that we follow each other (Which doesn't mean much as she follows like 1000 people).

Now in a normal situation I would just suck it up and slide into the dms. However she has had a bf for about 6 months now and judging by the comments they have on each other's pics they are going pretty good. She doesn't even like any other guys pics. 

I am not exactly an eyecatcher (even though my hairs been looking kinda fly lately). I'm pretty skinny for the average guy my age and her bf has a better, more muscular build. I don't know if I'm her type(but me and her bf are the same ethnicity/ similar background)

I'm not an awkward guy or anything but I don't even know how I would approach this situation. How would I even approach a girl I've never talked to before who seems pretty loyal in a relationship and somehow make her my gf.

I've also got the rest of my life in the way, I have really important exams this year which will literally decide if I can do the career I want to do and I am behind on work, I don't know if I should be making time for a girlfriend. My income is incredibly low, I don't even have enough to spend if I went out alone frequently and all this has got me wondering if a gf is even worth it. After this year's gone hopefully I'll be off to uni and there's no chance of me running into her there as we could end up anywhere in the country. (Essentially I have a year)

However I really crave a relationship, but I just don't know what to do. Do I wait until she breaks up with him and pop up after?( would this be worse than popping up while she's still dating him?) Or do I just let it all go and accept that even if we did get together we are probably gonna get separated in a year's time because of uni and all this is not worth the hassle. 

Any advice is really appreciated thanks

6,"I am 19 years old. About 6 feet 7 inches. Decent at math, decent in English classes, a desire to write. But I have no passion, not like I used to. The only passion I have now is to escape. To escape reality, which I can do through games, and feel happy for as long as I play, and to escape my reality, which I can’t do. I can’t save money, because when I buy stuff it brings me a small amount of happiness, even though I know I should save it, so I can leave.

I don’t talk much, not at home, because of reasons, which I will get into later. I don’t talk much at school, I am in my second semester at MTC, something I attend only to satisfy my parents, taking classes towards a career that doesn’t interest me at all. I don’t talk much because despite my size, which I have insecurities about due to years of people commenting on my height, I am afraid of rejection, and on another level, acceptance. I talk too much at work, because I am nervous constantly, and a lot of the time the stuff I say concerning my personal life is a complete lie, something I say because of my fear of society.

I have thought a lot about why it is I am like this, whether it is because I was abandoned by my biological father, or because my biological mother was unfit to raise me. Whether I am just different than other people on the inside, or if I think in a weird way. But no, I don’t think that is the case. I think it has something to do with the way I was raised. In the foster care system until I was eight, being in multiple homes, one of which that sticks out more than the rest only lasting one night. In my main foster home, I stayed with a woman we called grandma. She was an older black lady, and I remember that I was the only white kid there. That in and of itself isn’t a bad thing, not as a concept at least, but looking back I was definitely treated different than the rest. For example, there was once a time when we had a small boy, a toddler, stay with us for a few weeks. I remember that night, the boy had somehow gotten a plastic bag. The boy, lets call him Michael, would keep putting the bag over his head, and so I would remove it. After a while, another boy, let’s call him Buster, finally went to go get grandma.

I thought good, she can help with Michael, get him to stop. She comes back, and I get in trouble. She started yelling at me to not put the bag on Michael’s head, and so I would tell her I wasn’t, that I was removing it. She got madder the more I told the truth, and so I got in deeper trouble. Eventually, I lied to her, told her I was doing it, and that I would stop. That put an end to the situation, and I learned on that day the truth isn’t always good. Flash forward to when I get adopted. At first it seemed great, but on the first night, my new mom is out, getting pizza I think, and my new dad, is making me cry. I don’t remember what I did, but I do remember being in the shower, the door closed, with my new dad standing outside it telling me I’m not good enough, and that they were going to take me back.

This isn’t the last time I would cry and feel like I am not good enough. I feel like I am intelligent, and that I can see how things are. My father doesn’t like that. It took me a while to learn that I have to humor him, which also isn’t good enough. Early on, every time he tried to give me advice, and ended up saying something I already knew, he would go into a rage. He would yell, saying I was disrespectful, and that he is over three times older than me. Sometimes that wasn’t enough, and he would shake me violently, making me cry, and throwing me on my bed. My mother tried to stick up for me, which would only end up in him yelling at her.

As I got older, and I hit my growth spurts, and put on the weight, he stopped being physically violent. His verbal abuse got worse, though, and by now my mother hardly ever took up for me, I think to avoid his wrath. He would try to taunt me into hitting him, so he could have an excuse, and that would make me want to cry, but I tried not to, so he wouldn’t get mad. He then started to comment on how whenever I talked to him it sounded like I had an attitude, so I slowly stopped talking. At the same time I started doing worse in school, barely scraping by each year, and not really talking to people in school. At the end of the day, however he would always apologize to me and my mother, but by that point I have metaphorically become a turtle, escaping into my shell.

Even when he isn’t yelling at me, I still can’t be alone with my thoughts, because most nights I hear him spewing out racist comments in the other room. I called him out on it once, I never did again.

Now I’m in college, and it is just as bad as ever. Now he holds over my head that he can kick me out at any moment, so I can’t stick up for myself should I ever build up the confidence, which is becoming more of a common occurrence. For instance, on the day I am writing this, I just tried to say something, and he god so mad he started slamming his hands on the dining room table. With each bang I felt myself tense up and withdraw more. I tried talking to him, saying how I had to go to the foot doctor to get an ingrown toenail removed, and he tried to tell me I should wait until I get a break from school. I tried to tell him I couldn’t wait because the toe is swollen. I knew I couldn’t just miss school, and that I would still have to go. I shouldn’t have interrupted him. I finished dinner and came to my room to think, and to silently sob. That’s when I finally decided to write this…",16Oct2018,1

9,"Long***I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with some other girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing/giggling . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting and one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and pressed her lips together in a polite/pleasant way and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whispered excitedly to her friend the brunette girl 'eh that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table nearby  (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and it went quiet and then it went like:

Brunette: “excuse  me...excuse me” 

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here?” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) i walked over t their table and I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well just by sight and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me. She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went quiet again: 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously and politely) 

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it really pleasantly )

Me: ***ignored her because I didn’t know what to think of it***

Blonde: *watching the whole thing and smiling* “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has” (probably has a gf) (she said it out loud while looking over at me like as if she made sure I heard her idk)

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” (Pleasantly in a wanted to know way)

Me: *ignored again wiping the table looking annoyed because I didn’t know how else to act*

Blonde: laughs a bit  and says ‘aww leave it, he’s fuming now’ laughing a bit (I wasn’t fuming it was the coffee stain on the table I was wiping was not coming out lol) 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk walking out with her hand on her head and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me and went out of her way a little to say ‘byyyeee’ loudly smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

Edit: a ew hours earlier in the night I thought the blonde one had called me over to ask me something about the menu drinks etc and I went  over to her and said ‘yes can I help you’ and she was actually  calling her other friends over behind me not me they laughed as I walked away feeling embarrassed ",16Oct2018,1

11,"Hello, 

For a while now, I have felt this feeling of emptiness. I'm not depressed, I just sense this hole in my chest that I can not get rid of. I don't really feel a sense of satisfaction anymore. I also have a hard time trying to convey my emotions towards others. I often find myself easily bored of things I used to enjoy. 

Just a little background that might familiarize yourself with me :

I am an 18 yr/old male. I like to take good care of myself, such as working out. I have been in relationships before, but it was nothing long term or serious. As of right now, I am attending Community College. After I graduated High School, I no longer have a huge social interaction with friends. While I want to make new friends at Community College, the majority of people at my Community College are just there to go to class and go home. There really is no social interaction between people. I have a part time job right now to pay for my car payment and insurance. I am a full time student taking 15 credit hours for my first semester of college.

I believe this feeling of emptiness arose towards the end of High School when my parents had a huge fight. I'm not going to go into detail, but my dad lost a lot of trust in my mom. Divorce was thrown around, but thankfully they are still together and are trying to work out their issues. While I'm glad they are still together, it almost seems like they have thrown me towards the side to work on their relationship. Instead of the three of us doing something, my parents will leave me at the house while they go out to eat, go and have fun around town, or spend money buying each other things. I do understand they deserve to have their alone time and fun, but it seems I'm not even apart of the equation anymore.

I feel somewhat lonely right now and I don't know what to do. I also am experiencing a severe lack of enthusiasm and motivation towards the things I used to love doing. If anyone can offer me advice to what I should do, I would extremely appreciate it! 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. ",16Oct2018,1
13,"My roommate dated this girl for around 2 weeks, and he shortly broke up with her after not feeling comfortable with her anymore. Problem is, she won't get over it. She has been annoying the hell out of our friends since they broke up, and told the staffs of our school about our dark humor and jokes (Since she came from a Jewish descent, we make Nazi jokes and Jew jokes as well, but she was completely fine with it. Yes, this wasn't something to joke about, but context is required. My roommate was also a German guy, so that's why we made said jokes). It's kinda stupid how she was fine with the jokes and shit, but now she changed her mind and uses these things against us, claiming that it offends her and shit. Also, she was also ""raped"" when she was 13, and we never joked about it since it personally would offend her, but it feels as she uses it to gain attention from people. She says that she told us personal things (Being raped, etc.), but she has told a lot of people that she met, the same personal things

TL;DR, she told staff members of our school about our dark humor and jokes as evidence against us, stating that offends her, even though she was okay with it in the first place.

Apologies for the rant, but this shit's pissing me off. I kept my mouth shut for a good while until I told her to grow up and get the fuck over it. Any advice in combating this issue?",16Oct2018,1
14,"To start I'm a 19 M with a 19 F, and we've been dating for a little over a year. Overall I'd say the relationship is amazing. She's smart, funny, kind, beautiful, etc., sex life is great, minimal arguments, and we both get along great with the others' friends. I love her very much, and I know she loves me, and we both trust each other a lot. 

In spite of all of this there's somehow this immature part of me that gets immensely jealous and insecure. I'd like to try and figure out why so I can stop getting these feelings. For the most part they don't really affect the relationship as we're able to talk it out and the problem is solved.

However, one thing that tends to trigger this the most which I can't seem to shake is the concept of attractiveness, both of myself and others. What I mean by this is the thought that she once was attracted to other people, and that she may still find other people attractive upsets me, almost to the point of anger. These feelings aren't really directed at her, and I guess it's just a result of the jealousy/insecurity (perhaps it's anger at myself, I can't really tell). 

There are a couple of contributing factors to this I can think of:

First, I struggle a little bit with anxiety/depression which, although has become less of an issue lately, still has an affect on my thoughts from time to time. I've struggled with feelings of inferiority, so perhaps I have a hard time internalizing it when she tells me she thinks I'm attractive.

Second, it's possible that I've internalized somewhat unhealthy ideas about what relationships ""should"" be like. I think there's something deep inside me that believes you should only find one person attractive: the person you're dating. Rationally I know this is stupid. I understand that she's a human and she will have feelings of attraction towards other guys, and that's just how life works. I also know that it doesn't change how she feels about me, but again this is something that I somehow have a hard time internalizing. This is my first relationship, so perhaps just a lack of experience makes it difficult for me to truly believe what I know to be true.

Third, I will admit that I am the stereotypical guy in that I tend to get distracted easily by a woman's body parts. I do try very hard to be respectful of women, but sometimes it's hard not to steal a glance. I don't actually know if women do the same thing to men, but there's a part of me that would like to think my girlfriend doesn't. So it's possible that these feelings actually stem from a sort of self projection, that ultimately my own hypocrisy is what makes me upset, and not so much her natural attraction to men. 

It could be some combination of all these reasons combined, or it could be something entirely different. I guess I'm just looking for someone who's either been here before or knows what's happening to help me figure out how to quash these feelings.

TLDR: I'm struggling with accepting the fact my girlfriend will still find other guys attractive and that it won't change how she feels about me. How do I change that?",16Oct2018,1

18,"To anyone that reads this, thank you. It's a slight cry for help at this point as I have nobody in my life to turn to. 

I'm a 19 year old male, currently living with my mother, surrounded by an almost toxic environment, trapped with absolutely nothing in the future. My life has gone absolutely downhill, and in terms of my education, and my future, I see nothing left for me at all.  
In September 2017, I went into an Art College for a year solely to improve my art and strengthen my Art portfolio for an Animation course in University. I also wanted to make new connections, with new people as a chance to start anew after sixth form. Had to fake through a toxic environment in Sixth Form to avoid getting bullied once again. Looking back, I was probably much better off at another Sixth Form/College altogether, but it was perhaps the people I considered as my ""friends"" which caused me not to seek out a means of escape. I have a lot of regrets.  
During Sixth Form, I stumbled across some articles online which revealed the harsh reality of the creative industry right now, and that heavily discouraged me. I had a crisis, but not as bad as the one I'm having now. I decided, to just look past it all and do it simply because I couldn't imagine myself doing anything else.  
It hasn't even been a few weeks and I'm slowly beginning to feel left behind by my peers. They all clearly had some form of ""talent"" within them, they've perhaps been doing this at a very young age. I was just the guy who did this one-year course because my Art teacher convinced me to, and that I, at some point, really wanted to draw cool-looking characters for a story that I can't get out of my head. Being heavily discouraged by this new environment, feeling ""out of place"" and someone at an absolute different wavelength, I left convinced that maybe this sort of thing is something I should just keep as a hobby. I gave into what I read online about how bad the industry was doing, and sought for an alternative.  
Only problem was, was that I didn't have one. I left that Art College not knowing what was the next academic step for me.  
After a few weeks of being out of education and in unemployment, my mother urged me to find a job to help her with finances and rent because as I was out of education, she wasn't getting any support from the government anymore. (This is what she's told me, anyway.) So, I decided to job hunt in the retail industry since it was pretty easy. Took a while, a few rejections until I managed to get a temporary position at a department store for the Christmas period. This store has a very high, positive reputation for the way employees get treated there and how they treat customers, so I thought why not. First few months, it honestly wasn't that bad, but it wasn't good, or perfect either. I was trying to impress the managers in hopes that they keep me on for a permanent position, and they surprisingly did. After accepting the offer, I slowly began getting sick of the environment. My manager told me that I was ""shy"" and I need to get used to faking my confidence. Had zero common grounds with any of my colleagues, which made conversations just very awkward.  
Some days I managed to fake it since I was in a fairly good mood, others I just absolutely stopped trying because I forced myself to be this person I wasn't, only to, at times, be treated like a piece of shit by the customers. As I was 18 at the time, when my colleagues asked me why I wasn't at Uni, I made up a lame story that I was taking a gap year and weighing my choices. I faked my dying passion and career prospects and said I wanted to study Law, or Business just to keep those people from being disappointed in me.  
My depression got worse as the months went by working there, and one day every single ounce of hope that I never knew I had in my life just vanished. I had 32 tablets of Paracetamol in my bag already, so I walked home, played on my Switch and started ingesting the tablets. It was a half-assed attempt, I wasn't afraid to take the pills. I was drunk whilst doing this. I wanted to internally fuck myself up so bad that I don't go to work the next day. Walked myself to ER at the middle of the night after ingesting 14 pills and had to lay in a bed amidst the screaming chaos around me as they put some antidote in me. Got two few days off, told my manager that I attempted suicide, and he was very supportive, which I appreciate. It still didn't change how I felt about working there, so I did myself a favour and put my two weeks in.  
Left on the 1st of this month, and I'm currently unemployed. Once again, I'm back to my mother pushing me to either go to University or get a job to help her out. I have some money in my savings she can feed off of, but it won't be long until that's all gone. She really thinks I've got my life together. That's what everyone thinks. I honestly want to go as far away from the city as possible. I'm sick of this place.  
My situation is absolute shit, because its either do something you don't like but make a decent living out of, or do something you love which won't generate any financial income to support myself with, especially if I want to be alone, which I definitely want.  
I really don't know what to do anymore. I've no direction in my life. It's not as easy and clear cut as I thought. Sigh.  
tl:dr: I went to an art school because I liked art but people think art is a useless degree so i stopped and got a retail job which made me more depressed so i nearly committed suicide and left my job and now here i am again unemployed and depressed again. ",16Oct2018,1

But posting in that group turned out to be a mistake as it severely pushed me down and now I am unable to focus on literally anything without the thought of insecurity taking over me.

What am I insecure of? Basically, I am insecure of the way I look. I come from Pakistan and currently study in a university in Europe. In the beginning I didn't really care but, as time passed by, I became more and more isolated. The problem is that I am an atheist, so I cannot relate to the Pakistani expats living in the current European country and, therefore, have no Pakistani friend here (I had a handful of friends in my home country who accepted me for who I was). However, I am a brown Paki, so that means, at the end of the day, I am isolated. To date, after spending one year in Europe, I managed to make only one good friend here. However, I think he is starting to move on because he is an extroverted person and I am not. I don't know whether he still wants to remain as my friend and I wouldn't blame him. I am a socially awkward brown Paki which probably makes him look bad in front of his other friends.

A few weeks ago, suddenly this wave of insecurity took over me and I deleted my pictures from all social media profiles that I had. And then I joined this Forever Alone subreddit hoping to find refuge and maybe some support. But all it did was reinforce this idea that I am a worthless piece of shit who doesn't deserve love. I don't know how to bring myself out of this state of mind. The fact that I have been a virgin my whole life (I am 25 now) and that girls in general stay away from me, keeps reinforcing this idea and I cannot ignore it anymore. I have been ignoring the fact that girls hate me/ don't like to talk to me all my life but I am not able to do that anymore.

You might think of this as a rant but I am asking for honest advice. How do I deal with this situation? Girls back in my home country actively avoided me and now, here in Europe, it's pretty much the same situation plus it is even worse because of my race/ ethnicity. I don't know what kind of mindset I should put myself in to avoid overthinking this situation. Honestly, some days I just wake up and I don't want to leave my apartment even though I have class. This is seriously affecting my daily routine and I am scared it might mess me up mentally at such a crucial point of my academic career (I am a Masters in engineering student). I cannot let these emotions stay inside me for so long, I need to find some kind of outlet. If anyone has ever been in a situation like mine and been able to come out of it then please advise me as to what should I do. ",16Oct2018,1
24,"Hi! I need help!

I am reaching the age where I really need to get serious. Peers are applying for colleges and putting together portfolios... and I'm still trying to figure out what I want my job to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely have no clue. When I was younger, I (at first) wanted to be a vet. After I had to treat my dog, I realized that'd never happen. Can't handle it. After that, I went through so many phases, I only really remember three passions. 

1. Something to do with horses (I fucking loved horses)
2. Being rich (I legit just wanted a fucking mansion)
3. Drawing.

I am not bad at drawing. I've been seriously practicing for about four years. But, I personally believe that art schools are kind of useless, plus I get super impatient with myself and can't finish a project to save my life.

I like science, but what kind of job would I have? What if I'm not smart enough? What schools do I go to?

I'm good at debate, and I used to pretend to be a lawyer by helping friends when they wanted to make agreements or contracts (I have no clue why they wanted to so often)... but going to school takes soooo long. Boring. 

I am somewhat involved in local politics, and I've impressed a pretty well known politician in my area. I'm opinionated, and I don't back down easily. But how do you plan for a future in politics? How do I be a politician and maintain my soul AND keep my family safe?

I considered forensics. I like crime investigating, but I think I'm being influenced by tv shows tbh...

30,"Hello to the lovely population of Reddit. This is a throwaway account, and I just need validation on whether or not what I'm doing is socially ideal in the interest of building a potential friendship but not an emotional mayhem for two parties.

So I am a bisexual guy, 18 years old, and at my job there is another guy whom I liked. I worked there about four months now, and I knew for sure that I liked him. So three weeks ago I directly told that I liked him. NOT verbally, I wrote a cute note with my phone number and a smiley face saying I liked him, but under serious circumstances so he knew I wasn't kidding around. But as it turned out, he told me that he has a girlfriend. Maybe my Gaydar is off, but boy... I thought for sure he was interested in me. And he is really fashionable for a straight guy as well.

So yeah, I got swiftly rejected. But in his defense he did try his best to make me feel comfortable, saying it alright or whatever. But I made him feel overwhelmingly uncomfortable by doing so. And I was overwhelmingly embarrassed to be rejected, but this is life.

So here's the thing... He still tries to make small talk or whatever like he wants to make friends with me. I don't want to be friends. I am actually in love with him, and I know we can't be together. On top of that I want to respect the relationship between him and his girlfriend, so I don't want to flirt with him, I can't touch him anymore because I just know he'll get uncomfortable again.... But yet he still want to be friends. I don't get it.

So what I started doing is that I been avoiding talking to him since two weeks ago. And my cold shoulder is something that can make people feel dead. Practically I treat you like a ghost, a moving object, unimportant. And that is exactly how I've been treating him because I am at a lost on how I can advice interactions with him. I don't want to touch him on any level (But I do want to touch him on every level), I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable (But I do make him feel uncomfortable), and I don't want a friendship with him, (Because I want an romantic relationship with him).

So should I continue giving him the eternal silent treatment? Or should I attempt to suppress my feelings and continue being friends with him?",16Oct2018,1
31,"Hi all. 

Need some advice here. I am a mom of 2, living 3 hours away from my mom who lives alone. She is currently unemployed and suffering from something. She swears up and down it’s severe depression, but was at one point diagnosed as schizophrenic (or something of the sort). She believes that basically her entire community (cops are in on it too apparently) are sneaking into her home, gaslighting her, stalking her, swapping useless things out of her house, and various other activities to “make her think she’s crazy”. Basically, she’s convinced she’s being gangstalked.  Looking back on it, she’s always had issues thinking our neighbors were gossiping about us or doing things to piss her off, and it’s only as I got older that I realized holy cow no one has the time to be THAT focused on someone else. She also has some narcissistic qualities that are really hard to deal with. Up until earlier this year, I was still in pretty regular contact with her (although I am not proud to say she caught me during some really challenging times and I got into some really nasty arguments with her). 

My sister is not in contact with her and she divorced my father in a really nasty divorce back when I was a teen. She was already in a mental hospital once. She also is estranged from her sister and brother and her parents are deceased. 

I’m sure this is not the best course of action, but in order to protect my own sanity and my family, I ceased contact with her when she was going down hill. She was skimping or halving her medication at the time, I can tell. And I have two young kids and she has already invited one of her suspected stalkers to stay overnight and then insisted I come over to “prove” she was being stalked. I don’t trust her when she is like this. 

Well, earlier this month, I get a message from my cousin (her sister’s kid). She called my uncle and was begging to come out because she’s going to lose her home and she’s being stalked and hired a private investigator. Here’s the thing. She’s unemployed. She straight up told me she’s off her medication. She  paid this private investigator like thousands of dollars (and now has no job so of course she’s in financial difficulty). She found my in laws house and stopped there for 3 hours. Now she’s harassing them via phone and leaving crazy messages. She also said she’s gonna keep stopping by during weekends to see if we are there visiting so she can see us. 

I’m at my wits end. I don’t know what to do. I told her she needs help and we cannot have a relationship until she gets help. She’s not listening to me at all. Any ideas? ",16Oct2018,1
32,"Long***I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with some other girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing/giggling . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting and one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and pressed her lips together in a polite/pleasant way and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whispered excitedly to her friend the brunette girl 'eh that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table nearby  (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and it went quiet and then it went like:

Brunette: “excuse  me...excuse me” 

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here?” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) i walked over t their table and I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well just by sight and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me. She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went quiet again: 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously and politely) 

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it really pleasantly )

Me: ***ignored her because I didn’t know what to think of it***

Blonde: *watching the whole thing and smiling* “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has” (probably has a gf) (she said it out loud while looking over at me like as if she made sure I heard her idk)

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” (Pleasantly in a wanted to know way)

Me: *ignored again wiping the table looking annoyed because I didn’t know how else to act*

Blonde: laughs a bit  and says ‘aww leave it, he’s fuming now’ laughing a bit (I wasn’t fuming it was the coffee stain on the table I was wiping was not coming out lol) 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk walking out with her hand on her head and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me and went out of her way a little to say ‘byyyeee’ loudly smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

Edit: a ew hours earlier in the night I thought the blonde one had called me over to ask me something about the menu drinks etc and I went  over to her and said ‘yes can I help you’ and she was actually  calling her other friends over behind me not me they laughed as I walked away feeling embarrassed ",16Oct2018,1

Anyways i got on the floor tonight and saw the person i normally work with was not here yet. Well after a while they put someone else on. This person i immediately recognize as someone ive left early on before because he has a habit of talking way too much,  and quickly devolved into being intentionally offensive towards me..i told my supervisor i couldnt work with him last time and left. Foward a few months to now.  I put all my stuff down arrange my area and parts and start working.(i have one headphone in)  Not even 2 minutes in i hear,  ayyy. Ayy!  Im talkin to you.   I respond by taking  my single headphone out and saying  yea?   Immediately this man starts telling me. That i dont ""know about him""  and he stopped working last time because he wanted a break (he disappeared for about a month) and that he ""runs this shit""  i just kinda look at him and shrug him off with oh,  ok. Put my phone back in and continue working. Not even a minute later ""hey.  Hey boy. You listen to me. I see you i know you i know your life. I see what you do""  i respond..oh..ok.? What exactly do you see?  "" heyy. Hear me. I know you a bitch. You talk like my girl. You a faggot drag queen"" to which i just kinda look at him weird and im like what?! Lol. He then proceeds to tell me its ok but i need to watch my smart ass mouth. Cause no one wants to work with me and some want to beat my ass..ive been here 5 months. I get along with everyone so i Kinda shrug that off and tell him."" Hey look dude, i dunno what your into but im not gay,  sorry""  he just immediately devolved into calling me a faggot and i was gnna get  my ass whooped cause he wont look after me no more.   Ive worked with This guy maybe 7 or 8 times. Given him rides home so  by the end of this exchange im pissed. I go to my supervisor and he says..""i dunno. He probably drunk"" he says dont worry ill get him to appologise. Im sorry man.  3 minutes go buy he calls me back and says its this guys first day back at work and asks if i can work with him. I walk away to his boss and immediately complain . he says not to worry they will send him home. I said ok,  and asked to talk to the hr manager. He said...oh..ok..and supposedly texted him and he was coming down. So i calmed down a bit after being reassured he would come down get my side and document the confrontation..i dont know if he legally has to but i requested it,  as the man had threatened me personally and threatened me with 3rd party violence. My supervisor saw the hr guy come out and flagged me to go speak with him. Which i attempted to do,  only to be waved back downstairs by him. He apparently didnt need to speak to me about anything. I was confused and went down stairs to my supervisor and informed him ""he didnt need me"" he said oh my bad hes probably gonna come back down...its been 3 hours now as i said..his car is gone and my supervisor has no answers for me..i have a bit of social anxiety normally and right now im freaking out kind and no one in charge seems to care..that guy is back on a different machine..why can he speak to me like that and keep his job..why do my supervisor and hr find it ok to ignore this...i just come to work and do my best..why is it fair to be spoken to and treated like that..sorry for formatting and grammar..still rattled and at work will fix later...",16Oct2018,1
36,"I know, it’s childish to even bring this up. But this has gone too far. 
I am 24F, and she is 27F.
This started about 3 years into our friendship. 
We have been friends for quite some time now. 
I started to realize a lot of similar things. In the beginning of our friendship, I loved that she was unique and really cool. Basically, I loved her for her. I felt like we both had a connection because we were so different in personality and style that we clicked really well. I personally don’t think anything dramatic happened to her for her to change her ways in order for all of this to happen? I kept telling myself that I’m probably being “too paranoid” or “full of myself” but our circle is starting to take notice and makes us all feel uncomfortable. More annoying for me because it feels like i’m hanging out with a clone constantly, and i feel like there’s nothing new or special anymore. 
Here are some examples: the way I talk, what i own, how i do my make up and hair, the way i dress, anything i watch, similar jobs changes, all of my personal likes and dislikes, my small habits, what i order when i’m out in public and how I eat. Even the little things that get to me like the way i style and decorate my room/home, my nail polish color and SO ON.
EVERY LITTLE THING. It’s truly freaky.

I know what you’re all thinking, “TALK TO HER! SHE’S YOUR BEST FRIEND” 
Trust me, I have brought this up to her plenty of times. She doesn’t take confrontation well and she feels like i’m “attacking her”. She drops the phase for a bit but picks up the habit after a couple of weeks.

I’ve even tried thinking differently, like letting it go because its 2018 and truly, it is childish to think this way. I am not saying I am a trendsetter. I just never experienced this type of relationship ever in my entire life until now. 
I even took changing it up and taking it as a compliment as a thought, but its a lot easier said than done. 

I just need some advice. What are some ways to talk to her without her getting upset with me?  
Should I just let it go, if so, how do i cope with it not getting to me personally?

1) Fix the issue 

2) Check it in for a technician to look at

3) Do nothing (inform them we don't perform the service they are requesting)

&amp;#x200B;

It's not a bad gig and is able to pay the bills for the most part. However, recently rumors have been spreading around that the technicians will be checking in systems and the other people in my position (including myself) will strictly be doing tech support (attempting to resolve the issue right then and there). Many of the technicians are unhappy with this expected change and our lead tech has already put in his 2 weeks. My manager is already training one of us to be a technician because he used to work at a competitor where he learned how to replace iPhone batteries and data backups. When he was told to build a computer for a customer, it took him about 4 hours and did not even finish the build (this would take almost anyone else in our position about 2 1/2 hours).

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I'm trying to vent to a bunch of strangers on the Internet, but at the same time I am pretty scared that I will no longer have a job in 6 months. With technicians going to the front end to interact with customers, it leaves very little space for us to filter out who really needs to check a system in. It appears to me that my manager is trying to ""trim the fat"" and get rid of the tech support specialists. I feel like I have enough knowledge to perform as a technician, but am relatively uncertain as to whether or not he will offer me the position. Should I confront him and ask whether or not I should still be employed there in 6 months? Should I be looking at other positions within the company (home office is very close by to me)?

42,"I graduated in May with a degree in biology. With a 15 year repayment plan, I will owe 40k in federal loans and 74k in private loans (114k total) including interest. I worked my butt off getting into a great accelerated nursing program, but now that Im in it, I dont know if I can actually see myself working as a nurse. It wasn't an overnight decision either to go to school again, I spent months preparing applications as I thought this was definitely it for me.  

Now that Im unsure, I feel stuck. The program is 16 months, and costs 80k. With the loans I have for it, I will end up paying 134k total for the program. I am only in the first semester, and I have the option to take up to one year off for personal leave when the semester ends, and can rejoin the program after.  

The way I see it, the pros of taking time off include potentially not wasting money on a degree I could hate and accruing more debt, and that I could get a job and soul search a little to figure out what I want to do. The cons are that I have zero clue what Im interested in or would pursue, I would have to start paying back loans from the first degree, I would delay graduation if I realize it is what Im interested in, and everyone keeps telling me that I will never want to return to school again once I stop.   

Do you think its worth ""sticking it out"" for 134k, in hopes that I will eventually enjoy it, or should I take the time off and do literally anything else to see how I feel about it?

Lately however, many of my friends are doing things that i find morally wrong and that i don’t agree with. I’m shocked that this has happened but don’t know what to do about it. In addition, (I hate to word it like this but i don’t know how else to say it) my friend group is also the stereotypical “popular group” and just as one would assume they treat people who are different from them harshly and unkind. I’ve always had friends that they would label as  weird and consider some of them as some of my closest friends. I would almost just cut ties with all of them but let me now introduce why i’m hesitant: 

1. I only have time to hang out with these friends and because of this i can’t get invited to many of my other fiends gatherings. I’m afraid if I leave my current friends i’d then just be a loner and not be invited to anything.

2. Currently because of my association with that group of friends i’m invited to many of their parties and have some perks with running with the “cool crowd”. 

3. There’s one particular friend in that group that i’m extremely close to. She’s different from the group in the sense that she doesn’t participate in the negative actions i’ve described. I’m afraid if i distance myself from the group then i’ll also distance myself from her also.

As a last note I want to clear up that I do not mean to humble brag when i mention me being part of the “cool kids” I apologize if this came off as rude or inconsiderate. In addition, i hope my mention of the particular friend doesn’t come off as creepy, i would elaborate on why but it’s a bit to personal for the internet.

46,"Okay so here’s a part of my crazy life story. I have met my biological father once. He signed off his rights when I was 2 years old. My mom and grandparents told me this was for my best interest. When I would be with my biological father, who we will call Jerry, I would come home to my mom reeking if cigarette smoke, and all around my mom has repeatedly said that I would have turned out awfully if he kept his rights as my father. My mom was 20 at the time, deep into drugs and the party scene. Jerry was also a drug dealer during the time. My grandparents spent over $10,000 in this court case to ensure that Jerry would not have rights to see me anymore. I was told that my mom won the case because we had more money to spend. Jerry lost his rights as he did not have more money to pay for lawyers.  

Now, here comes along “Stanley”. Stanley is 18 years older than my mom, quite a charming guy who shows up frequently at the restaurant where she servers. The start dating, and soon marry, as my mom sees Stanley as a good financial choice. (She is only 20 and sees Stanley as someone who could provide for her and her daughter, AKA me) 

Stanley adopted me! Woohoo! I have a dad! I honestly didn’t know better because he adopted me at 3 years old and I don’t remember Jerry in the slightest.

Years pass, I’m a kick ass kid. Top 4% of my graduating class, slightly a loser with not a lot of friends, but overall I really turned out okay. I’m 20 and married to the man of my dreams and I’m the first in my family to attend college.  During my time at home, my mom ended up becoming a raging alcoholic narcissist who made my life hell. I was a perfectionist. I needed to be perfect. I believe her constant manipulation and name calling is the reason I take a 20 mg pill of Prozac daily, because I’m a mess off of my meds. 

I actually moved out as soon as I turned 18 and lived with my grandparents because being by my mom was that awful. When I was 17 and moved out my mom threatened to call the cops and say I ran away, so I had to move back home and wait till my birthday. 

Her and Stanley get a divorce after being married for 12 years. I also have a little sister but she’s irrelevant to this story. 

My senior year of high school, my mom reached out to Jerry’s ex wife and asks if he was a good father to my half brother I have never met. She said yes, and my mom encouraged me to reach out to Jerry. 

Jerry and I start texting, he tells me that he legally couldn’t talk to me until I turned 18 and that’s why he never contacted me as a child. Interesting. 

A few months pass with our texting relationship, We go to a Mexican restaurant for the first time and we meet, talking for 3 hours about our lives and pretty much catching up.

And that’s it.
After that he went radio silent. 

So whatever, it kind of hurt, but i lived 18 years without the bastard, so everything went back to my normal life before I knew Jerry. 

Now I’m 20 years old. And for the past 2 years Jerry’s great Aunt and his parents have been in constant contact. So that’s fine and good, but I don’t want a relationship with these people if my own biological father isn’t going to talk with me.  They sent me birthday cards and posted on my facebook wall, but not Jerry. 

Now I have never met these people. They text me about how they want to meet me, though. 

My “cousin” on that side just reached out to me via instagram.  Here is her message to me: 

“I want you to know that papa George is getting open heart surgery Oct. 25th and today he hasn’t been feeling well. I don’t want to guilt trip you by any means at all, I just want you to be aware that his health is of a big concern right now &amp; to be honest I’m still scared after all my prayers. Chris and I live two houses down from papa and grandma now so I can see him everyday but it’s still hard seeing him not his normal self and feeling well. I would like to ask if you could consider having a lunch with papa, grandma, &amp; I soon. Papas biggest hope is just to meet you, nothing more.”

So now, here I am, married and finally content with my life. Away from my awful mother. And now I’m faced with the decision on if I should meet my biological father’s dying dad. 

What would you do?",16Oct2018,1

Fast-forward to a few months ago and he makes contact, apologizing for how he'd treat me - since then we've talked a bit online, hung-out twice (last time was not Friday just gone but the Friday before). I'd like to spend more time with him...I've no friends locally, I like spending time with him, also he's very social so if I could develop a friendship with him it may help me meet new people too.   


I noticed on Facebook he's shown interested in an event I'm interested in next Friday, he knows I'm interested in these sort of events, I also think he's normally free on Fridays - although he's always got something new going on so he may not be. I'd like to ask him to join me but I'm worried he'll say no or that he's going with someone else - that'd mean I'd have to avoid going as it'd be awkward my going alone while he's there with someone else - I'm also worried he may read this as a date, when I just like spending time with him and want someone to go to this event with.

48,"Hi, all:

About six months ago, a family member of mine committed suicide. We were undoubtedly very close, and the initial shock of it was surreal. Time has (somewhat) healed the wound, but it’s still very much there.

About two months ago, I began student teaching. I have a wonderful mentor teacher that is just so kind and selfless. In many ways, he’s been a fatherly figure to me since the passing of my family member. 

Anyway, I just had my midterm evaluations from my supervisor and teacher. They all had marvelous things to say, and I was actually tearing up at some of the things my teacher wrote about me.

My life has been very good as of recent, and I feel that I should be happy. I woke up today in a pleasant mood, ready to tackle a new week and teach. Well, that’s when the grief hit me again out of no where. I began to think about my family member, again, and I’ve been in a funk throughout the day today. 

I think a lot of it has to deal with the fact that said family member and I used to vent to each other. We were like outlets for one another, and since his passing, I haven’t had that outlet.

I really feel like talking to someone about all of this, but I just don’t know who to contact. My teacher knows my circumstances and always tells me to talk to him if I’m feeling depressed, but I just don’t want to be weird if I get too detailed about my personal life. I also just feel that I might just come off as a sad sack that just can’t handle his emotions. I feel like he’d be a good person to talk to because I am with him 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.


tl;dr: Family member committed suicide six months ago; life is good atm, but I am feeling the grief resurface. ",16Oct2018,1

I was offered and accepted a job that paid $8 more an hour + full time and as of today, I said I would like to return to my old job because I'm not ready for that position, yet.  The manager is a great guy but my parents are going to kick my ass once they found out what I did.  I'm 26, by the way, but this was the most amazing opportunity I could have gotten and couldn't do it.. for now.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been so severely depressed, not happy about anything in life, whether I'm making more money or not.  I've also been lonely, I rarely go out and when I do, it's just to go to the gas station to pick something up and then come right back home.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has been out of work for nearly 6 months now due to some conditions and she is stressing about bills and stuff like that which is also reason as to why they're going to kill me once they found out what I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to focus a little more on myself and start 'acting' like I'm 26 and performing duties and tasks myself instead of my mom constantly doing things for me.  It's cool that she does it but I'm tired of it already.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about going to the gym and start forcing myself to go out and 'live' instead of being inside all the time, surrounded by 4 walls and my computer.

I'm a 23 year old Canadian, I have a great career set up, I'm doing very well for myself but there is a little something missing. I work for a railroad, which is a great opportunity for me to excel as a young adult with plenty of opportunities. I also love to travel. Thankfully, I'm able to do a little bit of travelling on the side while I work.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan was to take a leave of absence which would last a year to travel over seas and work for a European railroad. For the past four years, I've always wanted to do this. Recently, I asked for my leave and it unfortunately got refused. I've been thinking about doing this for a while and I'm a little torn between the two. I won't be able to work over seas without coming back here to a great job.

&amp;#x200B;

I still live with my parents, I have no ties here at home other than family, friends and a fantastic job. I asked for a leave of absence as job security in case I have to come back home. My plan would be to stay there in Europe indefinitely and to enjoy the experience of working abroad/experiencing a new culture. I'm having a hard time giving up my work because I have it really good. If I leave and come back, I'd have to restart at the bottom of the ladder, once again. I'm not sure if I should follow my dream or play it safe and enjoy myself at home. Both options are great, but it's still quite the decision. I may be giving up my work opportunity here. Should I leave it all at home and travel over seas to restart over there?",16Oct2018,1

58,"*reposting because I really need some advice*

I've always been the quiet, lonely guy growing up being a former fat boy (265lbs at 12yrs to 155lbs two years ltr), I was also severely bullied, moreover my mother had plenty of guys come over(for sex). As a result I lacked social skills, was depressed, had no father figure and the dating aspect of my life was entirely nonexistent. Well I graduated HS, joined the army and now I'm stationed 3 hours from home you could say I'm doing great considering my upbringing

So I took vacation about two months ago and got it into my head I should go get a date while I'm here. Keep in mind I've never been on one before. Long story short I had met this beautiful girl(18) whom we shared classes in highscool however we never talked until now. We went on three dates and we were both head over heels for each other. Went back to where I'm stationed and maintained a ldr. Our usual 4 hour phone call conversations were nice I admit I was getting clingy and attached but it was my first time so what can I say.

Our conversations started shifting towards her past like she wanted me to know. It turns out her first bf had raped her, she told me she lost that ""feeling"" of how women should be pure and she went on a spree sleeping with 6 guys and 2 girls. I was in shock the girl I really like wasn't this ""good"" girl. I was struck with overwhelming jealousy and insecurity. I couldn't take it and acted poorly we settled on being friends, that was too much. One night while drunk she ridiculedd me for being a virgin and how she wants to be young and reckless, how sex with me would be wack she wouldn't give me a chance. I slept with this random women off tinder the very next day thinking she'll give me a chance then. I came for her birthday drove three hours brought her flowers and she stood me up and went out with her friends. That night we got into it and parted ways.

I tried living my life but I find myself texting her begging for another chance. Being rejected by her I slept with 4 more women. After everytime I found myself crying afterward for some reason. I felt like my inner self was withering away and I lost my moral identity l still went on and the last straw was driving to a complete strangers home getting blowjob/anal on her patio and leaving right after. it felt cold and disgusting. I broke down at a truck stop at 2am and drove back from home, I didnt even say goodbye to grandma. I cant have her see me like this. This isn't the type of person I am, I'm fucking sick of who I've become.

So far I've adopted smoking, drinking, and dipping. I've spent 2500$ the past month, I've pushed away my family away even my grandmother who is closer to me than my own mother. I started binge eating again and I'm slowly gaining the weight I intially lost

Just last night I got into a fight with my best friend who I drove 3 hours to see. He called me a little bitch after trying to tell him what I've been going through. We're no longer friends.

I'm lying to myself if I say I still don't have feelings for this first girl I met. During the car ride at 1am, I had to take a nap at a gas station I figured I need to get her out of my mind and completely destroy any chance I have with her(if there was one). I sent her a message on snapchat telling her everything that has been going on, ending it with ""Dont even think this is because of you, I just need to push away/forget the last thing i care about and start again(I'm doing this by telling you), as far as you're concerned I never exsisted."" She didn't care at all after leaving me on open. I was alone at some dirty gas station in the middle of nowhere.

Td;lr: I really have no idea whats going with me, I just really needed to get this off my chest. I don't have anyone to talk to anymore",16Oct2018,1
59,"BACKSTORY:
We've all known each other for years. Her and I used to flirt, she and him used to date, and now they're back together and have been for the past few years.

He and I are pretty similar in stature, except I'm nicer and more personable, whereas he's more conventionally attractive. Other than a few other minor differences, we have similar style, aesthetic, anime taste, food preferences, etc.

Her and I got close before they started to date. Now, a few years later, it seems their relationship isn't on the steadiest grounds- and it seems, at least to me, that she's ready to leave that relationship for something new. 

I'm a very flirty guy, and my friends know that I'll flirt with anyone at any time (within reason), so for the past year or so I've been getting odd vibes from said friends whenever they find she and I are alone. Since she and her boyf are both my friends, I've never wanted to make a move. It'd just be douchey. Cheating, or convincing someone to cheat, is never okay. 

RECENTLY:
The other day we went out with a few other friends. Her boyfriend was supposed to come, but couldnt make it ""for some reason"". While we were waiting in line to go in, she looked at me up and down, checking me out (actually stared at my groin for 3 seconds, maybe zoned out idk), then looked straight at me with the Ariana Grande eyes like I was Pete Davidson (rip to them I was rooting for them). 

Eventually we get in and its all cool, we're all just dancing and having a good time. The others with us essentially took turns getting drinks so as to never leave her and I alone (again those weird vibes). As the night went on, she got drunker and started flirting with me as she normally does with her boyfriend. She also repeatedly rubbed my back and hit my arm with her boobs whenever she would return from the bathroom/getting drinks. 

More fun, more drinks, etc. Eventually we were all ready to move to the next ""spot"". The others had to go to the bathroom, so she and I were left alone for a few minutes. Almost immediately after they leave, she puts her arm in mine to hold her steady. She needed it cause, well, she drank a bit, so maybe that's all that it was. 

While we were alone, she asked me if I'm bi (I am, and I've talked about both women and men with her before, but I've never 'came out'). She said she's bi, and, ""If you and someone else would- not do anything because I'm in a relationship."". She then tried to pull personal information from me, something I haven't told anyone, so I didn't tell her. As the conversation goes on, she says (and I'm paraphrasing cause I can't remember the actual words), ""What is your weakness"" or like ""What would you succumb to"", like weed, beer, gambling, etc. I said candy and her eyes flashed. Like you know when you see someone have an idea? It was that. 

Friends return, we all leave. She grabs onto my arm again, and bounces around my other friends doing so as well, but spends a lot of time with me. As the night continues and ends, nothing ""directly"" flirty happens, though I do find out that she and boyf had a big fight and that she's threatened to break up with him a few times before, though I don't know the context of those threats, whether or not they are playful or serious, but I believe there was at least 1 that was serious. 

I believe I know her well, and this next part proves it. That night, as I went through and tried to figure out if she was flirting, I predicted that she'd come over during the weekend and bring candy without asking if we wanted candy. She did. She even threw the candy towards me telling me to eat it. She also left a note (it's her handwriting) beside where I was sitting with a lot of (seemingly) random numbers. I picked it up after she (and boyf) left, but I really don't know what to do with it. Not a phone number or anything like that so I'm just confused. I like mysteries/puzzles so I'm tempted to solve it, but I don't want to like dig a hole that I can't climb out of.

MOVING FORWARD:
I do not want to make her cheat. I'm morally against cheating, and do not want to have any active role in her breaking up with her boyfriend. I have never, and will never, make a move so long as they are dating.

I know this isn't a lot of information to go on, but any wisdom helps. This isn't a post asking if I have a chance with her, just if she's been flirting with me. 

TLDR: friends gf (who is also a friend) has been rubbing up on me and saying suggestive things. she's almost always facing me and feet pointed at me, she may not be in the best spot relationship-wise with boyf, and boyf and i share many personal and social characteristics. is she flirting?",16Oct2018,1
60,"I'm 20 years old and I still live with my parents. I want to move out at some point next year(hopefully by August/September). I'm currently in college, but absolutely hate it. I'm about a month and a half in, haven't made any friends, and I hate the coursework. I'm a computer science student, I'm not enjoying it but it's the only program my school offers that I'm somewhat interested in. I want to drop out, but I feel trapped. 

I have nothing to do if I dropped out. I feel like if I dropped out I'd live the rest of my life alone because I probably wouldn't be able to make friends or a girlfriend outside of a college environment(not that I have anyway). I feel like if I drop out, I'll have nothing to do for a job. I've been trying to self-learn web development, but I doubt I'd ever be able to do that as a job, especially as there are very few jobs in web development near me.

So, I'd appreciate any suggestions for an ""accidental"" death that would be relatively painless. If the method is calm, i wouldn't mind waiting it out. Ideally, I'd very much like to die the first go around. Being a cripple is not something I'd look forward to. 

I have considered vehicular suicide, but I don't want to resort to that, because it would take my mother's car with me. We're broke, and I don't think having to get a car AND a cremation will go well for her.

I was wondering if you guys think if I should try the truck industry. I was thinking maybe I can take a summer course and maybe work local jobs in every summer until I graduate college. But idk I heard that trucking does not mix with relationships. But I hear some truckers still do have families while they do long distance jobs. Another reason I thought about switching to trucking is the availability of jobs. Film, tv, media jobs are hard to get these days and are only mainly popular in cities, while trucking jobs are all over the place. We honestly want to move in more of a rural area.

Later on he said that it was a movie he wanted to produce with those classmates, never the less he got suspended for it. In 4th  grade. I sat next to him in class, and we had been instructed to go on the computer one day.

68,"Context, I'm a 16 skater from Sacramento and around mid July I broke my tooth trying a trick and busted my chin open and lip as well. Now, I have given reason for my mom to not trust me, meaning I would lie to my mom and got caught smoking weed and lied about that (obviously) which isn't that bad considering the other things kids my age I know are doing. So I i'm not aloud to skate at the skate parks or in the streets because my mom is in fear of me hurting myself again. Which I will say is understandable as she is my mother after all. 
I talked to her about my frustration about not skating, as I plan to be involved in skateboarding through the rest of my life, as in I want to own a skate shop and try to get sponsored. She kept talking about trusting me and lying and the went in about how she doesn't like the 40 year old loser drunks theist haven't grown up. I said, well that's makes sense from an outsider perspective so lets agree to disagree. I go in more about trying to let me skate again, and how I feel she is holding me back. She insist that she is not trying to stifle me, but wants me to ""take a break on it until we learn more about my '""serious injury""'. The problem is, I won't be able to get an implant until i'm 21. That is too late to peruse anything within skating, besides owning a skate shop. She also is scared about the people I would be surrounded by which again is understandable as she is my mom, and lets face it, skating attracts everyone and that means EVERYONE. and the she goes into how I shouldn't dress this way and act respectful, which I defended myself asking when I time I had ever been rude to someone I didn't know and she then retracted that argument but I know she still felt that way. I feel that she is trying to get me to conform to what she wants me to be and I refuse. She just has a hard time understanding things she doesn't agree with. I believe in a lot of transcendentalist view's ever since I was 8.

75,"So I have been at my current place of employment for nearly a year and a half. I work as a server/bus person in diner in a fancy Senior Living community. I love hat I do but as with any restaurant job the hours can be grueling. I went from trying to get any shifts I could to up my meager part time hours to full time because management didn’t think I could handle more hours and they didn’t have any to give me to having 10+ hours of overwrite every week.

They call me in all the time so I am lucky to have a day off. They depend on me more than most people in my department. I come in and do my job as well as several other people’s jobs. I never complain to management about anything and never call out. The very thought of asking for more money scares me but after working here fro so long without any sign of a raise I feel like it is time.

Everyone is always telling how hard of a worker I am and both of the managers tell me how much they appreciate me and that they can count on me for anything. I don’t leave my coworkers drowning. If I see someone struggling I lend them a hand. Constantly. 

I work at a no tipping restaurant and so get paid well over median wage versus the usual $2 a server would typically get. Basically I am just asking for advice on how much I should ask for and how to go about doing it. I am going out of town on the 18th for a week and I’m not sure if I should tell my supervisor tomorrow, first thing or when I get back. I have never asked for a raise before and even typing this all up stresses me out. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this. ",16Oct2018,1

79,"After high school I was briskly shipped away to college. A massive university that was overwhelming when mixed with my laziness and lack of ambition. I could never picture myself falling into a lifelong career or any path that was given to me the first go round. Failed out on my first semester and ended up spending the next ten or eleven years bouncing around in the music/production industry. There’s no benefits. Retirement plan achievable and all in all not an intelligent life decision to carry on this way.  The pay is somewhat very respectable yet, it comes with a slew of issues and problems. 

So now we’re here:

I was in a wreck nearly 3 years ago. Because of this, work has suffered and my thoughts returned to school. I sold the truck and without hesitation got my dream car. It’s just a common old classic from ‘68 but it’s my daily driver. I knew nothing about cars back then, engine components or even spark plugs. Looking back however, I realise the first day that car gave me hell was the first day I knew instantly this was it. Ever since I’ve been thinking about returning to school with the ambition of working somewhere in the automotive industry. I’m most alive being around them or working directly with the vehicle in some way rather than designing parts or pieces.  I’ll prepare for both however. 

Also, I currently live a state away from the area offering the types of career paths and good school options. Struggling on how to locate a home and move while living out of state (I am visiting the area soon) as well as how this is even possible. 

So, what are your stories? Debt? Changes or simply just words you’d like to share?

81,"So I live in a dormitory on a college campus. One of my roommates has a boyfriend who is here constantly. He lives in the next state over from ours so I guess he doesn't want to make the drive to see his girlfriend - I am not sure if he is a student here. He is always in our apartment and he's loud and sometimes brings his friends over when his girlfriend isn't home. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other day I came back to find tape over the tumbler on the door - so that it wouldn't lock when it closed. This is really irritating as the other roommates and I don't like to leave the door unlocked when nobody is home. So I peeled the tape off and posted in the group chat about it. School policy says that guests are limited to x amount of time, so the other roommates and I would be well within our rights to tell her he can't stay here every night of the week.

82,"So recently I've been thinking quitting coffee and just drink water. The reason is the highs and lows, i can feel it and it is emotionally draining. The reason why I started drinkng when i was 22, it was 1 year ago is because at the start of the semester I felt really sad, for weeks I was all over the place, I felt sluggish and anxious so I said f*ck it and chugged down an espresso. I felt the dopamine boost, the energy, focus and I generally felt better. A few months later I started drinking energy drinks as the coffee itself wasn't enough now I feel really foggy without coffee and I cant sit down to study without one. I also noticed that my creativity and witiness isn't the same anymore and I'm really grumpy and less talkative. Idk its weird, at the same time I feel like I need coffee otherwise I will go back to that old state I had and I will fail in life.

87,"Where to even start with this?

&amp;#x200B;

My partner and myself were a long distance relationship. They had told me of the living conditions of his home he shared with his parents and siblings, which was generally filthy. I wanted to wait till he found a place, but my parents didn't approve of the relationship and often threatened to not let me leave, thus leaving the time they could pick me up a very small window. We figured something out eventually where they'd pick me up while they were on vacation.  


Everything was fine when I arrived, the place was tidy to a degree, I said my hellos, and that was that. Now, I'm a very shy person, it takes me a long time to be comfortable with people. The anxiety of moving to a different state didn't exactly help either in my openness. That, combined with the fact that on the computer a bunch like my partner doesn't leave much talking.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward, the place is becoming more and more of a mess. I'm trying my best to keep things clean, since my partner's parents were very nice in letting me stay here, but whenever I'd come back it'd be totally destroyed again.

One day, I just stop and only clean up after my partner and myself. Boy, I have never seen a house get that disgusting before. I think maybe two weeks had gone by before anything was actually cleaned by someone other than myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I had to go back to cleaning after everyone else in order to actually use the appliances in the house.

Today, I had a conversation with my partner's sibling and the state of the house came up. About how their parents and other siblings just say ""leave it for OP to clean up"" and how my the mixer I got as a birthday present was actually so I'd stop using their appliances, so I wouldn't ""break them"". They also told me how when I first came here, how they'd commonly talk of how weird and quiet I was, and how they'd try to get said sibling to agree with them. One random funny thing they told me about, was how when another one of their siblings were staying here, they didn't want me to wear a robe to the shower because there was ""impressionable, young"" boys in the house.  


I get the sibling could be lying, but it's some very strange things to lie about. Either or, I've discussed it with my partner and their response was to not start anything, and be thankful I'm able to stay here. I really don't appreciate being treated this way, and I feel that my partner doesn't really understand given they've been cleaning up after them too his whole life. How should I go about this?

90,"I was talking to a girl whose cleavage was a bit exposed (and I am NOT criticizing her or her right to dress like this) and as we were speaking, my eyes sort of drifted down to the area between her neck and her breasts, for maybe a bit longer then they should have.

As we were taking, she covered her shirt up a little, then my eyes immediately moved back up to her eyes and stayed there. She didn’t explicitly say anything (of course, this could’ve been because it wouldn’t have been worth her trouble), we continued to talk afterwards, and she didn’t appear hostile, but I couldn’t help but feel that I might’ve made her uncomfortable. I genuinely feel terrible and contrite about what I did.

I initially considered what I did to be a disrespectful and embarrassing faux pas, and something from which I should learn to refrain from such behavior in the future. Yet for whatever reason I began to dwell uncontrollably on what I did, and with each instance of contemplation my perception of my action worsened.

I should preface by explaining that in the past I've had tics that compel me to do things I otherwise shouldn't do. One such example consists of looking at my feet a total of four glances while I'm driving, precisely because I know I'm not supposed to. Similarly, when swimming underwater, I feel compelled often to open my mouth and let water in four times, as I know that it would be best not to do so. These tics may seem trivial, but they have been natural for me for a long time.

Such tics have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I say this not to convey that these tics have made my life unbearable—they have not; rather, my purpose is to explain that these tics have become normalized for me. I’ve always suspected there may be an attention deficit component to these tics.

When I was young, I developed a similar tic-like habit whereby I would look at private parts. This eventually developed into something where I knew I wasn’t supposed to do something, but precisely because of this I felt compelled to do it anyway. I don't know why this tic in general developed. Was it due to the frequent thoughts about sex I had when I was 6/7? Was it due to innocuous portrayals of such behavior in movies/TV? I’d feel the need to steal glances at a private area a total of four times, in general. This urge has been there not just with women’s décolletage, but also with mens’ crotches at times, or women’s legs. This is especially true when I’m engaged in conversation with someone. This urge-driven tic wouldn’t necessarily always be there in every single interaction, but through some interactions it would be there.

It’s not that I deliberately try to leer or to make people uncomfortable. I don't openly stare, for instance, at a woman's chest for 10 seconds with wide eyes while drooling. I've never made comments, or touched, or tried to take up someone's personal space. I’m not trying to prey on people, or to try to impose myself on them sexually. For whatever reason, it's like when talking to a woman for extended time, it's hard for me to keep still in general. My eyes wander haphazardly, and combined with this tic, this happens.

And yet my reasons should not matter as much as the effects of what I did to her. She covered her shirt, and odds are good I made her feel uncomfortable. In the moment, I ascribed what happened here to my tic, and judged that I had been rude and disrespectful at worst, and that if I learned from this, I could move on. But over time, my dwelling in this became far worse. She'd continued talking to me during that conversation, and she wasn't hostile, true. But what was she not showing me? How can I be sure exactly how bad I made her feel? Maybe I ruined her day. Maybe I ruined her whole week. Maybe I made her feel less of herself. Maybe I've affected her life immutably. Are these exaggerations? Am I obsessing over this to an unreasonable degree, or are these possible, reasonable ramifications of what I did?

Furthermore, I began to fear that maybe, whilst I'd believed that I was never openly leering/ogling at people, what if I'd been wrong ever since I'd developed this tic? How many countless women could I have potentially made uncomfortable? No one has ever prior indicated that my presence made them uncomfortable. I've never been reported for anything even remotely minor. And yet I feel I can't be sure. I remember now just one other instance, from when I was younger, when a girl at school covered her shirt while I was talking to her. This is the only other time covering shirt had occurred. Was this due to my tic too?

As I read stories of people like Morgan Freeman, Bill O'Rielly and their workplace sexual transgressions, I see small, maybe if only tangential, similarities between what they did and what I did. Men like this have commented in women's figures in the workplace, touched their skirts, asked them how they 'feel about sexual harassment.' These transgressions seem to me patently wrong and inexcusable. And yet another thing they've been accused of is leering women up and down. Coupled with their other systematic patterns of behavior, it seems as though this leering should be construed as further attempts to make women uncomfortable in the workplace. And although I've never been party to these other types of behavior, I can't help but feel peripherally associate with these men.

Ultimately, I cannot ascertain for certain to what extent my actions in this instance stemmed from normalized tics, and to what extent it arose from subconscious irreverence for her person. I have little doubt that what I did stamp largely from a dependence on my normalized tics. Yet if I submitted to this tic, is this not the same as being irreverent to her person? Maybe I am no better than a Morgan Freeman/Bill O'Rielly.

I've been hoping that the fact that she may not have even noticed, or likely forgot about what happened soon thereafter, may mean that I should get to move on if I promise to do better. But why not take this logic to completion? If a man rapes a woman, and she was too drunk or incapacitated to remember it, does this make him any less of a rapist? By the same logic, would her forgetting this make me any less of a harasser? Of a predator? I understand that to conflate rape with looking at cleavage would be disingenuous at best and malicious at worst—that's not my purpose. My purpose is to test this line of logic.

I cannot live with myself thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. This label has been weighing on me for months at this point. I can't eat properly, and can't get assignments done, I'm hardly sleeping. Sound funny, or facetious? I'm being genuine. I am deeply sorry for what I did, and I understand now not only that what I did was wrong, but also why it was wrong. I am cognizant now of how differently women can perceive objectification, and that, even if my tics become difficult to resist, this is no excuse at all for disrespecting someone else's person. But I can't go on thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. I just can't.

There are only two ways in which I could deviate from this course of action, either by rationalizing my actions or by and living with myself that way, or by accepting what I did, which would—even if only slightly peripherally—place me in a category of individuals with whom I am unequivocally unwilling to be associated. To commit to the former path would be to lead my life with unconscionable dishonesty; the latter, to undergo such a radical change in self-perception for which I have not the strength.

There is no impartial mediator to help me guide my thoughts. I had one feminist friend who told me that I'm overreacting. Yet I'm confident that there would be other people who would say I'm not overreacting. But if one person thinks I'm a sexual harasser, there must be legitimacy to that, yes? If I'm even .5% associated with a group of people including Freeman, O'Rielly, Ansari, etc. I can't live right myself.

I have virtually no concern with being potentially reported for sexual harassment. This isn't about that. It's about how I see myself. Judge me as you wish.",16Oct2018,1

Anyways I really want a stand alone device for music while I workout. It’s a benefit not having my phone for a couple hours while I lift in peace. And I don’t want to risk breaking my phone under a dumbbell. Typical workout consists of 3 miles running, powerlifting, jump roping, circuit training, or machines. 

My wishlist:
Sweat proof. I probably sweat more than anyone you know. Like I literally ring my T-shirt out after cardio and have to bring a second shirt for lifting.

Small and portable. I don’t want a big arm band or something that has to live in my pocket while I lift. The clip on the shuffle was perfect. 

Spotify. I much prefer Spotify and actually only maintain iTunes because of that iPod shuffle. So I can go either way but Spotify would be ideal. 

Wireless or wired. I don’t really care I have great wired headphones now but could get a pair of Bluetooth ones if need be. 

Decent battery life. Would like to get 10 hours out of it so I only have to charge it once a week. 


I’ve seen this green little shuffle knock off that uses Spotify. It appears that it could fit the bill. I have no experience with it. Can anyone recommend it or is there a better alternative solution that I should consider? Maybe the Apple Watch with music on it?

103,"Hello,

My mother has been smoking most of her life and in the last few years she was recently diagnosed with COPD. My mother also has Schizophrenia which also lead to her depression she currently has. She also has a million other problems but the main one is the smoking and now with her COPD.

My mother has been sent to the hospital about 3-4 times now in the past year due to her not having enough oxygen during the night. Every time I would come to her house, I would find her breathing heavily and she could barely even talk back to me in a conversation. She also fights me every time that she does not want to go to the hospital because I believe she is scared to find out that she might have cancer or something similar since she continues to smoke. During all these events, she always tells me that she would do her best to stop smoking and then give up during the first few days of her returning home. I try to help, I try to motivate her to stop smoking but, I cannot be there 24/7 to monitor on it. I even bought her a book to stop smoking which she read some of it but continues to smoke.

I honestly don't know what to do. I want to send her away to something similar as a nursing home where they could monitor her for maybe 30 days until she can get rid of the fix she has. I just need to figure out something otherwise I'm afraid she might die. Recently she has told me she is sick and I can tell from her breathing that she doesn't seem to be getting enough oxygen. She tells me she thinks she has the Flu but I know that is a lie or at least I believe it is. My father is taking her to Urgent Care tomorrow in case it might get serious as one of her attacks. I can't take the risk anymore since I don't know if we keep letting this go on she might die like this one day.

Please, if you have experience something similar in your life please share it. Any advice, any wisdom right now would help me out so greatly. I just don't know what to do anymore on this situation.",16Oct2018,1

My mom is not giving me much information on the current situation.


For some back story, 3 years ago my sister went through an episode for the first time which was extremely hard on my family and I. 

When she's manic she's impossible to reason with and is extremely paranoid and delusional (and does not believe she is delusion). 

It took an extremely long time to convince her to go on medication but after the fact she made a very quick recovery and none of the symptoms seems to resurface until now.

I'm in Japan for another 2 weeks. Everyone tells me I can't do anything at the moment and to stay in Japan but it's eating away at me.

I also selfishly am scared that my engagement trip needs to come to an end to fly to SF.

I'm taking it day by day at the moment but I'm not sure what I should be doing.

I was able to get mental health clinics and resources info to give to my mom for now.

116,"I've been generally unhappy for a while now. If you look at my post history, its basically just me anonymously complaining. This post will probably end up reading the same. I have been trying to improve myself and my quality of life lately, but I haven't noticed any improvement. It's kind of discouraging. 

About a month or so ago I hit a low. I felt lonely and was dissatisfied with my performance in college. So, to improve my life, I decided to become more socially active and study more frequently.  Nothing has changed. 

I study much more, but I just dropped an F bomb on a test today. I was really anxious during the exam. My professor drops the lowest exam grade, but I am feeling really worried about my performance in the class. 

I have made friends (I think), but none of them initiate contact with me. I always text them first, and I don't want to seem desperate or clingy. My friends also don't want to hang out outside of an academic setting. I think that my personality might come off as abrasive (loud and annoying). I feel like the way that I interact with people isn't a good representation of who I truly am because I am mildly socially anxious. How can represent who I truly am when I interact with people?

I developed feelings for one of my friends that I know he will NEVER reciprocate. It has been hard to accept because he is so genuinely kind, respectful and intelligent. We also have the same goals and morals and are interested in the same things. The stupid bitch part of my brain decided to boyfriend zone him. 

I have never dated or kissed anyone and guys do not approach me or express interest in me (even my hands are virgin, taunt me). Why have I never been approached? Am I just clueless and bad at reading signals? I don't think that I'm ugly, but my self-confidence is waning. I do look young for my age, which comes with minor annoyances. According to all women, I'm ""so cute"". I just want to be hot for once, damnit! I want a relationship, but I'm not sure if its for the right reasons. I just want to be emotionally intimate with someone who will listen to and fake laugh at my terrible dry jokes. Some part of me also wants the physical intimacy that comes with being in a relationship. However, I come with a cargo ship full of emotional baggage and insecurities that I don't want to burden anyone else with. 

I have a some questions:

What things should I do to improve my grade in class and master the content? 

How can I establish better/closer relationships with friends? 

How do I get over my romantic feelings for my friend?

How can I be more confident in myself and generally improve? 

How do I meet people for romantic relationships? How can I tell if someone is interested in me (romantically)?

My friend/roommate has a girlfriend that everyone in our house hates.  And I mean HATES.  She is incredibly obnoxious and takes (recreational) things without asking.  We make her feel unwelcome in our home because she isn't yet she hangs out at our house or with our other friends when she's with our roommate.

Our roommate is a serial monogamist and almost seems to be in love with this girl (despite being with her for maybe 2 and half weeks??).  This exact same situation happened last year when my roommates were living with him (I was living with other friends at the time).

The girlfriend has gotten me to the point where I hate being in my own house when she's here and it seems no matter what my other roommates and I try there is noway to get her to stay permanently out of our house.

Ideally we would want for our roommate to realize how absolutely toxic this person is and for him to forget about her and let her ruin her life on her own.  We've confronted him and told him how we feel about her yet he either laughs it off or becomes hostile depending on his level of sobriety.  I've told him on several occasions never to bring her to our house but he does it anyway. I let it slip usually because I'm doing coursework or playing 2k.

How do we approach him and get him to understand that she is awful for him (and us) and get him away from her?

136,"So recently a college friend got married. At the wedding there were 3 people I knew. 

One of which was a friend of mines ex from 3 years ago. They dated for a bit but eventually called it off. They're civil. They're in the same town and see each other at the gym. In college I didnt really know her, basically just of her. We didn't even run in the same social circles and never had any 1:1 time. 

This friend I used to call my best friend but 
 hes kind of jerk and an asshole. I used to tolerate it and even vouch for him but now I can only do small doses...He didn't show up for petty reasons. He's also a die hard Trump fan which for me is pretty disgusting.

So from the beginning she and I just kinda hit it off. Laughing and joking the whole time, admittedly we drank a bit too. Even my other friend who was present commented on how well we got along. The cherry on top being someone asking how long we'd been dating. As the night was winding down and most peope left the bar where we had an informal after party. I kinda sorta invited her upstairs. Don't know if it was just the liquor, a few glasses of wine and beer, or the positive vibes. She was down and came up. I wasnt prepared and didnt have condoms so we didn't go all the way just oral and stuff.

However we cuddled and talked for like 3 hours after. That was 3 days ago. Ive tried to put myself in the friend's shoes but we're different guys. He's your type A kinda guy where I'm more lowkey. I would honestly be happy for one of my ex partners .I dont know if he would be more bothered that I didnt ask or that I made a move in general. He's also the type who prides in dating multiple people.

137,"Trying to remain anon here, throw away acct obv. 

Basically I feel like I’m constantly having an identity crisis. There’s the person that I want to be now...the person that I want to be when I settle down...and then there’s the other people everyone else thinks I am. 

A lot of people in my life tell me that I’m a good person. Usually these are people who I work with or people that I know in passing. It seems like often when people first get to know me they put me on a pedestal and identify me as this artistic, kind and loving creative person. Part of me believes that this is the core of who I am, but then part of me doesn’t.

What I do for a living is completely centered around helping other people. It brings me joy and it does help people. Sometimes I feel like I’m truly being selfless, but other times I feel like Im probably doing it so people continue to think I’m a good person. 

In every seriously deep relationship that I’ve had, people have put me on a pedestal only to later decide that I’m not who they thought I was or that I’m selfish, thoughtless and careless. 

Nothing upsets me more than when I disappoint people in these more intimate relationships. When I feel devalued, it honestly gives me the worst thoughts ever. I get confused, I feel like I’m being gaslighted or like I’m crazy, and more often than not I feel like I’m worthless. 

I have selfish thoughts a lot. I want to save face constantly and appear like I have everything all together because when people around me like and appreciate me, it’s the only time I feel like I can breathe. Whenever I feel like people’s perceptions of me are shifting, I feel overwhelming anxiety and anger at myself. I’ve tried so hard over the past few years to work on my own behaviors that warrant people devaluing me, but the worst behaviors always resurface without me thinking. 

I think im a good friend. I think im a good partner. I think im a good daughter. But then other times I dont even know if I care about anyone or anything. It’s exhausting. 

The kicker is that now my life looks really good. I have a stable job and I’m settling down with an amazing person. 

Lately that person is constantly picking apart my behaviors, reactions and my decisions. Every time they do it, it makes me internally implode. 

When I think of the person I want to be when I settle down, my current partner has a lot to do with that identity. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells but I DONT KNOW WHO I AM. I JUST KNOW WHO I WANT TO BE AND WHO EVERYONE ELSE THINKS I AM. 

I dont think I’m ever going to be good enough. 

I dont know if any of this makes sense but I just have to get this off my chest because I constantly feel like I’m living a waking life split between reality and falsehood. I just want to wake up and have things work out. I want to know who I am and be okay with who I am.

So I'm in eleventh grade, I'm sixteen, and my parents are super homophobic. All of my friends are girls and that hella bothers them because they say I need ""Godly male friends"" in my life which is just ehhhh.

But anyways I have this one friend named Nikki. I've been friends with her since like May 2017 and we've just grown closer since then. She's from India and then she lived in Germany, but now she lives here in the USA.

Basically when she got adopted to Germany, she had to learn German after speaking Hindi for the first years of her life. And then when she moved to USA she had to learn English and so for each new language she had to learn she got held back a year in school.

So she's (almost) nineteen while still being in my grade, while I'm turning seventeen next March.

So two years (and a half) apart, but still in the same grade.

So my parents didn't like her off the bat because

1. She's a girl and
2. They're always like ""wtf she's two years older than you, what do you have in common?""

But since she's in my grade and she could easily pass the same age as me, were good friends and most people don't bat an eye. And also my dad's best friend is like four years younger than him so...?

Anyways my parents let me hang out with her because even though she's a girl and whatnot they want me to be social or whatever.

But last March things went bad. Basically on a Friday after school she came to my house with just her and I, I had my parents permission and everything would have gone fine but...

When we got to my house she started smoking weed in my room and I was like ""wtf you can't do that here or else my parents will notice the smell!"" but she offered me some and we both got high. While we were cooling off, we decided to take a video of us... being high? I really don't know why we took it. After we were cooled off, we got the smell out of my room and ate some ramen in my living room. Then we went to church, it's like a youth group thing and when we finished we went to this local restaurant. While we were eating I thought of the video we took earlier, and I asked to see it.

It was really cringy, it was just us slurring our words and laughing at nothing, so I asked her to send it to me and she accidentally sent it to my mom because she has her as a contact for some reason I can't honestly remember 😬😬😬

We started panicking and freaking out but decided to play it off cooly.

Anyways she went home after that and so did I, and when I got home, my parents watched the video.

They asked why we were so grungy and drowsy and I simply told them we ate a lot of sugar which they actually bought. But my parents were still annoyed because they hate when I act ""weird and immature like that"" and so now they officially had a reason to dislike her, which she was oblivious to because she actually didn't ask about how they reacted to the video, maybe she forgot? But whatever, they now branded her as a bad influence. And also my dad said that video made me look like one of her ""cheap bitches"" and so he told me he didn't like that either.

And I knew that smoking weed is bad even when I was doing it, but to be fair neither of us have done it since that one video, it was a one time thing. So after that day I just wanted to move on because we were both in the wrong but aye we didn't get caught, maybe that was my birthday present from karma because that all happened on my birthday lol.

Anyways, in May of this year I made a really stupid decision involving Nikki.

Basically my parents were attacking my sexuality for no reason because I am gay, and they were telling me how I'd just be a sugar baby for the rest of my life because that's all I'm worth to any man. For context my parents found out I was gay Thanksgiving 2017, but they didn't start attacking me over it until February 2018 hence the ""cheap bitches"" comment I mentioned earlier.

But anyways, I was SO angry in that moment, I had never been so angry, and so I made a spur of the moment decision.

I told my parents that I'm actually bi and how I have a romantic connection to a girl.

They asked who, and with no thought process behind it I told them it was Nikki.

That immediately backfired because

1. They already didn't like her, they thought she was weird and unappealing
2. They know she's 18 while I'm sixteen, so they think that's weird too
3. My parents claim to not be racist but me and all my siblings know they would never approve of a dark skinned partner with any of their children and Nikki being Indian is, ya know dark skinned.

I know, I should have gotten her consent to say that I liked her, and I should have thought this out better. But when your parents are yelling at you day in day out for something you can't control, I think you'd go a little loony too.

My parents became a lot nicer about the whole gay thing after that, they said they were ""disappointed"" by my liking but that at least there was ""some hope.""

Anyways, in June things got even worse!  
Basically me and Nikki were hanging out one day in June, and I got these really nice new shoes. I accidentally got dirt on them later in the day, and I started laughingly crying while frantically trying to get the dirt off.

Eventually I did, but when I got home that night Nikki had left a voicemail on my phone, basically mocking my crying as a joke saying ""Oh I'm Joey boo hoo, Oh I'm Joey boo hoo"" and while that may seem a bit much to some of you, it's kinda just her sense of humor. I still don't know how she had the home phone but oh well.

But my mom heard her message and recognized her voice, and so she told my dad.

My parents were yelling at me, again, saying ""HOW DARE SHE CALL OUR PHONE AND RIDICULE OUR SON.""

I honestly just laughed at this because this is coming from the same people who say shit like this:

""Oh Joey, you don't know what being gay is, you'll never have a good love life because all you can get is a sugar daddy.""

Anyways me and Nikki are still friends, but my parents don't know so whenever we hang out it's very secretive and planned out.

One day she asked why it's all so secretive because she was starting to catch on, and I was going to tell her the honest truth. I told her that my parents didn't like her but that I like her and I wanted her to maybe talk to them.

And I quote, this was her response

""Wow, your parents can suck my dick if they have a problem.""

After getting that message, I just shut it all down and pushed it underneath the rug.

But anyways, Nikki's nineteenth birthday celebration is this Saturday. Secretly being with her is no issue, but I can't keep lying about all this. It's stressing me tf out, and I'm lying to Nikki AND my parents. But I'll think she cut me off if she finds out I pretended to love her, and I can't deal with that right now because I legit care about her and I'm afraid she'll feel uncomfortable around me after that.

Her parents and her sister who I haven't really mentioned really like me too, they say I'm a good friend to her and this is all stressing me tf out and I can't do it anymore. I'm lying to ALL OF THEM.

142,"Hi. I'm writing this quick so the title may not have put that much thought into it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So uhm, I actually don't know what I should do with this situation I'm in right now. I'm currently pondering on whether or not I should go to this (college) class. I've been absent in this Tuesday class since 2 weeks ago (actually the first one was understandable because the schedule was changed so none of my groupmates went).

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for my deliberate absences is that we have a group work that I promised the active groupmate to help him with concepts on a poster and I failed to deliver on last last Sunday (where a draft is due) so the concept he sent to the class facebook group chat was evidently poor made and we (at least the two of us) obviously know why. 

&amp;#x200B;

And because of this, I've deliberately avoided opening my fb in fears of many things like they might be angry/disappointed at me (specifically him since he's in my friend group). I know my brain is tricking me here because he's ditched a subject before so other part of me knows he'll probably be the likely one to understand my shakiness.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where I'm going with this but I'd like to get an outside opinion on what to do or how to get myself out of my own shit since I haven't voiced it out on anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, my class starts at 2pm (currently 1:15 here) so maybe I'll read this after (as I'm planning on ditching this class for today to go to the like student welfare to try to talk to somebody there and suggest help from them at least about the class itself since I'm afraid I might fail this one again) as some sort of future advice reading list.

152,"There's this girl in one of my classes. I never thought anything of her during the two months of class together. Not until today...

I just usually sit down and converse with some friends before the teacher would arrive. And I'm over here chatting with people when I look at this girl. I see her every week, but for some reason, it felt different. I don't know what it was, but she radiated for some reason.

And if we're going to be superficial about it, I thought she looked really nice. She had on this pelted skirt, flip-flops, and an orange shirt, and her hair was tied back into a ponytail. It doesn't sound like anything wild, but I thought she looked beautiful. And something funny to add on that, she was wearing a bracelet with an olive branch on it. I immediately knew what it was, because it's from the Paloma Picasso collection sold over at Tiffany's. I bought my mother the same exact olive branch for her birthday earlier this year, except it was necklace. 

I don't know... I just found her attractive for some reason. Hell, I usually don't do this, but I started eyeing her during class. And I really don't do that. I get really anxious sometimes and I usually avoid looking at people. I tried not to make it obvious, but I'm pretty bad at hiding my emotions. She must've noticed, because I made eye contact with her a couple of times and she glanced at me a couple of times. That's probably a bad thing.

And there was something about her that I found lovely. She seems smart, and I like the way she laughs. We're a pretty vocal class, and everybody (well, most of us) contributes to the discussion. Class never gets boring and we always joke around. It's great. I slide a couple of dumb jokes in there every now and then and she would always laugh at them. And hearing her laugh was nice. Hell, she could've been laughing at me for all I knew. My teacher and I have a lot in common when it comes to music. After class, I went up to my teacher and I bring up this musician named Stephanie Mills. My teacher was surprised that I knew who she was and I jokingly sang one of her songs. The girl I was talking about was walking past us as this happened and she laughed. I don't know, man... I just like seeing her smile.

She's cute as hell. I don't usually go around thinking about people this way, but damn... I have this idea where I go up to her next class and tell her that I think she's lovely and then I'll walk away and never talk to her again. At least I'll get it off my chest. Maybe she has a boyfriend... I don't know. ",16Oct2018,1

154,"So, I’m only 15m. I really need help.

For as long as I can remember, I was never really happy. It’s always been very easy to distract myself from that feeling, but almost daily, usually if I was alone although often times with people too, I’d feel either really down and my head will get clouded with negative thoughts to the point where I can’t think clearly and I’ll have to go home, or I’ll just feel like every emotion I have is very “watered down.”

For example, amazing things will happen to me and I’ll appreciate it a lot but my reaction (to me anyways) always seems like it isn’t as emotional as it should be. Same thing when bad things happen, just not really phased by it. 

I also have a bad sleeping problem I got from my Dad. I could be really tired, on melatonin with the lights off and still won’t be able to sleep. No matter what I do I’m never able to sleep. When I do manage to sleep it’s a very light, inconsistent sleep and I usually only rest for a few hours a night (4-5 at most). I’ve never taken any prescription medications but I’ve tried multiple dosages of melatonin and benadryl with only light effects, sometimes even in combo with each other 

I magically got better over the months. My relationships improved and grades improved, but that feeling was still in my head that nothing really mattered, except it didn’t manifest as much. Everything was actually going well, until February of this year.

I moved from Portland, OR to a small farming town of not even 4000 people. I’m still living here. In that time span, I’ve:

Taken online school until Summer.

Have felt mildly dissociated from reality a few times and it scared the fuck out of me

Have started having unpredicted anxiety attacks (shaky, thought loops, racing heart, sweating and just a really dysphoric feeling) and it’d usually last ~5 minutes but with lingering anxiety for the next couple hours

My friends text me every day and I still get to visit them on occasion, and I thought that’d be enough but I guess it isn’t.

I am now going to public school. Remember my sleeping problem? It plays a pretty big part in this. I have to wake up at 5 AM every day to get ready, catch my bus at 6:40, start school at 7:20 and I don’t get home until 3. Luckily I don’t have school on Mondays but I’d rather have 5 day weeks honestly.

(if you decided to scroll through like the title said, here’s where to stop)

So here’s my current situation. I’ve been at school for 7 weeks now, but I’ve missed so much school that I’m failing almost all my classes. I still don’t have any friends at my new school. I feel so isolated that the sad feeling I talk about rebounded ten fold and I’m so inhibited that I can’t even get out of bed to eat or shower or talk to my parents. I’m having constant negative thoughts and I’m just always really sad for no reason? I try to make myself happy so much. I try to distract myself with guitar, texting my friends or something but I can’t do anything other than that. My day to day life lately has been go to school, come home and try and sleep because there’s nothing for me in this little town to even do. I want to tell my Mom because it’s reached a point where I know this is going to affect my future because of my grades. But I’m scared to. I don’t want to stress her or my Dad out because I’ve already proven to be a major inconvenience to them by missing so much school, but I just can’t motivate myself to go anymore. I’m gonna have a breakdown if I go one more week. I’m weak and I know that but it’s gotten to a point where I really just can’t anymore. But like I said I’m terrified of telling my Mom.

But it wasn’t something he genuinely asked—it was in the midst of something else related that we were discussing so he didn’t mean it in ‘I’m-done, get-out.’ I told him I wouldn’t do it again.

I keep thinking about everything he’s done hurting me and it breaks my heart, I end up feeling angry, want nothing to do with him and fantasize about being happy with someone else because I assume there is someone out there way better for me. It’s freaking hard to walk away. I don’t know what to do and it’s giving me so much anxiety. I’m losing sleep over this. ",16Oct2018,1

I tolerated being repulsive to guys all throughout middle school and high school, but now that I've started college and all of my much more attractive friends have experience dating and having sex and relationships, I feel like I'm missing out on a major part of life. I have put myself out there many times. I've asked guys out (rejected),  I've tried dating apps (no matches), I've accepted date invitations (stood up).

159,"Lately, I've been having a really hard time figuring out what to do about this. I'll try to give the best amount of detail I can without dragging it out, and I've also changed the names of everyone involved.

Backstory:
My friend, Ryan, and I have known each other for over 10 years now. We always hung out together, and in a way, we are inseparable. After a break from each other for about 3 years, I started hanging out with him again, now along with another girl, Erin. They weren't together as a couple, but only as good friends. A few months later, Ryan told me that he was dating Erin, which totally blew my mind for some reason. I had always liked Erin, but I was too nervous to make a move. 

Recently:
Ryan and Erin announced that they are engaged a couple months ago. I hang out with Ryan and Erin at Erin's house just about every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and we also go to many other events and things together. Lately, I've been noticing that Erin has been flirting with me (ie. teasing, sending light-hearted private texts and funny pictures, and also went from us three driving separately to meet, to me meeting Erin at her house to drive together to meet Ryan). I also notice her staring at me when we're watching a movie or something in her room. I think she started to be attracted to me more than before because I've been losing weight, and becoming more outgoing and energetic as a result. I can't explain it fully, but it seems like she's into me.

Why I'm Hesitant:
She usually doesn't touch me ever, unless she's imitating Ryan's touchy personality. Also, she'll lay her legs across Ryan's lap if they're sitting down together, and they hold hands when we aren't in a super public setting. It can be hard to tell if someone is seriously flirting with you sometimes, because everyone is different, and she could just be messing around with nothing in mind. The biggest reason why I haven't brought it up to her, though, is obviously because I wouldn't want to jeopardize my longtime friendship with Ryan and Erin because I just asked someone who is about to get married if they are attracted to me. Even if she said yes, we all know she's in too deep to break it off now for me.

TL;DR Question:
Should I ask Erin if she likes me, or just drop it? My flaw is that I overthink WAY too much, so it's not like I can just forget about this whole situation and move on. Would just asking her be going too far?

I can save 10k by the end of the year and get A 2010-2012 Acura TL = 100k miles or so. this will come with expenses such as registration, gas, insurance, maintenance, tires etc. I don't plan on needing a car to commute to work as I currently do that from home. I do have a bike that I can ride if need be to the gym etc.

So I'm a freshman in college and I like this guy that lives in my hall. Let's call him D. D is literally like the dream guy for a lot of girls, or at least that's how it seems. He literally gets asked out on a weekly basis, but hasn't dated anyone yet.

That's because he has liked this girl for two years. Let's call her H. He says he's too busy to ask her out, but he admitted that it was basically because he doesn't have the courage to ask her out. I don't know much about H, but she looks very similar to me.

One night, the same night he told us about H, him and a group of mutual friends were going through our top 3 attractive people in the hall, and he picked me as #1 and these other two girls. I then replied that he was my #1 and then I picked two other guys.

Also that same night, I told him that I liked a person in our hall, but didn't say the name.

He's as dense as a brick, so he didn't get the hint. 

Now he told a mutual friend that he still likes H, but he also likes another girl, R. I pretty much think that means he doesn't like me, but I'm still infatuated with him.

My friends are advising me to ask him out, or at least tell him I like him, so I can once and for all get over him if/when he rejects me. But, we have to take a class together next semester, and I think it would be awkward.

I don't know if I should follow their advice or not, so I wanted to get an outsider's advice.

By a handful I mean less than 10 and we get some pretty cold days where I live and he’s there bundled up and walking.  

He’s still pretty big but he’s lost weight for sure and his pace is getting noticeably quicker honestly it’s pretty inspiring.  I thought the other day that I would pull over and give him a quick atta-boy, keep up the good work but I thought it would look creepy some random dude watching him for over a year.  

What should I do reddit?  Pull over and give some encouragement or just leave him alone?",16Oct2018,1
170,"Sorry for the long post but here I go

I am in my fourth year of my Economics and Finance degree which i had to extend after failing  a couple of modules in my third year which was supposed to be my final year. I have no interest in what i am studying and do not see a future for myself in the careers related to the degree. So why am i doing it?

Some background:

I have always considered myself as very creative something that many people who know me would agree on. So in high school I really took an interest in music and would dabble with instruments and music production software here and there but i knew my father would here nothing of me wanting to go into music so a career choice that i felt would let me harness this creativity was architecture which was what i left high school believing i would do. I got into A levels and did really well. So i applied for architecture at different universities and put Economics and Finance as my second choice on those applications but i was 100% sure at the time that i would be accepted into architecture because my grades were good however my drawing portfolio wasn't as impressive. I got accepted into Economics and Finance in all the Universities i applied to but there is one that didn't accept me for architecture and that was the one my parents wanted me to go. My father is a big economist so he made me do economics which made sense as i knew i could easily get a job int the field but it was not something i wanted to do or had any interest in. I never argued with him or voiced my opinion because that is how i was raised through fear and in a dictatorship where my parents made all the decisions and i had to follow regardless, so i was scared of letting my parents know how i really felt. By the end of the first semester in first year i had failed 2 of my 4 module and was certain this was not what i wanted to do. I met a friend who saw my creative side and encouraged me to go into music production as he was also going into it himself. So i started it and i found i really enjoyed it and by the end of my first year was sure that it was what i wanted to go into as a career. I told my mother who is much more understanding than my father but she also knew my father would not hear of it so she encouraged me to just go on with the degree. So for the past three years i have just been getting by in the degree while focusing most of my time on music. I have failed and redone some modules here and there which really upset my parents but as time moved on it became harder for me to tell my parents how i felt as i was in too deep in the degree.  But now i am coming to the last stages of my degree and i am still failing in some modules. My parents believe that this is the final year for me but they don't know that i will have to extend the degree (I don't  even know if that will be possible) plus I was clearly told that if i fail another module i wont be able to continue as my parents wont pay for my education. This whole situation has made me very depressed and i can feel my mental health is really suffering. I am a shade of the happy person i once was in high school and A levels. I constantly have thoughts of suicide as i cannot bear the consequences of this past 4 years. My only hope is my music which i have cultivated over the past 3 years but even that is looking dim as i cant see know how ill make it without support from my parents which i am sure they wont give me. I have not been able to speak to a counselor about my situation as it tears me down having to explain my whole situation as it is filled with regret plus i don't really think they will fully understand what i am going through. The degree i am studying has brought me nothing but stress, anger and anxiety which has all culminated into depression. Dropping out seems like the only option for me right now but I fear that more than I fear death as i will have no one if i do that as my parents will abandon me and i do not want to be a burden to my friends or other family members. I know I am not the first to go through something like this but i just want to get some advice or some thoughts that would give me hope or a different look on this.

Any advice will be highly appreciated.",16Oct2018,1

Should I take incremental steps to asking him out? Like talking more then asking for his Snapchat, then asking him out?

176,"I'm a 21 year old female, 5'6"" and roughly 160lbs.

This past Wednesday \[oct. 10th\] I received my flu shot in my left arm. I'm in nursing school and also work in a hospital so I'm required to get them yearly. I had the typical soreness for a few days, nothing major.

Sunday evening BOTH of my elbows started to hurt ridiculously bad to the point that I was in TEARS. Mind you I can tolerate pain pretty well as I played volleyball on a torn up knee for 6 months before having surgery. It's now 3:30AM on tuesday morning \[oct. 16th\] and i once again am in tears from my elbows.

I was wondering if this severe joint pain could be a side effect from the flu shot.

Does anyone else know what could be possibly causing this? I did not work this weekend or do any kind of strenuous activity as i pretty much laid around and relaxed all weekend. I'm also confused as to why it's both elbows.

It's like a very annoying and STRONG ache and is there constantly. If i take tylenol and use a heating pad on them the pain does seem to subside, but as soon as the medicine starts to wear off it's back in full force.

I guess i'm just looking for someone else's thoughts on what this could possibly be or any advice anyone has",16Oct2018,1
177,"I dealt with this situation this passed weekend, and I find myself thinking on how inherently incapable I really am. Basically, on a drunken Saturday night, my girlfriend and I were walking back to our hotel upon which 3 men (definitely not sober but still coherent) took notice of my girlfriend and immediately started harassing her (I was right there with her). They didn't get physical but were absolutely verbal (""DAMNN, HOPE YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF THAT, DAMNNN""). Basically the sort of scummy, bottom-feeder, deplorable type of people that one can imagine.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, it was outright disrespectful to not only me, but more importantly her. And as her boyfriend it is a truly dejecting feeling to feel intimidated and want to keep walking instead of turning and engaging. But that is what I did. My instinct during these situations is always to de-escalate as much as possible. In this scenario, there were 3 of them and only me (and my very drunk girlfriend). I chose to ignore and keep walking to our hotel, and that was (fortunately) the end of it.

&amp;#x200B;

However I don't foresee this being the last time I deal with this, and I'm trying to understand if there is a proper approach to these tense confrontations. Curiously, I find myself wondering, as I'm writing this, if I really am simply looking for validity of my own masculinity. I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My girlfriend and I were harassed by 3 drunk men and I felt incapable of protecting either of us, instead choosing to ignore and keep walking. While this may have been the right approach, I'd like to learn about different methods of de-escalation and defense.",16Oct2018,1
179,"I’m super torn... I moved away from my home town 3 years ago after living there for 27 years. In the time I have been gone my social life has been kind of lame because it’s hard to make friends when you are new somewhere and also married. I met my husband after I moved and we started our own company. Our business has a big opportunity to grow close to my hometown but it’s also a gamble we will either have huge growth or a huge flop. High risk high reward. We have other opportunities in states closer to us now that will also be great but very competitive in a market that is more familiar with our product and generally low risk moderate reward. 

This is also huge cross country move to go back to my home town.  I’m fearful for my husband as he has never lived outside of his home state. Although he literally has no friends here. We visited my hometown this past summer and he liked my friends. One of the shittiest things about me living so far right now is I miss my family and friends. 

The pros and cons seem to be even in all scenarios. The thing is I just don’t really want to live there again. Its cold half the year and a little rural. It’s like been there done that. Although if we can work out the business there we will have tremendous growth and corner the market.

180,"I've always been insecure. I've come to terms with my unhappiness a long while ago, I realize logically that I will realistically never look in the mirror and be sastified. I know that is a shock especially in the modern day of body positivity but it is true. I see women bigger than I and can appreciate their beauty, I can look at women smaller than me and do the same, but I can not honestly look at myself and say I am beautiful. I have realized that and made peace with it. I instead put all of my effort into being a good person. I love my personality, and find no greater joy than pleasing others.  The issue I am facing is because I put no effort into my appearance. Yes I shower, wear clean clothes and keep up with general hygiene, but beyond that I don't put in any effort. I rarely dress up, and the amount of times I put on makeup or get my eyebrows shaped can be counted on one hand...for the entire year. I let this be known up front and people always reassure me with, ""You are pretty!""or ""Isn't it what I think that counts? I think your beautiful"". All pretty words but then as time goes on they change into ""You never dress up for me"" and, ""you would look so pretty with..."". They aren't wrong. I don't dress up and even I can understand some make-up would go a long way to making me look presentable, but is it wrong to not want it? Is it not enough to be a good person do I have to go out of my way to look attractive as well? I am not much of a looker and I say that with all honesty. Is it wrong to long for a person who's attracted to my person. A person willing to look beyond my appearance instead of trying to change it? I understand that in a relationship chemestry is needed, along with a base level of attraction, what I'm not understanding is why it seems as time goes on the standards rise. Why do I have to dress up now when it's not something I've ever done before? Why when this was made apparently clear is it now a source of disappointment that I am completely clueless either makeup? If I'm beautiful to you, or was, how has time impacted that?  I love myself whole heartedly and I think that means accepting your flaws. Is it wrong of me not want to change them?",16Oct2018,1
181,"* I know this is a super long post, but I’m feeling really unsettled and tried to include as much detail as possible.

I need help figuring out if my friend has a particular mental health issue. Here are the things I have noticed in her behavior over the last few months:

• She does not have any opinions about anything and always responds “I don’t know” or “Nothing” to EVERY question I ask
• She is always the one who initiates catch ups and has nothing to talk about when we do!!
• Her lack of details seem to cover-up a lot and I feel she is lying most of the time about her life. Just last month, she told me she moved out of home (even sent me pictures of furniture she set up at her new apartment!) only to move back home within a week!! When I asked what happened, she just said, “I couldn’t do it.” I naturally asked her about the lease contract etc. but she gave me no solid answers, just “I just couldn’t do it” and changed the topic - I wonder she even moved in the first place?!?!!
• Sometimes she gets really offended over the most simple things and overjustifies her thoughts, eg. Today I asked her about her favorite meal and she refused to answer the question saying “I don’t like that question, I eat all food to nourish me. I just don’t think about things like that.” She also told me she stopped ‘eating out’ so when I asked her what she eats at home, she said her mother cooks for her. When I asked what she cooks she said, “Middle Eastern food,” and I followed up with, “does she have a specialty dish?” to which she replied, “I don’t know, just Middle Eastern.” - She couldn’t name one type of food and refused to share any details about the cuisine when I showed genuine curiosity.
• The above point could be related to her insecurities (she struggles with her weight), yet SHE is the one who often brings up the topic of food whenever we catch up! ie. food or restaurants she likes or has eaten at.
• She hides behind humor A LOT and brings up silly things that only she finds funny, at very random times (often in the middle of serious discussion, that might not even be related to her personally). I find this very rude when I’m opening up about my life and am trying to create meaningful conversation.
• She makes fun of me with little remarks and assumptions about who I am and what I think. We recently re-connected after 5 years of not being in touch but she rejects any idea that I’ve grown up and says things like, “That’s not like you, you don’t say that kind of stuff. That’s not the person I know.” - and this was after I merely showed interest in going to a talk on feminism that was advertised on a poster we walked past! I didn’t even delve into my opinion on the topic, I just mentioned it could be interesting.
• To add to the above, she changes the subject or has NO thoughts on anything I bring up in the general news. In my effort to steer clear of bringing up personal topics that might offend her, I mention trending topics or news stories which SHE DOES NOT CARE to engage in - no matter what it is!! The only time I’ve noticed her engaged in our chats is when she brings up childish things like the time she ran into an elderly woman and nearly knocked her over. And she loves talking about the past, the fun times we had being stupid, going to work hungover etc.
• Her brain seems so scattered and unsettled, this is just one example of consecutive texts that she has sent me recently:

    - How are you? Catch up next week? City? Xx
    - Okay maybe the week after. Let’s keep in touch because I can’t do the city. Xx

I honestly don’t get it!!

Please know that I always do my best to understand and empathize with people, especially in an age where depression and mental health are on the rise. I am just struggling in this case with my friend because I don’t know the truth of what she is going through. I have assured her I am here for her whenever she needs but she avoids opening up.

Perhaps she only wants connection, yet I find it hard to continue to provide that when she negatively impacts me. I make time and effort to see her yet her erratic behavior is hard to keep up with and she leaves me feeling depleted of energy each time we catch up. I don’t feel good around her but maybe does with me, which is why I continue to be a friend.

I want to better understand where she is mentally and emotionally based on the above, can anybody enlighten me on what the problem could be and how I can better manage it?",16Oct2018,1
182,"TLDR: My dad and I have never been close and over the years there has been a lot of issues with him, my mum, and stepmother. I would describe my childhood as 'traumatic'. He is now at the end stage of renal cancer and I would like to make peace before he dies. For context, I am now 24 y/o.

Unfortunately, my dad and I do not have a simple relationship. I have given details below that may help with advice but I will try sum it up as briefly as I can. 

5 y/o - Parents divorced. Very nasty/bitter. I grew up living with mum, but visited dad every second weekend and half the school holidays.

6 y/o - Stepmum moves in with dad. She and I have had a VERY rocky relationship. She always made us kids feel unwelcome in their home and was very nasty to us growing up. My dad never did anything about this and would sometimes join in.

16 y/o - Told dad I didn't want to go to his house anymore and we didn't really communicate for about a year after that. 

17 y/o - Mum kicked me out (We don't speak for about 3 years, but that's another story, haha). Moved in with dad and stepmum for about a year while I finished high school. WORST year of my life. Treated poorly by stepmum. Began self harm/diagnosed with depression/anxiety.

18 y/o - I move out and do my own thing from then on. 

19 y/o - My younger sister and dad/ stepmum have a massive fallout. I am the only one who stands up for my sister. In reponse, dad and stepmum send me an email telling me I am a liar, and that they no longer want to communicate with me. We don't for about a two years.

21 y/o - Dad gets diagosed with stage 4 renal cancer and contacts me. We never speak about anything that has happened between us, and have a very superficial relationship. I have tried to talk about my upbringing, but am dismissed immediately and told none of the stuff I remember ever actually happened. I go over to see my dad for christmas every year and my stepmum hugs me but it is very false and awkward. 

24 y/o, present day - The medication dad has been taking has stopped working and the metastases are growing. I am not sure whether he will be around for another year. He doesn't talk about it much (understandably) so it's hard to know exactly. I am going to visit (I live in another city) over christmas for a month. My dad is being unusually friendly toward me and telling me he loves me which is not the usual for our relationship. I feel as though he does not have a lot longer to go. I don't want to regret my actions or wish I had done something differently. I saw a therapist for 3 years and am accepting of my childhood. I do not harbour anger towards my father. I want to make peace with him before it is too late.

So, what do you think I should I do? I would really appreciate advice from anyone. If someone has been in a similar situation, I would love to hear from you. Is there anything you regret not doing/saying?

189,"Going to try to make this short. 

Two weeks ago, I started a temp job in another city. The co-worker, I'm speaking about, let's call her M. She started a day before I did. M was pretty friendly when I met. She's a very opened book and seemed like she loves to talk. I felt like I already knew her whole life story after 2 days of meeting her. She talked about so many topics that weren't work-related or professional. From her personal sex life, to dealing drugs, fighting and watching her family shoot guns at people. I'm 24, and she's 25. We came from the same city but we both lived two completely lives. I always felt like she was trouble to be associated with. Just because she was laughing as she told me about, and her exact words were, ""watching my brothers shoot out these Spanish people, haha."" We're both Asians. Our trainer told me there's a possibility of hiring for perm because their department have been under staffed for months. This is something I really wanted so our trainer have warned me a couple of times to be careful talking to M because the things she speaks of isn't going to impress the company.. 

Today, she found out I knew one of her ex. I met him 5 years ago. And it was a one night stand kind of thing. I'm not proud of it. I felt pretty ashamed and disgusted right after and I actually cried in front of the guy. I wasn't sober when it happened. So, once I realized it happened, I started crying really bad and the guy ended up comforting me. I don't speak of that night since it's pretty embarrassing. Also extremely ashamed about it. She asked me and I quote, ""did anything happened?"" I said ""no"" because admitting my past has nothing to do with her and the present. No matter what kind of history she had with the guy, my mistake is not something I was going to admit to someone I barely even know or even proud of. After I said no, she just went back to talking about her boyfriend and their current argument. And that was it. 

Tonight, before bed. She found out about the truth that I slept with her ex. She was pretty angry that I lied to her face when she asked if I fucked him. She had my phone going off for a whole hour.. She kept asking me to meet her up, because she wanted to fight me. She said she wanted ""to clear things up."" She kept mentioning ""shooting my ones."" I had to Google what that meant.. I basically apologized for not admitting my truths to her and that I don't want to fight. But she kept going, saying to stop playing the victim and how I'm such a closet hoe. I said my sorrys again but I'm not going to fight her. I'm home relaxing with my boyfriend and 10 month old. 

I don't want to fight someone over a little lie. Especially a mistake that happened happened years ago. I started to ignored her messages right after she didn't accept my third apologies. She got me stressed so I actually started crying. I ain't ever been in a fight before. I have always kept to myself. My boyfriend knows everything about my past so he was super angry that she was attacking me and wanting to beat me up over something pity. So they went at back and forth for a bit until my boyfriend ignored. I blocked her right after that. 

I don't know what to do about work tomorrow.. Should I show up to work? Should I mention it to the job agency? Or call the supervisor? I'm scared for her to lose her job, because I feel like things will escalate.. But I fear for my own safety if I show up to work tomorrow.

She frequently tries to put Christianity into our lives which I’m not completely opposed to, but she wants to build our entire relationship around it. Her whole ideal future family goes to church every Sunday and makes God a priority in every single situation.

I am very afraid to talk to her about this because I feel as if it might end in a break up, which might be beneficial and it might not. I am close with her whole family and they like me a lot, so now I am not only breaking up with this girl, I am breaking off all the relationships I have made with her family.

Not sure if this even makes sense because I was up until 4 AM thinking about this and really wanted to see if there was anything I need to do. I know I need to talk to her about this, but I would love some outside input on the situation.",16Oct2018,1
194,"Hi everyone! Sorry for formatting, but I’m on mobile.

I’ll give you some context: I (22F) studying a Master’s in Computational Linguistics student in Antwerp, Belgium. 

I already have a BA in Applied Linguistics and a MA in Translation. I just started this year with my second master’s, to ultimately have a career in Natural Language Processing (Siri and that kind of technologies).

Last week, a recruiter contacted me for a dream function as a Spoken Language Linguist for a company in Cupertino, CA. 

It would require a 6-8 week training on site, and from then on I could work on a shirt term project remotely.

But I also recently moved in with my boyfriend, and he wouldn’t be able to pay the rent on his own for 2 months. On top of that, we recently adopted a puppy that still needs fulltime attention.

Since I just started my degree I’m not even sure if I am qualified for the function they contacted me about. 

I’m rather insecure about my abilities and I also have been struggling with anxiety for almost two years. So what if I don’t fit in the image of the Bay Area Young Professional and if I can’t handle the constant pressure?

I’d have to put my degree on hold for now, and leave my boyfriend and our dog for a couple of weeks. 

What do I do? Do I contact the recruiter saying I would be interested and ask her some questions about the specifics, or do I wait for an opportunity like this to present itself when the time is right (but that may never happen again).

I hope you guys can offer me some advice.",16Oct2018,1

199,"First of all, a quick introduction of my friends might be helpful, some details have changed for privacy reasons;

Sophie (25F) Roommate, Bert’s girlfriend, we’ve became good friends quickly and have a lot in common. 

Bert (25M) , Roommate, Sophie’s boyfriend, started as good friends before realising how shitty he is. 

Mark (24M) Roommate, lived with Sophie and Mark for about 6months before i moved in, we get along well. 

Betty &amp; George (24,25, M&amp;F) Not roommates but they came over often, everyone got along well with them. 

Jacob (24M) My older brother, friends with Sophie and Mark well before I was

Todd (23M) My other older brother, in a band with Bert and Mark. 

Sarah (24F) Todd’s girlfriend, one of my close friends. 

i’m not even sure where to start, so i’m just gonna dot point the shitty things he does. 

-Bert Started an argument with George over a meme he shared on facebook. Bert doesn’t even have facebook, he just saw that George had tagged sophie +others on it. Bert refused to be friends again until George apologised, George felt he didn’t need to and they both stopped talking long enough for Betty to become uncomfortable at our house, leading to Betty and Sophie also not talking.

-Months after the fight with George he admitted 
“George was right, but now it’s too late to apologise”

-Bert started an argument with Sophie one night, calling her a bitch and verbally abusing her until me and Mark decided to call the police. After the police left he continued the argument, then gave a half asses apology which Sophie ate right up. 

-Bert constantly told Todd and Sarah (who were camping out, in the middle of winter) that they could stay for a few nights, Todd and Sarah politely rejected until one night the accepted because of a storm. After staying for 3 nights (every night Bert would say they could stay again) Bert decided they had stayed too long and needed to pay rent. Todd and Sarah took this as a sign to leave and left. 

-Bert continuously texted Todd over multiple hours asking for money because apparently they “owed” him for the time they stayed. 

-Due to Todd, Bert and Mark being in a band, Todd left most of his music things (amps, stands, instruments, etc.) at our house, which everyone was fine with because we have a whole room dedicated to music. When Todd left and didn’t pay Bert $200+ he threatened to sell all of his things. 

-Bert and Sophie left town for a few weeks to visit family, while away I let Todd come and grab his things, as he was scared Bert would actually do it (Neither me or Sophie would’ve let him but it was still better to get the stuff out) when Bert came back and found out he got mad and complained that now he had “lost” because he didn’t have anything to use as blackmail. 

-When his girlfriend was away another time, he talking to me about how she was the “wife of the house” and that’s why he was so bad at cleaning. He then told me i’d be a wife one day too. I have no intention of getting married and When i tried to laugh it off and say “yeah sure, we’ll see” he told me  “no, we won’t see, you will [be a wife]”

-One night while having some friendly drinks, Bert threatened to kick Jacob out because he was talking about his job (bricklayer) and Bert took it as him threatening him. (?????) When i came out and told him not to speak to my brother that way he threatened to kick me out too. 

Most of these events happened because he was drinking, but even when sober some shitty things he does are;

-expecting sophie to clean everything for him.

-if sophie is not there i am expected to clean because i’m the only other girl. 

-Tells people they’re useless to society unless they’re working or at school, yet doesn’t have a job or go to school.

-Sleeps on a mattress in the lounge when Sophie isn’t home (she visits her family often) 

-When sophie is away he says very odd things to me like “I love sophie but I never wanted to be in a relationship” or “I could replace everyone in my life if i wanted to, it’s just easier not to”

Honestly there’s a lot more but i’m sick of thinking about him.  I need some advice, I’ve gotten to the point where i hate being at home because i know he will be there. He purposely vents to me about weird shit that’s way too much for me because he knows i’m too shy to walk away or speak up.  If sophie’s gone, He doesn’t even leave me alone because he’s always got SOMETHING he needs to talk about, and i can’t fuckin handle it. He bitches to me about my own BROTHER, and expect me to be on his side?? The worst part about it to me is that he fully seems to think i’m on his side, and that i just Looooove being his friend. I reply to most things he says with any variant of “oh cool”, “yeah”, “i getcha”, “oh haha” and somehow that made him talk to me more??

I would’ve up and moved out ages ago if it wasn’t for sophie, I love living with her, she’s so much fun and great to talk to but I can’t get any time with her without him, and i’m afraid when I move out we won’t see each other and hang out as often, but i can’t fucking handle her asshat boyfriend, so, any advice please? I know if i tell Sophie what he’s told me there will be a lot of awkwardness and maybe even anger from Bert, but I don’t know if it’d make her realise he’s a trash bag, or push her away from me. 

any advice at all would be so helpful, please.

202,"I don’t know if there’s a different or better subreddit for this but here goes. I’m in a situation and I don’t know what to do. I know what the logical thing to do is but I’m struggling to find ways to actually do it and get through it. 

I (23 f) graduated from my degree (nursing) in early 2017 and I knew in second year of said degree it was not for me, but my family managed to convince me to finish because I was already more than half way through. I dragged myself through the last bit of the degree, and finished with above average grades. I wanted to look at pursuing other avenues then but I didn’t and still don’t know exactly what. 

So instead my family managed to convince me to get a job and not waste this 20k degree. So not having a lot of other options and bending to pressure I did. Worst mistake of my life. I got a job in a busy ED ward as a grad and the anxiety of facing every day absolutely made me feel like giving up on everything literally. I stayed there for 3 months and slowly dropped from full time to 3 days per week before quitting as I couldn’t take it anymore, despite my family’s disapproval, I then went and worked part time 3 days at a GP practice for 5 months and I didn’t mind it too bad, but it wasn’t interesting to me or anything. I lost my job there after they downgraded their staff. I then got another job a few months later in sleep study nursing, but the 12 hr shifts killed me, I only lasted there for 2 months. 

I now secured myself another job it’s in a rural and remote country hospital that is semi busy with an Aged Care section too. The people are great and friendly. Everything seems okay. But I’m only just into this job and already the feelings of being trapped and anxious and not able to sleep at night, plus the overwhelming feeling of just being so miserable and sad is really getting to me. I don’t know what it is but when I wake up and realise I have to face another 8 hour day on shift, I have to stop myself from crying and force myself to go in. And then fight the feeling to want to leave shift the entire time. It’s not good for me at all and is already doing my head in, and not good for the hospital I’m sure. But I don’t know what to do, I had to move 1000km to a rural and remote place for this job, and take up a 6 month rental,  and got into a bit of debt to do it. (Me thinking of I force myself into the situation I won’t be able to back out and have to do it, stupid me) 

They’ve already agreed to put me down to 8 shifts a fortnight but I’m considering asking to drop to 6 shifts but it puts a slight financial strain on me as I won’t be able to save much or pay back as much debt. But I’m struggling to go in everyday, this morning I broke down before leaving and just couldn’t face it and called in sick. I’m sure the hospital aren’t happy and I feel awful. I’m just stuck in a situation where I can’t do anything and it’s pushing me to feel extremely bad. I just don’t know what to do and wanted peoples opinions. I’m not opposed to working, in fact I’ve had no issues working full time  prior but nursing I just can’t seem to make it work, I feel trapped and overwhelmed. 

Thanks for any advice.

TL:DR I’ve struggled to make nursing work as a career for me for years and now I’m stuck in a Nurse job in a remote town with a bit of debt and I don’t see anyway out, struggle to face every day, it’s really effecting my mental health badly. ",16Oct2018,1
203,"I genuinely love my boyfriend a lot and we’ve been together for around 3 years. He has a good job but he hates it and is really depressed.

I love him but I’m at the point where it’s beginning to ruin me, I dread opening his texts throughout the day and feel depressed when he comes home from work and goes on about how shit his life is. Sometimes I just want to tell him to shut the fuck up, which is horrible (I’m nothing but supportive).

I have helped her to bye the baby's cloths and stuff and even was there when the baby was born as she kept it a secret from her parents and only my gf and I knew about this. So I was there in the waiting room while she gave birth and was the first male to hold the baby in my arms as her own bf or the baby daddy didn't want the baby.

We got close (gf's sister and I) before the baby died. And I saw how much of a wonderful person she was and she was also very beautiful.  Now it is almost going to be a year next month since she left us... and My gf' family see me as the baby's father now as my gf has adopted him.

It has been very hard to move on as I feel or realise I was in love  with her but dared not to cross the line between my gf's sister and I. I think of her everyday and cry alot. And feel I wish I only could have told her how I felt and wish I could have saved her.

So I (21M) met a Swedish girl (22F) in Australia (my home country) a couple years ago. Fast forward a year, I decided to move to Sweden - for travelling's sake as well as for our relationship.

Life never really goes to plan however, and I haven't ended up travelling much, we kind-of just knuckled down and lived the ""adult"" life - work, bills, I helped her buy an apartment etc. 

But now, we have mutually decided to end the relationship. We have lost the spark and have (over the past few months) settled into a friendship routine. I don't even know what you would call it. But anyway, we've decided that it's best to go our separate ways.

I'm now stuck in Sweden, in the middle of a relationship visa application which can take anywhere between 6 months to another year before I receive any kind of answer. I do not know what I should do next.

* Hang around in Sweden until I \*\*have\*\* to leave the country?
* Travel more of Europe, before making my way back home to Aus?
* Travel Asia on my way back home to Aus?
* Move to New Zealand with an English friend of mine in January?
* Go back home and try make a shitload of money before embarking on a Working-Holiday somewhere else in the world?

210,"Not sure if I am at the right place to ask for advice but oh well.

I recently just got my first full time job and was pretty excited about it. I've only been in the company for a month and it's taken me awhile to get used to the company. Hence, I'm still kinda reserved and shy and basically clueless about everything.

Anyways, my coworker who's a senior was giving me advice on how to improve myself and he says I could really change my energy. He says I tend to have low energy and I should be more outgoing.

The thing is, I naturally have pretty ""low"" energy. I'm not super bubbly and extroverted. I tend to have a RBF (Resting Bitch Face) at times. Sometimes when I'm concentrating on work, some colleagues would even tell me to not be so ""serious"". And I'm like.... But I'm just concentrating? I do smile from time to time but I guess it's not enough? Some guy too told me I spoke to slow but I legit speak normally and I guess I speak in a way that ensures that you'd get everything I'm saying. 

I put on mild makeup and sometimes I don't because I have to leave the house by 6am.
I literally feel dead in the morning but I try so hard to still look pleasant-ish. That one day when I had 0 makeup? People told me I looked tired and sick. Am I wrong to feel offended in some way? 

I'm also somewhat soft spoken especially when I'm trying to be polite and not want to act too casual at work. Plus, it's difficult for me to be confident in speaking about the work I'm doing when I'm still learning.  I've only been in the company for less than a month and I already feel like I can't succeed in this field because Im not ""energetic"". 

Does anyone relate to me or am I just a lost cause. Help please.

212,"This might be lengthy. I had the same best friend all the way throughout high school, we’ll call him Jim. Jim and I were inseparable, people often used the phrase “attached at the hip” when describing the two of us. We went thru all of our firsts together, but w different people if someone else was involved in the first. If that makes any sense. Jim and I were never romantically involved. I had a connection with Jim unlike any other connection I’ve ever had before, and after really. When Jim and I had a falling out last year, I thought for sure that was the last of it. We’ve had our spats before but the months kept passing by w this one. All the way up until now. See, I never hated Jim per say, there were definitely some issues that came out at the end but I didn’t hate him for anything. I think in a way we both just started going different directions. I have to add here that when Jim and I had this last spat 11 months ago, my headspace was not entirely where it should have been. I had just went through a very bad break up with an abusive man and was really just looking to change anything at that point. I took out a lot of this anger on Jim, and he took it well. As well as anyone can take a delusional, borderline psychotic break from their best friend. I said some things to him the last time we talked that were only to hurt him, what they were is a whole different topic and irrelevant to what is at hand. And I can see how he would have felt dealing with me post-break up and active melt down. Jim has agreed to meet up with me, I hit him up after many months of going back and forth between leaving it alone and saying something. Well I finally said something. I’ve grown a lot in this past year and my head is definitely in a better spot. But I’m asking how to not screw this up I suppose. I don’t expect much to come from it as we are both in two different places than we were previously, but I desperately don’t want him to hate me for the rest of eternity.

216,"Hey reddit, apologies for the wall of text but I've been thinking about how to write this post for a long time and sort of needed to vent as well. Really sorry if this is not the right place to post, I know that people can get annoyed by posts like this.  
   
So I'm a student in 10th grade and I've noticed this sort of pattern in my life which has been going on for at least 5-6 years: 
   
I always procrastinate before the exams. I don't think there's been one instance since elementary school in which I've actually managed to study something or prepare a subject unless they are less than a week away. I *really* want to study and when I read about people on reddit grinding through college and high school and working 24/7 I am in absolute awe and wonder how someone could even do that.  
When I try to study, it feels like a literal repulsive force is trying to push me away and sometimes I have to physically force myself to sit down at my desk and open a book. A feeling of complete dread overcomes me and I feel so suffocated that l'd literally be *anywhere* else than sitting at my desk with a book in front of me, and so of course I get up and guiltily try to find something else to do. Sometimes I manage to push through for maybe 15-20 minutes, sometimes this doesn't happen at all and I might be able to study even for an hour, but eventually, 90% of the time this takes over and I find myself completely unable to oppose it.  

When the exams *do* arrive, however, it's like everything changes. When I study on the last day I'll be able to complete 10 chapters in a single day and even have some time left over to go through some of them twice. That feeling of dread and repulsion vanishes and I wonder why I couldn't study before the exams started. I feel like a different person. But of course I think that if only I had studied earlier I would have gotten better grades. My marks used to be in the 90s, now they're in the lower 80s and might touch 70s as well. My parents are not happy with these grades as well because they see that I'm not putting any effort into studying beforehand and they think I don't give any importance to my exams, but I *do*.   
So when the exams are about to get over, I start feeling motivated, that this time I'll study more and get better grades. I'll practice self control and discipline, and stay motivated throughout the trimester and throw everything else out the window.  
  
Well, that doesn't work. I'll study for a few days, maybe a week, and then I'm back to square one. That same feeling of dread and anxiety. Everything back again. This has happened dozens of times now. I literally feel like I cannot trust myself anymore - I can make plans, design schedules, and be all motivated and stuff but I have no assurance that tomorrow I won't simply ignore them - because that is what always happens. Now that I write about it, I feel like many people probably go through this. But this is at the point where I feel like my own personal actions are out of my hands and I'm just some sort of drone or meat puppet going through the same routine over and over again. I really want this to stop, but I don't have a fraction of the willpower or energy to overcome this and I feel that by the time I'm in college this could seriously mess things up. Again, sorry for all this text but if you guys have any advice I'd appreciate it a *lot*.",16Oct2018,1

A, however, started off cool but is gradually getting worse and worse to live with. (I am on mobile so forgive the incorrectly bulleted list.)

-She left doors unlocked constantly and when D told her not to her response was along the lines of ‘but it’s been unlocked for the past month and it didn’t bother you before???’ Had we known, yes it would have bothered us. Our balcony is not the highest and could easily be jumped onto. We’ve also had to tell the multiple times to lock the front door which she didn’t think was a big deal either. (We live in a gated community but the gate doesn’t go all around and the rest of woods behind a shopping center. Also the front gate is always broken and open)

-She would eat others food without asking. I saw her just take my cheese from the fridge once while standing there talking to me but she didn’t ask. I blew it off because maybe she thought it was someone else’s (I was looking for any excuse to avoid confrontation). What set it off for me is she ate the last of my cream cheese for my bagel without asking. A bagel and cream cheese at the time was my breakfast every day. I know it was her because D was gone for the weekend and C didn’t know what cream cheese was (C is not from here and isn’t familiar with all American foods). I also know it wasn’t my boyfriend (who is over frequently) because he always waits for me to give him food. 

-She neglects her animals. It started with a fish named Phil (I made a post earlier about him). Phil is a beta fish and from what I’ve seen on r/betta is that 2 gallons is the acceptable minimum for a betta tank. Phil is constantly in a 1 gallon bowl that the cat drinks out of so he realistically he has .5 gallons of space. He hides constantly now and I haven’t see he feed him in over a week ( I’m not sure but I’m pretty sure they should be fed at least once a week). I refilled his bowl once and I’ve had to remind her to clean it. 
-The kitten. So a few weeks ago she got a stray kitten (didn’t register it with the office like you’re supposed to. If we get a fine for having an unregistered cat I’ll be calling her parents to pay my portion of fee because I did warn her about registering the cat). Also the cat is very young and had virtually no toys. The one she likes the most is always kept in the closet. I left it out for her to play with while we were gone and I got a text that read “You can’t do that. You let it out so she broke it.”  Not only was he phrasing of the text harsh and rude but it’s a toy, a cheap one at that, buy a new one. She also said she was gonna get a cat tree (never did) and the cat is so under stimulated that she relies on everyone else in the house for play and cuddles. Roommate A does take care of food and litter though. Roommate A is also always gone which sucks for cat because she’s so loving but being neglected by her mom. 

-She never does her dishes. At first everyone didn’t mine doing an extra dish or two especially if they were already at it. Later on her dishes would sit for days. Now there is a whole side of the sink that we cannot use because she denies that they are here (they clearly are with remnants of things only she eats). The dishes have been there for over a week and it’s really starting to piss me off. She used my pot to cook in and hasn’t cleaned it. Because I’m not doing her dishes, I’m pot less. Everyone is because she’s used every pot. We are all incredibly annoyed and she ignores them. 

-Rude harsh texts. Every time we curtail her behavior through our group text she ignores it. But once she has something to say about us, it comes with a snarky text after we’ve already apologized. The above text about the cat toy is one example but what has really set me off is this morning. I left the oven on all night last night and when I found out I was mortified. I could have burned the house down and killed us all! I apologized profusely in the group chat saying I’ll double check it next time. Her response was “Also, this is why the gas bill gets so high.” Like o get it I fucked up and my concerns with the oven on were our lives (As room is right next to the kitchen as well) but yet she wants to point out one accident as the reason why the bill is high (the bills her parents pay. I have to pay for my own bills so of course I’m cautious with using utilities. Accidents just happen.)

A is also a care free party girl and her life is really just make it up as you go. We have some good times but lately it’s turning all sour. How can me and my other roommates confront her?

225," 

Recently I've been missing my ex so much, which is weird considering I broke up with her 9 months ago.

The relationship was fun, there wasn't much bad within it and we were both extremely supportive of one

another over the year that we were dating. However she started talking to me about her sister being

a 'psycho' when in reality she was just a normal person. For 10 months she was telling me how her sister

was in and out of jail, but I found out quickly that she was lying. As a person who really dislikes

lying, I became really paranoid and failed to believe most things she would say. The drama settled

over the final two months, but eventually I became bored with the relationship.

It's weird because when I did break up with her it wasn't a big deal at first, I simply told her that

I just wasn't in love with her anymore. A week later she was upset, understandably but I treated her like

complete shit and just shut her out off my life completely. And here I am. 9 months later filled with

regret.

I really miss her company and how she made me feel. I miss how much she made me love myself, knowing

she would support everything I did. I miss having that person I can cuddle up with and just talk for

hours about anything. I'm puzzled as to whether I like her once again, but I just miss her so much.

I've noticed how my self esteem has dropped dramatically and how I view myself in a negative manner. To

make things more complicated she'd recently said to one of my friends that she still has feelings for me

and she wishes we were together. I've had countless night where I just can't take her off my mind, and

whether my choice was right.

I've been considering getting back with her again but I'm completely puzzled on the whole situation.

What would you guys recommend doing in my situation,

Thanks.",16Oct2018,1

I work as a paramedic, and I've known for quite some time that my work colleague has been dealing prescription viagra to other work colleagues - she has offered to sell me some in the past. She even gave me some to try. 

She gets the viagra from a friend who is prescribed viagra by his GP on the basis of his depression - apparently, this friend doesn't actually need it, and takes a cut from my work colleague when she makes a sale.

I've always seen viagra as a bit of a harmless drug, and I've not wanted to shake up things in the workplace, but yesterday I was in the locker room (where my work colleague does his deals) and I heard her and another colleague say ""this is the purest stuff. Honestly, just one sniff and you'll be buzzing"". I quickly made to leave, they heard my foot steps, and they stopped talking. 

They didn't know I was there to begin with, as the locker room is quite extensive, and I was checking my text messages before going on shift. They heard me leave, but I made a hasty getaway, so I wasn't seen.

I assume she was dealing cocaine. On nights out, she has provided cocaine (something I've always steered clear of....).

I'm not quite sure what to do now. I do NOT want to go to my line manager about this, as she would just confront her, and has no issues implicating other people - i.e. me. 

So what do I do?? Should I do anything? Should I just let it lie?

I'm scared. I've had depression/suicidal ideals in the past when I finished high school. What helped was setting a routine and going to uni. Having purpose, something to do each day.

Now I have neither, and today I absolutely lost it, meanwhile berating myself. 

I know I have a future set out for me somewhere, and I can get a job again soon, and blah blah. I know it will work out. But how the fuck do I get there again?

I haven't known my father for 11 years but we recently got back into contact about a year ago.  I moved into my grandads granny flat under his house 4 months ago, and I haven't known this man all my life.  (same amount of time as my father) he also isn't really blood related, but he treats me like I am so naturally it didn't matter.

But, and here's where the issue starts,  he comes into my flat a lot when I'm not there and a lot of time fails to mention he does so until after. And he's started to implant rules on me,  which is fine but it's just frustrating because I was promised my own space and my own home to do as I please. And some of them are not outrageous or unfair,  like he asked me to keep my flat a bit cleaner.

238,"Yeah I know the title sounds pretty lame, but bear with me.

So basically at the start of the year I applied for a scholarship for a certain subject, and my teacher told me that if I got the scholarship I'd have to go for this overseas trip for 12 days, so he made me sign up for it anyways.

I got through the trip, but not my scholarship. No big deal about the scholarship part, I was sort of expecting it anyways. But the trip is driving me insane, I guess.

1. Most students in the trip are all friends in very close circles, and I barely know any of them very well (but I do know for a fact that some are pretty stuck-up). I have about 2 or 3 friends within the trip who also have their own closer group of friends. Most knew one another for years or so already. I'm pretty much alone, but since I have always been a sort of a loner, it wasn't so bad for me at first. I'm not the type to make new friends as well - just don't feel it at all. I know many of them probably have some sort of preconceived notion about me too, so there's that.

2. Preparations for the trip takes up too much effort. We had to sign up for it at the start of the year, and have regular meetings until the end of November, when it takes place. There's honestly too many administrative briefings, in my opinion. Plus, we have to do reports and presentations beforehand on the place we are visiting. I get that it is normal to have such things, but personally I get marginalised because friends in pairs and trios would snatch up the easy topics to do first, while only the few who doesn't have any close friends get the hardest topics. Yeah, this one's pretty unfair but unavoidable. Sorry.

Now, we haven't paid for the trip yet, but I have to do so by Thursday (I think the tickets have already been paid for by the agency). That means I potentially still have time to withdraw, but possibly with heavy consequences. Some of my own teachers are involved in the trip, and a reason not good enough may just give them a bad impression of me which I do not want. My parents probably wouldn't be very supportive of my reasons - they definitely would tell me to learn to be accepting and tolerant in the 12 days. I also feel bad, since they kind of have been anticipating for me to go as well. I really, really dread this trip and I can foresee that nothing will go well for me even if I went. I know my reasons aren't great reasons, but I just want to get out of it without compromising anything heavy. What could I do, other than pray for some epidemic to halt the trip entirely?

Anyone have any advice for this, or experience with something like this? Thanks in advance",16Oct2018,1
258,"Hey everyone, today has been one of the roughest days in a while because I became aware (ignorant is bliss huh?)  


Backstory:  
After high school I decided to pursue music because I had gotten a really good chance to make a living from it. It turned out to be 2 years of procrastination and staying home in my room and sometimes going out.  
Now its been almost 3 years since high school and im living on my own in a really small location, while working part time in a grocery store.  
To be honest i feel completely lost. My social skills are lacking as I cant form deep connection with people. i think this is because i´ve been so isolated and havent really progressed in life or experienced stuff. My last girlfriend said that we didnt really click and that I had to find myself, fair enough.  
What made me aware this time was this girl i started meeting. Been a month to this day and it has sizzled off. She said indirectly that im clueless and dumb. I agree, i have nothing really to talk about. I get told all the time that im really good looking, but I feel like a trap that girls walks into and realize that im the most boring person ever. 

My grades from high school are really really really bad, so im not sure what to study. Only reason i want to go to college is because I want to get back to socializing and making friends, as im growing apart from all my friends.  


Its getting really frustrating as I should be living my life and taking risks, but Im so damn isolated and ""locked in"" that I have no idea what to do. I feel like i´ve wasted the precious moments of teenage youth, and im really far behind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im not sure if this backstory is enough to give advice, but anything helps really. Im super anxious and depressed at the moment, and the isolation is starting to kill me (worse, making my mind drift off to places i dont want it to go)  


Cheers people! Thanks for reading.",16Oct2018,1
259,"This conversation started off by her saying that she loves Donald Trump and I simply asked her why. She could not give me an answer. (She is 66 years old and honestly doesn’t even follow politics, she just listens to whatever the people around her say and then repeats it). I wasn’t even trying to have a political debate of any kind, I was genuinely curious about whether or not she actually had any reasons. She then proceeded to say how sick she is of women coming forward about sexual assaults that happened years ago. 

So, stupid me thought this may be the time to try to explain it from the point of view of someone who has never said anything about my own personal experience. I intended to explain that people don’t believe them, victim blaming, etc. because that is personally why I never said anything. It was easier for me to just try my best to forget and forgive the person instead of carrying it around for my whole life. 

In short, I was molested in my sleep multiple times in my old relationship. I’m not saying that he was trying to turn me on by touching me in my sleep, he was getting off to the fact that I was unaware of what was happening. I woke up to him masturbating with one hand and his other hand down my pants multiple times. I asked him not to do it again but he continued to do it and then guilt me into staying into a relationship with him. It all led up to one night where I didn’t want to have sex and he made me feel so bad that I just gave in and laid there, crying, while he had his way with me. He saw I was crying, he said “are you okay?”  I just nodded and he kept going.  (We split very shortly after that). I realize it isn’t blatant, violent rape but all of this affected me seriously for years and I’ve finally made some kind of peace with it. I never said anything because I stayed in this relationship for years so I didn’t think anyone would believe me, they’d think that I liked it or that I was allowing it. Plus, I didn’t want to “ruin his life” with coming forward about everything, I just simply wanted him to stop ruining mine. 

So back to my mom, I tell her pretty bluntly “well mom, I’ve been through some pretty awful sexual experiences myself”. She asked if I’ve been sexually assaulted before and I told her that yes, I have been although maybe it’s more appropriate to say sexually abused. Before I could even explain what happened or get any further, she just said “no you haven’t.” Other than therapy, this is the first time I tried to open up about it. I immediately just shut down and left the room. 

I realize now that this probably wasn’t an ideal time to bring it up, but her reaction really hurt me. We have a pretty close relationship, but I don’t know how to handle this. I tried to open up to her about something that really affected me and she immediately shut me down before I could even explain any details. 

Should I try to talk to her about it again, or should I just forget about it since she’s apparently going to be insensitive? I’m at a loss. 

TL;DR: tried to open up to my mom about my sexual abuse and she immediately didn’t believe me before I could even tell her what happened. ",16Oct2018,1

Hi everyone, I think I have an issue about how I see and evaluate myself. It seems that I've got quite a too great ego and I'm finding myself more skilled and competent than I actually am, leading in situation where I fail because of that.

For instance, I had a financial apppointement (won't detail more) a few days ago, and I thought it would be easy, but instead I kinda fucked up and delayed the whole thing for 2 or more weeks (will lost about 200 bucks in the process). I think that if I had prepared the meeting properly it wouln'd have happend.

My questions are : how to have a proper view of myslef, my skills, my strengh and weakness ? How can I stop the bias I have about myself ?

263,"I recently broke up with my gf of 9 months, not that long in the big picture but still hurts. The relationship started off normally, you know going out to the movies and for dinner or just relax, we were together every second of every day but I started to get sick of being with her every day and I wanted some space to myself. Whenever I brought up I want time to myself, catch up with family and friends etc. I would say I want some time to myself and she'd ask how long I'd say a couple of days because I want to enjoy my own company and relax. She was okay to start off with me having a day to myself here and there, but as time went on whenever I brought up the concept of spending time alone she would say that I didn't love her and start screaming and crying and cause a big argument. Or say you better spend time with yourself and not go my only friend Jacob (I've known him for years and he is the only person I trust with my life, he's like family to me as my family were never really around, I'm 18 and he is 24 but I never seen the age gap as a difference.) she would flip out and cause a big argument and say that I lied to her and was probably off doing drugs or having sex with other girls. Which I never did I loved her, we would just relax and play computer games or mess around with our cars and work on them. Go for long drives and enjoy the roads, we're really into cars and both have an extreme passion for them.  Anyways I'm drifting off track, she eventually gave me an ultimatum, either her or my friend Jacob. I didn't know what to do and she wanted an answer then and there. So I said I would pick her just frantically didn't know what else to do.  I thought about it and I picked her up to come grocery shopping with me, she would usually come with me because she would ask to.  When we got done grocery shopping, we got in my car and she slammed the door and threw the seatbelt around, I'm very tedious with my car it's my pride and joy so ofcourse I said why did you slam my door and stretch the seatbelt right out. She said I didn't and I said you did I just watched you do it.  Anyways a big argument ensued and she was rambling on saying I didn't love her and I never have. Saying that I would have sex with her sister if I had the chance and I'd cheat on her if I knew she wouldn't find out.  And I was nervous thinking oh no what have I done, blaming myself for it when in reality I really didn't do anything. Now she starts talking about Jacob saying that he was dragging me down and he's nothing but a piece of shit and that she's glad I'll never see him again and I'll never find another friend like him. But I didnt want a different friend. Hearing her talk so badly about someone I value extremely in my life, really made me angry, I never really got angry during arguments before I'd just talk normally and try to resolve the issue. But I slammed on the breaks of my car, she asked why I did that. I said I can't sit here and let you talk badly about someone who is more family to me than my own family, someone I've shared some of the best memories of my life with ever. She started screaming how dare I talk about Jacob around her and how she's going to break up with me. So I said do it. And she did. She got out and I drove off, went for a long drive and ended up falling asleep in the car. 

Short explanation: I broke up with my gf of 9 months and I don't know if it was the right thing to do.

267,"Okay, so I work as a secretary for a local government office. I work alongside 3 coworkers and our supervisor. Two of the coworkers are new hires and have been here for about 6 months. First, our supervisor isn't very great. She's been here a long time, but she's more concerned about stuff unrelated to our work and whether or not people like her. Second, she treats the new hires like teacher's pets. They can do no wrong, they're her best friends, etc. Now, the job we do involves my coworkers to be out in the field and do inspections. They are supposed to log their inspections in our system as well as add notes, etc. 

Anyway, one of the new employees I've noticed is out in the field from around 2pm and doesn't come back until it's almost 5pm, quitting time, so he basically just comes back and leaves to go home. Some days he is also out in the field all morning. The other new employee expressed some frustration to me that when he's in the office he hardly does anything and spends all his time on his phone (they share an office). So, out of curiosity, I pulled a report to see how many inspections he'd been doing. In the period of 2 weeks. He did 9 whereas the other 2, even the other new hire, were at about 20 or so each. Some of these days he even had no logged inspections at all, but he was still out in the field for hours like he is every day. Most days he did 1 inspection. There was only one day he did 5, but the other new employee told me there was a day he went out with our supervisor, so that was probably that day. Normally, depending on the location, they should be able to do between 5-10 inspections a day. So no one knows where he's going or what he's doing all this time. He is doing some work, but the more I investigate, the more it seems like he's doing just barely enough to make it look like he's working. 

Both my other coworkers find this very unfair as we all work very hard and it seems he is not pulling his weight. My supervisor doesn't notice this. She doesn't pull reports or follow up on hardly anything like a supervisor should and I have the feeling even if she did, she would try and protect him. He has a lot of family working for our government in different departments so he's like the ""golden child"", but he's young and he's got kind of like a ""you can't touch me"" attitude. Another issue is that he's got 2 young children and I would hate to start anything that may cause him to lose his job and therefore affect his children. However, on the other side of the coin, it's really his own fault if he's not doing the work. ( I really doubt he'd be fired, he'd probably just be reprimanded, possibly put back on probation)

Basically, I'm debating saying something to someone. I really don't think my supervisor would do anything and probably throw it back on me somehow. She doesn't like me much because I don't kiss her ass, but she knows I'm good at my job. I don't know if I should say something to our director (who is above my supervisor). I really feel if I were to approach the coworker about it, he would get defensive and we'd end up having a sour working relationship. I'm really debating just letting it go, but the more he does this, the more our department is going to suffer. We are about to hire another person, so perhaps when they start he'll shape up a little more, but I kind of doubt it. I don't want to seem like a tattle tale or anything, but it causes so many problems if he's not staying on top of his cases and his inspections. We'll have a lot of cases fall through the cracks, stay open for years with no activity (it's happened before), and it reflects badly and that could affect things like our budget and such. Anyway, just looking for some advice in this matter. Thanks!

Backstory: We went on a couples trip last fall to DC and her boyfriend was a total a-hole the whole time. He complained about everything and constantly questioned why we were doing what we were doing (i.e. going to museums, going to bars, etc.) All he wanted to do was sit at the house we were staying at, and hang out. Why would you go on a trip just to do what you do at home? My friend and I were there to see a friend who was in town that we hadn't seen in like a year and we wanted our S/O's to meet our friends up there.

I usually plan New Years parties instead of birthday parties because I don't like the focus being on me, instead I want everyone to have a good time. But this time a friend is offering to let us stay on her property and I worry that he will just make it miserable for everyone.

I wasn’t looking for a relationship because let’s be real I’m just starting my life and I can’t handle that right now. Also, who actually looks for a relationship?

Anyways here’s the meat of it:
I met this guy on Tinder about a month ago. We will call him Chad. Chad had a tinder bio that referred to BDSM so I was intrigued him and sent him a good old submissive joke. That night we met up for a snack and went back to his place. We hooked up. It was very good sex. I bled on the bed though and Chad kinda worried that it was my first time and I didn’t tell him or that he didn’t stimulate me enough etc. But he also said he was just sad he couldn’t eat me out more. Whatever. We move on and hooked up again the next night. Since then we’ve been hooking up for about six weeks now. For the most part I was the one initiating it in the beginning I would text him and see if we could hang out etc. Long story short. I started catching the feels. I’ve never ever ever spent the night before but he asked me to and I did. I’ve spent the night a few times now and we always shower together after sex which is different to me. Hook ups always to me are hook up, cuddle, and text ya laters. So I started catching the feels. I don’t know if has any interest in me at all. But he has lately started hitting me up more often. 

My question is this: How should I go about asking him if he wants anything more? 

I want to ask him that without freaking him out. Because if he isn’t interested in more I’m totally fine with just hooking up. Cause turns out I’m always horny af and everyone else I’ve hooked up with during our six week fwb type deal have been not as great.",16Oct2018,1

TL;DR Fiance left me, i'm a mess and I feel like my life is in shambles. I am looking for advice

First i will say that i am 23 m right now.

Three and a half years ago i met my now ex-fiance (24f now) and i now know we moved the relationship along fast. She wanted it to move as fast as it did and i loved her more than i've loved anyone. (She also got me out of the depression i was in at the time) We had both been through a lot of the same shit (s.o's falling out of love, cheating etc.) We both wanted us to last forever so we made a pact that if either of us was having an issue in the relationship we would talk about it. Two years later i proposed and she says yes. Everything was great. A few months later we bought a house.

Everything was going great until January/February of this year when she was bullied at work. She was never good at brushing things off and she fell into depression. I spent every day for the next few months doing every thing around the house along with trying to make her feel happiness. Along with the anti-depressants she took she started to make progress right around the time of my birthday. Then around june she started to change, little by little. She seemed more distant. I tried to talk to her but she would just say she was having an off day. This slow change happened for a month and a half when she tells me she wants to end the relationship.

I was damn near on my knees pleading with her to go to counseling with me and we can fix anything we are going through. She told me that i didn't do enough around the house and that i didn't want to go out. (not the biggest partier and i worked 10 hr days so i reserved my going out to weekends) She gave me a bunch of reasons (all of which she later said she knew were false)

Then she smashed my already broken heart. She told me she cheated on me just before she broke up with me. I don't know if its true or not but the damage is done.

The house has been sold, she gave me the ring back because she says she loves who i am as a person but doesn't love me anymore. I have had to move back in with my parents to save up for another down payment for a new house.

So now is where i ask for advice. I have started working out and learning the guitar (i gave up the guitar when i met my ex) and for a time they provided some relief. But now i just feel empty. I wake up and wish i didn't. I am never hungry (i force myself to eat) but i find no enjoyment in anything anymore. I keep finding myself thinking that if i could have protected her from the people at her work we might still be together. I miss the feeling of loving and being loved unconditionally. I don't know how to make this empty feeling this void where i used to be go away. I know that ""time heals all wounds"" but i don't know that i can wait.

Any advice i would greatly appreciate.

Thank you.",16Oct2018,1

M/40ish/USA

A few years ago, my wife got pregnant, delivered a healthy child, and died from a massive postpartum hemorrhage. Her first cousin works remotely and was able to stay with me and our newborn child. After three months, one night my wife's cousin and I connect. I simply ask her to stay, we've been in a relationship ever since. It's fulling and enjoyable and I love her more than I can truly describe. This relationship is different from the dynamic I had with my first wife, for what it's worth. 

We've never told our now kindergarten-aged child about their mother, their Daddy's love of his life. That the person they know as Mommy didn't give birth to them and stepped to in to help and the chemistry that transpired led the loving, nurturing life this child adores. This child has no idea about the trauma of losing their birth mother.

There are a couple of photos around the house of me and my late with, plus a couple of the cousins. Little one hasn't asked about them.

Here's where I need advice. My former wife and partner are a different ethnicity from me. Our child looks like they could biologically be born from either woman. I don't want to lose the memory and fact that my former wife gave all to bring this child in to the world. I don't want to disrespect the woman who dropped everything to care for the child and me at the darkest moment in my life and helped us flourish to become the second love of my life.

284,"I am 25F single and live alone. I had one cat that is a rag doll mix and is the best kitty ever. I got him when he was 3 months, he is now 1.5 years and is big and fluffy and pretty mellow and is 15 lbs. Hid name is Meeko. I thought I would get him a friend, someone to keep him company while I am at work.

Last weekend I adopted a 5 month d female tabby. When I first petted her, she started purring and nuzzling and was very comfortable. I’ve had her 3 nights now. She is a crazy little thing. She is constantly running and jumping around, knocking stuff over, trying to play and bite my feet under the covers, she hisses and chases my Meeko, and swats at him. She doesn’t really cuddle because she can’t sit still, but she does like to be petted. She seems to have adjusted well and doesn’t hide from me, she walks around like she owns the place. She cries a lot if I close her in another room.

Meeko was not this hyper and crazy as a kitten if I remember correctly. They have been fighting some and I’m lot sure he likes her. It’s still really early though. I just don’t know if I like her personality as much as I thought I would. Will it change and will she mellow out?",16Oct2018,1
285,"Title pretty much sums it up. I was dog sitting my friends dog (who is also my neighbor), and I was told that he doesn't have a chewing problem, and that he only sometimes has an issue with eating toilet paper.

Fast forward to yesterday, I found him chewing on one of my things. This is where it gets awkward though, because I found him chewing on my vibrator (hence throwaway). He basically ate the entire wire end of it (was controlled externally), and it no longer works. I had this under my pillow on my bed, and didn't even think he would chew on it since I was told he didn't have a problem with that. 

Should I ask them to replace it? Normally I wouldn't care if it was some other sex toy, but this one was about 100 dollars. Part of me thinks it's an awkward subject to broach but the other part is pretty annoyed it was destroyed.",16Oct2018,1
286,"I work in a professional retail setting (think bank). I had been at one branch for three years, and just recently made a career move to a new branch. 

The previous branch, I had never really taken sick days/ gotten ill. I did end up using my PTO my first year and my second year due to the birth of my children. (They use the time first during FMLA and pay you their incentive pay after. It is paid at 100% for a birth of a new baby up to 6 weeks, they just use your PTO first). 

In August of last year, 6 weeks after my son was born, we moved into our new home, that had been recently renovated. We all got sick almost immediately, including my newborn son. Fast forward a couple months, into the winter I had to take off three weeks, broken up over the course of two months due to my entire family getting the flu, both A&amp;B, nearly back to back. When one of us got better, the other would get it. The time off taken was between myself being ill, and my two children. I also had to take off a few days bc their caretaker was too sick to keep them (with the flu). All in all, I used up 3 weeks of PTO. I usually will get 4 weeks for sick, 2 for vacation. Our benefits are pretty good. 

That being said, my husband started a new job a 4 months ago that didn’t allow him to earn PTO until after 90 days, and then it is earned weekly by hours worked. HE ended up in the hospital (while uninsured) for his diabetes, and I took off the day he came home to drive him/ pick up meds/ get things ready. 

I’ve been at my new branch for only 3 months. I have gotten sick twice, the first time I was contagious and only took off two days till the antibiotics kicked in, and was allowed back. 
But this last time, I got sick Friday 2 weeks ago, pushed through the day, saw the doctor on Columbus Day, and was given amox. Went to work Tuesday, felt worse on Wednesday so called to go to the doctor again. I went, he said the antibiotics were not strong enough, but to keep taking them, and gave me an antibiotic shot. Felt better for a couple days, but then started to get worse again. Yesterday I went into work, but was coughing on customers and so congested I could t hear. Asked to go back to the doctor, manager obliged, she said I’m still contagious, gave me stronger antibiotics, another shot, and told me to stay home a couple days. 

When I spoke to my manager, it was as if he didn’t believe me. He is asking me to provide notes, which is not uncommon, and I have them for him. When I let him know yesterday she did not want me back for a little while, I could honestly hear the disbelief in his voice. This is NOT an attempt to stay home and not work. I generally like my job, and was trying to push through. 
I’m afraid he is going to go to HR about my dwindling sick and vacation time. (I’m even using vaca days for illness). This is incredibly unlike me to get sick so often during the year, and I’m concerned about the next time I have to ask for my kids. 
I guess the threat being that it was said to me “HR may need proof of illness, they don’t like to see you use everything available to you.” 
Do you think I can get in real trouble for using all my PTO? I’m not planning on leaving the company, or utilizing it in any way than I have conveyed to my manager. (I’m not going out on day trips/ using illness as an excuse to stay home. I have two young kids, staying home isn’t always less work).

292,"I’m in the midst of planning my slightly untraditional wedding and I had what l think is a very cute idea for the ceremony. I want our family members to be involved and I especially wanted to add in something that includes both our moms and our dads.


I was thinking that we could ask both of our fathers to be the officiants for our wedding and have our mothers walk us down the isle, so his dad would walk down, my dad, brides maids and groomsmen, then him with his mother, and finally me with mine. Our fathers would then both say something and when it came time to do the vows, my father would read the vows to my fiancé and his father would read them to me.


Here are my concerns. My parents are divorced and they don’t speak. It is not amicable but they don’t fight either, they just don’t speak at all. My mom has made a lot of mistakes and while her family hasn’t turned against her, they all greatly care for my dad (who lives within 5 minutes of most of her side of the family) which my mother definitely sees as a betrayal. 


I want to include my mom in the wedding especially because things are so tense with our family, but I’m worried my dad would be very hurt that he isn’t walking me down the isle and even more that my mom is. I know walking your daughter down the isle is a big thing for dads and I don’t want to take this from him.


The way I see it, being the officiant is a much bigger honor and much more involved than simply walking me down the isle. I know he would be so honored to be an officiant but I don’t know how he’d feel about not walking me down the isle. The thing is, I know he will never say what he feels even if I ask. He wants it to be my special day, but I love him and want him to be happy too.


How would you feel about this idea if you were my dad? Do you think this is something he would see as a better honor or will he be sad? He may be slightly disappointed at first but do you think he might end up preferring this plan?

294,"I’ve been with my company for eight years and I’m part of the management team. There is a guy in finance, about 45-50, who does not like me. He will indirectly speak to me via my employees or refuse to correspond with me, even after being directed to. He just does not like me and that’s not even what I’m bothered by, because frankly  I don’t care for him either. 

Recently, he’s screwing with my job, lying to my boss about things I’m not even doing. My boss basically told him to mind his own business, but his hostile behavior seems to be increasing. I’ve done nothing wrong and I don’t want to find myself in a situation with HR over his petty junior high school bully behavior. The office has kind of accepted that he’s an ass and “that’s just how he is,” but if this continues, I feel like I’m going to go to HR myself and voice my concerns. 

Advice? ",16Oct2018,1
295,"Hey, sorry if this is the wrong place, but I do need advice.

I'm a college sophomore. I just got out of my philosophy class. Class is held in a relatively big lecture hall, but attendance is sparse, so today there were only about fifty students in today. Our professor sticks to a strict no-electronic policy, so we all write down our notes on paper. Our professor will call you out in front of the class if you so much as glance at your phone. I always sit in the back row; I'm a loner, and I'm fine that way. But because I'm in the back, I have a better view than most.

There's a guy who always sits in the back row with me. There's always a seat between us; our section's rows are five across, so he's in the corner, then there's an empty seat, then me, then usually another empty seat and somebody else. Our section is on the left side of the room, with the whiteboard and lecturing professor in the center in front of us.

Anyway, about this guy: he's always late to class, usually by five minutes. If I had to describe him, I'd say he gives off vague neckbeard-y vibes. He never pays attention and is always on his laptop. He doesn't really participate in group activities, and I don't think I've ever heard him speak. When I can steal glances his way, he's on Discord and Reddit (a lot of r/prequelmemes). I've never seen him make an effort in class. This in itself isn't a huge deal; it's a little distracting, but I would never snitch on something as harmless as that. I figured if our professor wasn't calling him out on it, this guy must have special accommodations to use his laptop or something.

Today in class, I caught a glimpse of his screen (I'm not one to pry, but this class is really boring, and I get distracted easily). He was on Reddit and Discord as usual. Then about five minutes later, something really caught my eye: he was looking at handguns on Amazon. I don't know if they're literally classified as handguns, but they were black and look like what you'd see a cop or a spy on TV carry.

My internal alarm went off a bit, because these days, I can't just ignore a boy looking at guns on his laptop at school. But I didn't want to do something severe, so I didn't say anything to him or anybody else, just made a mental note.

Then he started looking at... what *looked* like assault rifles, maybe? I'm not a gun person, but I know these looked long and serious. It was hard to keep stealing glances, because he was out of the way of the professor, but he looked at these for about ten minutes.

A bit later, I was able to read the title of an item: Fallout: New Vegas Service Rifle Prop. I felt my nerves settle down a little. I can't fault a nerd for looking at nerd stuff (I use ""nerd"" fondly here, I'm not a dick). 

Still, I hesitate to write *all* of this off as prop-hunting. I know I couldn't get a great view, but I'm certain I saw handguns before that, and I know it was on Amazon. But I'm me. I jump to conclusions a lot. So my questions are these:

Are there any Fallout fans who want to weigh in? Is gun collecting a thing for you guys? (I know nothing about Fallout). Should I bother telling someone, or should I chalk it up to just a harmless nerd?

**TLDR**: Quiet guy in class shopped for guns. I later learned at least one of them is a Fallout prop. What do now?",16Oct2018,1

297,"I am just in a need of some other opinions about my current situation. 

I am currently renting and living in my parent's first home with my girlfriend. 

Rent is $500 every month plus paying all utilities. We have access to the whole house but the third floor is my father's office. There are positives. We have access to an entire house, a yard, a porch, a nice deck upstairs, three bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a basement for storage, and a really quiet neighborhood in central Pennsylvania. 

Now a little about my father's routine and use of the house and office.

My father will arrive Monday-Friday, sometimes on Saturdays, with no prior notice, arriving around 12pm every M-F and staying until about 5pm. He uses either one of our two bathrooms while he is here. He also uses our freezer to store his personal items for his office use. I am planning on buying him his own freezer to store in his office so this no longer occurs. I also found out that my girlfriend's towel went missing. I know I didn't touch her towel and my first thought was that my father used the towel somehow and didn't put it back. I am starting to get to that point where my paranoia about him being here is bothering me. I know when both my girlfriend were off of work and at home that my father has entered the house while we were having sex in our bedroom. He walked past our bedroom and upstairs to the third floor while we were having sex. The door was most likely ajar to our bedroom. It was uncomfortable to say the least when laying next to my girlfriend realizing that my father was there all of a sudden.

As a renter we do have a lease but we have not signed anything else for this is now the second year. I am assuming we are month to month at this point. We make a lot of sacrifices in terms of what we are allowing for this low rent. The house was not move in ready. A lot of my sister's furniture and personal items were left in the house, as she was the former tenant. We had to move all of my sister's old furniture into one of the bedrooms so we could move into the other bedrooms with our stuff. I had to sell her old couch and tv stand and throw so many things out just to get room for our own stuff. There is still an old couch upstairs that we cannot remove because it is too large and will require the door to have to be removed and taken down from the second floor. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been slowing doing a full clean of the house and upkeep to make it the best it has ever looked, it was so dirty and dusty and just gross when we moved in, it's much better now that I clean most every day. I repainted the wood porch, I mow the grass and maintain the lawn and exterior. I am constantly under paranoia of what my father will think when he enters to a messy kitchen or living room or entryway. I am constantly cleaning up after my girlfriend as she has no intention of cleaning now matter how hard I try. I ask for her help but get nothing in return except guilt trips that she pays the bills, even though I give her half, most are in her name except for Internet which I always pay for in full. I am just trying my best and I realize life is not always going to be perfect but this time could be used as a time for me to work hard and safe up money and do my best to improve my situation. I have two part time jobs, one that pays $9.55/hr and one that pays $20/hr so I am making just enough right now. I am hoping that in time I can find a full time position with benefits that will support me enough to move out and move to somewhere better. Any thoughts and general positive comments are appreciated. Remember my father is my landlord and it is a difficult and sensitive situation. Please remain positive in your comments.

301,"23 year old guy with a college degree, working on a license, about to start working in my field, I have many friends but don't see them that often, I work out, eat alright, and I'm fit. But I failed completely with relationships and sex. I have only had bad dating experiences and have only gotten as far as kissing girls. Those bad experiences really messed me up, I was lead on, made the back up guy many times, lied to, got yelled at for walking away from their shitty treatment, was rejected for being a bad kisser, had to watch a girl I dated who treated me like crap end up with my now ex friend and I will be seeing her again soon when I start working. We wont be working together and she isn't working for my company but I will easily run into her from time to time.

Regardless of all of that I missed out on the college experience and relationships with college girls. I always wanted a relationship more than anything, I knew sex would come after a relationship anyways so I did want it but not as much. I don't really care about ""making up for it later"" because I'm older now. I'm not interested in going for college girls when I'm older I always found it weird when I hear guys do that but I also don't want to move on to older women. There is no making up time for things that you can't do anymore, college is over for me. Whatever relationship I could have had in college will never be the same as whatever I could have now. I can never be anyone's first anything, not just sex I mean boyfriend or anything like that, I wont be special, I wont matter, all the girls I've gone on dates with never seemed to put that much effort into me so a relationship now even feels like a drag. I stay up at night thinking how I'm going to get through the rest of my life alone, I don't ever want to have anything more with a woman than a platonic relationship at this point.

I've been made fun of and looked down on for being a virgin by friends who are girls. I'm not interested in someone who is older and has a past because of that and since I missed out on the best years of my life with women. No amount of love or whatever will ever be enough to satisfy any of the things I missed or the shitty treatment I experienced. Rejection was always ok, I just took it and moved on but being lead on and made to feel stupid was the worst thing ever. Thinking I had a chance since they would always reach out to me, get jealous if I spoke to a girl, and flirt with me after we went out a few times when in reality they just wanted my attention while they were ready to do whatever they wanted with other guys was humiliating. Watching that ex friend be with that girl was the worst experience in my life, they got the time of their lives and I was backstabbed, lied to, and emasculated having to watch them be together in the way she was against with me. All despite her telling me she cared about me, that she wanted a relationship with me, and he telling me that me and her were great together and they both randomly denied feelings for the other. I can never come back from that knowing they got to be happy while I was trying not to break down seeing them together.

All I know is that life is over, its all just work and sleep from here on out. I haven't told my friends about any of this or that I've given up but I've tried to. They just keep saying I'll meet someone at work or something but its not enough for me. I don't want someone with a past or that I have to meet later on. I can never grow or build a life with someone or have experiences with them now. Its too late for all of that. My friends who have been in relationships for many years and some are already even married have it all. I would have given up everything if I meant I could have had that. I'll probably get hate for all of this but its not like anyone called out the people that treated me like crap, or made fun of me for being a virgin, or called out those two for getting together while I was always yelled at for women looking in my direction. Sorry not sorry for having my own standards but its not like anyone ever wanted me or will ever want me so its not like anyone would meet me.

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I just stay up at night thinking about all of this, how to get through the rest of my life alone while I watch everyone else building their lives with someone and never being able to have the same thing. Its too late for it now and I don't want it but I'm not sure what to do. My degree and career mean nothing to me, nothing motivates me, I just want to stop and live alone away from the world, that is the most happiness I could ever feel at this point.",16Oct2018,1

304,"Hi everyone! So here’s a bit of backstory of myself:

I (24F) have been working in the hospitality industry for about 8 years (mostly serving/FOH but also have experience in the kitchen, management, accounting, event management, and a few positions in between). I used to work for a small, fine dining restaurant as the assistant manager but it’s the kind of business that you have to wear a lot of hats at once which really rounded out my experience. Additionally, I am about to graduate from one of the best hospitality programs in the US (and in the top 10 in the world).

(A little extra info:) I really loved the old restaurant, but the owner opened another concept and long story short, I started to be taken advantage of. I was not only going above and beyond my role, but constantly doing personal favors when I wasn’t working, being called all hours of the day, and when I finally got a day off I was being called constantly to help with very minor issues (like he forgot his email password when I created a master list of all his passwords). He is a great chef and nice guy, but terrible business man. I was begging for some boundaries and it was affecting both my mental health and personal/romantic life. 

So anyway, I ended up resigning so I could focus my energy on doing well in school. I went back to serving tables at another (historic and well known) fine dining restaurant I worked at a few years ago that is easy, consistent money. 

Now the actually relevant stuff: 

About a week ago, my boyfriend who is a local musician, has a residency at another locally owned, locally sourced excellent restaurant. I frequent there, I know the owner, I love the food, it’s quaint and lovely. He mentions to me that he would love to have me be apart of the team. I think server and I thank him for kind words but wasn’t really interested in having to go through the training process. A few day later, I see him again and he tells me he would be willing to “design a program around me” because he needs someone with my background to help him get his FOH staff up to standard. He, the owner, was served a glass of wine that had water spots all over it (unacceptable and negligent, especially since he is the OWNER!) I say, let’s meet up soon and talk!

SO, tomorrow we are meeting for coffee to talk about what exactly I want/he expects.

Does anyone have any advice?! I’m fairly young and have been interviewed at least 20 times, but haven’t encountered this sort of informal situation.

My plan so far: Dress nice, but not interview nice. Bring something to write with/on. Get there early, get a table and 2 waters, pay for his coffee.

I want to mention that I think the best way for me to get a true grasp of what needs improvement and how to go about retraining staff would be to train in every FOH position. 

Any additional insight, tips, words of encouragement would be great appreciated!

307,"Throaway for no other reason than my real Reddit is very public.

I know this isn't as big as an issue as what usually get's posted here, but it's the irrationality of it all that stuns me.

I'm 18, turning 19 this month. I live in London and have had a running issue for the past few years.

I live a fairly active life, like to take care of myself, I'm very social, have recently got into a loving relationship, but I have a father who I genuinely believe doesn't want me to progress in any sort of way.

Flashback to two years ago, I was just starting Sixth Form and had taken subjects I was very interested in. I had been pretty laid back during all of secondary school but still got some pretty decent GCSE's despite partaking in all the things any normal 13-17 year old partakes in, without my father's knowledge mind you, I could never tell him, he's a deeply religious man who's always stressed out about everything and to top it off very stubborn.

That was fine back then, I went through my relationships and first experiences all in secret. I left to goto a different sixth form than the one that was at my secondary school to branch out. 

It was an absolute blast, time of my life. Kept all my friends, and made some more. Genuinely great people. Nearing the second year of sixth form - around 6 months ago - I felt the pressure of A-Levels, got off social media for a while, really knuckled down at home and studied hard. Gained a bit of weight, not too much, but enough that it was noticeable. No biggie.

I should mention also last year around December, I decided to get a part time job so I could go out and stop thrusting my hand in front of my old mans face everytime I needed some cash. In secret, again.

My dad got hip to the fact, and went. Absolutely. Ballistic. He completely went ape shit, I kept going, I told him I'm an adult, and I can do what I well please. He called me during work 20 - 30 times threatening to divorce my mum, just generally being a complete wanker. None of it phased me. I just hung up like 'lmao k'. He even locked me out of the house at one point.

My mum talked me out of the job, told me to quit. Told me it was affecting her relationship, their is no one I love more than my mum, so, I complied. Quit the very next day.

Grades finally came around, massive relief, got into university, but as I was waiting for them I gained a little more weight, I felt uncomfortable.

I decided last minute to defer my entry to university until September 2019 so I could have a year to myself to focus on my health, and travel, work, and just generally experience the world. Again, I decided this all in secret.

Fast forward to August of this year. Now here's where things get really bad. My dad found out I deferred my university course, got massively angry, tried to apply to universities for me, I got calls and emails about 'me' applying to a multitude of universities, I told all of them to ignore all attempts and that I have already got a confirmed place.

He finally calms down a month later. All throughout September I'm looking for jobs, applying everywhere for a full time position. I get a very promising gig at a restaurant for a permanent position, all kinds of benefits the whole shebang. I'm working on my health, losing weight, got myself a girlfriend who I confide in very much. Once again. All in secret.

He finds out, inevitably, takes my travel card, my phone sim card, which I can't do anything about. He paid for them, the only thing I have is my phone. 

Now it's mid October, I'm sat at home almost everyday doing nothing. I've gained back all the weight from sadness. My old lady is trying her hardest bless her soul, but I told her I need to find a way out of this alone and that she should focus on bettering herself as a person too. 

I want to be the best version of myself I can be, but for whatever reason the old sod won't let me work, won't let me be a proactive member of society, won't even let me leave the house. 

It hurts me so much when my friends ask me to go out to do something, or I see them out and about having fun, and I'm stuck at home sulking listening to Knights of Cydonia, and Playboi Carti - odd mixture I know -.

I've tried talking to him man to man, even had conversations with his business partners who sided with me, but to no avail. They literally sat there looked at him and said OP's dad, what is your son actually doing wrong? To which he did not reply.

Their aren't any parts of this I'm hiding, I work hard, I don't drink at all, I don't smoke, don't do drugs. I like to read, make films, appreciate art. I'd say I'm an okay chap. I just don't understand why my dad doesn't like me.

I appreciate any help.",16Oct2018,1
308,"I’m living away from my parents, with my friend and her family as my host family until December. Currently in 10th (I think, we don’t use that system here sorry) grade and moved to a very different and harder schooling system. For the first half of being here, it was alright. Manageable, but challenging. 

I don’t know what it is about this week but suddenly I’m wracked with overwhelming stress. I have a couple things piled on me right now, and while I’ve never been the type to be able to reach out for help and take advice, I’m desperate and I feel more isolated than ever in the feeling that I can’t ask for help. 

But that’s a long term problem that I have to work on, I have a more important immediate problem that currently has had me on the verge of tears for like, a good two hours. 

So, here’s the thing, my school year in this exchange school is a year of preparation for two years of big exams. Enter my current predicament, I have a maths presentation task that I was given today, which I don’t understand and can’t do due to the type of work I did (not to mention me and my partner were given the hardest task to present on). I can’t reach out to my partner now for some reason, and I have no clue what to do. Completely, utterly stuck, and responsibilities are calling me downstairs, but I feel like crying just typing this.

TLDR: way in over my head with a maths presentation due tomorrow, feeling isolated and can’t reach out for help, need advice pretty much as soon as possible. 

Any advice is appreciated. ",16Oct2018,1
309,"In 8th and 9th grade I was bullied every day. So I decided to switch schools so I could go to a better one that was in a different district.  My parents risked a lot to send me here and now I'm at a new school. Its... eh. I have more friends but people are still mean to me even though I don't know most of them. What bothers me more is that the teachers hear them literally telling me to ""shut the fuck up"" from across the room. Everyone laughs and the teacher doesn't give 2 shits. And I don't want to tell anyone because part of the reason I was bullied is because I was a ""snitch"" even though I didn't. And I don't want to tell my parents because they risked to much to send me here and it would devastate them. 

[Sidenote] the people who bully me are really popular and that seems to be a factor in why the teachers don't care. Should I tell anyone and how should I tell them?

310,"I started working at this company about a month an a half ago, so I’m still a new hire. This gay dude has been sexually harassing me since week two, which not being gay I’ve just brushed it off because most of it was funny, however it’s turned in to something more dark. He most recently started making jokes about shooting up the office and me specifically for being insensitive, but when asking him if he was being serious I couldn’t get a straight answer of yes or no, more so “That’s what happens when you’re an asshole”. He got rather detailed on what was going to happen, and noted that shootings happen when people are insensitive dicks, which I’m not. I’ve already contacted HR and they’re doing an investigation, any advice on how I should proceed? We’re already short staffed, and everyone’s friends with the dude, so I’m not sure how to approach getting back without looking like an asshole.

312,"My boyfriend and I have been through a lot already and we have been together just shy of a year.  In the beginning of our relationship I was in an accident and was on bedrest for months.  He visited me everyday and did his best to make sure I wasn't feeling like shit all the time.  He helped me a lot during that time and I feel like I will spend the rest of my life paying him back for it.  
Since then, I have been having more medical problems (issues since I was young) and have been in the hospital 5-6 times in the past 7 months.  He always gets upset with me every time I call him to tell him I am back in the hospital. 
I suffer from seizures and have been having them at work, so coworkers feel they have no choice but to contact EMS. 
This last time being in the hospital, they decided to keep me overnight for more extensive testing.  (Also, I am 15 weeks pregnant so they didn't feel safe sending me home.)
This absolutely infuriated my boyfriend.  He had the day off and wanted to go for dinner and a movie but now I was ruining his plans. 
He expressed his frustrations to me and I apologized but he denied it.  He asked me to put myself in his shoes.
I asked him to do the same for me and he said no, that he couldn't.  
He said he is tired of taking care of me as if I am a child and is angry that I don't take better care of myself.  
I said it isn't my fault I am in the hospital and he says ""You are here because you are stupid.""
I have no idea how to talk to him without him blowing up at me and blaming me for everything he can think of.
He says I am selfish, inconsiderate, an ungrateful bitch, and most of all, an asshole.  He says I don't give him enough while he is constantly taking care of me.
I told him if he wants to break up, if he wants me to leave, I will.  But this only made him more angry. 
I simply have no idea how to approach this situation because anything I say or do only makes him more upset.  

I care about him immensely, so it absolutely kills me to think that I am not making him happy.  He wants this relationship to work and for me to do better and I want that as well, I just don't know where to start. 

How do I rationalize with him?  How do I communicate my feelings without it seeming like I'm ""attacking"" him and dismissing all he's done for me?",16Oct2018,1
313,"Buckle up, it's a long boring story.

I (22F) just moved from my home state 500 miles away to be with my boyfriend (22m) while he goes to grad school. We've been dating for 4 years so I didn't think it was that crazy. The problem is that, now that I'm here, I'm really unhappy.

 I've been here for about a month but from the beginning I've felt sort of trivial, like I moved in because he didn't want to be lonely. I kind of feel like just a roommate. We've talked about how I've been feeling and he's promised to pay more attention to me, but it just feels like too little too late. We have nothing in common except that we both like video games, he doesn't even laugh at my jokes because he's in a ""work mindset"", and I'm funny guys, seriously. He's just a really serious science type guy and I'm a goofy country girl. The spark is kinda gone from our relationship and I'd honestly be relieved if he found a nice science girl at his school to cheat on me with. 

I don't want to be here working boring city jobs, I'd rather be back in the country training horses and ruining my knees before I turn 40. 

I miss my family a lot. I miss my dogs. I cry almost every day driving home from work and even just typing the word home makes me tear up. This isn't my first time away from home. I went to boarding school and college, but this feels different. I feel like I'm missing out on life by being here and working two jobs that I'm not really crazy about. 

Basically, I want to move back home, but I hate my stupid little hometown with it's small town racism and dead-end lifestyle. I have no friends in my home town and everyon my age movesout th first chance they get. But I also don't want to break this guys heart because even if I don't want to suck his dick like I used to, I still care about his feelings. I'm also ridiculously stubborn and I don't want to run away from something if I'm scared, but I don't think I'm scared, just done and very very tired.

315,"  

I’m the youngest of 4 kids and lately It’s becoming very apparent that my sisters and I are very different people. For some reason they need a man to make them feel complete. I on the other hand am a 28 year old (soon to be 29) single gay man and believe that you’re already ‘complete’ without a partner. Sure it would be nice to have a guy in my life to share with, but I don’t/won’t get depressed if I don’t find him. I rather be alone than be with a guy who is mentally disturbed. 

My sisters are always in relationships with men who can’t provide for them, their kids or even themselves or were/are  very dominant, so they couldn’t voice their real opinions about something. And  even if they know the guy is a loser or is dangerous they stand by him. The damage that it will do to their kids saddens me.  Growing up we didn’t had a happy upbringing. Our parents were physically and mentally abusive. So I’m not surprised that we’re damaged goods.  We didn’t have control of our lives when we were kids, but we do now…as adults.  I can’t fathom that they can’t see that history is repeating itself. 

Lately I express my frustrations more and more and they are not happy about it.  Because of no poker face they also can see it in my expressions.  I get that they need to live their own lives, but I think they’re selfish and not self-aware. I’ve tried to talk  to them about it one-on-one in a calmly matter, but every time it gets heated, on both sides. When I’m with them I don’t like myself. I become angry and bitter.  There are times that I think to myself to just cut ties with them. At the cost of never seeing my nieces and nephews again…but for now I’m not sure. 

What would you do or think about this?

322,"This all started at a house party I was invited to by the man I had a crush on at the time (now my boyfriend). My brother was at this party as well, since “my crush” was actually his friend. His friends and cousins were also at this party. 

I was introduced to all his friends and his cousin (who came with his girlfriend, who I was also introduced to). I spent some time talking to her, especially considering she was the only other female at the party. During the night she had a little to much to drink, so her boyfriend (my crush’s cousin) took her upstairs to sleep in one of the bedrooms. 

I had very brief conversations with her boyfriend prior, asking about there relationship and complementing how cute they were together.

So here is where things take a turn. It’s late in the night, and we’re playing beer pong. On teams on two, my crush and his friend on one side, and me and his cousin on the other. During the others team turn, I felt his cousins hand brush up against my backside. It seemed intentional but he had been drinking so I wrote it off as an accident. Then again a SECOND time it happens, this time grabbing my ass with the full intention of me noticing. I felt mortified, here  I am with my brother gone, the only female in the room, and my crush across from me. I felt panicked, but tried to keep my composure. Once again the ball goes to the other team and he grabs my ass for a THIRD time. At this point I excused myself from the game, making up an excuse that I was “feeling a bit dizzy”.

I always question should I have spoken up in that moment? I felt violated, but I was so frozen with fear to make a scene. I would be doing so in front of my crush and speaking up against his cousin. Not to forget his GF just upstairs this entire time. After I excused myself and sat on the couch, they decided to end the game. He looks at me with dead eye contact and winks at me and looks over to the bedroom ( I can only assume he was insinuating for me to come with him).  I felt sick to my stomach. I asked my crush if there was somewhere I could lay down in private, and once alone I confided in him about his cousins actions. He insisted this was unlike his cousin, and he apologized on his behalf. They have been together for 4 years.

I never told his girlfriend, I was afraid to. Would she not believe me? Was it not my place? Or fear of my crush being upset about my actions.

This happened sometime ago and I still think about it often. I will see their pictures on social media together from time to time. If that was my boyfriend I would hope another woman would let me know. I would want to know. I don’t want to waste me time with someone like that. I feel terrible for never telling her. Did I let her down? 

So sorry for the long rant! I just needed to vent about this. I feel woman to woman I did the wrong thing, and I just can’t get over it.

My boyfriend (M27) and I (F23) have had the plan to move to Spain ever since we started dating (2016). He had the plans for a few years and I didn't mind the adventure. I was in my second year of my bachelor degree, so he decided he would wait for me to finish my studies. Fast forward to 2018: I quit my bachelor degree. I've had some personal issues from the beginning that kept interfering with my studies and I just couldn't handle it anymore. My main focus was to get better and make a decision that gives me joy. 

I have a few options I'm considering:   
\- Work till January, start a 2-year degree majoring in something I'm passionate about, but now quite sure if I'll be able to find a job in, in Spain.               

\- Relocate now. I made such a big decision by quitting, so why not? I actually prefer moving now over moving in 2-3 years. I want to start a family at 26-27, so it'd be nice to settle, find a job before having a baby. My boyfriend has his own company and can work wherever he is, as long as he has his laptop, so we'd have a steady income and he speaks Spanish. Even if it doesn't end up being the right decision, I can go back to my home country. 

My boyfriend currently isn't a big fan of moving to Spain 'all of a sudden', but it was his dream to begin with. He prefers me studying, working and then moving. 

I'm not sure what the right decision is at the moment, but I'm trying to do some research on both my options. I also might be a little overexcited about moving to Spain. I don't usually make these big decisions, because I worry too much. I should have quit my bachelor degree years before, but I did it this year and I'm very happy about it. 

Does anyone have some advice for me? I'd like a different perspective.

324,"As evidenced by the title, my dad has been emotionally abusive towards my mother for a looonnngg time. He has a pretty predictable history of abuse, catapulting from being extremely loving and doting towards her to then being cold, distant, and mean. 

My parents have been together since middle school, and there were red flags shortly after their marriage. He has cheated multiple times on her and has not had a track record of saying nice things. In the more recent years, he has a history of saying things towards her, such as ""you're worthless"", ""fat"", and states that she has no value because she was a stay at home mom and doesn't contribute to their finances.

I don't think my dad is a terrible human being. He can be one of the most generous men I know and has always been a good dad to me and my siblings. That's the funny part of his abuse; he rarely lets my brothers or I see that side of abuse. I've witnessed it once or twice. Most times, my mom calls me crying or upset about something he's said, which he either vehemently denies or tells me it's not my concern. Additionally, my dad had a TERRIBLE childhood. He grew up in an orphanage overseas and was adopted when he was 12. He didn't know English or American culture at all and was consistently bullied all throughout his early adulthood. I know some of that trauma plays into this vicious cycle.

I also dont see the whole side of the picture. I really get a lot of it from my moms point of view because my dad tries to hide it. I know it happens though because I've witnessed it several times and my younger brother said he saw it more often when my older brother and I left for college. So I dont want to automatically assume anyone is the bad guy here.

Basically, my brothers and I are at a loss of how to help. We've tried to encourage my mom to separate or divorce our dad (even though we love them both) as it's not healthy for either of them to live this way.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Edit: My fiance absolutely has to work Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, if she didn't this wouldn't even be an issue\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the Army, and with holiday leave for Christmas coming up, I have a problem on my hands. My fiance and mine's plan was originally for me to fly up to see her at the start of the leave, and then the day after Christmas fly down and spend the remainder of the leave visiting my parents at their house. This was all fine and dandy until I told my parents about our plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother immediately flew into a rage, talking about how unfair and how hurtful it is that I'm going to be spending Christmas day with ""some girl"" instead of my family (backstory: I've been with my fiance for almost 2 years now). I was treated to continued phrases like ""you're breaking my heart"" and ""do you know how rude and hurtful that is to me and the rest of your family?"".  

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't the first time my mother has gotten upset at the thought of me being gone. When I was 19, I tried to move out. When I told my mom, she flat out refused. When I informed her that she couldn't tell me where/when I could go, she turned to emotional warfare, something she's very used to doing. She again used phrases like ""If you move out, it will break my heart"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the advice I'm asking for is, how do I get my mother to realize that she has to let me strike out on my own and live my own life, without creating undue pain? I know that you're supposed to prioritize your spouse (we're not married yet, maybe that's the problem?) over your parents, but it seems like no matter what I do, I hurt somebody. If I go with the original plan, I hurt and alienate my mother. If I go with my family's suggestion to effectively swap the trip and go see them first, I hurt my fiance by taking away time we had already planned on having together. I don't want to hurt or anger either of them, I love them both very much.

She bought him a phone and iTunes cards that she had to send in Africa because he worked at some sort of oil industry in the ocean. I don’t know how but she found out who the real man was and then she met the scammer that actually lived in Detroit and was far from what the photos showed.

She never listened to when I told her that this person didn’t speak English fluently and made many grammar mistakes until she saw him. Now she’s talking to someone else who is pretending to be a surgeon who has a kid and wants to marry her.

She asked me to add her to my bank account, but I declined saying that I have a college bank account and I can’t add anyone else(I don’t know if that’s true or not but she bought it). The reason she wanted me to add her is so that he could send her money. She also lies a lot so she said she met with him before, but I am 95% sure she has not due to the link I will provide. [Her future husband](http://scamhatersutd.blogspot.com/2017/08/larry-chambers-fake-contractor.html?m=1) is also a contractor and has done this scam many times.

I can't focus for more than 5 minutes. I've strongly considered it to be ADD, or ADHD or whatever, but when I raise it with my mum she just says I'm too smart to have it... I don't think thats how it works.

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked all over for advice, and haven't found any that would work. Maybe you guys have some?

&amp;#x200B;

I try and set myself targets, but have become numb to not meeting them to the point that I don't even care, even though I do, if that makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it would be helpful if I could study with somebody, but I live in the middle of nowhere, a good 45 minute drive from any of my friends, and I'm too young to drive myself. I've tried to find discord groups that have other people studying, but I guess most people see discord as a distraction.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I've tried turning off electronic devices, unplugging from WiFi etc, but my brain just finds other ways to procrastinate.",16Oct2018,1
336,"This girl and I have been cool for a while and text or video chat on snapchat pretty often. Now she and I kind of had a night together planned but she has been telling me she was feeling bad for her friend, That her friend wasn't the most attractive girl but she is really sweet and hoping I had a friend who could keep her company. So I asked one of my shy friends who's not that good with women and he accepted. My girl chose Taco Bell as the place we would eat. Everything was fine at this point, our friends was having conversations and we were enjoying ourselves. Then we all stayed at my house and that's where things went wrong. 

&amp;nbsp;

When we were about to go to bed both the girls left to go to the bathroom. Mine came out pretty fast and led me away to my room saying goodnight to my friend. We got to the point where I was about to go down on her; then I caught a very bad whiff. (I know this is where I should have said something but I felt like it would be so shitty to say) I just slid past her legs and kissed around her body. She enjoyed this calling me a tease and flipped me over basically starting everything off. As things went on the smell got stronger and stronger and other things started going wrong. She was rolling her eye and her face looked all contorted, her lips was pooched out, open, and stuck in the top right. And she sounded like a caveman huffing. I asked if she was okay and she responded that it was so good so I kept going until the bed was smelling way too bad for me.

&amp;nbsp;

We get up and she asks for it from the back and leans back on the bed. So we do doggy style and that's when her crazy animal moaning started. She also started queefing like crazy which I didn't mind. Until queefing turned into actual farting. I'm guessing it was the taco bell but she literally started farting very often and didn't seem to realize. So again I had to change positions... I picked her up in a stand and carry and put her against the wall. I was greeted with more of her weird faces. Her arms wrapped around my neck made me realized she also smelled bad. And well, she started farted again. She made out until she basically couldn't from loud moaning so I just wanted to finish. I carried her back to the bed where we did regular missionary and she ruined everything by wrapping her legs around me when I said I was about to cum. But I pulled away just in the nick of time.

&amp;nbsp;

This to me was really bad. I mean I guess it was my fault because I had my expectations way too high. I was at least happy that after it was over her cute face was back to normal and she snuggled into me with her butt. So we then went to sleep. Then she wakes me up in the morning on top of me. The bed at this point smelled horrible. She tries to grind me and I tell her I have to go to the bathroom first. I go and brush my teeth and use the bathroom. When I get back I think to myself how does she not smell any of this. I get back in bed only for it to smell even worse now and she gets back on top saying she's taking the lead. She started kissing and I felt as though her breath was bad. After a bit, she began to start drooling all over me. Like actually dripping from her mouth because she's face frozen. I tell her I'm about to cum and she starts riding me hard enough to slap our skin together, I pull her to me just as I cum again barely avoiding a creampie and she laughs as if I'm teasing her.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally that was over and we get dressed. She puts on the same panties she had on last night. Then we walk out together to see our friends in the living room. Her friend and her ask to cook for us and has shushed girl talk and gushing over there while me and my friend talk and watch TV. He and her friend didn't do anything but watch Netflix together and talk and he said they actually had a good time. So I told him what happened with us. By then they both had separate meals for us but my girl's cooking wasn't that great. I thanked her for it but it was really dry, not much flavor, had too much salt, and was also burnt. Her friends cooking which was actually very good and my friend and her seemed way closer while my girl just hugged around my neck and busted us out. ""I'm sorry if you heard us, last night"" Her friend said we were pretty loud but it wasn't bothering them. After cuddling and kissing me for the rest of the day, (Still never saw her brush her teeth), they finally went home and so did my friend after that I had to shower, wash my covers, and get air freshers for my room.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR I feel like this was a pretty bad night. I feel like maybe I should tell her; and I feel that would be extremely rude. She seemed to go home happy but I honestly did not enjoy it. I'm not trying to hurt her feelings but I don't know what to do about this.",16Oct2018,1

338,"UK based. I study at college and am in my second of year of Media. 

Since we're in college, attendance has always been an issue. A lot of people ditch class or turn up late. Myself personally am not guilty of this; I've not missed a day this year and always have been on time.

Our head of department, so to speak, has had enough. It's fair enough with rules like ""you need permission to film off-site (outside of campus) during class time"", but there's one rule that's angered us all: if you don't come onto the field trip to London, you're not allowed to film off-site at all.

Which is even worse considering our next project is filming nature documentaries.

I'm going on this trip, but I know people who aren't. It feels like blackmail. They're purposefully setting us back because people can't/won't go on a trip. Is there anything we, as a class, can do to protest against this? Is it allowed for the teachers to set us back like this?",16Oct2018,1

I have been dealing with what 3 different physicians and medical professionals have told me is ""bi-polar depressive tendencies"", and no matter what I do or what I take to try and fix it, it never helps. I have bounced from dream to dream to dream to dream, never really landing on what I really and truly want to do with my life. Right now, I currently work at a menial restaurant kitchen job that almost brings me to tears every time I wake up and realize I have to go back to work in 2, 3, 4, 5 hours whatever, and when I get a day off, its like getting released from death row until the cycle comes right back around. I have so many different things that I like to do, and so many things I want to do to better myself and the world, but it seems like every time I make any sort of significant progress in my life, something comes along, whether it be my own ""depressive tendencies"" coming back, or just something out of my control, and fucks it all up again. I feel I'm hopelessly lost, and I'm getting worried as an almost 21 year old that I'm running out of time to truly have an open book of possibilities as to what I can do with myself and my life.

342,How to stop the urge of feeling lonely?,16Oct2018,1
344," 

I need a little advice. I live in a two bedroom apartment with two others, one is my partner R, the other is a friend of ours, A. Generally things are okay, although there have been some bumps. But lately we are running into a huge issue and I have no idea how to bring this up to our roommate, A.

Essentially, my question is this: how do you tell someone nicely that you don't want to hear about a certain topic? It isn't that the topic is so much upsetting as it is just stressful and irritating to have to hear about all the goddamn time. Every time I am around A, which is fairly frequently, I have to hear VERY in detail about her money situation, how many hours she has at her job, how much spending money she will have for this week or next week or next month, and the complex maths she is doing to reach these figures. I work full time and R is disabled but works nearly full time as well. We are not rich people, but we manage to pay our bills even though we generally live from cheque to cheque. Money can be a bit of a stressful thought for us. We would much rather not think about money when we're at home and trying to relax whilst watching a movie, playing games, etc. But whenever A is there, she is chatting almost non-stop about her money and I just can't take it any more. I do not care about your money situation. I do not want to hear your complex maths that say that if you get called in two hours early, you'll have an extra whatever amount of money to spend.

Every time we try to talk to A about issues we have or problems, she cries very loudly for many hours even though we are not mean (I'm a very non-confrontational person due to a history of abuse, and she says she's crying because she feels like a bad person, not because we've upset her) and things are incredibly awkward for about a week before going back to everything being the same as it was before. So essentially, I need a VERY non-aggressive, non-blaming way to tell someone that if I have to hear about her hours and her money and her bank account and if she works another 3.8756 hours she'll have another $45.97 to spend on X thing, that I will absolutely lose my mind. I cannot do this any more. Please help.",16Oct2018,1
346,"Good afternoon,

Bare with me, please. 

I graduated high school in 2013. A few months following my graduation I moved out of my fathers house located in Va and moved in with my mother located in Md. 

I spent the last 5 years living with my mother, her boyfriend, and my older brother. 

In these 5 years I experienced a lot of downfalls i.e ruined relationships with step family, dropping out of trade school, and etc. 

In the beginning of 2018 my father invited me to move in with him to which I agreed. 

My father lives in a city about a baseball throws away from Washington DC. 

It’s been about 6 months since I’ve moved here and I regret my decision. 

I have made no friends here despite my attempts, my father travels/works a lot so I am mostly by myself, and I am not a fan of this area. 

I am not sure how to address this to my father. I feel guilty for my decision because he has bought me all new bedroom furniture and helped pay off my student loans. 

I’ve spoken to my mother about moving back in with her which she, of course, accepts. 

Basically, I just need advice on how to confront my dad about this situation. 

Any and all help is greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",16Oct2018,1

350,"I realize compared to other more serious issues on this sub this is pretty stupid. With that being said I'd still like advice.

So, I met this girl 2 years ago and we werent together but we kinda had a bit of romance together after 6 months. I thought we were just using each other but she thought it was something way worse. (note I dont use people but like we were friends with benefits, i told her that multiple times but she thought it was love or something) anyway she introduced me to her friend and then me and her stopped doing all that stuff. A year later and I'm really really close with her friend and actually have a fully romantic thing going on between us. But female friend number 1 doesn't know and female friend number 2 knows that her friend rly rly liked me at some point but doesnt know we did anything together. 

So now.. I'm with female friend 2 who i really like and she really likes me but female friend 1 would probably hate us if she found out we got together and female friend 2 would kill me if she found out I used to get together with female friend 1. They've kinda grown apart now but neither of them are happy that I'm friends with the other. They're kinda trying to stay friends but its hard. Honestly idk what to do, usually i'd say just be honest but my relationships are my business and neither of them need to know. Ontop of that they can both be pretty emotional and I feel like they'd both just enrage and hate me forever if I said the wrong thing.

I never wanted any of this, things just happened. I said to myself upon being close with the friend of the first girl I met that I wouldnt have anything with her because its too complicated, but we both rly like each other a lot and have a really good relationship. I don't wanna say bye to either of them. If they drift apart not gonna lie I wont care cause it isnt my fault they're just naturally not interested in being friends with each other.

352,"I currently have a part time job in a cafe I've been in for 3 years. It's ok. I don't like a lot of the people I work with, but I've been there long enough to be comfortable. If I ask for more hours or less hours they're really accommodating and my boss understands that uni comes first.

At the end of January I'll be moving house, so I'll have to leave this job. I won't be able to commute at all. I've been looking for other part time jobs an there's not much going. 

Today I was offered a job at a place that's opening soon. I'm not worried about the business not working out as they have several restaurants around the city. But there are a few things that put me off. 

Firstly the boss told me that they split up tips based on who's best at their jobs. This is the same thing they do at my current job but they never admit it (ie. a girl at my work gets £100 for 5 shifts because she's been there for 8 years, where as I'd get about £65 for the same shifts because I've been there for 3 years). 

Secondly, it's tray service, which I've never done before and I'm scared of. It's also later nights. (Currently the earliest I'd start is 8.30 am, latest finish is 6pm. This place is 10.30am start and 12am finish). 

I just want opinions. The tips would probably be better here, but I found the idea behind them a bit shit. Should I just take it or should I keep looking with the chance of not finding something?

I want to add substance to my life. I want to educate myself. I want to be interesting. I want to be somebody in the world and make a positive difference in life.

I also feel like it's cowardly to not want to save your people's lives, but trust me I'm conflicted enough with what I think of my country that all I have left is the risk of getting a bullet to my head over something i don't believe in, or have been forced to believe in, on the cost of what? What's going to happen next? Another 2000 of my people surviving? What I think right now is based a lot on what my father showed me. He told me and showed me a documentary of a unit that got set up with bombs and 80% of them died. I have been thinking about me jumping on a grenade, me getting a bullet to the head, me dying in front of my brothers and my brothers dying in front of me.

367,"TLDR at the bottom. 

Backstory: 
We became friends in junior high. We had some classes together and began talking and got kinda close during the 2 years in middle school. 

FF to high school. I get a boyfriend. She went behind my back to hang out with him more than once and was trying to get with him. When I found out, I stopped talking to her. 
A few short months after I missed her so much that I got over it and forgave her. We resumed our friendship, but we weren’t as close anymore. 

FF 4 years. After high school during the summer before college I came out to her and her boyfriend as being gay. She accepted me. He was pissed. He proceed to rape me one night while I was sleeping. I told her. She didn’t believe me and took his side. We stopped talking to each other. 

FF 2 more years, she gets pregnant with his kid, but ends up leaving him because of drug use around the baby. She contacts me and we become friends again. Again we weren’t as close as before, but we were there for each other. 

FF 1 more year and I’m looking for a place to live. She tells me to move in with her. So I did. During the 2 years we lived together we got closer than any person I’ve ever know. She was like my sister. We raised her son together like parents. It was the best 2 years ever. 

Then, she starts dating my ex. The one she tried to get with in high school. I begged her not to. That ex has physically, emotionally and sexually abused me for 3 years. The mere mention of his name brought me into hysteria and tears. I begged her not to see him. She didn’t care. 

That was fine, I knew the relationship wouldn’t last long because of his abusive behavior. So I told her that I wanted him to have nothing to do with me or my life.  That I didn’t want her to tell him anything. She said she wouldn’t. 

A week later I receive a message from him telling me that I am spreading lies about him and that my best friend told him about my mom, my dad and all about my life. Some of the things he said were about topics I didn’t even tell my closest family. She told him things that I never ever wanted another human to know, and she knew that. But she told him anyways. She betrayed my trust once again and it broke my heart. 

3 weeks later she called me to tell me she’s sorry and that I was “almost” right about him and that he was threatening her and her sons life after the messy breakup they went through. 

I haven’t talked to her at all not even after she left me that message. It’s been almost 2 years and I miss her so god damn much and I don’t know what to do. 

TLDR: Best friend of almost 10 years has betrayed my trust more than once, but I miss her so much and I don’t know what to do. ",16Oct2018,1
368,"So my brother got expelled from high school during his freshmen year for selling weed. Someone told on him because he was telling everyone of his friends he had weed and his not so good friend told on the teachers. He got expelled and is now going to a different high-school. 
My parents didn't really ""punish"" him as much as I really wanted him to be so he can learn a lesson. So they let him do and go wherever he wants. They even let him borrow their vehichles so he can do whatever he wants. I disagree with them but they let him. 
Fast forward 2.5 years and now he's a senior and my mom caught him with a jar of weed, two pipes, a bong, and a scale under his bed this morning. 
My just called me because she doesn't know what to do. She hid the stuff in her room. 
He is at school and gets off in a few hours. 
How should we confront him? 
He gets really aggressive and starts screaming at my mom and dad once he's confronted. 

What can we do? ",16Oct2018,1
369,"I believe that someone has moved into my grandmother's life to steal from her and from my family. 

Nobody in my family (or family friends) trusts this person, except my grandmother. Things like heirloom jewelry have started to disappear whenever this person is involved. She parades around under the guise of an aid, but is clearly slimy.

We don't live near my grandmother. We have mentioned our distrust of the aid to her on multiple occasions. I don't think we have any concrete evidence yet of theft, but the writing is on the wall. Ideally we would find a way to incriminate this scoundrel, for the sakes of justice, reparation, and prevention.

370,"This dilemma of mine started a few days ago. I was talking to my sister in her room and she confessed to me that, a few months ago, she had fooled around with a girl in her grade. As she was talking about this, she began to cry, and told me that she'd been feeling really deeply ashamed about the whole experience and that she didn't know what she was doing and that, while it felt good, it was just a very stressful experience for her overall. 

I realized that my parents had never spoken to her about sex and they probably never will. My parents are very traditional. When I started having sex, at 16, my mom went behind my back to cancel my birth control subscription bc she thought that would get me to stop. She didn't talk to me about it, or why she thought I should stop, she just did that so she's not the greatest person to be giving my sister ""the talk."" My dad definitely wouldn't either. He's just too weirded out by that. They also don't know that my sister is attracted to girls and they probably never will because they'd just freak out. 

I realize that I'm going to have to be the one to talk to her but I don't even know what to say. No one ever talked to me about sex so I don't even have a good baseline of what to say about it. I don't know what to tell her about the technical aspects of sex either. I've never had sex with a girl. I was considering showing her a diagram of the vagina and pointing out the clit to her on it but again, I'm totally totally *totally* lost. 

I really want to talk to her. Like I said, no one ever talked to me about sex and all it did was confuse me. I don't want her to feel ashamed about it and I've already told her it's a natural thing that everyone does but I would like to elaborate and properly talk to her about sex so that she isn't as confused as I was but, like I said, I have no idea what to say.

371,"This situation is so absurd that I know it sounds fake. It's not.

I moved to my current city 3 years ago for work. I love my job. The culture here is very friendly and it's normal to be good friends outside of work. Lots of socializing outside of work hours, so naturally romantic relationships tend to crop up.

About six weeks after I started work I was invited out to happy hour with my work team and a few others from around the job I hadn't met yet. My boss Jamie introduced me to her friend Eric who worked in another building on our property. Eric and I hit it off right away. A month later, at another happy hour, we spent all night talking. He ended up kissing me outside the bar, then he walked me to the train and it took about 45 minutes to get three blocks because we kept stopping to make out. 

We had our first date that week. We started dating officially shortly after. Immediately there were red flags: he was flaky. Three out of the first five dates were canceled or rescheduled by him. I'm big on communication so I told him after the third time that I was frustrated - I liked him but the flakiness was offputting. He got upset about my communication and gave me a whole spiel about how he almost fainted on the train, was ill, blah blah. I felt terrible for accusing him and let it slide. That became the running theme of our entire relationship.

When things were good they were beautiful. We had a special connection and formed an emotional bond. But it became clear quickly that he had issues with depression and anxiety. He'd often spend 2-3 days at a time on his couch in his underwear in the dark both eating junk food and smoking pot in alarming quantities. I spent ten years struggling with these same things before fighting my way out of it with therapy and medication so I thought I was doing a good thing by supporting and loving him through it. The problem though was that he had no desire to change. He was negative, often angry, and lashed out more and more as the relationship progressed. I don't think he understood his depression, and when he got down it was like he needed to find something to blame for it. Since I was the one closest to him I was the easiest to blame.

He and my boss had a friendship that was very very close. I did my best not to be suspicious or jealous. I've been in poly relationships before, so I'm usually very good at recognizing and moving passed jealousy. But more and more, I had suspicions that he was lying to me. Shadiness abounded. He'd say he was feeling anxious and needed time by himself, but then later I'd hear that he had been out at the bar with her and others. He'd tell me he was going out with her and a group but then I'd find out it was just her. 

My suspicions got the best of me and one day, about six months in, I read the texts between them while he was sleeping. What I found destroyed me. She had been trying (and succeeding!) in convincing him to break up with me. The reasoning she was giving him was that I was too open about our relationship. Although there were no rules against it and it was pretty common practice in our organization for employees of different departments to have romantic relationships she was very much against people being out about it (although she herself had had a relationship in the past with someone lower down the ladder.) In the texts he said he would break up with me when I got back from a trip home for Thanksgiving. I was gutted. When he woke up I confronted him, and rather than having a two-way dialogue about it he tore into me. Tons of personal attacks and viciousness. No, I should not have read his texts. But he was equally at fault. He lied constantly, made me feel terrible. The only way I could find out the truth was through his texts. But nothing about his wrongdoings were even acknowledged, he bulldozed me with vitriol over how horrible I was, and by the end of it I was begging him to not leave me. I don't know how he always did it, but he'd get me so twisted up and turned around. Everything that went wrong between us was my fault and it got to the point where I truly believed that. We didn't end up breaking up then he and held it over my head like he was doing me a favor.

One of the worst and most memorable instances: we went to a yankees game. The first half of the game was just him and me, then Jamie joined us along with another friend. The order of us sitting was me -&gt; eric -&gt; jamie -&gt; friend. The entire rest of the game was spent with Eric's back to me, talking to Jamie. She got up to use the restroom and I told him I felt uncomfortable because I couldn't join the conversation. I was calm and rational. He blew up. Shout-whispered to me that I ruined everything, I was the worst kind of person, everything I did was terrible. 

The relationship lasted 18 months, 17 longer than it should have. Towards the end we were breaking up every other week, meeting up to ""talk about it"", then getting back together. I walked away for the final time in August of last year. I had a bad falling out with my best friend in November, and from there I spiraled out as my depression flared up. I contacted him with heart wrenching apologies - I took the blame for everything, told him how awful I felt about being jealous and possessive. I told him I would do better, be better. We met for dinner, he told me that he was dating someone else.

I took that for what it was. I spent the next six months working hard on myself. I was mentally and physically the healthiest I'd ever been by the end of it, and in May I met a beautiful man and fell in love. Things are wonderful. 

I found out in June however that the person he's been dating is Jamie. They started dating weeks after we broke up, and now they live together. She left for another job in February, but from September through then she was working with me, looking me in the face every day, knowing that she had effectively ""stolen my boyfriend."" I came to him brokenhearted and in pain, apologizing for suspecting him of the exact thing that he had done. He saw my pain, the depth of it, and said nothing. He let me live in it. Even when I contacted him and told him I knew, he wouldn't come clean and chastised me for approaching him angrily about it. He said he didn't ""owe me anything, especially not when you come at me disrespectfully."" He then turned it on me by saying something about my personal life being unprofessional. (The guy I'm dating now also works with us.) 

This has been really long. The point of this all is, how do I stop being so angry? I'm in a wonderful relationship now with a man who treats me with love and respect. There is no gaslighting, no mind games. I'm still mentally and physically well, but since finding out about them dating I'm just so furious. I'm furious at him for how he treated me and messed with my head and wasted my time and made me feel like I'm worth less than I am. I'm furious that he didn't have the integrity to come clean when I was at my lowest. He disrespected me and disregarded me. I don't want to waste any more mental bandwidth on him but I don't know how to clear the space in my head. 

Thank you for reading this far, and thanks for any advice.

TL;DR: My ex boyfriend treated me horribly. We broke up and within weeks he started dating his best friend, who is also my boss. I was told I was crazy for not trusting him about her. I'm so angry and I need help moving on so I can enjoy how great my life is now without him.

372,"I'm 21 y/o woman and yesterday someone I had sex with about six weeks ago, B, texted me saying that someone he'd been sleeping with tested positive for gonorrhea. The only person she'd slept since her last clean test with was him, and I was the only person B had had unsafe sex with since his last clean test. So it must have come from me. 

&amp;#x200B;

In July, someone had sex with me while I was blackout drunk - I had to be told later that we'd had sex as I had no memory of it. Obviously I have no idea if he used a condom. I know I should've gotten tested afterwards but I guess I was in denial because I really just didn't and still don't want to think about it. Other than that, I've slept with five people since I last knew I was clean, three before July and two after. Of the three men before July, I used condoms with two and the other told me he was clean. The two men after July, including B, told me they were clean.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so incredibly guilty and irresponsible for putting my partners' and their partners' health at risk because of my own stupidity and immaturity. I have no idea how to tell this other man that he should be tested. We stopped seeing each other because I moved across the country for school, but I really liked him and thought we had a shot at a real relationship. I keep telling myself that if that were true, then he would accept me, gonorrhea and all, but it still feels like a shitty text to send.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't know how to respond to B's text. When we had sex, he didn't ask me until the next day (?!) if I was clean. I fucked up really badly when I said yes, I know, but I've sort of blocked the whole encounter from July from my mind till now. I feel like if I reply and tell B about it, he'll be mad at me for lying to him about knowing my status and think am trying to guilt trip him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had an STI before and don't know how to talk to people about it. I would really appreciate if anyone had any advice on how to move on from here. I know my next step is to actually get tested, but how should I reach out to this ex-partner, how can I respond to B's text, and how can I get over feeling like a total dirty trash human being?",16Oct2018,1
373,"Like the title says, I'm feeling lost and don't know where to go in life. I'll try to keep a long story short.  


To start off, I'm 24 years old, educated 5 years ago in IT (Information Technology). After being educated I felt like IT wasn't something I wanted to do in my life so I've been trying different studies and wasted 4 years with that. Currently I've been working at a warehouse for a year and it really sucks there. The supervisor is an asshole, always complaining and yelling at me and some other dude and giving us the worst tasks because we ain't his buddies like the other workers. I've deciced I wanted to go back in the IT sector and I've been searching for over a month for a job now. Unfortunately I get declined every time probably because I've been out of the sector for too long.  


The last days I'm so done with my work because I feel like it's only getting worse. Also since I can't find something else I want to try, I have for now no clue what to do/where to begin. I hoped some of you had/have familiar experiences or could give me some guidance. 

Besides all this, I'm doing personally well, I see my friends multiple times during the week, I enjoy running and I go to the gym too relax.",16Oct2018,1
374,"Something I don't really talk about is that, what I was younger, I'd planned on joining the military. My dad had always pushed be to go Air Force, but I'd actually leaned more towards Marines or Navy (more the latter as I got older). I didn't, of course; it was always ""one thing or the other getting in my way"" (in hindsight, I now realize I was just coming up with excuses).

Still, as I sit here in a nice, cushy job that actually has great benefits and good pay, I am *bored out of my fucking mind*.

There's stress with my job, mind you; deadlines, or a feeling that any little fuck-up could put your head on the chopping-block, but it's manageable. I wish I got more PTO so I could visit family more regularly (5.67 hours per two weeks, I've never worked someplace with PTO so not sure how good that's considered), but in all honesty, it's a job most people would kill for. Hell, I spent the past three years hoping to land a job *like* this.

But... I dunno. My life feels ""empty"". There's nothing satisfying about my work. I don't ""want to be the best"". It's fundraising; sure, I help bring money to non-profits, but *I'm* not doing anything special.

There's nothing ""exciting"", ""sexy"", or ""dangerous"" about my life. It's not a *bad* life, and certainly it's nice not to *constantly* be stressed about money (well, I still am right now, but only because I'm paying off debt and taking care of things I couldn't when I was broke, like having my car repaired).

But in a lot of other ways, I feel like a marshmellow. Soft, not very exciting, I just sort of ""exist"".

I'm probably just romanticizing the idea, but part of me wishes I was actually on the streets, *doing* something with my life. Like, a few months ago, this girl (who I liked, but nothing came of it) came to me for help, her boyfriend lost his shit and she needed help figuring out what to do.

I helped her with everything. I made sure she had a safe place to stay (which wound up being my place), helped her get a restraining order, went with her to pack her belongings... It was a pretty grueling few days, but I remember thinking, ""this just feels *right*"". Not about her specifically, but going through all these channels to make her feel safe, bossing people around to actually do their work (yeah, I was ""that guy"", but way too many people didn't seem to give a shit that her boyfriend was threatening her both physically and her career), the whole thing.

My roommate at the time -- who works as a cop, and also personal security for politicians -- even suggested I should do a ride-along, he thought I would be cut out for that kind of work.

But still... I don't know. I turned 30 this year, and I'm at a company I could very easily see retiring at. Most of the employees have been here for 20+ years, save for a couple of us ""kids"" in our 30's. And really, it *is* nice to have a bit of stability for once, as I never really had that growing up.

I dunno. I feel like the job I have would be perfect if, like, I were *already* married and had kids. If I was already some super driven guy outside of work, and I was just looking to ""provide"". But being where I am now -- 30, single, boring, and no prospects on the horizon -- it just seems like another facet of my life that just seems ""empty"".

What do you guys think?",16Oct2018,1

Now shes been in love with him and the first time she told him he asked me what to say because he didn’t want to hurt her and the friendship. I told him to be honest with her as thats all you can really do. So he told her (I’ve seen the messages) that she is his friend but he doesn’t like her like that. 

She fell out with him. 
She told people he was nasty to her, made a joke of her feelings and wasn’t very nice. 

Knowing this was a lie, I backed off slightly, but we still remained friends.

About 2 weeks later she tells us she is in love with him again.

They would message each other all day long (snapchat only) and of course thats fine, they are friends. This was when it became weird.

She asked other friends to message him asking what time she should come to his at and he had no clue what they where talking about. 
She would tell people she was out with him, but he would be with me/other people etc.
She would screen shot his location on Snapchat Maps and send it to people in anger if she felt he was with an ex. 
She would leave the club early and walk for 30 minutes to his house to meet him when he hadn’t asked her too, even sometimes when he wasn’t in and hadn’t spoken to her. 

One drunken night they slept together. 

We (me and him) spoke about it and he told me he regretted it. This was when he finally went to get some help with his own personal problems. 

He apologised to her and told her it shouldn’t have happened, but she continued the obsession and he finally stopped talking to her. 

Last night she spoke to us and told us that we were horrible cause we can’t see that he is nasty, and then told us shes in love with him. 

What to do? I know its not really my business, but it’s affecting my friendship with both of them. He is my best friend but the more questions that come along the more it’s annoying him. I’ve stopped talking to him about it but i know its still affecting him mentally.

380,"To give a bit of backstory (obviously) I am a 19 yr old girl from the US, I graduated High School last year. I took a gap year off for my mental health and to get some traveling in and to ""find myself"" as I had not a single clue as to what I wanted to do with my life at ALL. This gap year has now kind of turned into 2.

In this time, I have realized that traveling, languages, and social work are my passions (outside of hobbies including art, etc). I really want a career where travel is a priority, hopefully a remote teaching/translation/tutoring job, or to teach as an English teacher in many different countries, and hopefully to settle down as a permanent TEFL teacher in a foreign country (or teacher in general) at a later point in life.

I liked High School and I love learning, I graduated with a good GPA and I do want to go to school and get a degree, just not right this second. I loathe routine and \*for right now\* I know being tied down to one place for 4 years would make me very unhappy. Another reason for wanting to travel and move is that my home situation is not the best for a few reasons, and I cannot be successful in this small town that I live in... it's really weighing on my mental health right now.

My biggest hurdles are my degree (or lack thereof) and finding part time jobs that are good enough to pay rent and/or attend language courses, etc. abroad. I hope to get my degree in a European country. I simply cannot afford the costs of schooling in the US and I would much rather start later, learn a language, and graduate from a European school with little to no debt. Ideally (and I mean really, in an ideal world) right now I would be living in different countries for 3 months at a time, while tutoring people in English online. But most reputable remote sites require a degree. 

I only recently turned 19 and I realize that I have my entire life to figure out what I want to do, but at the same time I am feeling stagnant. I don't want to go to school when I don't feel financially/mentally prepared just for the sake of ""getting it out of the way"".

I'm educated, if that's beneficial or not, when doing this sort of networking.

I'm not there for the selfies or status, but simply as a different form of networking.

This is going outside my normal comfort zone, but that's partially why I'm doing this.

However, my problems are twofold:

1) How would I get the opportunity when I don't have connections to celebrities?
2) What would be legitimate ways for me to meet them, such as celeb parties etc.?
3) Is this a good form of networking?

Obviously, this sort of thing is not the thing you can do via Meetup.com or any social networking, and takes more time and research.

I would appreciate any advice and suggestions.",16Oct2018,1
385,"I just finished nursing school two months ago, and was unsure about when I was going to get a job as an RN after passing the NCLEX (which I did!) and really needed money. So I took a job at a local supermarket while I interviewed for RN positions, I got two offers and accepted one! I start in a week, and have to quit my job at the supermarket. It is minimum wage, and I started about three weeks ago. The store manager that hired me knew what my intentions were except I told him I wouldn't be getting a job as an RN for at least a few months, not just one. How do i quit and who do I talk to? I have a different department manager than the guy who hired me. I don't even know what to say, I'm sure they are going to wonder why a registered nurse is working in a supermarket making $9 an hour lol.",16Oct2018,1

Sorry for the bad spelling i wrote this during a anxiety attack

I've been on my own since I was 15 because my home life wasn't stable or healthy. I was homeless multiple times before I finally ran away for the final time. I've kept in contact with her for the past four years, in that time she has become homeless and has gone back to heroin.

A little background on what she did to me as a child when I lived with her. She used the money I got from an injury when I was a baby for heroin. she did drugs when I was in the womb and on multiple occasions I have saved her life from overdosing and dying. 

She also put the idea of what she was doing was right and was to help me. When I finally started to do good in school and excel (7th grade) she decided to move us across the country with a couple day notice, I lost all my friends at the time and became severely depressed to the point where I dropped out of school at 14 and never left the house, until I got the courage to scrounge up some money to move back to where I previously lived. 

I've only seen her once since then and she tried to get my money for drugs when I didn't give it to her she locked the doors on the car we were in and started telling me how useless and a burden I am and how I ruined her life.

Now I live on my own and have a stable job and some goals I'm working towards.today she called me saying she's coming back and is gonna try to move in with me and won't listen to my choice in the matter and if I don't help her she will likely die on the streets or overdose. But I can't have her with me because it will ruin all I worked for the past 4 years.

TL;DR: Crazy abusive drug addict mom is trying to move back in with me and if i don't somehow help her she will likely die on the streets or overdose.",16Oct2018,1

389,"First some context. I live on my own in an apartment without a yard. I do have a small balcony. I adopted my dog, Sam, a little over two months ago, and when I'm with him, he's the perfect dog: sweet, playful, generally a good dog. He doesn't ever chew on things he's not supposed to, except for the occasional shoelace if I leave my shoes out. Overall, he's a normal, good, happy boy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first few weeks I had him, I could leave for a couple of hours, come back, and everything would be normal. I would generally find him curled up and napping somewhere before he would greet me. Then one day, I came back to him napping in what can only be described as a rubble heap of my belongings. I cleaned up the mess and spoke to him sternly, but I didn't shout. The next day, I came home to more things destroyed. That day, I ordered two pet gates that I would use to confine him to the kitchen/laundry room of my apartment, away from things he could easily destroy. Until those arrived, I was forced to put him in the laundry room with the door closed so he wouldn't destroy anything else. He didn't like that at all, and started crying whenever he was in there. He cried so loudly that I could here him at the bottom of the stairs leading to my unit. I live on the 3rd floor. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did some online research, and I started giving him a Kong cone full of frozen peanut butter right before I left for the day, in the hopes that he would begin associating being alone with this awesome treat. It worked for the most part, since he no longer cries when I leave, and he's not as apprehensive about going into what I have now dubbed his pen. I always give him plenty of toys to play with in there, he always has water, and he still gets his peanut butter Kong.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the last two days he has figured out how to dislodge one of the pet gates. Now, I've been coming home to the gate literally flipped upside down, one time with him lying in the remnants of a pair of shoes, the other with him still in his ""pen,"" but clearly able to roam free if he wanted. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's an American Staffordshire Terrier mix, is a little over a year old, and weighs about 60 lbs. I feed him twice a day, and he gets lots of exercise on walks and runs.  Right now, I'm only away (max) from 7:45 in the morning to noon, but I'm usually home sooner than that. In a month, I start a new phase at work and I'll start being away for a lot longer.

390,"Long***I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with some other girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing/giggling . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting and one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and pressed her lips together in a polite/pleasant way and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whispered excitedly to her friend the brunette girl 'eh that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table nearby  (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and it went quiet and then it went like:

Brunette: “excuse  me...excuse me” 

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here?” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) i walked over t their table and I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well just by sight and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me. She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went quiet again: 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously and politely) 

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it really pleasantly )

Me: ***ignored her because I didn’t know what to think of it***

Blonde: *watching the whole thing and smiling* “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has” (probably has a gf) (she said it out loud while looking over at me like as if she made sure I heard her idk)

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” (Pleasantly in a wanted to know way)

Me: *ignored again wiping the table looking annoyed because I didn’t know how else to act*

Blonde: laughs a bit  and says ‘aww leave it, he’s fuming now’ laughing a bit (I wasn’t fuming it was the coffee stain on the table I was wiping was not coming out lol) 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk walking out with her hand on her head and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me and went out of her way a little to say ‘byyyeee’ loudly smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

Edit: a ew hours earlier in the night I thought the blonde one had called me over to ask me something about the menu drinks etc and I went  over to her and said ‘yes can I help you’ and she was actually  calling her other friends over behind me not me they laughed as I walked away laughing too like OMG ",16Oct2018,1

When I was a teenager I thought for sure I would help people. for the past few years I've helped no one but myself. I use the fact that I was trying to survive as a crutch, quite frankly, because even though I've been through a hellish time, there is no reason I can't pick myself up and live the life I was meant to.

I don't need anything fancy. I talked to my dad two days ago, and explained to him that my dream in life is the picket fence, a wonderful family, and deep sleep with happy dreams. I want to be a man who provides. I'm perfectly happy living wherever life takes me, as long as these things happen.

Right now I live in a town on the coast of California and I'm drowning. My debt is crushing me even though it seems like such a small amount. I can't find employment. I'm stuck in a relationship that I'm afraid to admit is going nowhere, and every day seems like a struggle to get out of bed and perform basic functions. The traumas of my earlier life prevent me from doing anything of substance with my life, but I'm afraid that now, I'm just keeping myself in this cycle. I know it will eventually kill me if I don't do something to change it. My depression and anxiety get worse every day.

My girlfriend holds the fact that I can't find a decent job over my head, and to be honest, it hurts. I try, every day, to do the things that constitute a normal happy life, but the energy it seems to take is massive:I don't understand it. I don't know if everyone feels this way and I'm just weak, or if there is something irrevocably wrong with me. I don't want to be this bitter shell of a person. I feel so alone. every step that i take to fix myself is a step further in bettering my life, but the people around me don't want to take those steps too; I've been with this girl for 5 years and she is one of the meanest people I know. the fact is, I'm scared to go at it alone. I have very few friends and my family is far away. I know I have to take this leap by myself. I have to start picking up the pieces of my life.

I have a bank account and identification. I owe 900 to the state of California before I can drive again, but that's manageable. I have restaurant, office, and animal care experience but all my jobs have been sporadic and short term. My credit is horrible but I spoke to a debt consolidation expert on Sunday and he said a lot of my debts could be discharged. I'm a hard working, hard hitting, strong son of a bitch when I'm out of my rut. Day by day I've dropped the awful things in my life like drinking, I'm a month and a half sober. Finding the will to exercise is a joke, so motivation on that factor would be a boon. I need to get out of this very expensive state, and as the penguins say, ""pull myself together, man"". I don't know where to start. I need clear steps. all I know is I can't continue to sit here day in and day out making nothing of myself. Please help a man become a man, because right now, I feel like a boy.",16Oct2018,1
394,"I've lived at this apartment for almost 2 years. Single story, quiet place, good neighborhood. I'm in the end unit. 

This past weekend, a new guy moves in. I meet him, seems nice. But then he goes on to show me what he's done with the place and how he's setting it up to record music with his band. After I ask what that includes, he says drums, bass, vocals- the whole deal. Yikes.

I work remotely from home and am on call 24/7. I also take online classes. After just moving in, he had a blowout party on Sunday night. Went until 3 AM. I went over at one point to ask him to stop smoking cigs inside as the smell was in my Apt. He gets people to stop. He then tells me that he plans on having this Sunday 'get-together' weekly. I figured it was a moving in kind of party, nope.

On a final note, according to the new neighbor, my landlord knows he wanted to record and gave his blessing. I haven't verified this with my landlord.

395,"I am not sure if I am overly sensitive because of depression/anxiety and past bad experiences or if I just sense that people like to pull my leg but when I am in a social setting I tend to be paranoic of how people perceive me, if they laugh at me or talk about me. It is going to be kinda long but I want to explain it well and be sure I am not paranoic. I have no one else to talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I have been feeling pretty bad because I like this dude but I feel like he is just making fun of me all along and/or I have no chance.

We are both in last year of HS and I already knew him superficially but right now we are in class together. 

The first day of school I nodded at him and smiled during class (probably in a too evident way) which caused a obvious reaction from him and his friend. 

He smiled and started laughing and began talking to friend and glancing at me so I thought he was laughing at me and it was pretty bad. I have some form of social anxiety and a lot of negative experiences influenced a lot how I perceive things...the day afterwards both him and his friend said hi normally so I didn't think much of it.

Afterwards he said hi and we made more eye contact but sometimes he started laughing, smirking and he winked at me a couple of times but he is generally a guy who is friendly to all girls (even if he knows the girls in class well and he doesn't do this with them, he is very friendly though).

I often laugh at this jokes etc but I wasn't really sure why he started laughing/smirking or making a surprise face expression or a sudden face expression when I spoke to him. Another time I told him to download an app to lose weight (they were talking about diet plans so it wasn't random or uncalled for) and both him and his friend had a smirk on their face but they listened to my advice.

I have no idea if these are legit signs but he also stands often near me even if there is a lot of space in class and he turns to look at me if he sees me walking around (his desk is right in front of me atm and when he stands up he is often near me but it could be totally casual for all I know). He generally said hi or waved if he was me etc

A while ago he was talking to some girls behind me (he is comfortable talking to girls and being friendly, also he knows them well because they have been in the same class for 4 years) and he said something and we made eye contact for 3 seconds then he looked away smiling, I am sure he wasn't talking to me because he was talking to them from the beginning so idk, I hope because otherwise I would have accidentally ignored him…

I noticed he makes less eye contact and a couple of times he blantantly ignored me during English class while he was passing papers, he does small talks with many girls but he doesn't talk to me much even if he is often around my desk. He just laughed when he saw I was waiting to get the paper and passed it to the girl near me or another girl.

I am often confused because sometimes I find his attitude a little odd but maybe that's just the way it is. Two days ago he moved desk in French class when I sat next to him with the excuse that he couldn''t see well (it might have been true though), when I sat down he turned his head for a while and then made eye contact and changed seat (near his friend).

Today he randomly noticed me and asked to take a selfie with him while we were heading for a school reunion and I accepted but when I asked him why he wanted a pic he didn't reply, not sure if he didn't hear me or he ignored me but then he winked at me and acted just he did during the first weeks. When we went out and I saw him and his friend I said hello and he asked me about homework etc but when we were waiting for the bus (I usually take another bus in another stop but I had to take this one because I got out later than usual) he didn't say another word to me. He stood there near me, smoked, socialised with other people and sometimes he went with another group of people he knew but he mostly stood there. I stood there too in silence because I didn't know what to say... Then I got on the bus and when I got down he waved at me adamantly as he saw me walking home. I know he tends to be generally sociable and friendly with people, but he does more small talk with other girls (which he knows better though). 

&amp;#x200B;

Once teased me about something about school but since many people in that school don't like me and there is the rumour that I skip tests on purpose, I am lazy etc (this is a long story though) I cannot say why he hinted I wanted to stay at home on purpose to skip the test then apologize with an heart emoji and act clueless.

&amp;#x200B;

He tends to put his stuff on other girls' desks but I saw he purposely avoids doing that with me for some reason. Not sure why.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday he normally said hi but he doesn't really talk much to me in general (so I assume he isn't interested in getting to know me).

&amp;#x200B;

What makes me think that he is making fun of me is that he is Always laughing with some girls and I sensed they probably don't like me very much...It might be a casuality but I saw he took out his phone with the excuse of taking a pic fo the blackboard but I saw his phone was angled in a strange way (not directly towards me). He didn't move it when I turned nor he changed the angle but I suspect he might have taken a pic of me. Then he showed it to one of the girls and she laughed. There is a possibility he just took a pic randomly or he took a pic of the teacher like he did before but...I am very paranoic because some girls did this stuff to me in the past to laugh at me (I am average looking but not very photogenic, also they did it other people as well, HS is bad).

What should I do? If I see it happening again, I could confront him but now I cannot really. I fear he might have aksed for a selfie with me to laugh at me behind my back for something, I suspect it because he acts normally friendly withother girls but with me he switches from saying hi, asking for pics etc to purposely avoiding me (once he saw about to lay his stuff on my desk but he stopped himself when he saw I noticed and moved to the desk behind mine, wtf??)

&amp;#x200B;

TL; DR: A guy I have a crush on acts a little weird sometimes and I suspect he might be pulling my leg (since it already happened in the past it could happen again, people there all know each other), I don't want to seem paranoic but his behavior seems a little weird etc

&amp;#x200B;

One moment he says hi, asks me for a pic, winks at me, teases me etc, one moment he laughs to my face, ignores me etc and he doesn't talk to me very much, I have experienced similar things in the past and it was a very bad sign (actually people considered me as a laughingstock since I am anxious, lonely etc) What can I do?",16Oct2018,1

This seems to happen more on days where I am at school. I went to the doctor a while back and he couldn’t figure it out. He suggested my eating habits (I used to skip lunch), but even after fixing that, I had the headaches. He also thought it may be sleep depravation, but I was getting 7-9hrs of sleep every night. I went back and he thought it might be stress related due to advanced classes and high expectations. I didn’t really think much of it. He told me to just take Advil when I get a headache or take it in the morning if I feel like I will have a headache.

All three years of middle school I took 3 tablets of Advil every morning before realizing I am probably destroying my kidneys or liver (I can’t remember which). Most of the time this worked, but it’s not a long term solution. I’m looking for any advice on this situation as it has been getting worse and I have been resorting to Excedrine which is extremely powerful and is supposed to be used for migraines. 

I should also add that my mom seems to think it’s my lack of caffeine as I am addicted. I don’t drink coffee or anything, but I do often drink caffeinated soda. I know this may be a possibility and it’s part of the reason I’ve been taking medicine with caffeine in it. I tried to stop drinking soda, but my headaches got worse. Any help is much appreciated.

Im not sure if I'm posting this at the right subreddit but bear with me. So, studying in the college. I used to be very social, had lots of friends and I enjoyed hanging out with them big time. Two years ago I started working in a nice place however soon I just gave up on everything but work. I was just going there, my gf and I were working there (broke up year ago), I had new friends there and we were like a family. I even forgot about college. Job was sales and I became excellent salesperson, making lot more than average. As I had a financial situation well, I just did lots of stuff people of my age can't do. Things changed this year when I got expelled from the college and had to change it to a different one. I left work and hoped to get back to social life. As you may already guessed none of the work friends turned out to be real friends but I couldn't care less because I thought I was same social guy again. New college is terrific, but I just discovered that I can't talk to people. Small talk bores me or I don't know what to talk about. My best friend thinks that I just became way too arrogant for college people to hang out with and that's why I complain that I got antisocial. IDK if its true. I feel like guy who just got out from the prison and struggles to develop social contact.

400,"I just left a project early and at a financial loss thanks to a sexist, unhelpful, disrespectful, and pathological liar of a project manager who thought it was perfectly okay to whip my car door open right after I tried closing it to leave during an intense disagreement, in an area that was WAY more conservative than I've ever experienced, and drove 1600+ miles to the state I was previously in simply because I didn't know where else to go and haven't liked many of the other states I've been. Back to almost nothing except a few okay friends. The project also nearly ruined my main hobby for me and is leading me to changing my career path entirely, to what I don't even know yet. Completely shifting my career path back to nothing but a hobby/unpaid interest and removing the social aspect from it except for a few friends is going to be a huge paradigm shift and transformation for my life.

402,"Before I get started, it might help to provide some context. I’m 21 years old, live with my parents and siblings, and have been unemployed since July. Since then, I’ve had a habit of smoking weed almost every day. To be honest with myself, I do it to try and stave off my depression, in place of my antidepressant prescription which ran out earlier this year, and I haven’t refilled it or been to a doctor since. I’ve been too anxious to go the doctor’s by myself, doubly so because I don’t even know who my doctor is or where the office is since I was aged out of my pediatrician's office (also why my prescription stopped being refilled). I’ve also been too timid to ask one of my parents to come with me. I know I smoke too much, and I haven’t made as much progress as I should have already in getting back to school (graduated community college shortly before I quit my job and haven’t applied to any universities). I try and contribute around the house so I’m not just a bum, like by doing dishes and laundry and buying groceries sometimes. For myself, I’ve tried to dedicate myself to playing my guitar, writing, and even doodling around with a video game engine on my computer. I still often feel guilty about myself, though. I don’t drink nearly as often as I smoke, because a lot of people in my family have a hard time controlling themselves when they drink. I haven’t had any outbursts or serious mishaps all the times that I’ve drank, but I can’t help but feel like I’m tempting fate just saying that.

Last night, I had a bit of an oopsie. I was feeling a little bummed out (it happens), but I didn’t have anymore weed. I did, however, have a handle of vodka in the freezer I got as a gift for helping out a family member the other day. I know that turning to alcohol to cope with sadness is a huge mistake, and for a little while I told myself I would just ride it out like a normal person, and not turn to any substances. I gave in, though, and had four shots within a half hour. For a little while, it worked. I was content, sitting in my kitchen, eating pizza rolls. I even had a beer to go with them. Afterwards, I went to the bathroom. On my way out, I stumbled and fell into the tub, bringing the shower curtain down with me. I was unhurt physically, but deeply embarrassed with myself. I’m better than getting myself falling-down drunk on a Monday night and messing up my bathroom, aren’t I? The rod was still in one piece, and I tried to put it back in place when I got up. I couldn’t. I felt ashamed and angry at myself for letting this happen, being unable to fix it, and for inconveniencing the next person who would want to take a shower. I also didn’t want anyone thinking that I had made a mess and just walked away from it. After trying some more, I gave up and went to my room to write an apology note. I started out just apologizing for the mess, but then I wrote “I know I haven’t been good lately, maybe not even OK, but I’m trying. I wish I hadn’t done this. I wish I could be better.” Then I wrote that I hoped the reader would have a good day. I left it on top of the heap of curtains. After that, I figured I should call it a night. I went back to my room, laid down, and loudly sobbed in the dark for a little while. Then I fell asleep.

I fixed the shower rod this morning, and the note was gone. I think my dad has it, since he gets up the earliest for work. I meant what I wrote, though in hindsight I think it may have been a little intense just for knocking down a shower curtain. My dad’s still at work as I’m writing this, and I kind of hope we’re both going to pretend there was no note. I also really hope no one heard me cry. I’m going to chill with the drinking for a little while, and I need to take a break from smoking anyway, so I’ll try to stop with that too while I don’t have any. Did I over-apologize? I was honest, but I still feel so weird about having left that note. I almost wish I hadn’t done it at all, but just making a mess and leaving it for someone else to clean up with no apology would have most likely made me feel even worse. Is there anything in particular I should do going forward, apart from generally getting my act together?",16Oct2018,1

405,"Just *fishing* for general advice here, as it could be a tricky situation.

A 30 gallon fish tank completely leaked out of a seal failure at the bottom of the tank.  It was sitting on a bar area, and that is all warped and expanded with water damage.  All the carpet in the living room is soaked.  To make matters worse, it sat for a few days because I was gone for the weekend.

I've been in contact with apartment management, and they had guys go over and pull up the carpet, throw out the padding, but the carpet itself is still in there, and they have fans and dehumidifiers in there.  It smells really bad.

The carpet will be thrown out, and a third party company is going to replace it.  And I guess they'll be redoing the bar area.

Because it was my fault, I'm pretty sure I'm going to get stuck with the repair bill at the end of all this.  To make matters worse, my renters insurance (Allstate) doesn't cover damage caused by fish tank leaks.

So I'm screwed and just kinda throwing this out there to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  Any options that are available to me, anything I should be on the lookout for to not get screwed over, any advice on the possibility of mold, any estimation of how much this is all going to cost?",16Oct2018,1

Neither of us has pushed anything and it's more just progressed at a natural pace. I was telling my older sister about her a couple days ago and she asked me when I was going to officially ask to be boyfriend and girlfriend. I just said it seemed like we kinda already were because of the way things have been going, along with a few conversations we've had, but now I'm not sure. This is my first real dating experience and I really don't know how these things work. 

If you're thinking I need to officially ask, what would be a good way of doing it? Like, I'm not just gonna send her a text or some shit like that. Should I take her out to a fancy dinner or maybe wait for a more intimate moment to ask? Any ideas would be awesome",16Oct2018,1
410,"My ex boyfriend ended things in April for the following reasons: crazy busy work schedule/traveling, family issues with mom, and the opening of his new business in June. We had been talking about the future before the breakup and even the possibility of having kids. A big part of the breakup was him thinking ahead and saying he would love kids, but that he would not be happy as a dad who isn’t home enough and that he can’t make the changes he needs to in order to make a family life work. After that, we ended all communication in June at my request as I wanted the space to move on.

Six months later I have lost weight, made new friends, changed my job to a happier situation, and even joined new social activities. Despite all of this progress, I still feel like something is missing—him. Also three friends have had kids in the past six months and I have started to question my previous desire to even have a family as I have seen the reality of parenthood through their eyes. I see the loss of their freedom and ability to make independent decisions and that has really given me perspective on whether I just wanted kids previously because it is what was expected of me at 30 rather than a true maternal instinct/desire. That was the sticking point in the breakup and now it wouldn’t even be a big consideration for me.

Any way, I’m the kind of person who would rather try at something than to live with regrets. However, I always see people here advise you to move on and let go. I’m afraid that without ever confronting him about a second shot that I will always wonder “what if” and never be able to completely let go.

431,"My 10 year relationship with my daughter’s father suddenly ended. Looking back there were subtle signs over the last year or so that something might be up, but he continued to mostly act like he still loved/cared about us. Whenever I found something sketchy, he’d always turn it around on me &amp; make me feel like I was the problem. A few weeks ago I caught him in a lie and we had a huge fight. It pretty much ended with him telling me I was crazy and to f*** off. 

We have a 5 year old daughter together. He has refused any contact with her since this happened. After lots of questions regarding when she could see/talk to Daddy, I finally told her we weren’t together anymore and she was rightfully devastated. She told me her heart was broken into teeny tiny pieces and she cried for a long time. She wanted to know why. 

I just don’t know what to do now. He has completely shut her out of his life. So does saying things like Daddy still loves you even though he’s not here help or hurt more? I let her leave him a voicemail but then she’s waiting for him to call or respond which he hasn’t. 

I’m so angry with him for doing this to her. Part of me wishes I could just explain that he shut her out because I don’t think he deserves to be idolized but I don’t think a 5 year old can truly understand why a parent would do that and that’s just my anger getting the best of me.

Today I went to the office because UPS left one of my packages there and I just casually asked to confirm that they had gotten that letter. They told me no, there was nothing on file that I was scheduled to move out and that I could fill out a paper now but the 60 days would start from now and I would have to pay a pro-rate for the 14 days that I would still be on the lease, but not even living in the apartment. They said I could hand in my keys on the 1st but I'd still be charged for the 14 days. Which is literally almost half a month's rent, for when I'm not even living there. 

The whole reason I'm moving out is because it's too expensive to live here and now they're pulling this BS. I have the file on my work computer where it says the ""date created"" on the letter that I wrote and I gave it to them a few days after it was written.

You might say “well just don’t bring a gift.” I’m an adult and we all know that’s a little rude.

438,"I'm a 23 year old girl who has lived with 2 brothers, 1 sister and my parents for my entire life (i'm the youngest). I love all my siblings, we have had so many good times together. My 2nd brother (the second oldest of all of us), has been so close with me since we were kids. Yeah he was older than me by about 8 years but he always loved and cared for me. He has had some struggles in Middle school with depression but in High school and College he always seemed ok. Never needed anti depressants during those times. It felt as if recently (Maybe starting 4 years ago) he has changed. 

He's been burned by a lot in life. His roommate stole money from him, he had friends abandon him, he had lots of student loans, his job was not paying enough for him to live in the house he rented with his roommates and he had some credit card debt early on which he regrets. Ever since his roommate stole his money and his trust he almost seems... Bipolar? Please remember though that his personality has changed drastically since this occurring 4 years ago. He used to be happy, didn't let things get out of hand. Now he almost seems overtly happy one day, and utterly depressed the other. Some days we ask if he's ok and he refuses to talk, others he is excited to talk. It's so dramatic each day. About 2 years into this change, he lived with us again for awhile to get back on his feet. This is where things got scary. He would seem to always focus on himself more than others... not like thats bad... but in this case it was things like saying what we watch on tv is stupid and going on a tirade about his opinion being more important than anyone elses. It belittled a lot of my family. We just wanted to express our love for something only to be shot down. He would reply he doesn't care, he isn't interested. Yet he would always want to express himself to us in great detail about what he loves and appreciates. If we talked though, he would interrupt and be basically rude about our likes. His extremely biased opinion would drive my mom up the wall since he really is EXTREMELY passionate about his beliefs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd come home from work to hear my mom crying almost every day. ""He says I don't love him"" she says. ""He says being in our home is like prison, living in squalor. He can't express himself without being demonized and making me cry"". Now yes, this does seem dramatic but again he is VERY passionate. When we disagree with him he would blow up, affecting everyone around. So you can imagine that me seeing my mother crying every single day would make me angry. I don't want her to be upset, I can see how he acts towards her. He says he hates her... that she made him the way he is. Yet everyday his emotions would blow and he would even do things like get directly in your face, throw items and shake you vigorously. He screams so loud and lively it scares our dog. He throws himself on the floor when trying to make a point. It's terrifying.

&amp;#x200B;

One day I couldn't stay silent anymore. After some dumb argument about gym intimidation, that quickly took a wrong turn, I decided to speak up and tell him how we all felt. How he interrupts us, ignores us when we speak and he scares us. He confronted me by yelling ""what's your opinion about this argument then?"" And i said ""I don't care about it"". Those words....""I don't care""... it set him off. He yells ""YOU NEVER SEEM TO CARE DO YOU? DO YOU"". Then he proceeded to grab me (I was on the couch playing the Nintendo Switch) and pull my feet toward him. He yelled ""I WANNA HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY TO MY FACE"" and i yelled get off me. He just yelled more ""DO I SCARE YOU? YOU JUST ALWAYS THINK I'M SOME KIND OF MONSTER"". I never had been so frightened of my brother in my life. He was crying and screaming to get away from him but he was so much stronger than me. My mom ran to me yelling at my brother to stop... to let go of me. He was so angry he flipped a chair over... I felt like I lost my brother. It's hard to see him the same way even now.

&amp;#x200B;

The brother who once took me to movies and lived life with happiness and joy had changed. And my parents struggling with the idea to throw their SON to the life of being homeless was terrifying. He couldn't make it out there alone... but he also can't keep this up inside our home... making everyone else scared to speak... scared to disagree or even ask how he is today. Eventually (about a year ago) he got some uphill outlooks, found a place with friends again, he started a substitute teaching license and got a job at a different store part time. He has chilled out a bit more, now that he heard from me how people felt that day... but he still is a loud talker. He also discovered himself as being gay which was difficult to admit for so long due to my dad not being very approving.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest problem now though is he didn't tell us that he had moved in with his boyfriend who he only dated for a few months... and they just broke up... He tells us he doesn't feel safe... He says he had been sexually assaulted by him once before when they dated... But he's too poor to just find a new place. He already struggles with payments on all things mentioned before. He has a friend willing to take him into her home but only on the 31st since someone is currently staying there. I'm extremely worried about having him back in this home... I don't want us to live in fear anymore...but i also want me brother to be safe and feel loved. Not be homeless and poor... he may have some form of A.D.D. or maybe even a Bipolar disorder. He claims he has so much going on in his head... and always in a hurry to get things done quickly. He looses his stuff so frequently (I.E. Keys, phone, wallet). It feels like my family is torn between loving your son no matter what and taking him in or risking someone who may have a disorder out on his own feeling unloved and pressured to survive without money or help. We don't want him to do anything risky.. like take his own life... so we deal with it. So is it worth sacrificing your family's happiness in their own home to help one family member who REALLY needs the love and support... even if he hurts us in the process?

I'm stuck. My family is stuck. I just need someone to talk to about it. Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: We don't have enough money to get him another place or help him get started with his life goals... we try to get by as well. He no longer is covered by our Insurance either... so getting medication for him (which he also doesn't believe he has a problem) is going to cost so much for us... and we can't make a grown man go to a doctor for medicine if he thinks he is ok...

439,"I'll try to make this short, we both live with our parents who both themselves have grown up being beat as children. By belt, switch, hand, hangar, hair brush etc. Same happened to us by our parents, common within black households in the ghetto unfortunately. Anyway I'm 23 and saving up to move, he is 30 and hasn't learned how to keep his dick in his pants yet. He ended up getting some piece of ghetto trash pregnant and now he has a kid, he had to move back here after not being able to continue living alone anymore. 

They used to have shared custody of the child, until the mother (Who is a drug addict) got caught selling cocaine to an undercover cop (Sure knows how to pick them right?). Now he has sole custody of his son which he wanted, but lately he's just been getting pissed at him lately over the same thing. Usually its other dumb shit like him screaming, I mean literally screaming at him for not wanting to eat certain foods or not feeling like eating. It isn't uncommon to hear ""WELL DON'T FUCKING EAT THEN STARVE"" twice a day.

Moving on, lately he has been getting beyond mad at him for peeing in his diaper instead of telling him he needs to use his little potty. So he punishes him by lightly slapping his leg or arm, sometimes harder than normal and telling him that's his consequences for not telling him while he cries. Today I hear ""Daddy, I peed in my diaper please don't hit me"" but this sack of shit does anyway which royally pissed me off. My parents are no better they just let him do whatever, and think everything is normal because they're stuck in that old mentality of beatings are necessary. 

I myself have tried talking to him twice before, and it went like this both times.

Me: You aren't going to get him to start telling you he has to go if he is scared of you. Secondly he is two years old, don't you think he forgets and it's pretty fucking stupid to expect a CHILD of all people to always do something correctly. And thirdly, you shouldn't ever be laying your hands on your own child.

Him: Nigga hes 3, he knows damn well he should tell me and there's gonna be consequences

Me: That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard you moron.

Second time goes like this.

Him: I never get any sleep, he always keeping me up, of course I'm tired, that's why I never have time to put my clothes away or get anything done nigga

Me: Wow it's almost like having a kid is an everyday responsibility, you should have thought of that before you decided to fuck anything moving. Just put him in a daycare if you don't have time.

Me: .............Um, ok? Not my fault you don't do any thinking. 

He is close to ending up like my oldest brother who shook his new born baby's cradle because it wouldn't stop crying. 

Long story short he's one of those sensitive ass trashy parents who thinks they're always right. What should I do or say to make this dumb ass realize he is wrong before this escalates and I end up calling CPS? I have never been a fan of beatings nor do I think they are necessary when you can just talk. 

TL;DR: Older sibling hits his 3 year old because he can't remember to ask to go to the bathroom, what should I say or do before it escalates to more than that?

440,"This is weird because she's also my online tutor. She's 34, and I'm 24. Last year, we used to talk every day and were really close. She was going through a miscarriage and I was one of the only students she had that wasn't criticizing her for not wanting to work. We became close friends. She started swimming in June of 2017 at the Olympic level and wants to enter into the Olympics. She is also a mother, and so she got really busy. We don't talk as much, and when we do, I'm usually the one that initiates the conversation. We exchange a few texts about how her training or tutoring is going, but then she'll end the conversation with ""I'm busy"". She never asks how I'm doing or what's going on in my life anymore. Sometimes she won't even respond and will just say ""busy"". She never texts me and when she does, its usually regarding payments for a tutoring session or if she needs something. Her texts don't seem to be angry or anything, but they're just brief and it almost seems as if she doesn't want to talk to me. I don't even know what I did wrong. I get that she is really busy, but I know for a fact that she doesn't really have much of a social life besides me and her family members and her swimming coach, so I don't understand how someone can be constantly busy. It almost feels like she's ghosting me, but is still barely talking to me just because I'm one of her clients. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, being her friend is sort of mentally and emotionally taxing because I'm constantly guessing where our friendship stands. I have this hunch that she just wants to get rid of me as soon as she can because I remind her of her miscarriage, which I can understand, but I personally don't think that it's healthy to push people away like that. I'm afraid of asking her for fear of what she might say. What do I do? ",16Oct2018,1

442,"We have two document formats for sending quotations - a quotation document and a proposal document (the colleague ""revamped"" the proposal document) 

I use the quotation document as it does not have extra jargon, is clean and straight to the point while the proposal document has unnecessary images (its freaking 26 mb in size), does not have important sections (privacy, revision history, contact info) and has unnecessary information as well that we have to continually edit out for certain projects. 

So I created the quotation and sent it over and he said to put it in the proposal format and only use the quotation for small projects. The thing is, this project is hell small so I said that to him via email (a lot of other people were cc'd), and we already have a relationship with the client so there's no need for the extra frills, and I stated the the proposal document is a pain in the ass to edit and not good. 

He then says, do it anyway and small is subjective (clearly not true as everyone will say this deal is small) 

So I do it anyway and give it to him. Then, I sent another email to him and cc'd other important people stating the issues in the proposal document - and that I will fix them as well but its good to keep note as he wants us to use this document going forth.

Cliff notes on me

*I’m very productive when what I’m doing is fun to me, and slow as hell/prone to goofing off if I’m bored

*I love fabrication, though it’s widely an “outlet” to me

*Not necessarily opposed to trade school, but as of today I’m leaning away from it

*Not in college, I would like to be but I need to get my finances straight

*I consider myself tech savvy, I’m acquainted with coding though I have no real undertakings

*Have worked food service and retail, historically not for me but I’m open to suggestion

And I guess I’m open to questions if needed.

I will figure something for myself out eventually, but if anybody can relate to me and offer sage advice I’d appreciate the heck out of it now. Thanks!",16Oct2018,1
447,"I’ll try and keep this short. I just need some help, I’ve requested counselling but where I am there’s a big waiting list. I’ve also been in touch with our local carers support network and they also have a waiting list.

He’s home now and responding well to treatment, but it’s all up in the air and uncertain right now.

Our two year old daughter is and always has been a dream, and I really need to stop being such a bitch to her. There’s no physical reactions, I just lose my temper at the smallest annoyance.

448,"I am in a spot where I am completely unmotivated and basically am wasting all my time. Just a couple of months ago I was completely different. Let me share my story.

I am a student in my final year of engineering. A couple of months ago I had to take an internship to get a credit for the university. Most of my peers just wanted to go to whichever company would accept them and be done with it, not caring whether they will learn anything valuable. I was different. I did not want to take the easy path. I was looking for a decent internship for 2 months from which I could learn something valuable since I really want to learn. But to no avail. It is not like I was rejected, I simply could not find anything that would fit the criteria(which, seriously, was not that unreasonable). In the end I had to settle for a mediocre internship, just like my friends did. 

I believe this was the tipping point, and I went from the motivated and hard-working to unmotivated and not-giving-a-damn self. It is because I have realized, that there are very little jobs that actually require you to think creatively and work on interesting things. Most of the engineering jobs are just mundane tasks that include paperwork and standardized solution designs which basically are copied over and over again. 

I have picked engineering, so I can work on something exciting. That would require me to think creatively. That I would be able to proudly say “Yeah, I have worked on that” while pointing at it. That is why I have studied hard(I was granted scholarship every semester). That is why I have started my own side-project under the university’s patronage(I would rather not disclose too much here, but it even got some local media coverage; in future, if everything goes well, it can get even bigger) - to work on something fun, gain experience and have a head start if a good job opportunity appeared. This is why I have had studied to retake my exams to get accepted to a top university. That is why I have started engneering in the first place.

And I did not have to. After high school, despite everyone was telling me that I should go to a university, I did not want to study further. I just was not interested and going there just for the sake of it was pointless. Instead, I have started programming. I have found a programmer’s job and have been working there since then(when I have started the studies, I have been working part-time). When working there, though, I have decided that programming is not what I want to do as it gets really mundane and, most importantly, does not allow to work on anything “real”. It’s just code.

Back to the present day. I am at the point where I do not know what to do with my career - whether to keep looking in the engineering field(but I have no idea of what kind of positions to look for...) or get back to programming. 

As a sidenote - there was a point where I was considering applying to a top university in the US or UK(I am from Poland). I gave up on that for two reasons: a) I cannot afford it and b) along the way I came to a conclusion that the university degree means little to nothing nowadays. 

I am considering a few options, but none of them seems like THE right thing.

One of the options I have thought about is to get back to programming, land a client from US and save up(even as a junior dev I would earn about twice as much as I do now). Then, maybe, move to a nice country somewhere in South Asia and live there for some time while working part-time. Then switch countries. Rinse and repeat. But I feel that by doing so, I would be chasing money and giving up on something that I really want to do and have spent past five years on. 

So here I am - with no goal at all. With doubts. Playing video games. Having a goal would definitely help me get over the slump, but I just cannot decide.

I realize that was a lot of text(with quite a bit of errors, probably - excuse me for that) so thanks for bearing with me. Do you have any advice? What sort of jobs should I look for? Are there any options for me to utilize both of my “skillsets”(engineering - yeah I know it is a bit general, but I feel like I only have general knowledge in that area - and programming)? I realize my situation can be country-specific so I can even consider relocating if I know I can a solid job.",16Oct2018,1

I’ve been trying to figure out what is causing a lot of my personal problems or issues, and it all comes back to the fact that I’m just a negative pessimistic person.

455,"Extra info w/ a TL;DR at bottom if you find it to be completely necessary to make your judgement on whether or not to even bother giving me advice.

Post secondary schooling is approaching rather quickly so people around me are starting to get very, very antsy and such. Booking appointments and looking for advice on how to get in on certain courses and certain schools and whatnot. The only problem for me is that some people are getting a bit too antsy with me.

I have a friend(lets refer to them as ""she"") that keeps badgering me for advice and support that I can't give them. I see her doing the same with other people except those people are giving her the help she actually needs. So if I'm not around she goes and finds those people and we both make progress on our merry way. The only thing is that we have several classes together and I have no clue where to start when it comes to shaking her off my trail so she can find her own.

My parents are the biggest problem and one that I require the most help with. The only positive effects that they have on me are the occasional bits of rehashed advice, offhand compliment on something random or something I helped them with or the random tiny favor like closing my door for me after they barge into my room out of nowhere. The negatives sort of start there with those random violations of my personal space, there is no knocking in this family unless I'm the one doing so. They tend to give me hell over anything from an off handed comment from someone in education to them thinking that I missed an opportunity when in reality I know that opportunity front to back and found that it wouldn't help me. A large number of our interactions are them acting very negatively towards me or nagging and pestering me. The remaining interactions are neutral bordering on or just straight up negative. They also yell, talk loudly, as well as speak and act strangely throughout all of these making almost every interaction I have with them negatively impact in some shape way or form.

TL;DR Certain people in my life act in a way that is very grating and negatively impact my mindset. I rely very heavily on this mindset of mine so I'd like to find ways to cut out these individuals from my life. These people are a classmate and my parents.",16Oct2018,1
457,"This post is almost too difficult for me to write about, makes me feel like shit, trying to calculate the months above since... Like wtf. Either way i'm in college, living away from home, and have had a lot of difficulty living and studying over the past few months. I also just changed uni for grad school and feel like I have little support. 

Anyway, shit's been rough, and my dad texted me a few days ago telling me he'd like to visit, and wanted to come to my city in a few weeks. I was excited and told my roommate, but then today he slipped in that a work colleague would tag along called X. X has been mentioned in convo before when i've spoken to my dad, and I know he's been doing a lot of traveling to diff countries since what happened a few months ago, perhaps as a coping mechanism... idk. Either way I know some of this involved traveling with X. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you start to get the picture, but I feel like im going through a lot, and idk if my dad is too. I can't believe he would ask me if it is OK to bring along his work friend to come see me, like igaf about her or would want to see her. It seems too inconceivable that this would even be an OK thing to bring up on your grieving kid. Maybe i'm painting a picture of a real fucked up fam situation, maybe it is, idk, but I depend on my dad for a lot. We aren't so close, but he pays for my college, food, housing, whatever, and our relationship exists in a large part around him sending me money for this and that, and we don't spend so much irl time together. I was excited to see him and show him around my new city but now I don't want to deal with the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am rambling a bit, but just trying to shed light on where i'm at, my situation. I wish I didn't have to face this question now, but I am forced to think about this because of the question my dad asked me, which is if his work friend can tag along, and that he would arrange a hotel so he doesn't have to stay in my apartment. I don't like confrontation, but I feel like I should say no, and I don't want her to come, but now that he brings this up on me the way he did idc if he comes. He tries to start off with a ""I want to visit my kid"", but it seems to me he has a mini vacay planned again and just wants to pass by. His visit would be for less than 24h btw, one day to next afternoon, and he lives a little over 400 miles away, so I can't imagine he now planned to come see me for such a short amount of time. Idk. I guess my thought was I don't want to deal, and then maybe reddit had something to add. I feel like my dad is almost taking advantage of me, idk why he even wants to come see me... Idk why I feel that way, but it seems like he thinks I don't even care if he would bring along his friend, like he thinks i'm too emotionally stupid to comprehend the situation he would put me in. Idk, I just feel like it's fucked up. Maybe someone has some shit to add, I guess my question is what to really do here, but ik it isn't so clear cut. I don't want to say something to fuck up our relationship, but i'm also in a bit of a wtf position.

Recently, his father passed and it's obviously hard for him. He's a private person (compared to me who is very much not so) and doesn't really talk about it with me. 

I asked if I could come/if he wanted me to come to the memorial. He said no because he wants to rely on his family and that's not how he wants his extended family to meet me. It did hurt when he said that. I feel selfish that I was hurt. He got frustrated that I was trying to ""wedge myself in"" to the situation. Honestly, as soon as I said it I wish I hadn't. I felt like I was putting my foot in my mouth. I've never dealt with death and grief so I'm not too sure how to act.  I'm also not sure how I fit in this regarding this time of his life I guess.. which also feels really selfish. 

He won't tell me what he is feeling, thinking, or about the things he has to do surrounding the will, burial, all the legal stuff. 

   I know I'm not entitled to knowing, it's his right to handle this however he think is best or what feels best. I don't push for information either. But, it hurts that he won't talk to me about it all because it sort of feels like he views me as someone he can't rely on.

We also have full access to each other's accounts, passwords and phones, and we have since getting married.

I have told him truthfully how I felt and we have had plenty of discussion on the subject, even discussing using dating apps and both coming to the conclusion that it was not ok and off limits since I'm not into it. I have been able to just accept that he has these kinks and I do not, and that's ok. Up until this past weekend. I had a feeling something was off. I checked his phone and found tinder and another app called wild mates, which is like tinder but for swingers and group sex. Out of curiosity, I opened both apps and they are both on a sign up page as he hasn't signed up yet. So I talked to him about it and he reassured me that he had downloaded them a long time ago to see what they were like but he didn't want to sign up, and just never removed them from his phone. He removed them right then. He didn't act defensive like he does when he is caught in a not-so-good position. He is away on business, which is a normal thing for his job, and last night he called me to tell me goodnight and catch up on what we have done that day. Immediately I could tell he was drunk. I asked him what all he had done as we hadn't talked all day, and he said just watch some Netflix. So I tell him, ""you sound drunk"" He got defensive and started raising his voice, eventually cussing at me. I ask if he is ashamed of drinking or if he was just not thinking it was pertinent when I asked what he was doing and he left it out. He said he didn't think it was pertinent. So I ask he consider it pertinent in the future when I ask, as I always tell him when I am drinking if he is gone. For some reason he got even more defensive and said ""I'll lie to you if I think you're going to fuss at me for something"". My heart sank and I hung up the phone and turned it off. I knew if I didn't do that, I would end up saying things out of hurt and spite, and he wasn't in a mood to have a good, constructive conversation anyways. I stand by that decision. Whether you agree or disagree on my reaction, those words coming from him made me think. He knows I would do much more than fuss if he had cheated. He said himself he would lie to me if it kept him out of trouble. With the dating apps, and the admission of his ability and willingness to lie to me, my mind is just spinning and I think I'm spiraling down a dark hole so is there anyone out there who can give me an outside take?

467,"I have started a new study this year in a city other than where I live. I need to commute every day for a total of over three hours and honestly, it causes me stress. That's why I need to live much closer to my university. Now I have this friend who goes to school close to my university. She's a girl, I'm a guy and we're both the same age. We've known each other since we were little kids (our parents are friends) so we know each other quite well. We actually didn't see each other often, like maybe once every two years. Up to this year that is, because we kinda reconnected and became friends when we found out we go to school so close to each other.

Now, we went on vacation together at the start of this year so we were kinda stuck together during that time. I was very very nervous beforehand but it turned out great in the end. I am totally honest when I say I've never felt so much at ease being with someone else 24/7. That's why I consider her now to be one of my all time best friends even though we don't see each other often. When we got back and we're joined by our parents we kinda jokingly spoke about how we were both gonna need a home when school would start and that we should find a place together.

Now my social anxiety joins the game. I have a terrible judgement of if someone likes me. I cannot rationalize it and think objectively about whether someone is my friend or not. To complicate matters even further, I'm actually kinda crushing on her. I can't tell if she is interested in me at all. Well, rational me can: because she invited me (first) to see if we could go look for a house together with possibly one other friend (F) of hers. We set a date to meet up sometime next week to see if it would work.

Like I said, I feel very comfortable around her and she one of the only two people I know about whom I know for sure I could stand being roommates with (the other one already moved out and he's in a different city). We're just sharing some core personality traits that makes us very compatible, I think. Absolutely not wanting to live with too many people is one of them, and generally some disinterest in more extreme social experiences (like busy parties) is another.

Help me. Is it okay to move in with someone you're crushing on? Someone with who you feel ultra confortable around in the moment, but beforehand you're unbearably nervous? Should I first figure out what our friendship is before saying yes? I'm also nervous about living together with two girls and being the only guy, not sure why but it just makes me anxious. I feel like I would be extra self-conscious on top of my normal feeling of self-consciouness in that situation. And also, how on earth do I figure out what our friendship is? I've been pretty antisocial up to two years ago and I've been learning social skills every day since but I'm not there by a long shot yet. I'm also afraid that doing this might ruin our friendship forever because I have a really hard time dealing with even the slightest rejection.

As a side note, I've been actively seeking help for this anxiety I feel (possibly complicated with mild underlying Asperger's) and I have my first appointment with a therapist in a little under a month. Should I wait until that takes off before making a decision?",16Oct2018,1

469,"TL;DR how do I cope when I'm in a city where I don't know anyone and I don't have family

My dad died 2007. My mom probably has bipolar disorder and we've always had a very bad relationship. I started cutting her out 8ish years ago. I've tried to have a relationship with her (I desperately want one), but she's incredibly manipulative and narcissistic. Finally chose back in December 2016 that I needed to stop torturing myself trying to make that relationship work. My sister cut me/the rest of the family/friends/anyone we knew mutually January 2016. Brother takes care of our mom and we haven't been close or had more than a few words since 2011. He called me up in 2015 when I was hit by a semi-truck, but other than that we're strangers. Grandparents, uncle, 2/3 aunts, and my cousins haven't really had contact with me since my dad died in 2007; the contact we have had hasn't been pleasant.

I have one aunt whom I love to death but I have a hard time talking to about my problems after living with her for a year and a half when I was going through some shit. 

Most days I'm able to cope and I go about my business, but days like today when I'm stressed out about finding work in a new city where I don't know anyone... I'm a fucking wreck. I have a couple hobbies and I go to them occasionally (will be able to go more once I actually have a job and can afford the costs). I'm already on antidepressants. I wouldn't say I'm depressed so much as (understandably) really fucking sad about my family situation right now and looking for some words of advice I guess. ",16Oct2018,1

I know I’m supposed to be motivated to “change the world,” but I feel powerless and apathetic.

471,"I need some advice. I grew up in a very conservative household and in a very conservative church that does not believe in any sexual type of relations at all. Growing up I never did anything, however when I turned 23 I had a supervisor of mine come onto me who was about 10 years older, and although we didn't have intercourse did do other things that I am now deeply ashamed of. I haven't done anything like that since and obviously never did anything like this before. I am now 30 and looking to get married in the future. How do I bring this up to my future spouse, is this something that should be brought up? Or should I just leave it in the past since I have repented for it and asked God for forgiveness. I feel like if I do bring this up to my spouse it is something that can burden a marriage. I guess I just need some spiritual guidance, I know its a unique situation, just hoping for some advice on here. Thank you. ",16Oct2018,1
472,"Hi, I'm a 21 year old college student and I currently have a problem with taking too many courses than can handle. Most of the time I'll be taking almost a full workload only to drop one or two courses half way through the semester. As a matter of fact as I am typing I just dropped my chemistry class due to stress and anxiety. This really pisses me off because I'm basically throwing money down the drain by doing this (dropping a course only to take it the next semester). I also have a bad habit of putting things off to the last minute resulting in sub-par grades (\~C) and a pretty pathetic 2.13 gpa.

I've been in college for 2 years now without taking any semester off and I feel like I'm going no where. I tried using a journal because I heard that helps but I end up forgetting to write down my progress (if I had any). I tried setting my alarm clock on my phone really early only to get up and get distracted on my phone, I tried to clean my room because of all the mess but I end up leaving it half done. I really can't stay put on one task.

Another thing is that I know you shouldn't compare yourself to others but I keep getting constantly reminded that. My Mother keeps telling me that ""Your 21 now your friends from high school should be graduating why aren't you graduating?"" or when I try to stay at the college library to actually study since I feel way more productive there she keeps saying ""Why are you staying so late there? You need to come home right now."" Like I'm an Adult yet I still feel like a fucking teenager (probably because I'm acting like one). I would like to move, however, I'm pretty financially dependent on them (I quit my part-time job just to attend college). I mean I still have like \~10k in my bank but I don't know if I should just move considering that I will need to get a new job and find someone to share the rent (not to mention where I live rent is pretty high).

 Anyways please if someone could give me advice I'd much appreciate it thanks.",16Oct2018,1
473,"Hello,

I found out my roommate was doing stuff in my room without my permission, not sure what but it is probably smoking, alcohol or even drug related (hapenned once as far as I know).
So the story how I know this is a bit long so I spare you that. We both have a 1 year contract in this room, it’s an appartment complex that I share with 2 others with shared kitchen and private sleeping room + toilet. I live in Belgium, Europe and the owner of the complex is a good familly member. I confronted her with this but she is just blatantly lieing.

She was always nice and so was I to her. Idk why she did such a thing.

How do I survive a year with her? I don’t want to be nice and say things like ""hello"", ""how was your day"", ""good morning"" because I can’t forget or forgive her for what she did.

474,"After 4 years of running, I've decided that my heart isn't into the sport anymore. I dread coming to practice everyday, which has become an awful lot like a chore, but I hate to admit it. Ive also noticed that I've been counting down the time until I don't have to do it anymore and that my mood has been consistently more negative these past few months. 

If I'm being honest with myself, I would have stopped doing track and field and done other things If it weren't for the fact that I'm naturally good at it and I have this feeling that a lot of people (including my coach) are counting on me to continue running. But I've recently come to terms with myself and realized that I can't keep doing it if I want to preserve my mental health and do things that I have been wanting to do.

I'm thinking about dropping out of the track class at the end of the semester, right before season starts. 

I've talked about this with a few of my other teammates, who seemed to be expressing similar feelings. I really want to talk to my coach about this, but she's honestly hard to approach and confide in. I'm also afraid that she already knows about my intentions and is angry at me or will try to manipulate me to stay on the team. Inevitably, the conversation will be difficult, but how do I do face her in a way that will allow me to get my point across politely but also maturely and confidently?

475,"So this guy that has seen me on the bus/around campus asked me for my number a few months ago. I told him that I was in a long term relationship and he said that he’s totally cool just being friends. So we’ve been friends/hanging out for maybe two months and the last time we hung out he asked to cuddle with me. This made me really awkward and uncomfortable, seeing that I’m in a relationship and he knows this. I said no and then later during the hangout he told me that he’s starting to develop small feelings for me. I didn’t really know what to say/do. 

So afterwards I told my boyfriend about it all and after our talk and upon my own reflection, I felt as though my male friend had crossed a line. So I texted him that and I also said that I’m not sure if it’d be best if we continued to see each other. He then responded saying he’s sorry and he actually wants to meet with me and my boyfriend because he came to the realization that he actually doesn’t have romantic feelings for me and he wants to apologize to both of us in person. I pushed back a bit more and then he said, “For someone who’s been through the phases of depression, I was hoping you would understand where I’m coming from [he’s been lonely/looking for companionship and has also been going through a rough time regarding being rejected from med schools], why I asked to cuddle, and why I always hug so tightly. I’m just trying to find any reason to hold on and our friendship was that reason for the last few weeks. But you’re right, maybe it is too late”. I don’t appreciate him using my depression as leverage, but I don’t know, am I being too harsh on him? Keep in mind that we’ve only been friends for 2 months and my boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 years. The male friend is a nice friend, but I don’t know if things are just too weird now.

484,"Hi,

I am 18M and I've had a couple of weird encounters with a friend of my girlfriends, we'll call her the 'chick'. I've known the chick for a while now and used to hang out a bit, she's a friend of mine as well because I used her for a source of information whilst I was trying to 'get in' my current girlfriend. 

The first time my girlfriend wasn't present and I was with the 'chick' and her friend. We were walking to the car to go meet up with my girlfriend and the 'chick' casually and with sleight, squeezed my bicep. I was a bit confused and blamed it on her intoxicated state but I think she noticed I obviously was uncomfortable. I didn't say anything to her cause I figured I would just get them to the car and everything would be fine.

The next time I see the 'chick' is at another party where my girlfriend is with me, girlfriend had only been drinking a little. I had come a little later to the party so the girls had already had time to drink and everything else (I was designated driver so I didn't drink, and I don't think the 'chick' was drinking either). Whilst I was with my girlfriend the girl pulls the exact same manoeuvre and I think my girlfriend noticed and gave her a bit of a death stare. The only reason I think my girlfriend left it at that was because they're close friends and I hadn't told her about the first time she did it. I'm thinking at this point ""WTF is going on"".

I'm not sure whether the next time she does it I should tell her to stop cause that would publicly embarrass her and make me look like an asshole, or thats actually not what she was doing and I look like a asshole again. I can't tell if I'm being ridiculous and this girl isn't actually touching me in a sexually aggressive way, it was just squeezing another dudes bicep seems a big of a nono for me.

She is not MY RA, but one in the same building on a different floor. We are the same age.

495," 

Hello [r/Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice), first time posting here so hopefully I get this right.

I am writing this somewhat sporadically as I have only recently come to the conclusion that my current situation is not working out. Basically looking for your thoughts/opinons and would appreciate any feedback that you have to offer.

Here we go:

I am a 20 year old student living in Vancouver, B.C. and am in my third year of attending Capilano University for business. I also graduated from Vancouver Community College in April 2018, with a Fashion Merchandising Diploma. Because I was attending both schools for my first two years, I am behind in my Business Degree, sitting around 55-60 credits out of the 120 I need to get my Bachelors degree for Business Administration at Capilano U. I realized that I do not intend to work in the fashion industry for various reasons and am mainly pursuing business as it is such a broad and seemingly practical degree to have. Also, my parents have agreed to pay for my living expenses while in University, which at this point the main reason I have stayed in school so long. Even though I do want to open my own business someday (I'll get into specifics later), I simply dread going to school and find 90% of the material boring and unappealing. This has taken a severe tole on my mental health, resulting in increasing the severity of already existing conditions ranging from anxiety, panic attacks, depression, and intense intrusive thoughts (basically my mind telling me to attack/kill myself and others). I ended up in the hospital this last April because these issues became so intense I simply could not carry on. Having since sought out counselling and support through friends/family, I have gotten somewhat better, but feel as if school is really whats weighing me down since I am only attending to please my parents.

Over the past year, I have become simply obsessed with body piercing. This has turned into me going into shops weekly over the last 6 months, getting pierced and tattooed many times, and simply learning as much as I can about the craft. After pestering the few local shops that I deem to be the best in the city (high quality jewelry, proper sterilization, and best overall skill/restraint) I landed a job working the front desk in one of these shops. I have so far created a good relationship with the piercer/studio manager and it seems that I am on my way to an apprenticeship. These apprenticeships are extremely hard to come by, especially in Vancouver with the limited amount of Association of Professional Piercers members, and I do not want to pass this opportunity up. As of now, we have agreed that I will work 3 days a week while in school and work my way up to becoming an apprentice by being the best counter staff I can be and using that as a foundation. Hard work, long hours, and devotion to the craft are the most important things when entering the body modification industry and I feel that I need to be in the shop more than 3 days a week to make this work. This, along with the fact that I have no motivation to focus on my studies are my main reasons for wanting to drop out of school. I am also considering just lightening my course load to one or two night classes and working full time next term. Once I obtain 60 credits, I can at least apply for an associates degree.

I would be making 15/hr and would most likely be working 40 paid hours a week along with unpaid overtime that is expected during apprenticeships. As for living situation, I currently live in a basement suite and have a car, but i my have to give these things up and look for cheaper options. With a rough net pay of being $2000 per month, I think i could get by with renting a bedroom at $500-700 a month plus $250-300 food costs (on the high side to be safe and food is very expensive here), $100 transit costs, $35 for health care and the rest for savings/leisure. I'd have to give my car, a 2016 Honda Fit, back to my parents since insurance costs alone are up to 350 dollars per month let alone the car payments I owe to my parents. Luckily, transit is a very viable option here, especially if I move close to a metro station. As for living with family, my parents currently live in L.A. and my extended family all live here in Vancouver (we are all Canadian born citizens). I would rather live on my own and I don't have much hope for working out a living situation with my of my aunts/uncles.

As said before, my main purpose for this post is to what this sub has to say about my possible decisions of giving up my studies to fully pursue an apprenticeship and becoming a body piercer. I am prepared to work long and hard hours while making very little money as this job has become my passion and is one of the few things that keep me going. Everyday I cannot stop thinking about being in shop working and learning everything I can. I have committed to attending a well respected course, the Fakir Intensive, in San Francisco this January to learn how to perform my first piercings under guidance of several long term members and founders of the APP, including the president himself. I am also planning on attending the annual APP conference in Las Vegas next May as a way of fully immersing myself into the industry. I see this move as a way of finally being happy for once in the past 3 years and maybe even recovering from my mental health issues by finally focusing on something I am passionate about. I understand that I will most likely have to scrape by for several years before landing a job in a successful studio, and even then possibly not making a whole lot of money. My long term goal is to open my own tattoo/piercing shop using what I learned from business school once I am ready/have the money saved.

Maybe I just needed to write this post to vent out all of my current stresses about changing my path and hopefully this was an interesting read.

498,"Hi guys. I'm always very awkward when seeking advice, but I will make it short - my undiagnosed ADHD is ruining my life. I am 23 years old, still in my undergrad while others have graduated and have been working for two years now. I'm a senior who has just switched majors after realizing that I am not good at maths and sciences - I cannot even teach myself to be. Part of the reason why is because I am so easily distracted.

&amp;#x200B;

I browse the Internet for HOURS with my heart beating insanely making me feel sick deep in my chest, knowing that I have things I need to do. I go to bed at 4 because I just move insanely slow with completing tasks. I zone out most of the time, have a very hard time in classes/following what is going on, and was a straight-A student in my two year college before I transferred to my four year - where I am struggling to keep my head above a C. I'm not just trying to blame my problems on a learning disorder - I have had one for a long time, but my parents are into all natural cures and stuff like that, so I have never been able to get help. I'm also not financially independent (pretty crippled by my parents, have a curfew, can drive but keep failing my test because I cannot parallel park), so I cannot just buy it myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to a dean at my school who told me that everyone has problems, and I should try harder. The one good thing she did do was phone in to Student Disability Services, who told me that they had a LONG waiting list and I would have to wait for them to get back in contact. I waited. They never contacted me (been 3 months). 

&amp;#x200B;

I desperately need help because I'm doing very badly in school, depressed, and honestly very suicidal. I know I have a lot of other problems going on - I honestly feel like I need to seek independence from my family and don't know where to begin - but part of what would help is being able to see SOME sort of diagnosis and be able to take steps to get the help I desperately need. How do I go about being tested for something like this when I DON'T have a family doctor (I see a pediatrician for shots and checkups because we don't have insurance)? Also, how can I survive until then? Did therapy help anyone? Anything else? I'm desperate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies in advance for the rambling. ",16Oct2018,1
499,"In 2004 I received a phone call from a man named Edward who told me that my husband, Tom, had a two year affair with his wife, Patty. It has started in 2000 and ended when Edward had discovered the affair in 2002.  Since that time, Edward had been terrorizing my husband. He would call Tom and threaten tell me about the affair, usually on important dates like our anniversary, Valentines Day, our kids birthdays, Christmas, etc.  I knew in 2000 our marriage was in crisis.  I didn’t know what was wrong specifically but we were fighting constantly.  In 2003, it started getting better and by the time the phone call came our marriage was in the best place it had ever been. We were so happy, and about to celebrate our 10 year anniversary when Edward dropped this bomb in my lap.  I could’ve gone my entire life without knowing this information.  Edward apologized for telling me, he knew it would hurt me , but he said he couldn’t let my husband ‘get away’ with this. Tom and I ended up going to counseling, working through things and staying together. FB stalking shows me Edward and Patty moved to another part of the state and are still together as well. 

Fast forward to 2014, I happened to be looking over our cell phone bill online when I noticed a reoccurring incoming phone number that i didn’t recognize on Tom’s phone.  I started looking at back phone records and found it over and over, usually once or twice a week. Always an incoming call. The phone records only went back 18 months but it was there for all 18 months. So I called the number and a woman answered. And I asked for “Patty.”  And she said “This is she.”  I cursed and told her who I was. She got really quiet. I asked her how long it had been going on this time. She said it wasn’t an affair. They hadn’t seen each other since the day they ended it in 2004. They just talked on the phone. She said it started in 2011 when her son got in some trouble with the law and she called to ask Tom for advice and help (he’s an attorney) and it just didn’t stop. She swore it wasn’t anything sexual, they just talked as friends.  I asked if Edward knew about their phone buddy situation and if he would approve. She said he didn’t know and doubted he would understand. Back to the counselor for Tom and I. 

It’s 2018 and we are in a good place again now, but one of my best friends is dealing with a cheating spouse. She calls and cries about the betrayal and it just brings everything back to the surface for me. So much so that I’m thinking of calling Edward to let him know about Patty’s phone calls to Tom for 3 years. Just like he did to me, I’ve waited years to do this. Unlike him, I did not psychologically torture his wife during these years.  But a part of me wants to hurt both of them like I have been.  I actually told Tom I was thinking of doing this.  He told me it was up to me, he didn’t want to dredge things up from the past but understood my need for revenge. Edward didn’t know it, but he actually did Tom a favor by telling me. Tom would never have told me on his own, but during those years when Edward was threatening to tell me, Tom was a mess. He had ulcers, high blood pressure, got anxiety attacks, was constantly grabbing the phone when it rang, always running ahead of us when we came back from anywhere to check the home voicemail, grabbed the mail before anyone else - just constantly on edge that Edward had tried to contact me. 

At any rate, I want to call Edward. I want to make his marriage to Patty suffer like mine did.  Is revenge sweet?  Or bittersweet?",16Oct2018,1

502,"Posting on a throwaway as my reddit username is very recognizable and some information is a tad incriminating, i'd also like to preface this by saying I love my aunt for who she is and don't want to sever ties with her completely, its really not an option as I have no other family and have only reconnected with her and in turn some of my cousins earlier this year which is a big part of why this situation is so hard for me, I'm 19 and my partner is 21 and this is our first rental home.

Earlier this year after kicking out a work friend/flatmate for breaking rules and being late on rent twice within the first month (shocking but my partner and I have learnt a lot from the experience, obviously we didn't learn enough though) I received a message from a family member asking if my aunt who is on 24hr home curfew could come stay with us as we're a lot closer to her daughters and grandchildren and at the time this seemed like a fine idea.

At the time me and my partner were recreational heavy drug users and I worked as an escort (legal in my country and fully regulated) so our household hours were already quite messy and we didn't see her being a heavier daily user as much of an issue, our only real rules were nothing was to be smoked in the house and guests aside from family were only allowed if really necessary and must go in the garage because due to my work history and personal preferences/mental health I don't like people in my home or knowing my address. 

We also only found out after she had moved in that rather than receiving cash rent for the room we would have our groceries paid for for us via fraudulent cards (which we would have to go pick up which could have been risky for us, we were assured otherwise but who really knows and on top of that it requires me and my partner to drive halfway across the city to pick up a huge amount of food after hes worked all day from 6am to 6pm)  and we would also accept free drugs to try and make it ""worth our while"". It was nice at first but now we are sober and I have left my past job and lifestyle and we are trying to fall into routine and live normal lives for people our age its an inconvenience and something we dread, on top of this our rules were pushed aside within the first few weeks under the guise that ""it was fine"" and now most mornings we have random people sleeping in our home in our extra spare room and on our couches that haven't asked permission and sometimes we haven't even met and often during the night we're woken up by people that either cant control their volume or just don't care. 

Our bills are fucking insane due to lights and heaters being on constantly and her friends freely using the utilities and shower and kitchen around the clock and we cant afford it anymore, rent is $600 a week and bills are more on top  we feel trapped and I don't want to lose my relationships with my family when i've just rebuilt them as last time I tried to bring the topic up it resulted in screaming matches and abuse and personal insults being hurled at me that left me cut for weeks after, I have no idea how to bring this up with her, when the going is good its very good but more times than not it feels like we are renting a room in our own home and no one respects us but most of these people genuinely don't see how much they're doing us in because they're so focused on the lifestyle they lead, how do I work around bringing up her needing to move out without causing a huge fight??? I feel so trapped i'm sorry for the long horrible post, thank you in advance to anyone that has anything to say, I dont know where else to go and who to ask for help ",16Oct2018,1
503,"I occasionally (2-4 times a month) get night terrors that leave me in a state of panic and often are followed by migraine.

I wake up at the sound of my own screams (or my partner waking me up because of my screaming) and am incredibly terrified and in a state of panic. But why, I have no idea.

What they have in common:
- it’s worse if my partner isn’t in bed with me
- it’s worse if I’m on my period
- my fear is always focussed at the bedroom door
- it’s usually followed by migraine
- I am in such a state of panic that it takes me a while to get back to sleep, if I can get back to sleep at all
- the only thing I can remember is the sensation of barely being able to breathe or having to scream very loud because no sound is getting out

My partner goes out on business trips every now and then and it has come so far that I’m afraid to go to sleep on my own because there’s nobody to comfort me if I wake up in panic. I’m currently lying awake while writing this.

Any ideas what I can do with this? Will a shrink help? Sleeping pills? Melatonine pills seem to make it worse.",16Oct2018,1
504,"Hi everyone,

A little background:  
The professor doesn't mark the tests himself, instead the TA (teaching assistant) does it. The TA is a graduate student and is responsible for helping us during tutorial time. 

So I royally fucked up today and now I'm feeling super guilty. I got back a math test and I was unhappy with the results. For one of the questions I ended up getting it completely wrong, then afterwards, erasing the answer and wrote in the correct answer. I went to the professor's office hours, showed him this question in an attempt to increase my grade, but he was skeptical about it. For instance, he asked me about the eraser markings and questioned why the TA did not write any feedback on the question. He told me to go to the find the TA during office hours and ask them about this question. I agreed and said I will. 

I feel like at this rate I'm going to get caught if I keep going. What should I do? I want to confess but I'm scared that I may be expelled or suspended from University. I was also thinking of dropping the course so at least I have an ""excuse"" for not speaking with the TA. If there's any other option, please me know. ",16Oct2018,1
505,"I was recently offered a full-time position, and I accepted the offer because I love the work. This is my first full-time job after college, so I was a little hesitant to negotiate my salary during the initial meeting. My manager at work has explicitly told me that they think my salary isn't reflective of the work that I'm doing, and they said they've been discussing it with some people on the executive team. 

**Reasons that my pay should be higher include:**

* It's outrageously low right now. Just, stupidly low. The average entry-level pay for my position is about $5,000-$10,000 higher than what I'm currently making. 
* The scope and quality of my work so far has far exceeded anyone's expectations. Not only have I made major contributions to my own department, I've also reached out to other departments as well and taken on some additional work. As a result, my job title has stretched a little, and I think my pay should reflect the higher-level work that I'm doing. 
* Although I technically have an entry-level title (for example, Employee Level 1), I am expected to (and DO) take on the type of work that should be reserved for higher positions (Employee Level 4). 
* I have received personal feedback from nearly every member of the leadership team, including the CEO, that they're incredibly impressed with the work that I've been doing. I'm delighted to be valued and to have my work recognized in my company, but I'm frustrated that this isn't reflected in my compensation. 

However, I know that if I'm going to get a raise, I need to be the one vying for it, so I want to schedule a meeting with the financial manager to talk about it. **I'm a little hesitant to do this because:**

* I've only been working there for about four months. I've definitely proven myself in that time, but I worry that it's not enough time to justify a raise. 
* There are tons of additional perks that I get with my job, such as free parking, flexible hours, food/drinks, generous vacation time, etc. However, these sort of feel like ""distraction"" perks to me; My company hires a lot of young people who are enchanted by these things, but these perks are not nearly as important to me as having a reasonable salary. 
* The pay structure is set in ranges. So I have a base pay, but I can also make a bonus of up to $7,000/yr, depending on how productive I am. I appreciate that my employers are willing to pay us more for productivity, but I still don't think this range captures the real scope of the work that I'm doing. 
* I'm a woman. I hate to factor this one in, but I work in a male-dominated company, and it's just a fact that the women in my company need to work twice as hard as the men do to be taken seriously. 
* I come from poverty. I'm absurdly grateful to have this opportunity, but I literally don't know anyone with a salaried/corporate position, so I'm not sure what's reasonable or what the etiquette surrounding these things might be. Although I can fully appreciate the privilege I have here, and it's worlds better than what I'm used to, I'm worried that I'm missing out on its true value because I'm just not familiar with things like this in general. 

Do you think I have enough leverage right now to ask for a raise? I want to get what I deserve—and I have the numbers and the support from a few people on the leadership team to justify a higher salary—but I'm worried that I'll be seen as greedy/pushy/unprofessional if I ask at this point.

I put it down to him being really tired because he did say he was out the night before and he had been working all that day. 

I know it’s stupid but I feel like today and yesterday (the day after we’ve had sex) he’s lost interest. I texted him on Monday and then I was the one to start the conversation again today. 

I do like him and I don’t know what to think, whether he’s just got a lot going on right now or if he only wants me for sex and honestly it’s driving me crazy, it sounds so stupid but I Snapchated him about 2 hours ago and I’ve not gotten a reply but he was online only an hour ago. 

I don’t know if I should tell him how I feel and that if he isn’t interested then we should stop because the truth is is that I don’t want to stop but I also want a bit more than just what we’re already doing. We haven’t been out on a date and we haven’t talked on the phone it’s been texting and snapchatting. He works with a few companies so he’s constantly working and gets one day off a week and on the day off he normally just crashes and sleeps all day. 

I also don’t want it to be awkward in work because we do see each other in work a lot too. 

Anyone have any advice or opinions? Please I’m going out of my mind ",16Oct2018,1
522,"Alright, so, I'm a 17 year old lad in College (I'm British), and I haven't had a decent relationship yet, nothing I'd consider serious anyway. 
The way it goes is there's a girl at college that I find quite attractive, but I have yet to talk to her. Its the level where I don't just feel attraction but I'm intrigued to learn more about her.
I don't share any classes with her, I barely even see her, but the one time I do is on the bus journey home when there are about 50 other students around.
How should I go about this?
Do I just wait for someone else?
Do I talk to her?
How?
I'm basically completely useless in this situation.",16Oct2018,1
523,"Up until I was a young adult I had many creative interests: writing, drawing, singing, playing instruments, producing music on my PC... it was something that came to me completely naturally and I would just randomly get the urge to record a song for example, so I did it.

Now I'm 25 and I've noticed that I kinda.. am not creative anymore. It's not about time, I do have enough free time. It's just.. these urges/ideas don't come anymore. I still sing, but way less than I used to. The rest I basically don't do at all anymore. I think part of it is that my interests shifted, for example I now like sports and traveling, which I never did when I was younger. But I do wish I could get creative again. For example my best friend produces music and I'm just always super impressed by his songs and kinda want to try that again as well. I'm not sure why I don't just do it. It seems like too much work now? To really get into something and learn how to do it? That didn't use to bother me but now it does. I just think it's sad that I don't 'create' anymore.

Anybody know what I'm talking about? Do I just need to force myself to draw/produce/create whatever again, since it doesn't come up naturally?",16Oct2018,1

525,"TL;DR sentence at the bottom since I think this is kind of a rant

I’m not close to moving out (15 m) but lots of people say I’m more mature than most my age, but I can’t stand my parents at all. They are both in their 50s but it’s dang near impossible for me to stand it, they are pretty serious on religion and I am a Christian but they ask questions and I would just rather keep it to myself. Not only that but they found out that I cut myself (still do during on a somewhat regular basis but I’m not in the right place) and they asked me why but never did anything about it. No reference to the school counselor, or therapy or anything like that. They did ask and as the person I am, I believe everything has a logical explanation (as such why I want I to keep my religion to myself, I don’t question it and don’t want to be asked about it) I cannot explain why I do it and they just blew me off. To add on top of this my brother who is at the utmost levels of annoyance. And it’s not a phase its his general personality he listens to music I don’t like a criticizes the music I listen too (just because I like metal, rock and heavy rock, which brings the somewhat unnatural voices and he likes to screech in my ear). He constantly try’s to act black (my entire family is white) and follows popularity which I can’t stand. This may just be a rant but I couldn’t wish for more but to move out and live on my own when I turn sixteen. My parents like to reference drugs alcohol and sex for jokes but I am awkward on all subjects. I like to keep things professional and am very literal at home at least. I feel like wanting to disappear off the grid of my parents radar would seriously hurt them but I feel like it wouldn’t matter because of the way I want to live. On top of that if I’m being honest I think they’ll be dead before I get out of college or get married if I chose to find a spouse.

TL;DR, I’m only 15 and can’t stand anyone in my family because of their personalities and how our personalities clash, and feel like it hurt to just disappear, even though they will likely be dead soon after I leave college (according to statistics and our family’s disease history). ",16Oct2018,1
526,"Long story short my dad has really bad mood swings and a really short temper. He lashes out on people especially if he has a bad day at work. He recently came home from a business trip and said that the house was dirty when it wasn’t then said that laundry had been here for weeks and literally all I said back was “it’s been there for 3 days.” Basically he lost it and started yelling at me and saying that the house would’ve been better if I wasn’t in it, better yet didn’t exist. Started also insulting me and then said he wasn’t going to pay for my classes. Blah blah blah

Like a day later I was in his bathroom because I needed to get something. He came back home because he needed to get something. And I forgot to say good morning to him and he asked me if I had said good morning to him so I said good morning like he wanted me to. He once again lost it and told me to get out, started insulting me. I accidentally dropped what I had gone in his bathroom to get and he kicked it at me and it almost hit my face because I was bending down to get it. 

Later that day I forwarded the email the school sent me saying that they’re going to drop me if I don’t pay my classes by tomorrow (currently today). He told my siblings that I should just take the semester off because he’s not paying for a thing. Then my brother talked to me about it and said that I should just apologize because “he’s the one with the money.” I went ahead and did it and then he called me back later and said that he’s only going to give me the money. Then he said that I need to go to anger management classes. 

The biggest irony is that I never was once aggressive towards him. I didn’t even yell back at him. All I did was talk back once. He used to be physically abusive and now he’s extremely verbally abusive and throws things. I really don’t want to be forced into going to anger management classes because I don’t want that attached on any of my life files. Is there anything I can do to get out of this? Note my dad has no sense of rationality and always plays the victim. He is also one of those people who are never wrong 

tl;dr my dad gets mad easily and lashes out at people we got into an argument over and now he thinks i need anger management classes ",16Oct2018,1
