0,"So both me (19M) and my SO (18F) are both completely oblivious to relationships. Both virgins, both never kissed, etc. After going on a couple dates for 2 weeks I asked her to be my girlfriend, and she said yes (to be quite honest I feel I asked way too early). It's been almost a month (since January 8), and we have yet to even kiss yet.

Fast forward to yesterday, we were cuddling and I slip out a ""I love you"", and she was surprised. She told me that it was too early to say that we truly loved each other, especially since we haven't even kissed yet. Then told me I just need to think about it a bit more.

I'm just confused now. I do love her, I think. Everything just feels natural around her: my anxiety disappears, any bad mood I'm in she damn near makes it disappear, and she's honestly the only person I can talk to about certain things. I thought those things meant I loved her. But now I don't know. Am I trying to go to fast?",04Feb2018,0

We sit together in the seminars but have lunch in groups. My group constantly claims I’m “hysterical,” need to stop overreacting, overthinking etc. I feel ignored, misunderstood and unheard. What do I do?",04Feb2018,1

When we were at the club we were talking and he looked very nervous. He ended up kissing me on the cheek. Then he kissed me on the lips. I got freaked out and ran away from him and went home. I have never dated and everything was just happening so fast and I didn't know how to feel. I feel terrible and sad for just running away and leaving him at the club like that. My friend sent me a few text messages but I can't bring myself to read them. I want to text him and apologize but I don't know what to do or say.

9,"Hey guys! So I'm 21 and I'm a freshman in college. I got into college when I was 18 but I've switched courses 2 times so far, and now I'm back to my hometown living with my parents after 3 years on my own, and academically this year is going down the drains as well so there's that.

I feel incredibly lost. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I have several interests (languages, VFX, 3D modeling and animation, literature, currently starting learning programming), but I never really pursued any of these beyond the intermediate level. I tried to start a business and work as a freelancer for a while, but it didn't get anywhere (and also it only lasted 2 weeks).

My biggest problem right now is also socially. This is hitting me amazingly hard and it's ruining my academic and off-school interests and performance. Up until this year, I never really cared much for my Uni colleagues. I would meet 2-3 people and my roommates, and that's it. For the last 3 years I never ""chased"" a particular girl, I never felt the need to meet new people, and most importantly I never felt the need to be interesting/fun. Since I was not so inserted into my class, I simply didn't care about what people thought of me.

That pretty much all changed this year as I actively tried to insert myself into the class. Now, the first impression people have of me is that I'm a pretty confident, funny guy. I tease people, I make jokes, etc. People say they like me, they start inviting me out for coffees or group lunches/dinners, etc. But eventually it gets to the point I get stuck. What the hell am I supposed to even talk about? I don't have any funny/interesting stories to tell because my life has been pretty boring, and they don't have any interests that relate to mine, so I get stuck

This year it has been especially hard regarding girls. I lost count at the amount of girls I've ""fallen in love"" with during the past 6 months. It should be around 7 by now. I've been in 3 relationships so far, all of them during my high school years, and all of them pretty short lived because I didn't want to move it forward because I found all of those girls boring. I replied to one of those ""Hey my parents just left home"" with ""Ok. So how was your day"" or something. I burned all of those 3 bridges to the ground in less than a month each.

So at 21 I have 0 experience regarding sex or a relationship that lasts longer than 2 weeks and a half. I figure that has something to do with it. As soon as a girl starts showing the slightest signs she might be interested, all my confidence and ambition goes right out the window, and I become this needy, serious, and unfunny person. I don't find any of the 6-7 girls that have done so thus far this (academic) year particularly interesting or funny; I find them cute, that's all, but they still have me thinking about them almost constantly. Oh, she did this, is she interested? Is she not interested? Did I mess it up? Why is she not interested? What should I say the next time I see her? What will she think when she finds out I have barely any experience?

Until now this has lasted about 1 month for each girl and then I suddenly lose all interest in the girl and wonder how I was ever attracted to her in the first place. And then I meet someone new (or I suddenly look at someone who has always been there with new eyes), and now she's the new ""the one"". And the loop restarts.

Has anyone been through this? Any advice? Thanks!",04Feb2018,1
10,"I worked for my father's auto shop for 3 years. Its just me and him working so it's nothing big. Anyways 3 months ago he let one of his ""friends"" stay in the office because he was homeless.

12,"so there's a kid in one of my classes who has had a thing for me for a while. I am not remotely interested.

Unfortunately he's on the spectrum and doesn't take hints easily...but I feel like shit being deliberately mean to somebody who probably gets bullied a lot anyway. He made passes at me a few years ago despite my saying I was in a relationship, and I ultimately changed classes and have avoided him ever since.
Now we're in the same class again and I just want to be left alone. I don't want to deal with another year of this. I am not interested in dating him or even being friends. I just wnt to live my life and he's not in it.

20,"Currently, the person I would have considered one of my closest friends a month ago is treating me like crap for no reason. Let's call him John. 

Starting in September, he made a lot of new friends, which is fine, but he is seriously neglecting me our other best friend, Tom. Us two supported him and listened to his every rant and problem for the past year, we were there from the start and practically inseparable, he acted like a good friend would act. Ever since john got new friends, he uses myself and Tom as back up friends when he can't hang out with the others. He won't even discuss anything with us and whenever he tells us anything personal, it's usually followed by 'I wasn't even thinking of telling you guys'. John also discusses things with his new friends in front of Tom and I, reminding us that he couldn't possibly confide and secrets with us, even though we were told everything a year ago. A month ago, he kept on sighing whenever I talked, then suddenly sprinted off down the hall away from me without  explanation, only for me to find out that he went to his other friends even though he had promised to have lunch, after a months worth of lunchtimes spent with that group. He later blamed it on me having my headphones in after 20 minutes of sighing response. It later turned into an argument where he got angry at ME for wanting to eat lunch somewhere else, while he refused to eat anywhere else than where his new friends were, and therefore I had to apologise for the whole ordeal. I often save him a seat in class or on the bus, but when I ask the same of him, he often just gives it up to one of his new friends.
John constantly reminds me of what I can't do and why I shouldn't try. Unlike all his other friends, he likes to remind me whenever I attempt to throw something or kick a ball that 'you shouldn't try, you're crap a sports' or 'don't give him the ball, he's crap a sports'. I even get insults like 'stop tapping your pen off the table, white people cant make a beat'. Someone once asked me what I wasn't good at, I replied that I could dance and John immediately interjects with the whole sports thing. I have no problem with someone pointing out my flaws, but the fact that he reminds me that I shouldn't even try and that I'll never amount to anything in sport, ever, even though he's never actually seen me play, he's only seen me try to kick a ball (something the sports I've played never involved, Swimming and basketball). 
John has become very self centred as well. When I attended a big event that was very important to me, he didn't ask about it at all at class the next day. He also seeks a lot of attention about his problems and has very VERY  strong opinions and responses to everything. John is incredibly stubborn, even when clearly wrong, especially towards me. He'll turn anything into a fight, even when proven in the wrong, he's too prideful to ever apologise.
I have an extremely busy schedule between assignments, essays and projects and I still managed to make John the best and most detailed/customised presents that Christmas and birthday, as well as me doing an entire story post at midnight on his birthday. On my birthday, I got a happy birthday text around 10am, as well as no present. I have no problem with not receiving presents, but its the fact that he is so persistent with receiving his presents and he can remember his other friends and not the one who supported him through the toughest times. Even Tom agrees that John is being very odd. 
So basically, John takes out all the crap in his life on me and Tom, while treating his new friends like royals. We get treated normally only when it suits him and he doesn't have anyone to hang out with. We had really good memories together, should I throw it away?

22,"My friend did something very stupid. He had a burn ring and he was going to burn a small amount of brush inside it. He ended up starting a grass fire and the fire department had to come out. He put people's homes in jeopardy.

The short of it is, no one was hurt, nothing was damaged, and everything was resolved. My friend just bought his house. It's on 3 acres so there was disrance between fire and neighbors. This is his first impression to his neighbors. He thinks his life is over, he doesn't know how he's going to face the world. He doesn't think he can live his life in this house.

He doesn't know how he is going to mow his lawn, be outside his house, or ever face these people again in general.

He wouldn't ever hurt himself in anyway, but he would lock himself away and never go outside. He may even go to such extremes as hiring someone to do the yard work for him. But then again he may not because he doesn't make a lot of money.

He has been in his bathroom laying on the floor ever since this happened because it is the one room he can hide and no one will know he's home. He won't do anything. He knows he needs to go to his neighbor and see about getting the lawn fixed or what he can do to help. But he doesn't know how he would ever face his neighbor. His neighbor is going to hate him whether he offers the help or not. So he just doesn't see why he should face him and figure if the guy wants compensation he'll just come by on his own.

How do I convince this guy to his life isn't over. To get off the bathroom floor, shower, shave, eat, do anything.

-----

**below is the story**

I have known this guy for a lot of years. He would not lie to me.

My friend was going to burn a very small amount of brush and limbs. He lit the fire, realized things were too dry, and dump water on it. He thought the fire was out but the fire got under the tin burn ring meant to contain the fire and caught a piece of grass on fire outside the ring. He stomped it out immediately but he turned his back and saw that another package caught. So he stomped it out but the fire kept jumping to another spot and then it just went up so fast he couldn't stomp out all the spots and there was no way he was going to fill up his bucket or jug with water in time.

He called 911 and they had the fire reported but it was reported on the wrong Street. He has two driveways one allows you access all the way into his yard. So he ran and opened it and waved the fire trucks to let them know where it was.

A truck goes through back to where the fire is and my friend stays up front so he can waive the other trucks in. He walks back to see they are all working to put it out so he goes back up front to see if anyone needs to speak to him.

He goes out back and he is standing by the barn while they put out the fire. Because he said that he didn't think he needed to go get in their way. And he could speak to them after.

Two trucks have gone back by then. So a truck comes out and goes to the other driveway so my friend starts to walk to the other driveway to see if they need to speak to him. Well the firefighters that were in the back called him over so he goes over and they have a kind of debate over who's in charge and the guy who says he's in charge starts to talk to my friend.

The first thing he does is ask my friend where he went. My friend didn't understand the question he thought he meant when the fire started so he said I went to call nine-one-one. He said no we've been back there and it clicked what he meant.

My friend told him how he had gone around front to see if anyone needed to speak to him he didn't mention the whole standing by the gate to see if he needed the wave anyone else in. The guy acted like that was bullshit but continued on.

My friend told him all what happened and they laid into him like he expected and he knows he deserve it. The thing about my friend is he gets a lot of weird reactions from people. He has trouble reading people. And then he gets his weird reactions that makes it even harder to read people. So he is just beating himself up thinking that he could have done this whole interaction differently.

One of the firefighters made a comment about how his eyebrows were singed and my friends and he just Shrugged that comment off and started to talk about how he cared about everyone's houses around his. Because in my friend's mind he realizes that he could have killed somebody.  And that was all that was going through his head.  And I told him that they didn't understand that. That they were all coming from an after-the-fact place. They weren't thinking about your mental state or the fact that you realize that you could have really killed somebody. And he doesn't know if that made his whole demeanor look like he didn't care about any of it.

The leader said that he was super lucky because the fire almost spread to a bad patch that would have gone up way faster. Then he went into asking about my friends tractor saying that he could have taken the disc and driven around the fire to make it all dirt.

But that just doesn't make sense. I mean yes it makes sense after the fact but I'm trying to explain to my friend that what he did was the best course of action because everything turned out okay. The decisions he made and the things he did led the situation to end without anyone or anything hurt.

It would have taken way more than 10 seconds to get that disc connected to the Tractor. He chose to call nine-one-one, to open the gate, to wave the fire trucks in.

My friend said they all started to walk away and the the leader just said have a good day in this crappy tone. And my friend just didn't know what the hell he said wrong.

And that just caused him to beat himself up even more because he's thinking that he should have been able to do all of these things when in reality what he did was the best option. He made the right choices.

Yes what he did was stupid but I don't think it's life-ending. And I don't know how to convince him that he has to go on with his life I don't know how to convince him and he can't just lock himself in his house and let his yard over grow and never go outside again.

I just don't know what to say to him because I keep trying to think of similar situations but this is one where everyone knows. This is his first impression. The only similar example I can think of is like a DUI. But DUIs could be covered up in certain ways. It's not like people who got a DUI or walking around and everyone around them knows about it.",04Feb2018,1

Eventually we agreed that it was never unwanted and often a mood killer in asking, and skipped that. Fast forward a few months to yesterday, in the middle of the day she was trying to initiate sex. I wanted to make the most of the day, so i declined and said we would that night. During that night, we watched some tv, she was getting tired so we got into bed. I started kissing her neck and back, and shortly after began having intercourse. After around 15 seconds, I realised she had no enthusiasm in the act, and i stopped immediately. I asked if everything was alright, she said yes. I felt as if id done wrong but she assured me i hadnt. Later on we had intercourse. This morning, she told me when i first initiated it that she felt violated. She told me it wasnt a big deal and not to worry, that she thought it better if she said nothing and that i felt comfortable when i was doing it , but i have been upset all of today. I dont know how i can fix this, i feel like ive became the type of person I've always hated. I had no intention on assaulting her, and if i knew her feelings i would have never initiated anything.

So, long story short, my boyfriend of two years broke up with me (which I saw coming right towards the end), but we had just signed a lease on a new place (two beds so we could potentially have a craft/work room) and getting out of it at our complex isn't really easy so now we're stuck here until July as exes.

He makes a big deal about wanting to be my friend and caring about me and how I feel, and much as seeing him date other people hurts, he is allowed to do it. The part I can't handle is him bringing them here where I live. He is 27, and his newest girlfriend is BARELY 18 (as in was a minor 3 weeks ago) so they literally can't go anywhere else. In my eyes, that's not my problem, but he brings her here three to four times a week anyway, and I can't just leave the house for eight hours at a time to wait it out for her to leave, especially if she stays the night.

I don't handle it well when she is here.

Throwaway to conceal identities.

Me and the friend involved both go to highschool in Texas. I am posting for my friend because I am more familiar with reddit. I have direct contact with them so I can answer any questions.

My friend is an academically talented student who participates heavily in certain school clubs and events, takes high level classes, and has a perfectly clean slate with no infractions. On a school bus they were sitting on the lap of their S.O, under a blanket. There was some movement under the blanket that the bus driver saw and assumed they were having sex. The bus driver reported this to the school and both my friend and their S.O we're suspended for three days. This isn't the problem. They both know they did something wrong and understand that they have to take the consequences, but the school isn't just stopping there. When my friend comes back they are going to be put in ISS (In school suspension) for two weeks and the school has said that they are probably sending them to an alternative school that usually only really bad kids are sent to. The school is also putting this on my friends permanent record and forbidding them to participate in any school honor societies and the other events they normally participate in. They are also in very fast paced AP classes, that they are going to fall behind in, which means they will probably do poorly on AP exams and their GPA will drop. This is detrimental to my friends future and it seems so wrong that the school is doing this to them. The point of a punishment should be to have the person learn from and recover from their mistake, not destroy their future. It makes no sense that the school is trying to destroy one of their star student's future.

If it's important the evidence that the school has is the testimony from the bus driver, and an apparent video from the bus that only the school administrators have seen, and probably very poor quality to be used as hard evidence against my friend. They also interrogated both my friend and their SO, telling each one that the other one had already spilled everything to try and get a false confession or something. They interviewed two others from the bus at least, both who were on the side of my friend.

Please help I don't want my friend to be lost of their entire future for one mistake. There's got to be something that can be done to stand up to the school.",04Feb2018,1

He has a family with 2 young kids too.  Part of his problem is he feels that he's not handling being a father and husband. But is hanging in the to try and be a good person.

37,"man, i really hate my mom's obnoxiously loud laugh and voice and her immature mannerisms. i hate how she is obsessed with my face and turns it around on me when i call her out. she used to say i should get plastic surgery on my nose to bring it back to normal after my braces changed it slightly. she constnatly brings it up with my grandma is there, and when i call her out she says ""oh you dont have to worry about it anymore, its normal now, dont worry"" and i get so frustrated because i dont fucking care. she is the one that keeps bringing it up and my dad contributes too. he says that i should get my nose changed a little bit, then says it's just my mom that says it. 
its so frustrating how much my family contradicts itself and my mom always changes her mind and starts yelling at me, it's so fucking frustrating. 

and my brother always takes out his stupid hormonal feelings on me. i IGNORE him and he always finds an excuse to start yelling at me. he's 15 and im 17. i left my phone downstairs and he was watching tv and when i brough it back up, he said ""WHY DO YOU LEAVE YOUR CHARGER THERE?! BRING IT UPSTAIRS."" cuz my phone ""ding""ed a couple times.  He always orders me around and i HATE that. he thinks its okay to talk to me like shit because a. no one's around and b. he ""dislikes"" me.

38,"We don't know what to do. My older brother is a junior in college. He has no friends, is completely depressed, and absolutely lonely. He now has a problem where listening to sounds and not knowing where they came from make him go insane and do crazy things to try and find out the origin of them. It could be something as simple as a song, doorbell, or a car horn. This all culminated in November, when he tried to commit ""suicide"" because the sounds were bothering him too much by tying  yarn around his throat, after which we submitted him to a local hospital for over a week.

The doctors said that this metal issue arose from the fact the he is completely lonely and doesn't do anything at all. He really has nothing to do. He is completely empty on the inside and is afraid of any challenge. He literally doesn't have any interest in movies, games, hobbies, nothing. Sometimes he has a small bout of interest, like getting a new 3D printer or a new video game, yet gives up the moment any challenge presents itself. 

He's never had a job, doesn't participate in any activities outside of classes in college, and even barely that. He already dropped out of two classes this semester, and is now taking 7 credits total. All his classes are in the evening, and he only goes to school 3 days a week and spends the rest of his time in home in his room in front of the computer. 

Me and my mom are really scared for him. Everyday we have to deal with him, we try to take him out and encourage him and yet every day his complete absence of interest and gratitude kills us on the inside. We really don't know what to do about him because we feel like we tried everything. The worst part is he knows he's in a bad situation, yet doesn't try to fix anything. He could make friends, as he has met new people occasionally but immediately drops interest in them after just a few conversations. I even try to introduce him to my friends but he just makes a weirdo of himself. He could participate in activities and get a job, yet he just remains in his room because doing any of those things would mean he has to put effort. He's also convinced himself that there's nothing that he can do about it because he's constantly reading stuff online about how getting a job is impossible and too difficult because nobody will accept your application and that businesses only want to hire minorities etc. He also tells himself that he can't succeed in life because he has bad genetics such as the lack of a ""passion"" gene. I really need to know what to do with him, I don't know how and I've tried to help. Me and my mother can't handle this anymore and my father is a really shitty person who is incapable of dealing with these kinds of sensitive things. Is there anything that can help?

Right now I have a channel going that's doing really well without me really showing my face but I want to do more with it. I want to do videos where I show my face, talk face to face, I want my viewers to feel connected to me like they know me, etc. I want to do so much but for 7 fucking years I've been scared.

41,"Hello everyone, some context I lived in Brooklyn for 14 months jumping around jobs. I worked for parks for 6 months then my contract ended and I started working at my current employment which I do not love. I hated it so much I moved home to Colorado and worked remotely for the past two months. 

I have not been able to find a job in Colorado that pays for more 15 an hour. My rent is cheaper here, but I have applied for over 50 jobs with only 2 interviews. 

So, I got a job interview back in NYC back at Parks for another 7 month contract. This time, there is a almost guaranteed chance to renew for an additional 7 months. Pay is 24 an hour. 

Currently I am not sure if I should fly out for the interview ($192).

I am struggling with finding a job in Colorado and it has felt really hopeless. Obviously moving across the country is very difficult and stressful, but i'd say as stressful as searching for a job here. 

I have family in Colorado but a pretty solid support system in Brooklyn too. 

Things I am considering, asking for a skype interview for the first time( although I feel as if that is less effective than in person)

Is 24 an hour worth moving cross country?

Am I young and reckless and wishwashing between two places I love?

Any input would be helpful. ",04Feb2018,3
42,"I'm 20 with no job and live with my mom and dad. Since I lost my job I haven't been able to keep paying for my college classes. I have spent everyday looking and applying but you know how it is these days. 

My father is abusive towards me and has a very bad temper and is easily angered. I try to avoid him but there are times where something will happen and he will get mad and scream an inch away from my face and shove me to the ground or slap me really hard across the face. This has been happening pretty much everyday of my life but it's gotten even worse now.

My father having a temper has caused some friction in my parents marriage and so my mother and father have started talking less and are always in different rooms. For my entire life whenever my father got mad and started yelling and pushing me around my mother would just stand aside and watch quietly or try to stay out of his way, which I think is just as bad. When I try to talk to her about her advice is ""Just try to avoid him when he gets angry"". Now recently she seems to be avoiding him more than ever and my father has been taking his anger out on me and small things I have done will trigger him to go off on me.

Just before I started writing this I turned on the T.V in my room and my father came in and yelled at me that it was too loud and threw me against my bedroom wall and picked up the T.V remote and threw it at my face, It hurt really bad. He left and slammed the door.

That has just made me think of only getting out of this house, but I don't have the resources to. My mother ""gave me her old car"" which is mine, but technically not mine since it's still in her name. I have no job and no matter how much I search for one I never find anything. I have a girlfriend that at the moment is long distance since she recently moved to a different state. I've talked to her about my situation at home and she has told me that if I can get to her state that she can take me in and help me find a job so I can make rent.

I have considered this, but there are too many problems with it, besides the car I have no way of getting there, and even if i did find a way there that would mean leaving behind the school i'm in,and then what if I couldn't find a job over there either?

I want to get out but in my current situation I just don't think I have the resources for it and I feel I will be stuck living in this hell for a very long part of my life.

51,"I've been trying to wrap my head around what the hell is happening and I have no idea why I keep getting played with like this.

Recently what happend was this:

I was talking to a guy named Adam. We meet on a hookup site  and I was the one to ask to move to KIK, the dating site chat sucked. Well I wanted to meet up but he claimed he was in Boston and that the weather was too bad to fly back to Seattle. It made sense as there was a huge snowstorm at the time in Boston so I didn't find it weird. 

From there we were texting daily, although his communication started to get sparse after the first week of talking. Then suddenly he was back in Seattle, or so he said. He wanted to meet that weekend and I was excited! I asked where / when and he avoided the subject saying ""I'll tell you later"". 

""I'll ____ later"" seemed to be the response I got to everything including when I would ask for pictures of him. Friday comes and he goes silent. Saturday comes and goes and finally on Sunday he texts me, saying work had him busy (supposdly he is an erotic fiction writer but he wont tell me what publisher he uses or share his work with me). So we set a time up for the next weekend and the same thing happens. 

I stop texting him and dont hear from him for about a week, which brings us to two weeks ago. He says his phone was ""broken"" but is fixed now! He wants to meet but then goes silent when I ask ""where and when"". 

That brings us to today. He texts me again, same excuse. So I get the balls to call him. A guy answers but the voice sounds...wrong. Way too deep to match the face I've seen in the few photos he has sent me. So I text him, calling him out. Saying It's shitty that he can answer phone calls but can't text me a place to meet. 

He gets defensive, says I'm being mean to him. I say I just want honesty and it's shitty of him to be stringing me along. We've been going back and forth for the last hour of him ""not getting my texts"" but still he wont commit to a time or place to meet tonight. 

Am I right to assume I'm being played? I've been having awful luck in the dating world lately so I was really hoping this attractive guy liked me but it feels more like I'm being catfished. 

What should I do? Am I right to assume no good looking man would ever be interested in me?

I am currently in Uni and feel as though my current major(Graphic Design) isn't exactly what I want to be doing. Over the past few months I found myself getting really into coding and wanting to be a programmer. I got so immersed in tech that I ended up selling my mac book and building my own PC!

56,"So yea - I fucked up. I remember how two years ago I used to say that you don't need alcohol to have fun, until I started drinking and realised how much more silly and happy everything becomes with a bit of alcohol. So I started drinking, and that was the start to this issue. 

Without alcohol I can be very shy and quiet, but with alcohol I instantly become a completely different person, someone who is more fun and interesting. 

This led me to last night, when I went to a friends house party with a bottle of Jim Beam. (My friend had told me that the best drink is Jim Beam with Schweppes.) [Side note - its bloody delicious]

So I got drunk. Just like everyone else, and it was fun. It was fun all the way through the party until the end. I had a friend, who is a girl, and shes extremely attractive, but shes never shown any interest in me. Anyway, the party is ending and everyone is saying bye to each other, and she comes to give me a hug, and when she did I grabbed her behind and kissed her on the cheek twice. Then I told her that she is gorgeous. 

I need to know what to do - should I message her or see if she forgets about the issue. I'm very shy and I feel like I violated her personal space and made her feel uncomfortable. Another question is should I message her today, or talk to her tomorrow when we have class together?

We will call him “b”

We meet in august of 2016, high school, me and junior and him a senior. We didn’t even know eachother at first i’m not gonna lie, i thought he was a big nerd. 

He is actually the funniest and cutest guy i’ve ever met.

a month later, i invited him to come over to swim at my house, meet my dad and he did so. A couple girlfriends also were at the pool that day (i didn’t even know they were gonna show up, also it’s a community pool) and they keep saying things like “M, pick up what’s yours and take it” things like that etc... 

Later that day we walked to the park and i confessed i had a tiny crush on him (he was just so funny) and he said we could make this work. The next day at lunch we made it official.

(also, he is my first bf and this is new all new to me)

My friends were thrilled as so were his and ourselves. He took me to kings island and places i haven’t been and as time went out feelings got greater.
We told eachother our story’s (i have some trust issues from past home) 

January of 2017 comes around and i get my first job, he supports me. Everything is going so good. He ends up buying me a ring (says for valentine’s day a early present) a promise ring and it’s only been five months. The ring is absolutely gorgeous, yet i am unsure why he bought it already. I accept it, show it off blah blah...

A couple months pass, my 17 bday and all that. I’ve also been losing a lot of weight because of his support.

May hits, that’s where our relationship gets bumpy. B graduates, i go to his ceremony and he quits his job to get a new one ( and more pay too) and it’s all good. 

Then we start talking about college and what he is gonna go in and if he is gonna stay.  He also starts vaping.

Last summer, we started to get into tiny arguments like “are you coming to pick me up” and b would say “i can’t “ then i would get mad on the spot because i have to walk to work (buying own car). Our relationship is still good, and when we argue we don’t yell or scream, we talk maturely and calm. but this little arguments pop up more often.

August hits, and they become somewhat constant, only because i’m in school now, he is in college and we can only see eachother on weekends (my fathers rules). We make sunday our day, no work or school work so it’s to ourselves.  Also, my dad proposed to his fiancé who lives 3 hours north, so we go to see her more often on some weekends. 

This is probably the worst time, because we barely see eachother, and through text, we can’t really tell our emotions to eachother. 

Then our one year past, and again our relationship is blooming, but it’s just these small arguments.

I confront him about te vaping, i tell him i don’t want it around me, that i’d rather not breathe the smoke (vapor) in. This subject causes a heated argument. He says he will stop it all together. 

We go out more and thanksgiving and christmas break comes around, and during christmas he literally drives 3 hours to come see me at my dads fiancés house. That was an amazing day and everything is going good but again these arguments still pop up.

Now it’s Feb., and he says he wants to start vaping again because “it helps the stress” and now i feel completely useless because i, myself, thought i was helping his stress. I haven’t talked to him yet ( talking to him today) and i’m not gonna lie i hate his vaping. 

Then i realized something.

I’m the one who causes these stupid arguments. I’m the one who makes them bigger then they really are, only because i’m an extremely sensitive person and i need to grow thicker skin. He treats me like an princess, he spoiles me, he takes me on dates and i do the same for him. he even bought me a necklace to wear to senior dinner dance.  (which i did). when we argue, he is always the first one or only one to say sorry. 

I need advice, i wanna be nicer to him. All my friends think we are perfect together, and I love him more then anything else, and i know he loves me too. How can i be nicer to him?

58,"Hi everyone- fairly inexperienced with Reddit so forgive me if I'm in the wrong place. I'm a Junior in High School and I've been told to start thinking about Prom...I'm planning on asking my longtime friend, who I've had seemingly unnoticed feelings for. I feel really comfortable around her for the most part so approaching her isn't the issue, but all my friends are talking about their ludicrously elaborate plans for a ""promposal."" We're really close but she's not my girlfriend so I'm not sure if some over-the-top romantic gesture is appropriate, (although I do have several ideas). On the one hand, she's the kind of person that might be flattered by something like that but on the other hand it would seem really out of character for me to do something over the top like that and I worry it wouldn't feel genuine. But I'm also worried she might feel like I'm being ""lazy"" if I just straight-up asked her. I was wondering if anyone could give any insight.

Also, it's worth noting that she's a year older than I am- I think she looks on me as an equal but with a lot of my guy friends there's an odd prejudice against taking someone outside your age to prom, and while I don't care what they think it's still something to consider. Does this matter at all?

As a final question, how far in advance do people ask? Prom is at the end of May for me, but due to scheduling I'd have to ask by the middle of March at the latest, but is that too late? I want to get this over with as early as possible since it's quite possible someone else will ask!",04Feb2018,0

61,"I'm a college student, currently taking night classes and working part-time at Walmart for 2 years now. Retails hours fluctuate all the time but especially now since Walmart is trying out a new system.  

Walmart is trying out a new thing called customer first. It’s pretty much an automated scheduling system that schedules associates at “peak” times, and gives a select amount of hours on each day at select times. It also schedules by your availability with these peak demand times. So people who have open availability get most of the hours, and students are more likely to get low hours, my other friend works 5 hour shifts because of it. Some people now have two work in two departments to get their hours. 

The next two weeks schedules aren't looking good but I'll just use that time to study more.  I don't have that much bills, so it's alright I guess but at times I feel like why am I here at Walmart. I told myself I don't want to be in for 3+ years but I notice a lot of people say things like that and end up still working here 10+ years later. Don't get me wrong Walmart is okay, but I don't want to make it a career and at times I feel stuck here.  I agree I'm not learning that much skills here (if any), but with my friends job - I'll learn more skills there. 

I have a chance to work at my friends company, starting a dollar more than I make but it's completely different to what I do. His company deals with construction related work, using metal machines like angle grinders, they did some projects for Disney and I heard they are having another big project coming soon. They do welding as well, etc.

I make $12/hr right now. Walmart is going to start at $15/hr in 2020.

At my friends place at work, they start at $13/hr but if I take some welding classes, I can start making around $18-20/hr - maybe more. &amp; They give raises if you ask too, so I'll make more money in the long run, if I decide to take the job offer. 

I'm just afraid that I may not like doing that type of work, and decide to go back to Walmart, if I even can.  I'm already comfortable at Walmart and I'm worried of the chance of being unhappy with the new job..  

I'm also afraid of how I'm going to balance school because the new job is full time so I'm not sure if it'll effect my studies. But it should be do able if I manage my time properly. 

Any advice? Should I leave Walmart and blindly go for a new job, despite being worried that  I might decide to quit? ",04Feb2018,2
62,"I recently finished college and while I'm enjoying what I'm doing, I deep down inside really miss the social aspects of college. I'm living back with my parents and while I enjoy my family, I deeply miss the freedom of college and being able to live with a bunch of people my age, coming home when I want, and having all sorts of social opportunities around me. 

Deep down inside, I really want to move out and regain my freedom, the issues are that right now I'm way to broke to be able to do so, and realize financially it wouldn't even be smart, since I'm from a city and plan to stay in my home city, so even if I moved away, I'd likely just be in a small place, with very expensive rent, only 15-30 mins away. Secondly, I think I'd feel very lonely living alone with no one my age around me. Most of my friends are either in the same situation still with their parents, married at a young age, or moved in with their boyfriend/girlfriends. A few who went far away from their hometown have roommates. 

I'm fortunate that I have childhood friends around since I'm in my home city, but truthfully feel lonely since my job as a whole can be a relatively lonely profession, and I don't have people my age I can regularly see anymore, and moving out is going to be even more lonely since I'm single and have no roommates. 

Any advice from college graduates on this situation? What should I do to combat loneliness after college? Should I try to move out even though financially it wouldn't make much sense, and that socially I'd probably be even more lonely than I am now? I know eventually my parents will probably force me out anyway, so it's a struggle to figure out what to do.

I had a friend on Reddit and we talked a lot, I felt like she cared for what I had to say and helped me up when I got down, even if we had nothing to talk about, she would still talk to me when I was alone.

So this is kind of embarrassing and I hope I’m not judged too hard, but I was in my neighborhood almost home and my SO and I made the (dumb) decision to pull around the corner to a park and make out a little bit. I guess I didn’t realize that the park closes and after a couple minutes, THREE police cars were around us! We weren’t doing anything too bad, all our clothes were on and we instantly stopped sat back. 

This next part is a little stupid too, because we were too embarrassed to admit that two adults decided to fool around in our CAR, and so we said that we had gotten into a bit of an argument and wanted to go somewhere else to talk. He took our licenses and ran a check, another cop walked around the car and looked into the windows. Neither of us have ever been arrested or have warrants or anything, we don’t do drugs or anything even NEARLY criminal so this was a pretty crazy thing to happen. Our checks came back clear and he gave us a verbal warning for being in the park past sunset, and told us to make sure that we weren’t getting physical with our arguing and to keep a cool head, and sent us on our way. We went right back home.

But NOW I’m sitting here so scared that this will come back to bite me somehow. They said it was a verbal warning and they didn’t do any paper work, but I don’t know if they actually saw us kissing and stuff and maybe are secretly putting something on our “record”??(sorry I don’t know all the terminology). Or maybe they think there’s some kind of abuse going on? This was such a stupid thing to do and I want to erase it forever but I’m so scared that it’s going to come back to me somehow and my whole family is going to find out and it’s really stressing me out. Can anyone tell me if it’s going to be okay?? Like I said they didn’t do any paper work but I’m scared they saw us doing the opposite of arguing and might be doing something with that information.

To start off, heres some background about us two, we met online and basically live only 10 minutes away from eachother and have known eachother for almost two years. This is a f*ck that has threatened me and said shit about everyone in my family directly to my face, harrasing me and punching me for no reason, forced me to take a drug, and when we go out together we usually have at least one argument and will always point out the bad things in me and constantly keep telling me about these ""bad things"" making me insecure. The thing is he does not take no for answer which I've learnt the hard way. He is also friends with multiple ""dangerous"" (in a way) people. He has also threatened to vandalize my home if I wouldn't go out with him. The thing is we go out together at a place, we'll call it, A1, now A1 is a small area where we know a lot of people and have met a lot of people. I'm worried that I won't be close with these people we have met together as they might take his side over mine. So if I cut him out of my life I'll go back to my other friends who I would go out with probably a few times a month at the most however with this person we'd go out twice a week. I don't know what to do guys, please help me out on this. Thanks. 

EDIT: Last night was insane for me as he probably showed me his ugliest side and was almost going to probably break my face as he was reaching for something in his pocket the whole time. Since then he has messaged to me to Come to A1 which I haven't opened the message yet.

Whenever I ask she says that your life is like a house and if you play ANY first-person shooter (not just fallout) it will give you a bad “foundation” (or childhood). I asked her what that meant and she texted me verbatim “I don't think it is good to program anybody's mind to be entertained by frivolously killing people or people like things it's not a game it's not funny it's not entertainment. I think it would be a disservice as a parent to let you do it. I know that your friends might have those Liberties but I'm not their parent.” About 2 years ago my dad got me “Star Wars Battlefront” and my mom didnt know it was an FPS. I had also asked her for Fallout because it came out that same year. She said no. I got so mad that one day while she was sitting on the coach and I walked in the room and just started playing battlefront. She got really mad and asked “Where did you get this?!” I said from my dad (who was asleep at the time) got it for me. She said she thought she could trust him to respect her opinions and was going to talk to him. She NEVER even mentioned the game because she forgot about it the next day. So here I am now wondering how I can convince her that FPS’s aren’t that bad. She is really stubborn about everything so it will be difficult.

I keep telling him that I don’t want to be with him anymore, but he still begs and begs. 

Now, he’s saying he’s ‘done with love’ and he’s telling me that he’s going to ‘end it’ if I don’t give him another chance or love him again.

I have no idea what to do because I don’t want to loose him but I can’t be together with him anymore.

I try and try to tell him that if he hadn’t tried to date other people, then it would be different, but he blames me for ‘not looking past it and not giving him another chance.’

92,"So im 17, already have a few grand , get a 4.0, and am taking college classes in highschool. I have two pretty good options for my life after high school and am broken on which one I should do. 

Option 1: Work the Family Bussiness 
So my family ( I would be the third generation ) owns a pretty good bussiness where I could probably get a start pay of at least $15 (maybe 17-20) an hour with 6 figure potental as I get older. There is a good chance i would also get a company car like Cadillac or Mercedes. This would save me a lot of headache and suffering through school. I DO NOT enjoy school at all and it gives me bad anxiety. Nonetheless I am very good at it. So back to this plan, I would rent a 3 bed apartment and rent out 1 room to my brother and another room to someone else. Since I live in colorado, I could probably get my personal rent (after selling the rooms) down to less than 1k. I would then live frugally and save at least 50% of my income (if possible). 

Option 2: I go to college for Chemistry. I could probably get some great scholarships and perhaps my family would pay for the schooling. Chemistry is the only subject that remotely interests me. I could either go into teaching after college or go on to med school if I wanted to make the big bucks. 

Details: Money is not that important to me. Whats more important is time and retiring early. I would much rather drive a non fancy car and only live in 1 house and retire early rather than bust my ass until im 60-70. My grandfather is still working in his late 70s. My father is working too and doesnt plan to retire anytime soon. (Not because they have to at all, but because they are used to the lifestyle) I plan to be single (unless something changes) and shouldnt have that many costs in life. 

Anyways im interested to hear your guys thoughts. Open to all feedback and cristism. ",04Feb2018,2
93,"This may get long so bare with me. I previously attended a large, public, yet very prestigious public school. To be honest, I never truly wanted to go here so I was pretty depressed there. It has a distinct vibe that is not for everybody. During my entire first year I knew that it wasn’t a good fit and had filled transfer apps to apply to smaller, private schools that were all higher ranked according to US News and I got into most of them. Then in like April I really fell in love with someone and those feelings made me forget about my initial desires to transfer as I was happy and stupid in love. (Love will do that to you kids… be careful). So second year I came back to this school and instantly realized how big of a mistake I made. At that very instant I called a particular school that I had gotten into and asked if I could come, if not this semester than next semester, but they said I would have to reapply for next year. I was shattered, and spent the rest of the year just waiting for my “real life to begin” the following year. I spent every day regretting my decision to not transfer when I had the chance.. literally every day. I was so hard on myself for making that mistake. I actually started liking the school more my second semester of my second year, but knowing how much I regretted not transferring the first time around, I made sure to transfer this time. So now for my third year of college, I decided to transfer to the highly ranked, private school. The school’s demographics suited me better and I just thought it would be great. However as a junior transfer, things have been harder than I thought. I had known that things as a transfer are not easy, so I had beforehand planned exactly what clubs I wanted to be involved in and there were 2 that I was very keen on. These clubs look great and would be a great way to meet a lot of people and I was excited. Upon arriving on campus, I realized that both of them are very competitive and for both of them I made it all the way to the final round and then didn’t make it in- one was a business frat. I was told by several members later that the only reason I didn’t get in was that I was a junior and they mainly only take freshman or sophomores, and the same thing happened with the other club. Also this school is very greek, so even if I meet cool people it’s not that I will hang out with them or go out with them because everyone just does that with their brothers/sisters. I have nothing at all against greek life, I think it’s a great way to meet people- but it just sucks when you’re not in one. Most people I know are other transfers which I don’t like.

This school would have been beyond perfect for me if I went here from the start or even if I transferred as a sophomore- as I could have joined what I wanted to and also rushed a sorority. And I will always, for the rest of my life, regret not transferring after my freshman year. So now I’m just in some random clubs with some acquaintances and no matter how good and perfect fit a school is, it won’t be fun if that’s what the situation is. My ""type"" of people are in Greek life so it's hard. So I’m in the second semester of my third year, and just feeling so low because I know that I ruined college for myself. I had so, so, much potential in every aspect- socially, professionally but I wasted it. Anyways, I’m just not sure what to do now. This didn’t turn out as well, so I’m considering transferring back. I’m afraid I have “the grass is greener on the other side” syndrome, but also I think it maybe worth it because I can graduate from my original school in only one more semester (AP credits + some credits from this school would transfer there), and it would take one more year after this where I am now. College didn’t turn out how I wanted it to, because my own issues, lack of good decision making skills, etc. but I really did try this year- so now I’m thinking to just take the L and move on with my life. How bad/weird is to go back? Again, my primary motivation is just so I can graduate asap and also, I have more friends there. Also, in my country of origin where all my relatives live, my original school is actually a lot more well-known (even though its ranked lower according to US News). Also, one reason graduating early is appealing is because I want to give acting in my country of origin a shot, and those months would be perfect to give it my all to audition and stuff. I’m sure that I can secure a full time job with a good company for when summer of next year ends during my first semester of my senior year, but during that second semester I can try fulfilling my dream- and if during that time, it doesn’t work out, I’ll get back to the real world and I wouldn’t have ruined any employment prospects for myself.

106,"Hello all,

To put a long story short, me and a friend of mine have entered a lease on a duplex in December. I did not expect it to happen but I am at the point where I have realized that I cannot live with a roommate and I would prefer to live alone. In this case, I have been looking at single bedroom apartments for myself. Our lease is for 1 year. I do not want to break the lease but, for the sake of my own sanity, it is necessary. My roommate plans to add someone else to the lease if I choose to move out.

In this instance, what are the punishments for me for breaking my own lease? I’ve read on Google that if you break your lease, you must pay your landlord for the remaining months rents (in this case it would be 10 months of rent) however, if my roommate is still living here and paying rent, would this be necessary? Is my credit going to tank by moving out too early?

I know that tanking my credit is not ideal, but my own sanity and mental health is more important than my credit right now. I don’t want to vent about it but I cannot sleep or focus on my school work or my actual job since sometimes it requires me to work from home. I am constantly cleaning up after him and his girlfriend, I am bothered by the landlord every few days because HE won’t send in his rent checks, and when I work from home I have to go to Starbucks because his girlfriend and her friends are so loud. On top of that l, I have to fall asleep to Jet Engine noises on YouTube just to drown out the sound of him and his girlfriend making dinner at 3AM every night and listening to music. I’ve tried talking to them, it stops for a couple days, but then just slowly happens again. For the sake of my own sanity, I am breaking this lease. Whatever happens to my credit just happens at this point.

Basically what I’m asking is, if I break my own lease but my roommate still lives here and pays rent, what’s the worst that will happen on my end? Is this common or a huge no no? Thank you!",04Feb2018,2

108,"I essentially have two options go back to boarding school or get my GED the reason I only have these to options is this. 
My first two years of high school I went to private school which I’ve recently found out was not accredited. meaning they could only give me a home school diploma and none of the years I went there carry over to other schools in my state. However the boarding school (located in another state) I went to my third year decided to overlook this and let me go as a junior. Here’s where things get messy, in my senior I got kicked out because of mental health issues, I had suicidal ideation and I barely ever went to classes because I was so depressed so they sent men home and said that if I get better they’d consider having me back.

My only two options right now are get my GED or go back to the boarding school the thing is though that I’m not sure I’m better mentally, I still have terrible depression, I cry myself to sleep on occasion and I’ve lost my only friend in the past month so I don’t know if I could handle it. However I don’t want the stigma of the GED. I feel like people will think I’m unintelligent with it plus there’s things I want to do tat I don’t know would be possible with a GED, I want to be a professor of philosophy and that doesn’t sound possible with a GED or alternatively a veterinary technician or a paralegal. On the other hand  I would love a career in academia specifically in the humanities. It’s like you’re getting paid to study philosophy and read literature it sounds great.

I have depression and had suicidal tendencies myself(haven’t had them in months, yay!), so you’d think I’d know what to do in this situation, but I don’t and its scary. I’m in college and my very close friend just went through a lot of difficult things like serious problems with parents and a large breakup with a boyfriend. She’s on and off about feeling suicidal, and she’s been cutting just about every other night. Her major is VERY competitive and if she were to leave school it would have a large impact on the rest of her college career and life if things don’t work out. She is considering treatment and I have brought it up a couple of times but she seems to have decided that she won’t be doing it. I’ve been trying to stress the importance of it without forcing i upon her. It’s scary because of the self harm that is happening that treatment would be able to prevent. She just came off of a precious antidepressant and is adjusting to a new one, she’s probably been taking it for a week or a week and a half. I don’t think it has fully adjusted yet and I’m hoping that may be the cause for some of these tendencies.

And we took her home that same day. She made me feel happy when I was sad, and she was there for me through the very frustrating years in middle school and high school where all I felt was loneliness. She was there everyday after school, always at the door when we came home from the bus. And now, when I return home from college for breaks, she’s still there, right at the door. What do I do now that she will not be there? Should I be thankful that she will be free from the pain she is in? Should I be angry at myself for not paying more attention to her as I got older? We’ve had our girl a long time and I know she’s ready but is it absolutely horrible that I am not?

Hey reddit, I've been dating this girl for about 2 years now. We've had our ups and downs as expected, but I don't know how to feel about things right now. It was never easy to date her because she had a lot of time commitments and bad apples in the family and general mental health issues to top it all off, but I put in the time and effort to be a good boyfriend because I do like this girl. At least, initially. Recently, she's been having bouts of panic attacks, and while she denies it, I have a feeling part of the reason they happen is because I had a few weeks where I would get really angry at everything, including when she would not be able to hold our plans (which was far more often than not). She asked that we take a break in our relationship which she had done once before when her depression got really bad, but she since got antidepressants and we were back together until recently. The problem is, all these issues combined are making me really worried over if there's a pleasant future in this relationship, because now that I'm in a really weird single-not-single limbo status I'm finding myself less attracted to her by the day. It used to be that going 24 hours without talking would mean something big happened, but I haven't texted her in 4 days and I feel completely indifferent. I only really put that into perspective while writing this. I'm also really scared to break up with her not because of how she'd react to it, but how everyone else who thinks we're the good couple would react. I've introduced her to my friends and she's become part of our friend group, and I think breaking up with her would have way more impact between them than between us. But, I see continuing a commitment as a waste of time at this point because I'm talking to a lot more people now and I'm meeting more people and I can't help but to think that most of them would be much more interesting to date than my girlfriend at this point.

So my friend let's call him Greg dated this girl let's call her Betty for 4 months but he didn't really feel for her and he broke up with her about a month ago now, in that time I never held a conversation with Betty and didn't really have an opinion on her.

Recently my friend group has been actively rejecting both Greg and Betty due to them disliking Greg getting back with one of his exes let's call her Sally(she isn't important to the story). And they always found Betty annoying but personally I didn't. So basically Betty hasn't had anyone to hang out with but me.

So after hanging with Betty for a while I realized I kinda liked her, I didn't find her annoying, we have a really similar sense of humor, we listen to the same kind of music, etc. unlike all of my friends I had no reason to dislike her and plenty to like, but it wasn't too much of a feeling.

The thing is Betty really wanted to be with Greg, she knows everything bad about Greg and is able to see past it. So I put my little inner stirring put aside to help her get back with Greg but despite any efforts Greg just didn't have that feeling for Betty and didn't want to try again.

So at some point Greg hung out with Betty and he and according to him he told her to ""consider someone else"" (I don't believe him he I told him about my little crush for her) and about 2 hours ago she started messaging me on Facebook for the first time. We talked, it was nice, I told her I was playing a game and she said she was about to start playing the same game, a lot of jokes fun stuff all that. but at some point she said ""can I ask you something?""

So obviously she proceeded to ask me if I had feelings for her and I basically tried to dodge the question by pointing out everyone of my friends seemed to have a reason not to like her but not me. She picked up on the obvious dodge and asked again so I downplayed it by saying ""a little???"" And trying to dodge even more. She hasn't been online since I said a little and I don't know what to think or do.

So I ask you r/Advice what do I do? I know I still have to wait for her to read the rest of what I said but I feel like I totally screwed up and like imma bout to be on the r/niceguys chopping block. Please be honest did I screw up?",04Feb2018,2
124,"Approximately couple months ago I was having a conversation with my mom (I'm 15 years old) after she had received several old hospital bills in the mail. She couldn't figure out what they could possibly be from based on the given time frame. After a minute or two she said ""Oh unless it could be from that...,"" and sort of trailed off. Naturally I was curious and asked what she meant, to which she responded, ""The time I tried to commit suicide.""

The bills were dated 9 years ago, I would have been 6 at the time. I remember several things from when I was that age but I definitely don't remember something like that. I dont know if I like suppressed the memory or some shit. The topic was dropped soon after because I was afraid to ask any questions. 

I talked to my older sister a while after and got up the courage to ask her about it. She remembers it, she said she remembers our mom making multiple suicide attempts. I'm not good at talking about emotional subjects and I let the conversation dwindle again. 

I don't know how to bring it up, to ask what exactly happened. It's just that time keeps going by and it still bothers me that I can't remember. 

It's like reading a book and something seems kind of off about it, it doesn't make complete sense so you look back through the pages you've read and realize that there are a couple pages stuck together and they just won't come apart. If you could read those pages maybe the entire book would make sense. I don't know if that analogy even makes sense. Maybe I'm being stupid and placing too much importance on something that happened a long time ago but maybe that's why I'm so fucked up.

I saw it coming years ago so I was prepared for it to come to this, so I wasn't affected as much as i should rather I'm happier that they are separated and not fighting every goddamn night. Mum went back to live with her parents while I'm still live with dad occasionally (I usually stay at college dorm)  


However I only found out a week ago that the divorce happened due to my dad ex sweet talking him for years leading up to the divorce, convincing him to break up with mum. I found this by talking to the lawyer that handle our family case. In fact the lawyer slipped up and accidentally revealed that he actually works for my dad ex all along!

fast forward to now. we hang out once in a blue moon, still consider him my best friend, but i always find myself initiating hangouts and he always wants to go to lowkey restuarants (never a movie, bar, etc.) further, he messages me when he sees me hanging out w other people on snapchat. he just doesnt seem genuine even though we have a close bond and i helped him through a death in his family.

i know i deserve better. i know hes a shitty friend. were both guys so i dont wanna communicate this to him but it sucks. hes my only best friend and i just think about a wedding where i have no friends attending.

138,"I just had a big ass fight with my dad about college and financial aid.

So I (18M) told my dad to give me his most recent tax report last October for FASFA (basically federal student financial aid). It's now February and the deadline is in March. If you don't know, the earlier you get FASFA done, the more money you get towards financial aid.

I got super pissed at him tonight (my mom got pissed too lol) and asked him as calmly as possible how a grown man can procrastinate more than a high school student can, and why he hasn't given it to me yet. 

He then said, ""I can get it done easily."" 

I stood up from my chair and went on a frenzy - I screamed at him, asking him word by word ""If you can get it done so easily why the fuck haven't you gotten it done yet?""

This man said ""I have no time"". I got super triggered as soon as he said this. I told him, ""I gave you nearly 4 months ahead of time. If you don't have time why didn't you tell me earlier?"" 

He then started saying he doesn't give a fuck about my future and said its his life so he can do whatever he wants - but if that was the case why did he agree to do financial aid in the first place??? God damn it's making no sense to me. I told him to let go of his ego for one god damn second and he turned around and said no lmao then started yelling at my mom

Then I found out not only has he not done 2016 taxes, but he hasn't done 2015 either. 

I don't know what to do. It wasn't just today that I'm mad at either. It's a culmination of earlier observations too. 

My dad said he makes 100k a year - I found out last year he makes approx. 45-70k. This guy talks about how he's content with life, but always complains about how shit work is, then complains we don't give a fuck about him. He talks like he owns the world - but really he can't afford anything.

I sincerely want to move away after graduation. I really can't live with a man like my father. It's not because of what happened tonight, but like I said earlier, a combination of this and earlier events. 

I've worked my ass off during high school to go to prestigious colleges, and a world class education. I sincerely feel that my efforts were wasted, because at this point even if my dad gets his taxes done in time I don't think it would be enough for me to go to the colleges I want to go to. There's no point for me getting acceptance letters when I can't even afford to go there. 

I don't know what to do next. I feel like this sounded more like a rant (sorry if it did) but it's just that my dad is really fucking annoying at this point and it's been nothing but adding more fuel to the fire.

TL:DR - dad didn't do 2016 taxes, told him October to get it done since I needed tax info by March, still hasn't done it yet and it looks like the amount of money I'm about to receive for financial aid won't be promising; dad has increasingly making me angry for the last 5 years, considering leaving household after hs graduation",04Feb2018,1

I told her the things that upset me, she told me the things that upset her. But there was a big difference in the way we responded - I was willing to apologize, move on, but D, every time I said something that had affected me, was not willing to apologize and was insistent that I was wrong, remembering things incorrectly/warping facts, or just making this more serious than it was given that we were just recent school friends.

The things she said hurt me, but I also realize that what I said may have hurt her.

3. In the morning when I wake up, I get this pain in the ass feeling. it's slow, quiet and calm on my head so I ignore it and with some initial troubles, I continue this task.

4. Now a few more days pass and I really feel the same feeling with much intensity. I am disturbed due to this and my concentration goes numb. I ca can't focus nor do I like to continue the work.

5. The very next day, like as if I don't have a connection with the task (esp if its a self talk that doesn't involve a client) I just delete everything I done just like that no second thoughts. Shift + Delete the damn thing(s).

A few  more days pass and I feel intrigued by the task again. so I take up the task again and continue where I left off and the cycle repeats.

So do you think I'm kinda bi-polar because when the switch in my head is flipped, I'll just become what  I can describe as cold and ruthless...not the way I usually am!

157,"This isn't a matter of not being willing to go to a homeless or women's shelter, however the ones around and in my area are not anymore safe or stable than my current living situation; I've been looking into them for about two months. That being said, I plan on getting a job ASAP so that I can save up enough money to move into a place of my own, but am finding it difficult without a car or cellphone so far. ( My boyfriend accidentally broke my phone during an argument, and he totaled my car while I was letting him borrow it. )

I have no family or friends to turn to, and that makes it even harder because sometimes I just want someone to talk to - not even about the things that are going on in my life, but about our hobbies and what's going on in their's, too. I feel alone and caged, and it hurts. I'm determined to get myself out of the position that I'm in one way or the other, but if anyone has some advice or stories that may encourage or help me a bit, then I would love to hear them.

158,"We started talking last year. She doesn't talk to any other guy. Her friends tell me that she's into me. My friends tell me that she's into me. She keeps asking me about my plans and I try to avoid her. Last week we were in a bus for a 3 hour ride. I was sitting alone and she was sitting with her roommate. She asked if she could sit next to me as her roommate fell asleep. I said fine. Then we talked useless stuff for an hour. Then she asked me if I had a girlfriend and I said no. Then she kept talking about her not having a boyfriend. She kept pushing herself towards me or maybe it was just the bus. I looked at a restaurant outside the bus and said jokingly that we should go out to eat. She asked when and where and I had to tell her that I was joking about the restaurant outside.

Now, I'm not attracted to her really. So this is pathetic but it feels good to be cared for when you don't have anyone to talk to for a decade. What should I do? I'm not attracted to her most of the time but I feel like if I ignore this I would continue to live alone for the rest of my life and would regret later.

Bullshit from here please ignore :
There are two other girls with whom I have started talking to. I had crush on one of them in freshman year but not now. I would like to persue her but I think we are just friends. And the other one is just a friend, nothing weird here. And there's one more girl and shes such a good friend.

Anyway, this person was a really toxic friend in my life which I cut off recently, due to how aggressive he got to the point where he would basically bash me up. For some background knowledge, I went to a place with this person and then saw my cousins who went for a few drinks to which they invited me to and I went. I left this person to go see them which ended up me seeing them for a few hours while this other person was waiting the whole time. During these hours my cousin had offered me a cigarette which I took and this persons dad had told him he saw me smoking. Now the person knows I had a smoke and so does his dad, and after when I went back to see my friend he said he would tell my mother about this and basically destroy my life. Now the thing is if she finds out, my family is going to be torn apart and I’ll basically be a disgrace due to the reason I told my parents I quit.

I’m now alarmingly gaunt and sick-looking. My doctor is concerned with my well-being and says at the very minimum I have depression and anxiety that need to be treated immediately. 

I lie awake worrying at night. I feel nervous and empty and shaky every morning. My staff can tell I’m suffering and I feel completely ineffective and inadequate at managing them. I took this job for the attractive salary and great company but I am in way over my head. 

I live in fear that I have dropped the ball on something or screwed up a project, and due to my inability to focus and prioritize my work, I often have. My manager is extremely temperamental and I am at daily risk of getting yelled at, which I do not handle well at all. The position entails lots of corporate politics and scheming, which goes against my very nature and is adding to my misery as I find myself writing emails dictated by my manager and shunning groups of people I would love to get to know better. I never would have taken this job if I could see the person I’ve become after only 2 months. 

I have kids, a mortgage, and no backup plan. I’d be grateful for anyone’s advice or empathy because I am having incredibly dark thoughts and am dreading every new day.

While a bit tipsy she said something that made me frown a million percent. She said ""I don't think I'm racist but"", then said that at dance class she doesn't want to dance with black guys anymore because black guys stink so much. Then she described having to shower afterward so she wouldn't smell it anymore. She even said there's a specific word for this in her language.

At first and second glance this seems to me racist AF. 

But dare I say it: is it? Or is there maybe some weird physiological or cultural thing I'm totally unaware of? I honestly have no idea. (This is obviously a controversial topic.)

So far during our dating we haven't talked politics or society that much, though she reads liberal news sources and has seemed like a pretty normal and open-minded person to me so far. So the statement kind of took me by surprise. 

I don't know if I can just bring it up again casually, like 'hey about that thing you said'. Or is there any other way of knowing what her true beliefs are?

She is three months old, I just got her yesterday and when I got out of the car I was holding her and Texas started freaking out growling, barking, and trying to snip at her. He looked mean! 

I know it's normal for a dog to get threatened.. But she literally was just in my arms, they hadn't even met and he freaked out like that. And no, he's never acted mean or snippy at a dog before and is around dogs a lot and loves them. 

They both have xxl wire crates with a huge dog bed, food, water, toys, etc. last night I kept there crates separated and put a blanket over hers so she could sleep well for the first night and not worry about Texas starring her down. She howled a little bit, and soon fell asleep. He didn't make any noise or bark back. So I thought maybe he was getting used to her existence. 

Morning comes by 6am she woke me up howling, no problem, time to go check on them. Before touching her I made she to love on Texas and feed him and take him potty.. he did sniff and start growling at her cage and acting mean before letting him out potty. So I fed her, and held her in my arms and brought her outside.

 He was doing good, sniffing her, wagging his tail. So then I set her down and she was shaking between my legs. So I crouched over her to make sure if Texas were about to bite or something I was ready to grab her. He started growling when she's on the ground and snipped at her a little and made her yelp for a second. I checked her and didn't see anything, but maybe he just scared her. Yes, I spanked him (not that hard people!!) I just wanted him to know BITING IS NOT OKAY.

 So now it's 8am, I decided to put their wire cages right ext to each other an inch apart and leave them be.. no barking, growling, meanness. I'm hoping this will help him get used to her existence. They're both asleep on their dog beds, a few feet away in complete light. Any advice? Is this normal?






 I don't wanna hear haters saying anything about having them in crates (they're xxl, 6 adults could fit in it), or anything about spanking his butt lol.. I'm not raising a dog that bites. We also live on a 5 acre farm with horses so there's plenty of room for the dogs. ",04Feb2018,1

I initially wrote a very long post but a lot of it was unnecessary information so I started over and cut it down as much as possible. I'm 21 years old. I finished my A levels in 2016 with decent grades. I've spent all of my time since then sitting at home accomplishing nothing.

I applied for a US visa once and a Canadian visa twice but was rejected every single time, despite meeting all the requirements. I can't study in my home country because it has very few good institutions and I wouldn't start until the Autumn semester, wasting another 6 months.

Now that I'm here, I've realized the neighborhood is much more well off, so the clients here have a lot more money. The manager here makes many policy exceptions for them because of this.

My company is heavily regulated by the government, and I feel like working at this location where so many exceptions are made will teach me bad habits, and not the procedures and policies I'm supposed to be learning here. I don't know my new coworkers well, and worry that one of these exceptions might go wrong and if I miss getting them signed off by the manager I may get thrown under the bus.

Beyond the professional worries, working here feels like I'm backing down off personal principles. I'm supporting a place that straight up treats people with money better than those without, and I'm miserable walking in knowing I'm a part of it now.

179,"Hi Reddit!

So, I've decided I want to move the the United States. I would like to move in about 4 month, June 2018.

I live in Israel and I own an Israeli passport &amp; citizenship. I'm eligible for a Polish passport &amp; citizenship, too, if it helps in any way.

Basically I have to get out of Israel. I would like to try to live in the United States while I still feel there's some young in me (I'm 22 years old).

From my knowledge, there are 3 ways in which I can be permitted to go through legally :

1. Marry an American girl

2. Sign up as a student in an American Uni/College

3. Have an employer file some sort of form on my behalf asking to get an employee visa

Now, if we go through a quick elimination process, we'll rule out option 1, because of obvious reasons.

So, as far as I know, I must be a student or an employee. 

I have no idea how to get into U.S. Unis/Colleges. I browsed a couple of websites and they keep mentioning GPA's which is cool and all but I'm from another country and we don't use that method. Also, SAT's? Nope. We don't have them.

We have something called 'Memutsa Bagrut', or, basically, it's the average score of your finals in Highschool, combined with the scores the teachers assigned you with regarding how you performed as a student and mostly how much they like you.

As for SAT's, we have something called a Psychometric Exam, which I'm studying for, but I don't know if it has any international value.

Employee-wise, I know like 3 Americans, 2 of them are family so I can hit them up, but before I do so, I'd really appreciate it if the process will be explained.

So as you can probably tell I'm kind of stressed out about this and I can't really formulate the questions properly. So lemme try :

How much of what I said is correct? Which parts am I getting right?

From what I got wrong, can you correct me please?

What knowledge am I missing?

Anything you feel like you should add is super appreciated.

Please be descriptive, this means so much to me and I have no one to address but the internet.

She goes in and i follow her to my room . she puts on some music from where she comes from and we chill , ( at this point we're super drunk) i offered the pizza but she refused, we chilled for like an hour listening to music , and then again the fucking elevator thing happens. we've talked about how we both feel a connection between us and that we understand each other and you know all that kind of stuff (we've talked about sex ,ex's , friends parties in the parking garage before and she seemed quite comfortable to talk about sex with me) and today we can't get drunk because we've classes tomorrow so we just hangout for like 50 mins we walked around campus and again the fucking elevator thing happens again, and now im sitting here super confused i know i like her but i have no idea what to do because she's like my only friend here and i don't want to ruin it.

190,"More than a year ago, I met this girl randomly, I asked her out and she said yes ( i forgot the last time i asked someone out). But she never texted me. She later told me she was with someone, something that I did'nt believe initially.

After that she made it clear that she was seeing someone and they have been on and off for years. She said they don't do dates, even their friends think they are just friends, so it was something complicated. 

Talking to her was fun, easy, interesting, relatable and endless. We clicked, and in all my life (i am 31), i found someone who i felt was the right mix of things. 

We were talking from sunrise to sunset. For more than a year, hundreds of texts a day, from good morning to good night. She never brought up her bf. And I never asked. 
We just talked like friends. A few times i did ask her what she thinks about us, she said we just get along. And she never tagged it as something. I even forced myself to keep busy at times, to forget about her, but she would always text and bring me right back. 

We only met only a handful of times. To split a cab or something like that. Or never even talked on the phone. It was always texts. Except for the few times she drunk dialled me.

When it did get complicated for me, and I started feeling like i wanted to go on a date with her, I told her that maybe we should talk less often. Because I didnt feel right.

I tried dating again, but I backed away last minute for the date in all cases.

I would never even think of someone sexually just randomly, and as a personal thing I dont even take a second look at someone till I know they are single. 
But it was quite different in this case, it was just as if she was so easy to talk to or we were just like good friends.

Its been 3-4 months now. 
I have tried everything flirting with other girls, or just casually
hooking up to get her off the mind. But i always back off because it  feels stupid.

191,"So, I've fallen hard for this guy at work, like really hard, and I've been in a massive depression ever since. It's been a year since we first met, and I came out to him and told him I had feelings and everything, and he took it well and said things wouldn't change. In other words: the greatest guy in the whole world, can't stop thinking about him every day.

But what is so frustrating, is that whenever I want to talk to him I get really terrified and my mind races and I struggle to think of things to say or how to hold a conversation. When I talk to others who I don't have feelings for, it's a lot easier, but I'm not good at small talk in general and am an introvert, which makes talking to my love even harder and even more frustrating. I wish he knew me more and I knew him more but I get so tongue-tied and mad at myself because there are all these awkward silences because I have trouble with what I want to say. It's not that I am not interested in talking, I am! I wish we could connect more than anything just have normal conversations with ease like he does with other people. I'm getting so frustrated with myself because I can't even articulate myself well on here even. AHH! He must know that I have trouble talking to him, and he clearly has seen me converse with our other friends without much problem or at least I can carry a conversation further with them with less effort, but when it comes to talking to him, it's so hard and I get so mad at myself and then sad because I feel like he doesn't understand me because I don't know how to speak. He's a smart guy, he must know that I'm struggling to talk with him and why. 

Do you think he knows, do you think it is obvious it's because I am in love with him? 

Is it common for someone who loves another and admires, that they are speechless or have trouble talking to that person? 

Would it be obvious to my love? 

I just want to know because, with all the awkward conversations, I hope he gives me some slack because it's hard to ignore that I'm clearly struggling when I talk to him. I end up feeling like a complete fool and embarrassed and worry that he thinks less of me because I'm giving him a hard time trying to communicate with him.

I guess, without asking him directly, do you think he knows what I'm going through and why I struggle, and that he knows I love and want to talk to him more but can't? 

I've told him all this come to think of it, but it's been a while. Do you think he still knows and understands me enough to not be angry or annoyed at me for my awkward ways?

Why is it that somehow who loves another struggles to talk to that person? Why is it so easy to talk to other people you don't have feelings for?",04Feb2018,0
192,"The gift idea is for everyone in my choir to write both of our directors notes and put them all into a box to give to them. Because we have mailboxes to write each other encouragement cards for when we go to this state convention. But I’ve been wanting to write them a card to thank them for everything, so then I thought to get the whole choir to participate. 
We’re leaving in a little less then two weeks, which is plenty of time, but I’ll have to keep track of who gives me their cards and whatnot. I know everyone in my choir, but I am not best friends with everyone, you know?? So I’m afraid when I tell them, they’ll forget to write a card and then I have to keep reminding them everyday to write one. Then I’m afraid that I’ll come off as being pushy and annoying, but I just really want to give back to my choir directors because they’ve done so much for me and everyone else.  
So I guess I’m asking, how do I get this gift done without coming off as rude and pushy? ",04Feb2018,2
193,"I was sitting next to this guy in class and he ended up asking for ""help"" (when he really just wanted to copy my answers). I know this kid a little bit since we went to the same elementary school; I ended up backhanding him across the face in forth grade, but I don't know him well. At the time I was not in the greatest mood and I was having problems with socializing (I'm socially anxious), and when this happens I either: A)., Be curt and rude, B). Robotic, with fill-in answers, or C). I word vomit words that are similar to the original statement but have a different meaning. Back to this in a bit

After I denied my ""help,"" he said ""Go fuck yourself"" - a term widely used by teenage boys. At this point, my mind shut down and went to C mode - word vomit. What I wanted to say was, ""It'd be better than fucking you.""

What I said was....

""Well, I want you to fuck me.""

KEEP IN MIND THAT I DO NOT LIKE THIS GUY WHATSOEVER! AT MOST I CONSIDER HIM AN ACQUAINTANCE!

When he heard the statement his eyes got the ""Oh my god, a chance for a ho and go?"" kind of look.  He said, ""What? Hold on... I'm just gonna pretend like I didn't hear that"". At that point I was beet red trying to explain my situation in broken English and groans of embarrassment. I asked my friends for advice but they don't know what to do.

So, what do I do? How do I tell him that I have no feelings for him before he spreads around that the nerdy book girl is horny for him?

.....Ehhhhh, every time I think about it I cringe to the point in which I have a multitude of chins.

196,"Facts first.

A person lives in a Chinese city. S/he is enrolled in a programme jointly held by a Chinese school and a New Zealand school. Both school are public in their home countries. The two schools operate independently. The programme is such that a student studies at the Chinese school for two years first, then proceed to the NZ school for another two or three years (depending on English skills level). After graduation, s/he will get a degree/diploma from the NZ school, and can seek employment in NZ or return to China.

When s/he was studying at the Chinese school, s/he payed school fees (CNY1,500 per semester) to the Chinese school and no fees to the NZ school.

That person is now studying at the NZ school. S/he now pays the international student's fees to the NZ school. S/he also, at the same time, is paying the CNY1,500 to the Chinese school. Payment to the NZ school is made by international wire. Payment to the Chinese school is made by domestic bank transfer in China.

I sincerely ask for your opinion on this. What do you think?

=====

Here are my concerns. I try to be neutral and not make any hints in my passage above. Now here comes my questions and what I think I should do.

First off, I am a total bystander on this issue. You can take it as if I read it from reddit like you do. I am not the person. I have nothing to do with either school. I have never interacted with any of them at the moment.

I feel that this continuous payment to the Chinese school is wrong. S/he is now studying full-time in NZ, has nothing to do with the Chinese school anymore supposedly. S/he takes no courses with the Chinese school now, and does not have to go back to China to do additional courses in the future. Especially the comparison makes me wonder, why s/he has to pay the Chinese school while studying in NZ, whereas s/he didn't have to pay NZ school while studying in China. So my concerns would be as follows.

1. Is the NZ school aware of students' payment to the Chinese school?
2. Is this payment necessary (as agreed in the terms between the two schools)?
3. Is this payment legal?

The worst I can contemplate is, the Chinese school is taking advantage of the students, and the NZ side is either kept out of the loop, or turning a blind eye. The programme has been going for a few years. Each year there're about 50 students, so the total number of students studying in NZ at any one time is about 150. 1,500x2x150=CNY450,000 per year.

I feel that I should send an email to the NZ school's programme director, school principal, school's board of directors, and, if necessary, the NZ government. I should inform them of the students' ongoing payment to the Chinese school and ask if they know about it and what they think about it.

Whatever I said above is all correct as what I heard. There is only omission of details for the sake of protection of privacy, and absolutely no twist of the story. But the fact that it's NZ and CNY1,500 per sem will let anyone involved in the programme know immediately I am talking about their programme. NZ is not that big a place innit :)

198,Okay so about a month ago my best friend got a boyfriend who seems to me like a carbon copy of her ex. He made a pact to her saying he wouldn't smoke weed.

199,"So I’m 21, and my boyfriend (28) and I are looking to move into a nice complex in our area, but found out yesterday our application is on hold for drug charges that came up in my background check.

All of this is pending still, and my credit is pretty bad, but I’ve never had anything to do with trafficking or sale.

My boyfriend however has near perfect credit, no charges, and a perfect renting history (mine is good as well). How likely do you think it is that we’ll be barred because of me? And is there anything I can do in the future to get a nice place like this with my background? I know I need to take care of this but even if I do it’s still going to be on my record.

200,"So my girlfriend and I are both 19. We've been going out for over a year now, and every time the says or does something hypocritical, or makes a bias/flawed argument, I call her out on it.

She doesn't have much past experience with boys, so I don't think she's ever learned how to deal with this kind of criticism. 

I'm not really sure how to approach this. I can keep calling her out on BS and let our relationship will continue to degrade, or just not call her out on anything. Both seem like terrible options.

205,"I can't tell if my friends are really good friends. They don't talk behind my back or anything, but it seems like it is easy for them not to care about me, or maybe they think i'm easy going and don't need to be reassured.

Friend 1, who doesn't ever reply to me on facebook, which is the only way I can talk to him when I'm at college. He never starts any conversations with me, which is fine because he is really busy at college I guess. I'm a senior in college, and back in highschool sophomore year, he told me that he thought our mutual friend was his best friend. I could never get over that in highschool, where before I thought the three of us were best friends after that I felt like they were best friends and I was an outlier. This haunted me for the rest of highschool, even though we were still all friends. He is this really weird friend who everyone gets along with because since we all met years and years ago, he never really tells us verbally he cares about us. He never tells us if he's angry or sad or happy. He doesn't show emotions and very very raraely gives his opinion. In this way he makes friends with everyone very easily because he is easy going. But he is not someone I can really share my thoughts with. When we are both back in our hometown though, he is always very excited to hang out with me and invites me over. He is a great friend when we are all back home, and that has never changed.

This other friend, friend 2, is still friends with me also, but the friendship is funny. He only seems to message me if I message him first or if he's having one of his overly nice euphoria moments. He will go on facebook and make posts about how he loves all his friends and he will message all the group chats and personal chat to say something overly nice. I think he is also very scared that he doesn't have any close friends to talk to because he is the only friend who is not going to college, and is stuck at home. But if he is not having one of these days he could take a few days to reply to me, and he seems to sugar coat whatever he says. I can't trust his opinions, because everything is always ""great"" and all my art i show him is ""awesome"" and i'm one of the ""best artists"" he is friends with. I know that sounds just like a nice friend, but he talks this way to everyone so as to make sure everyone likes him, and it feels not genuine. Of course he still wants to be good friends, because he is scared of losing these relationships, but he comes off as shallow. He is also broke so whenever i'm in my hometown I have to drive him around and pay for his food, movie tickets..so on.

Now friend 3 is someone who was very jealous of me in the past. I dated someone in 8th grade who he was really into and he liked her and flirted with her for the next two years. A few years later I stopped talking to my ex who was now with someone new (we broke up on good terms). He would constantly tell me how even though he (friend 3) and my ex were not dating, that he told her his dick size and that she said I was smaller, and how if she wasn't dating said guy than she would be fucking him (friend 3) and so on. I think he was still jealous and trying to make me feel like he could get with my ex, or he was better than me.

In senior year of highschool i was about to date my current gf. One night after hanging out with her and all my other friends including friend 3, I drive him home. I told him I was really interested in her, and he says that he thinks she doesn't like me, and was more interested in him. After a few more hangouts when I am literally holding hands with said girl, he starts messing with her feet and flirting with her. Our friend group would hang after school and he would say things like ""she is driving in my car today!"". It was really fucked up. After we got serious he stopped flirting but this kind of thing always messed with me. He treats me like a child as i've always been the silly and non-serious in our friend group. He talks at me and now since we are both at college, he constantly barrages me with communist theory and stupid shit on facebook. I have never had a real conversation with him in years. I feel like he still really enjoys being my frined, but he is pretentious and acts superior to our friend group because he has confidence issues.

Whenever i'm back in town it is like everything is fine again, we all hang out and we all have fun, but this little quirks of all my friends always come back. A lot of the time after hanging out I feel drained, but sometimes our friendships feel just as genuine as they ever were. I know in this post I focused on the terrible things that makes me wary of them, but they have all been my friends since I was really young. This kind of sounds like a post that someone who is in denial about having shitty friends would post, but these people all genuinely still like me. Friend 1 always wants to hang out and asks me about my art when we are home, friend 2 likes to stay over at my house and talk to me about life, and friend 3 likes to debate and talk about high brow things and also dumb videogames we both care about. The way he used to flirt with my grilfriends ended 4 years ago and feels like the distant past. But there is this other side to all my friends that at some points make me feel very lonely.

I moved a lot, it's like every stage of my life (kindergarten, school, bachelor's degree, master's degree) happened to be in another town. I never had any close relationships to people but my family and I am living far away from my family by choice. Somehow I am not feeling ""home"" anywhere. During my time at university I didn't even really set up my flat, because I thought I won't stay here long. 

Now I am working at an IT company for three years and I am still feeling like I won't work here long. The company is a startup, maybe it won't survive. It's also placed in a very small town, and I am living 1 hour away in a much bigger town. But I am not moving close because had to move out of that small town soon anyways that's just waste of time and money.

214,"So I live in an apartment complex, and my next door neighbor owns two small dogs. They bark pretty much constantly. It’s a bit annoying, but at the same time I understand that she cannot control when the dogs bark and that I live in an apartment so naturally some concessions have to be made so that we can all live near one another, because that’s the whole basis of society. 

The problem, however, is that said neighbor is *constantly* screaming at the dogs. Whenever she takes them outside so they can do their business, I and all the other neighbors are treated to dialogues such as “GET YER FUCKIN ASS BACK HERE AND SHIT YOU FUCKIN BITCH”. The walls are paper thin, so whenever the dogs make a noise next door she makes insightful comments such as “WHY DON’ YOU LIE DOWN AND SHUT THE FUCK UP GODDAMNIT”. 

I try so hard to ignore it but Christ alive it’s annoying. I mean for god’s sake who screams at dogs all day? I’m afraid I’m going to lose it one day are run outside and yell at her, so I’d like to resolve it in a more peaceful manner if possible.

222,"This may get long so bare with me. I previously attended a large, public, yet very prestigious public school. To be honest, I never truly wanted to go here so I was pretty depressed there. It has a distinct vibe that is not for everybody. During my entire first year I knew that it wasn’t a good fit and had filled transfer apps to apply to smaller, private schools that were all higher ranked according to US News and I got into most of them. Then in like April I really fell in love with someone and those feelings made me forget about my initial desires to transfer as I was happy and stupid in love. (Love will do that to you kids… be careful). So second year I came back to this school and instantly realized how big of a mistake I made. At that very instant I called a particular school that I had gotten into and asked if I could come, if not this semester than next semester, but they said I would have to reapply for next year. I was shattered, and spent the rest of the year just waiting for my “real life to begin” the following year. I spent every day regretting my decision to not transfer when I had the chance.. literally every day. I was so hard on myself for making that mistake. I actually started liking the school more my second semester of my second year, but knowing how much I regretted not transferring the first time around, I made sure to transfer this time. So now for my third year of college, I decided to transfer to the highly ranked, private school. The school’s demographics suited me better and I just thought it would be great. However as a junior transfer, things have been harder than I thought. I had known that things as a transfer are not easy, so I had beforehand planned exactly what clubs I wanted to be involved in and there were 2 that I was very keen on. These clubs look great and would be a great way to meet a lot of people and I was excited. Upon arriving on campus, I realized that both of them are very competitive and for both of them I made it all the way to the final round and then didn’t make it in- one was a business frat. I was told by several members later that the only reason I didn’t get in was that I was a junior and they mainly only take freshman or sophomores, and the same thing happened with the other club. Also this school is very greek, so even if I meet cool people it’s not that I will hang out with them or go out with them because everyone just does that with their brothers/sisters. I have nothing at all against greek life, I think it’s a great way to meet people- but it just sucks when you’re not in one. Most people I know are other transfers which I don’t like.

It's so frustrating because I can objectively say that this school is so much better and would have been beyond perfect for me if I went here from the start or even if I transferred as a sophomore- as I could have joined what I wanted to and also rushed a sorority. And I will always, for the rest of my life, regret not transferring after my freshman year. So now I’m just in some random clubs with some acquaintances and no matter how good and perfect fit a school is, it won’t be fun if that’s what the situation is. My ""type"" of people are in Greek life so it's hard. So I’m in the second semester of my third year, and just feeling so low because I know that I ruined college for myself. I had so, so, much potential in every aspect- socially, professionally but I wasted it. Anyways, I’m just not sure what to do now. This didn’t turn out as well, so I’m considering transferring back. I’m afraid I have “the grass is greener on the other side” syndrome, but also I think it maybe worth it because I can graduate from my original school in only one more semester (AP credits + some credits from this school would transfer there), and it would take one more year after this where I am now. College didn’t turn out how I wanted it to, because my own issues, lack of good decision making skills, etc. but I really did try this year- so now I’m thinking to just take the L and move on with my life. How bad/weird is to go back? Again, my primary motivation is just so I can graduate asap and also, I have more friends there. Also, in my country of origin where all my relatives live, my original school is actually a lot more well-known (even though its ranked lower according to US News). Also, one reason graduating early is appealing is because I want to give acting in my country of origin a shot, and those months would be perfect to give it my all to audition and stuff. I’m sure that I can secure a full time job with a good company for when summer of next year ends during my first semester of my senior year, but during that second semester I can try fulfilling my dream- and if during that time, it doesn’t work out, I’ll get back to the real world and I wouldn’t have ruined any employment prospects for myself.

Since I became a dad, I've felt this need to know who my own father was. Originally I never wanted to contact him, I just wanted to know who he was, so I spent the last year tracking down my mom's former acquaintances, reading her journals and looking at her photographs, trying to find him. After I found the man who was most likely my father, I tracked him down and since I'm a coward I didn't just knock on his door and tell him that I think that he's my dad, I went to his business and pretended to be a customer so that I could have a conversation with him, and see if we had similar voices, gestures etc. and surely enough we did.

225,"So I think my husband is an alcoholic. Well actually I know he is. 

This is a throwaway because I know many people who use reddit and I don't want anyone to find out about this issue.

So anyway my husband has a habit of drinking too much and hiding alcohol. He had told me numerous times he is going to stop and then I'll find little bottles of wine throughout the house. 

I can tell he's drunk because one I can smell it on him, two his eyes are glazed over, and 3 he will slur his words.

Anyway during Christmas he told me he was quitting drinking. He got rid of all the alcohol in the house and stopped drinking when we go out.  He fell off the wagon Friday. 

He brought home a six pack and I admit I was a little pissed off.  I knew when he drank it he would get sick and he did. He had 2 beers and threw up.  He fell asleep by 830 and woke up at 2 and drank the rest of the six pack.  Saturday he bought another 6 pack and drank them sat/today plus I think he bought those little bottles of wine again.

We got into an argument and I told him how I felt, but he's not talking to me because he thinks I don't love him (I do very very much) because he's weak and stupid.

My question is, I love my husband very much and he knows he has a problem and I know he has one too. But how do I help him get through this.  I'm not mad I am just extremely disappointed in him.  I kept telling him how proud I was of him giving up drinking and supported him 110%  (I don't drink so it's easy for me to keep him away from temptations at home).

P.s it's not like i wanna change person for my benefit, it's more like for her benefit in the first place. I heard her complaining that she wan't to but she can't (feeling awkward most of the time).",04Feb2018,1

232,"I was 19, and worked for a family friends small business. When I first started working she didn’t have me fill any paperwork out, didn’t need my ssn or anything. It was my first “real” job, so I didn’t know that was out of the ordinary. I worked four days a week, from 10-5. She wasn’t often in the office, so most of the time it was just me scheduling appts and helping clients, placing orders online, cleaning the store, product display, and I even handled all of the marketing. 

About six months into me working, she referred to me as a 1099. I had no idea what that was, she has never mentioned it before, so I googled it. And I found out the definition of a 1099 compared to an actual employee, and I completely 100% fit the description of an employee. She was planning on claiming I am a 1099 so she doesn’t have to pay any extra taxes. She was doing this with the medical biller as well. 

In October, I was given time off due to my boss having a family emergency. That same day, I was contacted by the feds and was told they had my computer. I had left my laptop in the office that last night and they picked it up in a raid. I then was asked to come in for questioning, and I obliged. My old boss was being investigated for insurance fraud, which was both surprising to me and not surprising. Not surprising because I had seen many suspicious things throughout my time working there. And I knew how she ran the business. I was practically running everything except billing, as she only ever came in for appointments (20min late to every one might I add). So I quit. I knew she was doing wrong to the women we were supposed to be helping, and that always made me uncomfortable. 

After quitting, she went off on me telling me I was ungrateful for what she had done for me. Sure, she gave me a job and I really appreciated that, but I did way more for her business than she did for me. I kept the office open day to day, I redid her website, created social media accounts, I did photography shoots of the products, created and ran an amazon market account that upped sales by 60%!!!!!!! I did so much for this business. I truly loved what I did, it just hurt to have a boss doing what she did. Among the many shady things she did business wise, she also would talk terribly about the women we helped. We provide women who had undergone mastectomies due to breast cancer with bras and prosthesis. We had to fit the products on the women, so we did see some pretty bad scarring and things from the surgical site. She constantly made comments to me about how these women smelled, how they were trashy and disgusting. That has to be the only thing that makes me happy not to work there, not being around that type of awful negativity. 

Around The end of October I contacted her to let her know I was aware of her trying to misfile me as a 1099. She said I had known I was a 1099, but I had no clue until I heard her saying that’s what I was halfway through my time there, and googled it! So no, I did not know. I realize I was stupid to not look into it more when I first started, but she was a family friend who I trusted to do right by me as I was her. She didn’t reply to me after a couple messages after saying that I would receive a W2 to fill out, and I told her I expected her to file me correctly, so I let it go. It was nearing the end of November and I had not received anything. so I contacted her again to let her know I hadn’t yet received anything, and all she said was I would hear from her attorney and her accountant. I have not heard anything, so I let it go again. She doesn’t have my ssn or any information other than my name, so I didn’t claim the job on my taxes. 

Anyway, I am still somehow attached to the Facebook page for the business, and I get the notifications. I see that there is now another young woman is posting to the page and I don’t want her to get all screwed up by the way the business is run if she is working there. 

Should I message her on FB and warn her about everything? Or at least tell her I was an old employee that was done wrong, and that if she is working there, she should make sure to fill out a W-2 and make sure she’s being filed as a true employee?

So I'm hopeless. I thought a lot and I remembered that two months ago, I got the flu and slept for three days, then did nothing for two. I had so much work to do by the end of the week, with deadlines almost every day. And so I worked almost every hour possible for 5days, slept 5-6hours. I don't remember if I was happy or sad, I was just doing those things, and I managed to do everything. I was kinda proud but after that I never really worked until now. I had even more important deadlines a few weeks ago and yet I've just let things fuck up and drunk to sleep and forget. That never happened before yet nothing really changed except my failures may matter a bit more now but still.

238,"Hi Everyone,

tl;dr: Friend's ex-boyfriend shows up at her house unexpected and unwanted, refuses to stop calling her and messaging her, calls her names, when he is angry, accuses her of things that aren't true, and basically is emotionally abusing her. He will not leave her alone despite her requests to, and she is afraid to report him because he is a cop. What should she do?

My friend has been seeing this guy for a little over a year. It was not serious - it started off as just someone to spend time with and occasionally go out with. They didn't start calling each other boyfriend/girlfriend until only a couple months ago. She ended the relationship with him because he tried to take the relationship to the next level (moving in together) which she was not comfortable with and also because he has a very bad temper and she just didn't see the relationship going anywhere.

Since she ended things, he does not stop calling and texting her. She blocked his number, and he has showed up at her house about 3x, all unexpectedly and unwanted, and he would not leave when she asked him to. He forces her to see him and talk to him, then gets mad at her for not wanting to hang out with him.

Yesterday her and I were out, and he found out where we were, showed up, and yelled at her in public. That was my first time meeting him, and he honestly sounded so crazy and delusional (I hope he was drunk because if he wasn't, he has a warped perception of reality and is really, really, irrational and crazy). He said a lot of weird things, like ""I'm literally just trying to talk to you. I'm not yelling at you!"" even though he was definitely yelling, he accused her of being with another guy, and then maliciously brought up the fact that she has a daughter (whom she didn't introduce him to, but he ended up meeting recently when he showed up at her house one day and invited himself in). When he is mad, he yells out anything he can - such that she is a slut, a whore, stupid, a bad mother, etc. This is definitely abusive behavior.

She is afraid to call the cops because he IS a cop. She thinks the other cops will just take his side, and then he will be even angrier and crazier with her for reporting him. She is scared of him (and I am too), so she just does nothing. What should she do? His behavior absolutely isn't okay. For reference, he is with the NYPD.

Thanks in advance to everyone.

242,"Hello and thank you for your thoughts! My wife and I are newlyweds living in the Midwest. Our main hope for this post is to get advice on the following: when to start trying for kids/adoption process, when to buy a house, and what to consider when deciding where to settle down permanently. 

Jobs: We both have masters degrees and teach full time. Student loans are all paid off and we have retirement accounts + $30k in regular savings. I see myself always being a teacher, but she eventually wants to get a PhD in applied linguistics or TESOL. In other words, we may need to move for her education.

Kids/pets: we would like to get a dog soon and have kids in about 5 years. Flexibile depending on where we settle and how our jobs end up. We would like one of us to stay at home for the first couple of years.

Location: we love to travel. Midwest cost of living allows us to do so enough for our liking. However, we absolutely loved the pacific northwest and are considering moving there permanently if the job market is permissive.

What might we not be considering in terms of finances, moving far away from family permanently, and how a PhD program might affect everything mentioned above? ",04Feb2018,2
246,"My grandma recently retired and has a pretty good pension because she was a social worker at a school. She gave me a large amount of money that she had been saving up for a long time, almost $800. She made the check out to my name, however, I do not have a bank account, so my parents would have to cash it in. My parents are saying that I need to save that money for college applications or a new computer to take with me to school (I am a junior in high school.)

I understand that that large amount of money is best to be saved for college-related things, and I certainly do not want to blow all of it (that would be stupid), but I'd like to spend some of it on things such as new clothes, new lights for my room (mine are broken), or an eyeshadow pallete that I've been eyeing (ha, get it) for a while. My grandma did not specify what I had to use it for, she said I could spend that money on ""whatever you want"". When I explained this to my mom and dad, they said that I am a minor and that money like that falls under their jurisdiction.

I plan to open a bank account and get a job over the summer to save up for college, potentially lease a car, or to pay for some of those things that I want, but truthfully ya girl just wants some new clothes, you feel? 

So my question is, does money like that truly fall under my parents' jurisdiction? Would they be able to control it if they cashed it in? Does it still fall under their jurisdiction if my grandma cashed it in and gave the money to me? If I had a bank account as a minor and cashed the check in, would my parents still be able to control that money? Or, should I just save the money for college and wait until I get a job to pay for those things that I want? 

Thank you so much!

248,"This is a very strange situation, and I usually don't seek advice from people online but the information is too sensitive to talk to someone I know atm. 

I'll start by saying that my girlfriend and I play games with a group of people online whom we've come to have strong friendships with. One of the guys we talk to a lot, we'll call him Mark, was taking his friends about 3 hours away from where we live so he thought it'd be cool if we all could hang out and shit. Keep in mind we're all very young and even though I know when I'm making stupid decisions I have trouble stopping myself. Anyway, we hang out, go to the mall, rent a motel to stay for the night (which was our idea because we wouldn't be able to crash at our parent's house with a ""stranger"") and Mark and I smoke some weed and drink. I usually wouldn't say this but I feel like it's rather important; I didn't want to drink as much or smoke as much as he wanted me to because I rarely do either and I have a very low tolerance. I made sure for the safety of my girlfriend that he fell asleep first and waited a few hours before I fell asleep to assure that he wasn't going to wake up. 

Well fast forward to the morning, Mark gets up and calls his friend and says he has to go pick them up. He asks my girlfriend for a hug and she hugs him and he leaves. A few hours later both of us are awake and I ask her if she wants to take a shower, which we do. About 20 minutes into the shower I ask her whats wrong and she breaks down crying. 

According to my girlfriend (whom I've been with for over 2.5 yeahs), Mark was ""teasing"" her and took her over to the other side of the room and tried having sex with her. She claimed to have repeatedly pulled up her pants and pushed him away, but his story says otherwise. According to her, they had sex for about a minute and then she went and laid in bed with me. According to Mark, she ""finished"" and heard a loud noise and ran into the bed. 

I asked her why she won't call the cops and she said it's because she never said the word ""stop"", which makes her think she doesn't have a case. I'm at the point where if she doesn't take some sort of action then I will either end our relationship until we have time to mend it, or find out where he lives and end up getting a life sentence. 

When I asked her why she didn't scream my name she said she didn't want anyone to get her and didn't know what to do. When I asked her why she didn't tell me when she woke up and hugged him, she said she wasn't sure what was going on because she just woke up. 

I'm not saying I don't believe my girlfriend, but I don't understand why she wouldn't tell me prior to him leaving and why she didn't scream for help when I was literally 15 feet away. 

This is a lot to think about and a lot to try to comprehend, but I feel like she would want justice. I told her repeatedly that it wasn't her fault and she has nothing to be ashamed of, but she's still reluctant.

I don't know how I'm going to be able to look at her or her parents and not feel like a horrible person. I feel like the only way for for me to fix it is to do something I really don't want to do, but every part of me is saying to do so.

250,"recently one of my friends made a comment about by my lack of fashion and it’s been bothering me for a while. specifically, i made mention how i’m not all that well versed in the ins and outs of clothing and styles and she responded with “oh, i know” in the type of annoyed factual voice people usually take when they roll their eyes (which she did too). i’m sure it was meant in all fun and games but it’s been bothering me for a bit now, especially since this is not the first time people in my life have made comments about my style, or lack of it i should say.

to put in to context: i don’t wear outlandish clothing. actually, i always thought i’ve dressed rather plain? my usual getup is jeans, a t-shirt, a jacket, a beanie, and a pair of either converse or hiking boots. all of my stuff is clean (no stains/smell) when i wear it and i make sure my hair isn’t tangled. as far as i know, that’s just common everyday attire. 

my question is do people really care about what they wear everyday? like i know sometimes people dress up cuz they wanna feel cool or cute or whatever, but is everyday clothing supposed to look a certain way? if so how? (btw i’m a guy if that helps)

260,"I gave my friend two racks ($2,000) to build me a custom aquarium fish tank for my new apartment, and she is literally hopscotching around town with my money and has yet to provide me with a fish tank!

Here's how it all went down. My friend and I met in college. She is a fish/aquatic enthusiast and builds some of the best in-home aquariums i have ever seen. She started a side hustle a couple years ago where she builds custom tanks for people. I figured I wouldn't mind having me a tank since I just moved into my new home. I expressed my interests, she showed me her catalogue, drew up a few sketches, and we sat down and talked numbers. 

She told me she couldn't give me an exact figure just yet but she will take a deposit and give me a final invoice once the work is complete. She estimated the work to be worth at least $3,000 and no more than $4,000 and the deposit would be 50% of the top end. Around New Years, I gave her a deposit of TWO STACKS ($2,000) and signed a contract / statement of work. 

As I trust all my friends, I didn't bother getting copies of the paperwork because I prefer to do business informally with friends. Fast forward to mid January on the day she's supposed to come over my house with the materials and start building out the tank: I get a text from her early in the morning saying ""hey, something came up. Let's reschedule."" I was of course disappointed, but giving her the benefit of the doubt, I told her it was fine and agreed to reschedule. We rescheduled for two days later. Two days later, she misses our appointment time. After two hours of waiting, I start calling and texting her like, ""yo, what's going on? where are you?"" She ignores all of my phone calls and then FIVE hours later texts me back saying ""Hey, hope your day's going well. Had a family emergency. Let me know what's a good day for us to reschedule.""

At this point, I am PISSED off! I was so pissed to the point that I started blowing her phone up with missed calls. After calling her ten times, she finally answered saying ""Hey, my phone's been on silent, is everything ok?"" I told her ""Honestly at this point I don't know if I feel comfortable doing business because it feels like you're playing with my time and my money and that's a problem. If you're not going to keep your commitments, you need to refund my deposit."" Then she says, ""No that won't be necessary. I deeply apologize and I know it makes me look, bad but I hope you can understand that this is honestly a hard time for me right now with all my family is dealing with so please give me another chance."" 

I tried to be more understanding and I apologized to her for overreacting and not being understanding. Then she told me she would come by next week and start the work. Next week comes by, and she texts me saying her dog was ""sick"" and could she come over the next day instead. Again, I got extremely upset and just asked for all of my money back. Now here's where things get juicy. Below is a transcript of our text message exchange:

* **Myself:** At this point, I no longer feel comfortable doing business with you. Please return my $2,000 deposit in full and we will call it quits with no hard feelings.

* **She:** Yes, I understand, friend. Unfortunately, I am embarrassed to tell you that I'm having cash flow issues at the moment. I'll pay you $200 of your deposit now, and I'm going to pay back the rest when I get my cash flow up."" 

* **Myself:** Excuse me??? your cash flow issues have nothing to do with me. Since I paid you a full deposit you need to return my FULL deposit. 

* **She:** Honestly, literally do not have it at the moment . . . had to pay some bills and I don't get paid for another two weeks . . . 

* **Myself:** Not sure what kind of business you're operating that you take people's down deposits to pay your personal expenses . . . shouldn't you be placing deposits in some type of escrow account????

* **She:** True. I use a spreadsheet to keep track of personal funds and customer funds. I was only borrowing from your deposit since I ran out of personal funds but I do plan to replenish it as soon as I get the money back.  

* **Myself:** That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard! So the real reason you've been cancelling on me is not your ""family"" issues but your money issues. You don't even have the money I gave you to buy the materials! 

* **She:** Honestly, I was embarrassed to tell you that I ran out of money so I was trying to buy more time until I got my funds up to get the supplies etc. 

* **Myself:** If you're this sloppy, and DISHONEST, with business I should just sue you now!

* **She:** First off, I technically don't owe you a dime until the contract period expires! As outlined in the contract that YOU signed, you agreed to allow me up to 90 days to perform the work due to unforeseen circumstances, scheduling conflicts, etc. before a deposit refund is due. Maybe if you didn't have your head so far up your ex girlfriend's behind you would've been able to read the fine print of the paperwork you signed silly! LOL. As for suing me, I doubt you want to do that. We both know you'll spend more money on attorney fees than what you'll get back so I would advise you to cooperate with me before this gets ugly . . . 

A few days ago, my good friend told me he saw her at the mall buying a $300 handbag and she had other shopping bags and was clearly on a shopping spree. How is she having cash flow issues, yet she has money to go on shopping sprees? I should've listened to my friend last year who warned me about her. He told me not to let her build my tank because people say she has a very ""absent-minded"" borderline ""shady"" way of doing business. I figured it couldn't be too complicated to pay someone to build a simple aquarium and it's not like I'm hiring her to be my lawyer or anything serious, so I figured my friend was hating because he can't afford to buy an aquarium. 

So naively, I decided to move forward with the deal despite the rumors and that has turned out to be the biggest and worst financial mistake! She is the grimiest person ever! To this day, she has not paid back a dime of my deposit, not even the $200 she promised until she gets paid. Whenever I call or text her, she ignores me. At this point, I am so over things I don't know what to do. If I sue her, I would only wind up losing even more money in the end. But it burns me up like fire to know that she is basically swindling me and possibly other people while she goes foo-lah-lah-ing around town with our hard earned money to her benefit, avoiding her contract duties!


**TLDR: What is the best way to deal with a friend that I paid $2,000 to build a custom fish tank aquarium and this friend spent my money on personal expenses and is making every excuse in the book not to pay back my money after she literally cancels every appointment we have for her to start building the tank????** ",04Feb2018,4

265,"So, I'm going to make this as vague as I can and still get the gist across, because it's a pretty unique set of circumstances and I don't want to attach identifiers. Throwaway, obviously. 

I first met...let's call him Alex... the summer before my final year of college, when I was on a work placement in his office. He works in an office that's dominated by women, and in an industry that is increasingly so. We stayed in touch after my internship for more than a year, and I graduated and I went to work in my hometown. He was there for me when I had a terrifying experience being stalked by a former client, and suggested that I move to his city and try to break into work in the same industry there. I trusted him, we were close, and there'd never been a hint of anything improper. I wanted badly to get out of the city I was in and keep my whereabouts unknown to my stalker, and his city is definitely a great place to break into our industry. He said I could stay on his couch for a little while while I got my feet under me. 

When I arrived, things got weird fast. Alex advocated on my behalf while I looked for work, and eventually told me that he had feelings for me. When I respectfully rebuffed him -- saying that it wouldn't be appropriate for us to have a relationship while I was dependent on him for housing and without an income of my own, he said that he just wanted to support me, but slowly grew hard and mean and then stopped speaking to me at all-- he'd come home from work and immediately close his door. We eventually got into a fight, and he kicked me out of the apartment, into a strange city. I didn't have much money or any friends there. I called a friend from college, sobbing, and her friend-- a total stranger, and an angel-- came and picked me up. I got very lucky that day. I stayed with the friend's friend and eventually found a cheap apartment and restaurant work before landing my current job. 

Alex and I never had any kind of a romantic relationship. He's older than me and important in our field, which is somewhat public-facing and has been one of the areas affected by the #metoo movement. I got a foothold here on my own and am doing very well for myself, but we know enough of the same people that I have run into him at a party more than once (we didn't acknowledge the other's presence). A few days ago, almost perfectly on the anniversary of the fight and subsequent expulsion, I got a text message, saying that he's sorry for the way things happened, he'd be happy to meet up, but he understands if I don't want to. 

I am torn. On one hand, he behaved like an ass, and I am pretty certain that he wants to smooth things over to protect his reputation as I am in this industry, moving up, and not going away, and kicking a vulnerable young woman out of your house because you're mad she doesn't want to sleep with you is a bad look. On the other hand, I'm going to keep running into him whether I want to or not, and pragmatically, it seems like it could be something more easily handled head-on to prevent drama. 

Reddit, what should I do? I haven't responded to the text yet.

266,"Here's another whiny teen-ager post for all of you reading.

I decided to change schools this semester and study in a different country (studying in Scotland now) because I think a degree from here would be better than a 3rd world country degree. This is all worked out with my family and fine. The problem comes with subject selection.  I ended up taking 4 university application level subjects instead of five, and the subject I should have taken might clash with another one I want, or may not even be there at all.

This wouldn't be so much of a problem if I knew what I wanted to study in university. I'm considering engineering and medicine, but i feel medicine needs a bit of passion. I have no great desire to study anything, I just want a stable career and not to end up in a job I hate or stuck in a jobless limbo.

So I'll just ask here, did any of you guys go to university with no real passion? How did you pick whatever subject you did?

For those of you who know a bit more about the Scottish education system, I'm doing higher maths, higher history, higher chemistry, higher English and NAT 5 biology. I should have taken higher physics, but I didn't.",04Feb2018,2

It's safe to say this hit my ego and self confidence like a truck. I feel like shit I don't really know what to do I can only go to some bs subjects next semester since all of the main ones are connected to the main ones in the first semster. Basically I have 8 months of nothing to do and i can either quit uni and try something else I was considering military or police (since im pretty fit and enjoy both of those) or I can stick it out pay the 8 grand to repeat the first year and give it all I've got.

271,"I met my current roommate through work (on opening staff of a new place). At the time, he had just moved to town with his girlfriend. We got to know each other in group settings over casual drinks and nights out. I always thought he was attractive but respected the fact that he was in a relationship.


A couple months after we meet, he and the girlfriend break up. She moves back to the city where they came from (10 hours away) and he has a month to find a new place.


Right after their breakup, we were out with a group and everyone else went home. He and I ended up staying out and going back to his place/hooking up. Probably the best sex I've had, chemistry is off the charts. Hook up another time about a week later and then things sort of fizzle because we're both busy and he's looking for a place.


Then my then-roommate hits me with a bombshell and suddenly I need a new roommate in my place. Coworker moves into my house and I just assume we're done hooking up. We're both casually dating other people until we get drunk a few weeks after he moved in and hook up at our now-shared house.


Keeps happening every week or so. We got closer as the six months and now it feels like our lives are sort of merged. We go to the gym/work out together, cook each other food, decorate/clean the house together, and he is quick to do little things I need around the house (fixing cabinets, hanging shelves, etc.) that I ask for.


The dating-other-people/talking-about-other-people thing has casually slowed. I went on a date last week and he did his best to talk me out of it. I asked him why and he said ""I don't want you to get a boyfriend,"" and chalked it up to not wanting a dude hanging around the house. He has also slowed on going out with girls. 


Not sure if it's me or what but we mostly come home to each other now/go out together if we go out. We both work in high volume bars downtown in a major city and are in shape/attractive so there's no shortage of people, but have, it seems, respectively stopped going out/trying to meet them.


Our mutual friends have asked each of us respectively why we aren't dating. We both always answer that we're just friends. We've never talked about whatever it is is going on. Maybe we're just roommates, maybe it's more. (*we no longer work together.)


The sex is always as casual as ""want to go to bed?"" and there's no little kisses or hand holding, just ""I love you-s"" if one of us leaves the house. We also don't sleep in each other's bed, ever.


Does it sound like he has feelings? Is it just a roommate thing with the added benefit of casual sex? Do I say something? (I want him to be my boyfriend because I am proud of him and I feel lucky every day.) How do I say something, if I do? Is it worth the risk?


tldr; developed feelings for my roommate/FWB/best friend. Afraid of risking the relationship and need advice on what to do.

272,"My fiance's sister (to be referred to from here on out as futureSIL) is getting married this year in a destination wedding. Though my fiance and I are not in the wedding party, futureSIL has insisted all family members wear specific outfits - all the men have to wear a certain suit (not just color - make and cut) and all the women have to wear a certain style and specific color of dress.
My fiance and I are also planning our wedding this year, and though we are mostly financially secure, we are not well off. My fiance is currently in the midst of changing careers and has a paid internship, but the internship job does not provide any insurance/benefits at this point (and my insurance does not cover anyone else but me).

273,"Okay this is my first ever post on Reddit and at that it's a pathetic one, so please bare with me. July last year I was in training at my old job. I met a guy who I'll call C. I never ever believed in soulmates or love at first sight until I met him. And I kept trying to tell myself it was just a crush or even an infatuation as embarrassing as that is. But I have finally admitted to myself that the feelings I have for him are actually love, and I know he couldn't possibly feel it back. While i was in training, we were flirting and sparks were flying and I know he felt something too. It sounds stupid but the more I got to know him the more I realised he could actually be the perfect fit to my soul, I got to know him pretty well and everything just clicked. I liked to think it's because of the distance or because of my situation at the time (dv relationship, coming back to work after having a baby) that it wouldn't work but I know full well the chances are it wouldn't work because he simply doesn't have the same feelings back. I've never tried to tell him my feelings and in fact chicken out of even saying Hi through Whatsapp to him because I'm scared of the rejection. I'm not really looking for advice, I know this is the most pathetic thing ever but I've never had to feel like this before. Anytime I have had feelings for someone before, they've had feelings back and it's just worked out. But now I feel like I'm gonna have feelings for C forever and I'm probably never gonna see the guy again. I guess my question is, has anyone else had any experience in dealing with unrequited love?

278,"Hi, 
I’m 17 years old and i’m crying as i’m writing this. 
I’ve never cried like this before and it’s because I know my father is cheating on my mother. I figured out when I was about late 14 early 15 and at that point I came to the realization that I don’t have a father, and my kids won’t have a grandfather. But I didn’t want my siblings to lose their father (our dad) and when they have children, not to have a grandfather. 
I love my siblings so much and I love all my friends and classmates and I’d never ever want anyone to go through that so I just keep it to myself. I’ve never ever told anyone about this so please give me help. 

Some background about my father: My dad is a prominent figure in my community (he’s nice to everyone, everyone loves him and he loves everyone back) and it’s a religious community so everyone knows each other and it would ruin our lives if it ever got out. He comes to all of my basketball games, all my football games, all my baseball games, and all of my school honor roll awards ceremonies so he is very social. He’s best friends with my best friends and their parents who I consider my parents also, we even had thanksgiving dinner with my family and my best friend Ben’s family. He is good friends with both my basketball coaches, and everyone who I am involved with. 

Background of me: i’m the captain of my school’s basketball and football teams because i’m a great leader (and i’m not tooting my own horn because I wouldn’t wish any of this upon my worst enemy, I just want to give you background so please don’t write me off). I have 3 siblings and we love each other and care for each other very much even though we fight sometimes, same with my mom. I know when the going gets tough that I have to be their with my brothers on the field/court and let them know i’m with them and not make it look like the bad situation (losing by a touchdown/ or down a few points) gets to me. 

But it got to me, it finally got to me. 

I’m taking the SATs and I had a practice test this morning and I just couldn’t get through the questions, I knew it all and I studied hard but my thoughts just died and all I could think about was how I’d disappoint my parents but then I thought that I don’t have a father. I just lost the semifinals of my football game and I feel I let the team down. I don’t feel depressed (in general) because whenever I see my buddies I give them a big smile and a big hello to make them feel good but they don’t know what i’m going through. 

How I know my father is cheating on my mother:
1. Maybe 2 years ago He had a tinder and thought I didn’t notice, I just brushed it off and assumed he didn’t know what it was. 
2. He changed his password to his phone but I figured it out because I saw him put it in once, I’ve seen him texting random people with one name contacts (something he generally doesn’t do, he’s a business man so all of his contacts are very formal). One time he left his phone on the couch when I got home late so I knew he was sleeping and I opened up his whatsapp and saw all his texts. He was texting women about meeting up and wanting to have sex with them and I saw that he has met up with people before and talked about making out with them. 

I finally decided to reach out for help because I cried for the first time since I can remember. Please help me, and if you can’t, Please refer me to a subreddit that can help me

280,"I live in NYC and take Ubers all the time. 99% of the time I have a good experience without any problems. 
Last night, I took an Uber home from dinner with my grandparents. The driver and I started casually chatting about things like the traffic and the upcoming Super Bowl game. He asked me what my favorite sports were to watch and I said my favorite was gymnastics. He then turned back, looked at me and said “wow, you must be really flexible then.” I replied with a nervous giggle because that comment seemed strange and made me uncomfortable. He then followed up with “I mean, aren’t you?” 
At this point I was quite uncomfortable, but luckily we were at my destination by then. I told my boyfriend about it later and he agreed it seemed inappropriate. 
I am torn about reporting this driver to Uber or not. Part of me feels like he was being unprofessional and inappropriate so of course I should. The other part of me feels a little guilty. I don’t want to be responsible for him potentially getting fired and I wonder if I should just let it go. Also, it was clear that he had a thick foreign accent and I wonder if he even meant it the way I took it.

281,"My best friend is more than a friend, she's like family to me. I love this girl with all my heart and would do anything for her. 

Shes been in an on/off relationship for the last 2 years. In her words ""when its good, its good. When its bad, its really bad.""

We both knew him way back when, and even then i thought he was bad news. 10 years down the line they got back in touch and decided to get together, and my opnion remained the same. I agreed to give him a chance though, because obviously people change.

I have lost count of the amount of times she has called me when shes been so upset. They have had an argument, hes said awful things to her and then gone out on the lash with his friends, got drugged up to his eyeballs and crawled home, if shes lucky, the following morning. Sometimes he would take the only house key our with him so that she was trapped in the house and couldnt leave as it would mean leaving the door unlocked with nobody home. Every time, he would send her texts while he was out, giving her more verbal abuse. 

A few days later all would be right with the world again. Until the next time. 

2 years down the line she has two kids with him. Im honestly amazed that he has stuck around, but he hasnt changed. He's taken money from his own childs savings to go out on a drink/drug binge 

She however feels like she couldnt leave even if she wanted to, as his favourite emotional blackmail is to tell her that their kids will grow up to hate her for splitting up their family if she ever leaves. She is repeatedly told she is a terrible mother and that he will take the kids away from her if she ever leaves. 

On one occasion during an argument, my name was mentioned and he realised i didnt like him and didnt buy this bullcrap image he tries to project to the outside world of being such a good boyfriend. 

He reacted by messaging me directly and telling me i was banned from seeing his children, that my best friends mum and dad supported his decision (that was confirmed to be a complete lie) and essentially tried to use the same intimidation tactics with me as he does with my friend. I stood my ground and made it clear that this wouldnt work with me, and that regardless of what he said i wouldnt be going anywhere and would always be there for my friend and her kids. 

I have talked and talked and talked until i am blue in the face trying to get her to see the light and make a break from him. She actually did it once, but it last about a month and then she went back. She wouldnt admit it to me at first when i asked because she knew what my reaction would be. 

Today ladies and gents.....they got engaged. My best friend in the whole world is getting married - and i feel nothing but dread and devastation. 

I dont know what to do. I want to stand by her. I want to be happy for her - but i just dont think i can. How can i stand by and watch her tie herself to this man when every fibre of my being is screaming that this is wrong and that she shouldnt do it.

This has been happening for a long time, where he asked me to do something and if I wouldnt do it then he will just  punish me on the subject I care about the most, but this time I didnt listen to his request because I personally thought the reasoning behind the punishment is ridiculous and I wanted him to understand that my hobbies are an important thing for me.

284,"Long text, sorry.

I was at a concert with my brother and his gf, they are prone to have arguments, we leave concert, bad mood, they have a huge argument on the way home, we are all intoxicated, im just passive, i decide to walk ahead of them.

My brother takes out his anger on random gang of people passing by, taunting them to fight, i hear fighting ensue behind me, i wish to break up the fight, and i have to intervene since my brother is involved.

I rush there to stop it but before i even reach the fight or can understand what is going on, someone suckerpunches me with a hook and i fall on the concrete, they kick me in the head and then they perceed to rob me of my watch.

I suffered a 3cm lip laceration breaching the vermillion border.

A minor concussion, bruising on the head, hospital fees and the loss of my watch.

My brother claims he ""Apologized"" to me, afterwards, but i was nearly rendered unconcious due to concussion and i was sleeping, i certainly have no memory of it. 

He does clearly not apologize in a respectful manner and simply does not care, when i taunted him about it he simply said ""I'ts not my fault that you got your ass beat"" and he wont reimburse me for the watch either.

Here is the dilemma, i live with these people, me and my brother come from a family that is far from normal with true signs of narcissism.  

My mother shows a lack of empathy aswell, she wont help me in life with anything that actually requiers her to put in a effort, and especially anything economic wise.

I feel as i cant live with these people anymore, besides this incident, they fight all the time and my brothers girlfriend is from a abusive home, so she goes mental a couple of times a year.

The even better part is that when we got home his gf decided to smash 2 glass tables creating chaos in the apartment and this leading to both of them getting injured by glass, the police came and thought someone was being abused....

The alternative is move home to my mother, she does not want me there and she thinks she has done more than enough.

I only remember not having enough clothes even though we could afford it, i could go on and on about how she neglected me by not paying for things i needed and a list  with bad things that she has done, but to no point, she loves me, but she is incapable.

Problem is, i decide to forgive people because i see the psychological reason behind them making their decisions.

Should i go back home and just live in a small room, no freedom, or stay with these people, pay the rent, slowly discard myself from them until i can live by myself? 

I have no respect for my brother now that he really sold me, I always knew he was a coward and very weak, a person that masks it with arrogance and a massive ego.

Im a strong person, this beating wont keep me down, I have been treated badly alot before, i became truly strong after being depressed in my teens, now i work with children with autism etc, and i feel true happiness inside my core.

My last question is, i no longer fear violence, used to be terrified.

But im like a lightswitch, i used to have a short temper as a kid and i could become angry, i never hurt anybody though, unless they hurt me.

But now i cant find any motivation to even become so angry that i lash out in violence, i can even take a punch before feeling ""rage"" and wanting to attack the person, but if i do get really raged, oh boy, its like a strong surge that makes me scared of my own ability to perform harmful actions.

I got a sense of becoming truly raged when my brother said ""Its not my fault you got your ass kicked""

I saw a possible reaction where i completely manhandled him with massive violence, completely beating the shit out of him, until his girlfriend would intervene and as she would be violent against me in a manner i cant deny due to her upbringing, i would have to strike her aswell, i feel like a full blackout like this is entirely possible against any attacker that awakes my rage.

Im a responsible person, i calmed myself before doing anything.

I feel as if i could maim someone badly, or possibly kill them if they posed a big threath enough, im empathetic and i would never hurt anyone that did not hurt me, or someone else, but i feel as if i have developed a no fuck around policy around violence, i render my attacker unable to attack, if i have a weapon i will use it.

I know this is due to psychological trauma, but can anyone give  me any insight around this type of mindset? 

For example, if a violent situation strikes i look for weapons first, I then scan the area of possible attackers, If someone even seems aggressive i back up and if they close the distance i will fight for my life instantly, might be that they think its a ""fight"", for me it is life or death.

It feels like something similiar to symptoms of PTSD.

Im scared shitless of taking any chances with violence, I also have no remorse if they decide to harm me, i would gouge their eyes out, Im not paranoid when im out, but i would like to carry a weapon, i dont, since im not scared in regular day to day life, and it would be illegal.

I have been jumped by suckerpunchers more than once due to only being peaceful and trying to stop things, always some coward who strikes first.

Im 22 years old, male. 

TLDR; Went to concert, got gang jumped and badly beaten due to my brother starting a physical fight, he wont apologize, lacks empathy, thinks he is not to blame, i live with these people, moving home to my mother would involve living with someone with strong narcisstic tendencies, i write some about my fear of hurting others with excessive violence, due to not taking any chances with violence.",04Feb2018,1

Over Christmas break, her family really got to her and she ended up blocking me on New Year’s Eve because she thought we couldn’t handle the distance and she hates to be reminded of me after being in a relationship. She ended up unblocking me a week ago, but I never tried to message her. Last night, at 2am, she apologized. Being a guy, I think girls are wayyy too complex when it comes to this stuff. I’m assuming she really misses me and wants to give us another shot, but I don’t want to play her stupid games. At this point, after all of the shit she’s put me through (vice versa), I don’t think it’s worth being just friends over.

294,"I have 2 roommates. A couple mornings ago I was in the restroom and I heard my roommate talking. I left the bathroom and I asked her if she was talking to me and she replied, ""Ew no"". That really hurt my feelings and I said ""that's actually really rude"". Every since then I have been distant towards her. She asked me why I'm distant and told me I don't have to lie. I didn't tell her why I was upset because I wanted to get over it. Because there was a weird vibe, I decided to talk to her and she said that she never said ""ew no"" and that I got hurt at her saying that she wasn't talking to me. The argument turned really volatile and she became a different person. So now no one is communicating with me and I just feel very alone and I'm thinking about moving out.

296,"So. My dilemma at work. I'm scared to go to HR about a phobia I'm having.

I got moved to a packaging area with small, tight spaces and it triggers my anxiety. It's too the point that it's making me too anxious to return to work.

There are other departments at the warehouse in need of positions that have more spacious work areas, but you have to work for 60 days to be eligible to transfer to a different department. I literally JUST started.

My friend that has been there for two years mentions that usually they require you to work at least 60 days, but sometimes HR is willing to move people before then.

I'm nervous if they'll be nice and move me somewhere else or laugh in my face and tell me ""sucks to suck"". That's preventing me from saying something. I don't think I'm too good to work in that area. I just can't do the tight space. I need more room to feel comfortable. Advice?",04Feb2018,1

302,I have been in conversation with my family on dealing with the possible eventual passing of our father. He's suffering from a serious cancer condition. My peers want me to stop the condition from ever happening again. I feel as though I am the cause and the people I care about get into trouble since I don't know what to do. Three of my aunts and their children came down with the condition also. My mother is in a better place now after dying in the place she originated from. She traveled for many years in the Air Force being really successful at her job. But her passing I think has changed something about my dad that I don't understand. It has me wondering about what I want to do spiritually. Should I start preventing cancer from happening to other people. How has anyone else done this in their lives?

304,"Hi. (First 2 paragraphs not necessary, just a rant)

I'm 18. If my mom maybe knocked on my door, I wouldn't mind so much. But she just barges in whenever she feels like it. Sometimes I'll be changing and then I have to run behind my closet so she doesn't see. I'm getting really sick of my lack of privacy.

We first moved into this house when I was 13. I've been asking for a lock since I was about 15 and she won't give in. She starts saying stuff like ""what if something happens to you and I can't go in to help?"" I understand where she's coming from but is it really worth not letting me get a lock just in case of a .01% chance that something bad will happen to me in my room? I feel like she just uses this as an excuse, that her real reason is to just be able to infringe on my me whenever.

Anyways, I decided to just do it myself. My question is, can I just buy any door knob with a lock and it will work? Or are there only specific types I can use? 

Or I'm thinking about just getting one of those slide locks that are placed at the top of doors. I'm kind of worried about this one though because I've never used a drill before and I don't want to ruin my door.

I feel like this is the best time in my life to do something like this (early 20s, no girlfriend, no debts), but I know that eventually it will end, and I don't have a plan for when it does.

307,"Ever since I can remember, I have had a habit of finding some random piece of media (television show, video game, book, etc.) and just becoming absolutely obsessed with it. And I mean obsessed. It was all I could think about. I would look up everything about it, learn as much about it as possible. This would usually last from a week or two to almost two months, depending on what I was obsessed with.

It's gotten to the point where, while I hate this compulsion to leave no stone upturned, I just can't ignore it, and it's honestly been making life somewhat difficult. I have stuff I should be doing, but I can't stop researching whatever I'm obsessed with.

308,"I have had issues with finding things that I'm genuinely interested in and what i want to spend my life doing. I've had &amp; have many things that interest me and want to pursue. Although once i do, not long after does the interest/drive fades (maybe due to the novelty of it going away, but i don't know) and it gets hard to go on with it. 

As an example, I'm currently having a rough time in college. I've been thinking for the past few years about what i wanted to do with my life. I kept changing my mind every few weeks, until i found something (sociology) that actually held my interest for longer than this, so i decided to start studying it. It went well for the first month or so, but then it became a drag. I'm not nearly as motivated or interested in it anymore. And not sure if what's going on is something that happens when in the process of picking up new skills/knowledge, or a sign that this isn't for me, and that i should move on to something else.

So my question; How does one know the difference between when to keep moving forward &amp; when to move on to something else? I want to enjoy my life, but not knowing when to keep or going to change direction i fear is going to lead me down the opposite path. ",04Feb2018,3

313,"For some context - I've been with my partner for about three-and-a-half years, and have known his family for most of that. I wouldn't say that I was very close with them, but we generally get on and have spent enough time together that we're comfortable.

Recently my partner's brother (who I'll call BIL just for ease) has started coming out with some turns of phrase that betray an unhealthy mindset. Very recently it was ""I hate that nice guys finish last"", and there's also been a few offhanded but demeaning comments about some women being fat or ugly or ""slutty"" (a word that I particularly hate). My fear here is that this is part of the Nice Guy mindset (basically the idea that men who treat women in what they perceive to be a gentlemanly manner are owed affection and sex in return, and that women who reject this are just sluts or whores who ignore ""nice"" guys like them in order to pursue other men). BIL is in his early twenties, still lives at home but does have a steady full time job, and has had one short relationship with a woman maybe a couple of years ago. He openly laments his singledom and has done for a while.

Essentially, I don't want him to fall into this kind of toxic mindset. It's unhealthy for him and for any women he may date. I am a woman in my early twenties who, like many others, has had a first hand experience with a Nice Guy; I feel like I could at least help him to not fall into that spiral by talking with him about it from a female perspective. But I'm also the long term girlfriend of his younger brother, and I don't want to overstep my position here and come across preachy or overbearing. How should I approach this?
