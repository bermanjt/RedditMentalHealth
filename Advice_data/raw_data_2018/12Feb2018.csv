0,"So, my good friend owns a small construction company. I've worked for him for the better part of 2 years. Outside of work we have a great relationship but at work he can be a bit of a dick. We work 9 hour days, rain or shine. That's never been the issue. But what is frustrating me is the fact that he will not pay overtime or time and a half on stat holidays. Most of the guys he employs are shit workers, drunks and coke heads that miss days and are generally what I would consider near unemployable. So they don't really give a shit (about the lack of overtime etc) because he lets them get away with all the bullshit. But I never miss days, I go out of my way to get the other guys to site, because none of them have licenses, and I work my ass off. I like what I do but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. On top of that I'm being paid quite a bit less than what other trades in the area are making as a starting wage. 
I'm tossed because if I quit I feel like I might lose a friend but if I stay I'm not getting what I feel I'm entitled to. What should I do? ",12Feb2018,1
2,"So basically I'm 20 years old, work about 50 hours a week doing a pretty easy job. The problem is I sleep pretty close to 12 hours a day and I'm constantly tired and incapacitated. The jobs I work aren't real careers and I want to go back to school but, cannot work and do school at the same time. Yes, I know see a doctor but, they don't help as I'm very healthy being 6ft 175lbs and they act like I'm just lazy. So I'm pretty much wondering if anyone has any ideas or is similar. The only thing wrong wit me was a very low vitamin D  count that was corrected by taking supplements made no difference. I also eat a very strict diet gluten free as I have celiac disease if that makes a difference.",12Feb2018,1

Truck is now totaled and my question is; truck is under my older brothers name insurance but allowed my 18 y/o brother to drive it while he was stationed - will insurance not cover it since it was the other brother driving even though he had permission? 

I appreciate any feedback y’all are able to give me. Thank you. ",12Feb2018,1

Now shit gets real, my older brother is stationed in North Carolina and wants me to move up with him and his wife and I could work IT on the base, but I have so many plans back here where I live, and I know going to North Carolina is a big step forward in life especially career wise, but I'm conflicted with staying back home in Houston and starting adult life with my girlfriend and of course the fear of long distance relationship not working out.

13,"To start this off, its probably going to make me sound like a bad person and the more I think about it I probably am

But anyways, two weeks ago I, a HS Senior, asked one of my Junior friends to prom, instead of my fellow senior friend who I knew needed a date and wanted to go with me. It seemed like the right move at the time and I had a bit of a thing for my junior friend. Well, my senior friend was really broken up over it and the further I go the worse I feel. Every night I sit awake for hours thinking about it, I have a constant headache, and I feel like I'm about to throw up. This is her prom and she and I have been good friends for 5+years, but I asked our mutual friend instead because I had a crush on her, and my romantic advances were shot down. She's a great person and a good friend but she had another guy who wanted to take her, where as my senior friend has no one. I feel like the worst person and the biggest asshole. I know my senior friend is pretty upset with me and I don't know what to do about any of this. Obviously I plan on sticking to my commitment because that's the right thing to do, but this guilt is tearing me apart.",12Feb2018,2
15,"I'm fuming at the moment sorry for any grammar mistakes. We have been together around 2 years and everything is great. Just had a beautiful baby girl. My SO is my best friend and my everything. She has a 7 year old son. His dad is by no means a neglectful parent. Gets him two weekends a month always have fun. Buys Christmas and school clothes. Great guy. For some reason she feels obligated to give him 800 of 3800 because he does these things with his son. Yes he spends a little money on theme parks and beach trips on the times he has him, but that is what fathers do, am I right? This guy pays $40 a month in child support mind you. I am the one that has supported everyone over the last year while she was out of work, took everyone to the doctor, drive to school every day. So I hope you guys can see where I am coming from, but also maybe see her side and talk some sense into me. I am very close to making a very drastic decision (leaving). Please give me you're opinions.",12Feb2018,1
16,"I apologise if it comes across that I'm arrogant, and I can see from the title it's looking that way, but I don't know how else to phrase it.

Long story 'short';
I'm eclectic, I have a lot of different areas of interest and I have a small few talents.
But I'm essentially crippled by myself.
I am unable to be who I want to be in social situations, I cannot talk up in groups, I cannot get the words out of my mouth and I'm just not as fun or entertaining as I want to be.
I'm always the weirdly quiet guy, which in itself is fine, but it becomes an issue when I cannot operate whatsoever in a group.

I just want to snap out of it but I don't know how.
If I'm talking one on one with a girl I'm fine, I do better than you'd expect, I can walk up to and talk to virtually any girl on a night out, it doesn't always work in my favour but I've no fear or qualms about doing so again afterwards.

I want the same experience in a group, usually the girl see's me as someone who is interesting, someone who is intelligent and most importantly someone who is nice to be around.
In a group I'm arguably none of those things, I'm quiet, I'm weird and I get so inside my head I shut people out.

I want to be charismatic, as charismatic as I can be when flirting, but I cannot flirt with everyone.

It feels like I'm strapped in in a sense, like a harness and if I could only get out I'd feel more like myself and less incompetent.

Again apologises if this comes across as self obsessed or arrogant..
Any help?

17,"i don’t know if this is the right subreddit for this, but i thought i’d put it here anyway

i’m a 15 year old kid who does the same thing every day. sit in my bedroom, watching netflix and going downstairs to eat. i don’t go out much, only to walk my dog or if my parents say i have to go with them somewhere.

 i do have a few friends i talk to at school and play xbox with, but are too boring to go outside and do something, and there’s not much to do in my town without spending a lot of money.

 i don’t really have any hobbies, so i don’t have anywhere to go regularly.

i don’t know how to break this cycle of waking up and doing nothing all day. it’s driving me insane, i need to get out of my house and do something.

22,My girlfriend and I are both juniors in high school and have been dating for a couple months now. I don't want to over spend but still want to get her something meaningful. ,12Feb2018,1
23,So I'm not quite sure on what's a good gift idea (since basically it's the first time I'll spend this day with someone that fortunately I care a lot about) and I want it to be a good one. I'm a male so we are talking about gifts for female. Any advice (from gift all the way to how to spend the day) would be really helpful!,12Feb2018,1
24,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hey guys and gals, like the title says I'm in need of some advice and input in my life right now. I'm sorry if this becomes a book, but if anyone is willing to read it and give their 2 cents, I'd be greatly appreciative! I don't really know where to start, so I'm just gonna type haha. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm a second year college student at a university a couple hours from home, and I'm feeling really... lost right now. I lost my mother back in august and I haven't been the same since. It was a huge loss for me because my mom was that one family member who I could always talk to. My dad isn't cold, but we've just never clicked, you know? I lost my confidant, and one of my best friends.

 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;About the same time I started to finally accept that I'm struggling with mental illness, or at least some bad problems right now. I've known for years, but I never wanted to admit it. Well I met a girl who was great. Knowledgeable about the subject, and had been through a lot herself. She convinced me to go seek professional help, which i did. It was great, but I felt like i wanted to switch types of therapy (i was doing group, and it wasn't as powerful or effective as 1 on 1 in my opinion). 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Well my program was through my university, and right when I wanted to switch to individual therapy, winter break started and I had to wait for a good while before I would get the opportunity. But that never happened because over break things got a lot worse for me.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I had been seeing the same girl for about 4 or 5 months when things went sort of sour. My mental health got worse, and I got boring and seclusive. I wouldn't leave my room or get off my computer. I was missing classes and just not wanting to move. SO she got bored. Naturally. And she expressed this, and I took my mental health more seriously and genuinely tried to turn things around. But in the process, she cheated on me multiple times without my knowing. With someone who was one of my best friends at the time. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ive since cut them from my life after finding out what they had done, but it still hurts. A lot. On top of that I don't think I've even had time to grieve my mother's passing, and it hurts too, everyday. These things, on top of my mental health are just too much right now. Any extra stress is killing me, and school is nothing but stress. I can't focus and my grades are terrible. I can't pull myself out of bed most mornings and i've missed more class than I've attended this semester. I lost the scholarship that made this school reasonably affordable to me, as I'm here on my own and the government's dime. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So my grades are slipping, my hygiene is starting to become worse, I have to will to clean (which is hurting my relationship with my apartment roommate), and I haven't even been able to go get the help I need mentally. Essentially I'm at a point right now where I want to just have some stability and not have the stress of unexpected assignments, tests, and homework. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I've been thinking about withdrawing my admittance and taking a break to work. Earn some money, have a schedule, and use my time to better myself and seek a place near home to get some help mentally. What I'm worried about is having the motivation to go back, and my dad's reaction, but I think this could potentially be in my best interest. Any thoughts? And thanks for reading this far!

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; EDIT: I forgot to mention a pretty important factor here. I have a group of great friends back home who I never get to see. And after losing my girlfriend and my best friend up here, I've been really lonely. I don't have a whole lot of good relationships at school, but back home I love my friends, and I always look forward to time with them. ",12Feb2018,1

I don't know what to do with these feelings anymore, so any advice is appreciated.

I know you're probably wondering if I'm some fedora wearing, neckbearded nice guy, I assure you, I'm not.

26,"Well to keep things short, my sister was having troubles with her bank so she asked to deposit her paycheck ($1,400) into my account and then take the money out later. She did that and i took my card back thinking that was that.

29,"Perfectly nice guy, but he lives like 2 hours away. I met him at a mutual friend's party and thought he was cute. Later mutual friend asked if I was interested/would go out with him. I said ""sure"". 
We went on one date that was perfectly nice and fun. I assumed we'd go out again within the next month or two... basically whenever we happened to be in the same city. 
He texted every day for 4 days discussing our next date... offering to drive up to see me, saying he had ideas for if I came down there. I stopped responding and then my friend ""casually checked in"" (twice) to see if I was going to call him back. 

It's been like a week and now he just messaged to ask if he did something wrong or put me off in some way.

What do I say?
Keeping in mind that 
A) I can't lie about..like moving to a different hemisphere or something) because of our mutual friend 
B)  If I cite the distance, I'm 99% sure he will offer to drive up indefinitely
c) I will, most likely, run into him again at said friend's parties etc.

I'm considering working full-time but I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle it since I take night classes which start after 5pm.  I'm currently in the second intro classes and I heard the other classes get harder for Computer Science and Accounting so I'm not sure how it will affect my studies.

Many people recommend getting a degree, saying that it's worth it. So I'm giving school a try again. 

As I confused student, I'm currently trying to figure out what major, is for me but I always liked computers so Computer Science and IT seem like the logical chooses.  I'm also taking a Accounting class right now, and I'm really enjoying it - it just clicks, my grade is a 95%.  

Sometimes it feels like I'm going nowhere in life, I took 3 years off from school and this is my second semester back but I'm taking it day by day.  My mom just stresses me out, she thinks I want to stay at retail forever, and that I'm not trying with school since I should already know what I want to do.

42,"My job requires me to drive my own vehicle, about 4,000 miles a month. My regular wage is $15/hr, which isn't enough to live in this area. With mileage, my wage comes out to about $20/hr, which is reasonable for the area. 

I've had all kinds of issues with the third party that pays my mileage, and it's making me consider quitting.

**This is what holds me back:**

 •The schedule is flexible and fits my son's daycare perfectly. I don't have anyone to help me so this is incredibly important.

 •The pay is (supposed to be) decent

 •I have full medical, dental, vision, and life insurance. My son has a heart condition and we both wear glasses.

**Why I want to quit:**

 •I never know if I'm going to get paid or not. If I don't get paid, car expenses come out of my hourly pay which means I have to live off ~$10/hr. 

 •I keep getting chewed out for mileage. I know I am easily the person who drives the most for the company. But they can't expect me to drive across the entire state five times a month and not rack up a big mileage check.

**Here are my options:**

 •Ask for a company vehicle, which will reduce my pay by $5/hr but will guarantee I get paid. I will likely have to get a second job. They might not even approve this since they are short on vehicles.

 •Quit. I will lose my health insurance and I will likely end up with a job that pays less.

 •Keep working. I might not get paid mileage but will have to keep spending on gas, oil changes, and tires. My income will be reduced to $10, when the minimum I need is $18. I'll have to borrow money from someone just to get by. 



TL;DR: I want to quit my job but I'm scared of losing my  insurance. If I don't quit, I might not get paid. ",12Feb2018,2

46,"I need some advice. So recently my ex broke up with her boyfriend. Well 4 months ago. She texted me like 2 weeks ago and we were texting and decided we’d talk to eachother leading towards something again. We talk on the phone for like hours and hours &amp; one day she didn’t reply so i kept it cool the next day and said hey just checking up on you to see if you’re okay because you haven’t replied and she didn’t reply till the next day saying that she forgot her charger at her sister’s house and that she barely picked it up. So we started talking again right after that, she started sending me selfies of herself. I asked her if we can just be together without actually having a date because last time the date was on her birthday so im waiting for it again. She said yea and she kept sending me selfies or calling me randomly and we started calling eachother “babe” &amp; “baby” so two days ago i fell asleep while she was at the club with her best friend and she was blowing up my phone saying awh you fell asleep. So she texted me goodnight at 2am and then at 4 am she said she can’t sleep but doesn’t wanna call to wake me up. Then i woke up at 4:15 and called her and she was happy about that so we stayed on the phone for hours again. And she called me again the next morning so we texted that day and she was replying slow and at like 8pm she texted me saying sorry babe that i’m texting late and i’m like its ok and she said wyd? I’m like just got out the shower wby? And she hasn’t replied or texted me but she’s been on snapchat. So its really confusing cause she’s never been the type to cheat. We broke up cause i left her since i would overthink too much but then i realized she always sent me long paragraphs if i fell asleep and call me all the time for hours but i still ended up letting my thoughts get to me and she seems to be doing that. Plus why would someone waste hours on the phone with you and send you selfies for no reason. She’s beyond gorgeous with hazel eyes and hundreds of guys text her so its like she had no reason to even waste phone calls with me or texts but i don’t know i just wanna know what to do since Valentine’s day coming up.

50,"I have been dating this girl for about a year and three months. We havnt done anything intimate yet besides a kiss. A peck really since she says she doesn’t like French kisses. I’ve talked to her about this and she said that she hasn’t been interested because she’s been too stressed out from school(nursing school) and family life. In all honesty, I probably would have assumed she was cheating on me or just lost interest and broken up with her before now, but shortly after I started dating her I found out that I had herpes. I got it from a one night stand a few months before I started dating her. I told her about it pretty much immediately and she stayed with me, which meant a lot to me. I’m also terrified of trying to start dating again now that I have herpes.

When I asked her about why we didn’t do anything intimate I had honestly assumed it was because of the herpes, so I told her I would understand if that was why. Even if she wanted to have sex I wouldn’t. There are things we can do which are still sexual that won’t spread my illness to her. However, she has repeatedly insisted that it’s just because she hasn’t been horny the entire time we’ve been together. Which I find incredibly hard to believe.

I’m also going to add that we havnt spent a single night together. In a year and three months of dating. Not only have I not met her parents I’ve never been to her house. She says that her parents won’t let her stay out past ten or so or spend the night. She is 25. If I didn’t know her schedule and had already confirmed everything, I would have assumed she is cheating on me. If that can even be considered a thing when it feels like we aren’t even a real relationship at this point.

I care about her and want to be with her, but I’m still a red blooded male and I’m having trouble handling this situation. Am I being unfair? I’m a little lost, this situation is pretty weird and I have no clue what to do, because I don’t want to lose her but I feel like I’m either being played for a fool in one way or another, or I’m having unrealistic expectations of a good girl who is doing her best.

58,"Hi all. I actually posted about this on another sub but I couldn’t get any replies. I’ll try to explain it best as I can. Basically my best friend of many years has developed a very noticeable issue with body odor as well as bad odors in her home too. It started about a year ago when I was noticing that I was basically always grossed out, holding my breath around her. She has a three year old son who usually smells very unwashed. He still wears Pull ups and I’ve wondered many times if they are changed frequently. I’ve looked at his car seat before and saw rotten food stuck inside the seat. She lives now in her fiancée’s house and every time I’ve been over there, the general stench of it is almost overwhelming. Garbage, food, you name it. 

Unfortunately among our friend group I found out too that people have been making cruel jokes about not hugging my friend because the smell ends up on our clothes. And yes, it is pretty bad. I feel awful even asking for advice just because on the surface it sounds petty, and how could one suggest to someone they’re so close to that they smell bad? But sometimes it even looks unhealthy and I’ve been avoiding even going over there. ",12Feb2018,21
59,"Evening, I’ll try to make this not long so it would be a quick read.

Basically I have been doing graphical design for around 5~ years now, that involves websites too, app design, and etc. 
But now as time closes to choose a college, I’m starting to rethink my decision on what I actually want to study. Currently I’m studying website development, It’s okay-ish but its not something I’m really in to, I understand it, I can do it but I would put it that I don’t have that pushing motivation to actually do that as a job.

What made me rethink this was a different career idea, I’m planning on going to study management and business economics. It’s a whole different career but It’s something I have experience with prior. 

Also another thing is the salary for both jobs.
As a freelancing/employed graphics designer I wouldn’t say the pay is bad, but I do believe that, let’s say a business manager and analytics reviewer or international business manager and trader would earn substantially more. What are your thought’s guys? The university that made me rethink my studies is the norwegian business university called : BI or also know’n as ISM.
Any advice / tips are extremely appreciated

i just want to know what i should. i've passed the N2 and am currently working on the N1. i graduated with a major in Japanese and Asian Studies and lived in Japan for a year for study abroad. i would say i have a very high reading comprehension; kanji has never been a problem for me--i have a somewhat photographic memory for it. 

my biggest issue has been speaking. i have terrible social anxiety. i know, it's hilarious that someone who want to become fluent in a language is absolutely terrified of speaking. i thought i would grow out of the fear, but it's still just as bad. 

it doesn't help the fact that i've had a ton of bad experiences. i've had people making fun of me speaking in japanese, including fellow japanese learners or japanese natives. i've had one of my teachers and a few japanese friends tell me that my pronunciation is great, so it's not a matter of my pronunciation or my speed. 

i just don't understand why so many people mock me and act superior about it. it pisses me off to no end. 

there are so many other complaints that i have regarding my learning experiences. it depresses me that i've begun to hate the language because of all the assholes i've come across.

61,"My friends have started to commit themselves to a lifestyle that I really can't support and I'm not sure what to do.
I'll be the first to admit that I'm a fairly conservative normap person, I don't drink much, I don't smoke or do drugs, I have a steady job and a long time girlfriend and I try to be a good person.
My friends are nothing like that. They're not bad people, but theyre often times apathetic to their choices. Its hard for me to describe because I haven't really been able to describe it for myself but baseline is they all wear their flaws like badges.
Instead of striving to be good friends or good people they just sort of don't. That doesn't mean theyre bad friends, they just sort of don't put the work in.
When a disagreement arises it usually ends up going back to their ""I don't care"" attitude clashing with my ""I think you should care"" attitude.

Again its hard for me to explain so let me give an example.
One of the people in my friend group intentionally tries to get on peoples nerves as a joke. But when I've told him I find that annoying he just doesn't care enough to change it or stop.

62,"Just had a major fight with my boyfriend over my art and some stuff I drew. It started as a difference of opinion but after a bit some insults started getting thrown around and it developed into a shouting.   
I draw a lot of porn and smut and make money both from Patreon and commissions (which gives me some spending money but I pay bills with a part-time job), but I actually enjoy drawing it and a lot of my personal inspirations come from pin-up artists. He knows I draw this stuff and is pretty accepting of it, which is a first really, he even knew coming into the relationship.   

The fight was about a recent commission I got where I would do a set of pin-ups and porn from a variety of JRPG games, they offered way higher than my usual rates plus I could be part of a fan artbook for those games (with royalties, of course) which would help my popularity and put me on the map, all in all an incredible offer. 
Thing is, many of the characters I was drawing weren't ""of age"" to put it plainly, sometimes just in body and sometimes in-story too, but I don't particularly care since it's just drawings. He sees me working on it and asks to see, I show him the stuff and he's visibly upset, starts telling me how what I'm drawing is ""wrong"" and ""unethical"", I argue that it's fine since it's just drawing/fantasy and no one is being harmed.   
The argument went like:   
**+** It's wrong and unethical, they're children!   
""They're drawings, and no one is being hurt.""   
**+** Even then, it's still sexualizing them    
""They don't even exist, fantasy and reality are very different, they don't even look like real kids! (my art is very stylized)""   
**+** You're still enabling disgusting pedophiles when you don't even need to since you have a job!   
""You're ignoring me pointing out that 2D and rl are completely different! And this could be my big break to quit my shitty job!""   
And then is devolved from there into us yelling over each other.  

I'm still angry; he's just dismissing all my hard work and the fact that I'm working towards my dream of being able to live on my art like it's nothing, he's an artist too and very skilled at that but gave up on making it and works some low-level IT job. I like him but this was easily the biggest argument we've ever had and I was shocked that someone like him, who was so open and adamant about art not being removed or censored, reacted this way. I feel it might have been fueled by jealousy that my career is kicking off but I'm too angry and biased to think it through.  
  

Also, I won't be posting my work since I don't want my fans hearing all this drama.  
  
edit: Not really worried about it being illegal in the area I live in, asked around on artist communities and most seem to agree that the law doesn't consider it illegal. It's being printed and sold in Japan (for Comiket) so I'm not worried about that either.

63,"Before anyone says ""Oh just deal with it and go to school"" or ""Here's how to do better in school..."" let me explain my situation first.
I live with my grandfather, grandmother, and mother. My grandfather has stage 4 colon cancer and I have to go to all of the appointments with my mom and grandparents since it's very far away so we have to get up at 4 am to drive there in time for the appointment which most of the time makes me miss school. I cannot be at school every single day, it's just not an option for me. This causes me to be behind in school work and every time I manage to catch up, I fall behind again because of the appointments. I cannot bring my homework or anything to the cancer center as there is no internet and we do our homework online. Don't tell me to ask my teachers to make a plan for me to have less work or whatever because they don't give a crap. They're there for the money. Also, because of school, I cannot seem to have any energy no matter how early I go to bed. In general I just think online schooling is a better option for me. I'm very self disciplined and I could get straight As if I really wanted to, but my mother doesn't believe me. I am a high school student by the way. 
    I have done much research about online school and I know practically everything about it. I have 5 online friends that do online school and they've taught me a lot about it. It's clear that it's a better option for me and I've explained the pros and cons of being homeschooled to my mom. She thinks that I'll become antisocial and she thinks that online school is harder than traditional school, but I told her that I would get a job and participate in clubs, sports, and other social activies, but she doesn't listen. For the ""online schooling is hard part"" I told her that we can set our own pace in online school and we have different teachers for every subject. There's also a digital classroom. So I have many ways to get help on my work if needed, but she still thinks that it isn't right for me.
     Since my mom won't listen I called my dad to ask for his opinion (my parents are divorced). My dad thinks that online schooling is a good option for me and he tried calling my mom and telling her about it, but they just had a huge argument about it and now they won't even talk to each other. My dad said I could just live with him to be online schooled, but his apartment is very small. He has 3 kids living there and his S.O. with only one bedroom and one bathroom. The living conditions there are terrible and there's hardly any food there. My dad said to just not do my work until she agrees to let me be online schooled, but I'm afraid she's just going to be stubborn until the end of the year and I could risk repeating my grade. Right now, I have all Fs because of these constant appointments putting me behind and because of not being able to do the work in general. PLEASE help me be homeschooled. DON'T suggest for me to just do better in school. That's not the kind of help I need. Thank you.

67,"This is a long story, but I'll try and keep it as short as possible.

Basically I moved out of my foster home (meaning I can't go back) 5 years ago to be with my ""high school sweetheart."" He was the type of guy that was always there for me, sweet to me, snuck out for me, and treated me really well. Till we moved in together and he actually had to finish his high school diploma he had put off for almost 2 years and get a job. I had to basically force him to be self reliant. And even then he couldn't go to work on time and wouldn't clean up after himself.

I gained weight, he stopped being interested in sex, and we got into arguments about him choosing porn over me. I should have left, but I didn't. I eventually got really sick and had to rely on him financially, to which he said he was totally okay with until his constantly being late got his hours cut. Then he called me a lazy freeloader. Which is weird, because that's exactly what he was doing before we started dating. I literally got him all of his jobs, got him to finish high school, and helped get his credit to a 720. In return I ended up getting fat, getting sick and becoming reliant because I saw our relationship as an investment.

Well, he got really verbally abusive and became a total narcissist. I got fatter and he started insulting my body (mind you, I am genetically blessed, even now I look really good for being so overweight) He's insulted my boobs for not being anti-gravity (they don't even sag, they're just not floating anymore), and my stomach for no longer being literally flat, and never really liked the fact my butt existed.

Anyway, I eventually got a job because he threatened to kick me out if I didn't even though we had an arrangement and we moved into a new place. Immediately into our lease I find out he's been hanging out with his friends girlfriend (right after the guy goes to boot camp) and they text ALL THE TIME, and he took her to our old apartment when he was supposed to be moving shit. When I confronted him he lied, then admitted he lied because ""We didn't want you to think that I was cheating."" I don't think he was, but the fact he lied was just not okay.

Anyway, so the other day he told me he took her out to dinner while I was at work and didn't even invite me even though I worked across the street. I got understandably upset and he told me that we're not even actually dating, that we're just in a lease and I can't control him. And I'm like ""what the actual fuck"" his defense is that he's threaten to break up with me a bunch because I wasn't doing what he wanted so he didn't want to actually be with me even though he said ""If I just tried everything would be fine."" And I was understanding when he wanted me to get a job so like what the actual fuck.

Anyway, now I'm in a lease with a guy I thought was my boyfriend and I'm fat and hate myself and my cat is depressed because he got rid of his cat which was my cats best friend and my cat isn't really taking my sadness well.

I want to just leave but I have literally no where to go. And I'm not leaving my cat behind.

69,"Will try to not make this take too long (pretty new Redditor so sorry!) 

**TLDR is husband can't physically do labor jobs but won't be able to cut it in our call center job with their new standards due to medical (and medicinal) reasons. In depth explanation and details below.**

Basically, unsure of where, what, and how to go about my husband's situation. We've been married about 3 years and he's been marred with various health issues that finally got a diagnosis in the last year. 

1. Horrendously severe case of chronic pelvic congestion syndrome. His doctors have even said it's one of the worst cases in either gender they've ever seen and he was pretty much pulled immediately from labor jobs and jobs that require standing. TMI possibly but basically by the end of an 8 hour shift at Wawa he would be bleeding profusely from his rectum, couldn't walk or drive himself home at times, and would be doubled over in severe pain. He's always in pain even since but won't take actual pain medication, nor will his doctors prescribe him anything. He started doing physical therapy which left him bedridden the following day which interferes with his ability to work (which is a point I'll get to later.)

2. He has debilitating anxiety. He's recently started a regimen though his doctor to handle the anxiety as it would get so severe it would trigger hallucinations and have chronic insomnia. He takes Lopid for the anxiety and Seroquel for to let him sleep and ground him to stop the hallucinations. However, he's been on the medications for a few months and whenever he takes them he's basically groggy from the Lopid and if he takes the Seroquel the previous night to sleep then his Lopid the next day so he can work without a panic attack, he's a borderline narcoleptic, which is another point that will be important later. But if he doesn't take his medication, he crashes and becomes a totally different person, shut in, trembling, and hurts himself.

So now that those explanations are out of the way, I wanted advice on where to go from here due to our employment situation. We both currently work for Alorica, a call center company, and work for the Comcast cable repair department. Basically, we take phone calls all day and try to fix people's cable boxes. The problem is that, despite him being a great customer service person, the groggy waves that wash over him and his inability to focus for periods of time greatly impact his performance as it's a metric based job. He ends up floating between stellar agent and a bum who can't remember things two seconds prior. To combat this, as it's become a sticking point with our managers, he's tried to skip out on his medication some days so he can ""perform better,"" despite my recommendations. He'll be, for the most part, ok but because of management's new renewed zeal for metrics and sales as we're coming up on contract renewal, he's been skimping his meds a lot more because everyone has to be at 100% peak performance. This has led to him having multiple panic attacks in the last few days and been completely unable to finish a shift due to how badly the calls start to affect him, so basically trading one issue for another.

So herein lies the problem and where everything comes together. Basically, he can't work outside of a sedentary environment because of his stomach issue as it's so severe he was hospitalized at one point for losing too much blood after he worked a  10 hour shift. But being in a call center that went from more lax when we started to this Geico level performance push (for low pay mind you) creating performance anxiety on top of being screamed at all day, I'm not sure how much more he's going to be able to take before he 100% snaps. We can't afford for him to leave the job as it's the only thing he can really do in our area and I don't make enough to shoulder the burden longer than a month. But on top of that, he also can't take his medication here because of the performance push, but if he doesn't take it I'm scared he's going to snap and truly hurt himself.

So any advice I could possibly get would be wonderful. I'm kind of stumped and unsure where to go from here.

81,"I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible. There’s a summary at the very bottom. 

I live in a 3 bed, 3 bath apartment near my university, and the 12 month lease was signed on August 1st, 2017. The apartment complex is a completely smoke-free environment, including the front and back patio areas because they’re made of wood and can potentially be a fire hazard. My two roommates (Girl 1 will be Jay, and Girl 2 will be Hill) share this apartment with me, and I have known them since about a month before the lease was signed. 

Jay is the type of girl who does whatever she wants without any regard to anyone around her. Jay and I have had our arguments in the past, and they have gotten extremely toxic. Hill and I have always been close, but she occasionally plays the neutral party for the sake of not hurting either Jay or I. 

So Jay has been having her boyfriend (let’s call him Sam) around frequently. Like, spending two+ consistent weeks in the apartment without contributing to rent payments, or helping with chores like dishes or trash. For the most part, Sam doesn’t leave Jay’s room or is loud/disruptive to Hill and I. What Sam does, and now Jay has been doing with him, is smoking cigars and weed. The smell travels through the air vents into all of our rooms and bathrooms, as well as the living room and kitchen common areas. My clothes reek of the smell, and I’m surprised our neighbors haven’t complained yet. 

My mom came to my apartment to surprise me recently and she got extremely mad at me thinking I’ve been smoking, which I wouldn’t ever do (I’m very health-conscious and fitness-focused). 

What can I do to get Sam and Jay to stop smoking and potentially Sam to stop coming around or at least reduce the time he’s here? If I confront Jay, she has the potential to physically hurt me and I’ve been threatened by her previously, so I can’t risk that. Would it be smart going to my apartment complex director to complain? Could I potentially get kicked out even though I’m not the problem? Are there any legal issues I should be aware of that I am currently unaware of? PLEASE HELP😭 Thank you in advance!!!!

82,"About 1 month ago, my girlfriend of 1 year broke up with me. We had been long distance for about 6 months prior to that point but not only had it been okay up to that point and we were managing to be loving and happy with each as much as possible but the distance was actually almost over as I'm about to move back to Texas where we would both be together in person again. 

I learned from a mutual friend of ours that the reason for the breakup was that I was asking too much emotionally as in I needed too much emotional support all the time, and that can get to anyone and it finally got to her then. Now she actually is already with someone else that she met a couple of weeks after our breakup and she has since blocked me on every social media as well as my phone number. 

We were very loving to each other, we talked about moving in together and we were very serious about our relationship. We were convinced that we would end up getting married and I'm sure that had I not left Texas in the first place we would still be together now and I'd be much better off. 

I am certain that if she was to let me back in and decide to be friends that I could win her back over time, show her that I have changed, and get us back together. But that all relies on her unblocking me and taking the initiative to start contact again. I sincerely do love her, and I do feel that she is the one for me as misguided as that may be. I would do anything to be able to fix this, and restart our relationship. Any advice is really appreciated because I'm really struggling with this whole situation.

Hey

I'm a freshman in college, and I just can't seem to shake this feeling of loneliness anymore.  It's kind of been omnipresent with me for the past year.  

I'll go over what i've gone through that caused most of this, and then I'll go over my current emotions.

In high school (third year, but graduated as a junior) I was falsely accused of sexual assault

For context, I should say that I am a MTF transsexual, and for reference I was on hormones for about a year during the first story, and a year and a half on the second.

anyways

Over the summer 2016, me (MTF/16/junior, but graduating) and my best friend (M/17/junior)(we'll call him ""Red"" because that's what color I used to block his info in the screenshots) became really close.  It was the summer that Pokemon GO came out.  We would spend hours just driving around farming pokeballs, and stay out until like 4 am.  We often had many of those 'deep as fuck parked car conversations' and i really truly cared for the guy.  It should also be known that I really had a crush on him since 6th grade as well, so yeah.  

On September 10th 2016, Red asked me if I wanted to come over to his place after a band competition, which I did.  
His girlfriend (F/18/college freshman/""Yellow"") at the time lived 2 hours away and visited every weekend.  So, he would've been feeling sexually deprived and I really didn't expect anything to happen, because he knew me before I came out and I knew that was weird for straight guys, let alone me being trans within itself, so I was looking forward to an innocent night of Battlefront.

When the clock struck 3 am, I called it quits.  I was exhausted from the comp day, and I just wanted to sleep, so I asked Red where to sleep.  
""Well, we could either crash on the couch or sleep in my bed.""

*We*? 
I thought that was a subtle bait, but I wasn't quite ready to bite yet,  I remained skeptical.  So I walked toward his bed and laid down, him following suit.  He then proceeded to lock the door, reminding me that he always does that when he goes to bed because ""his step brother likes to run into his room to wake him up with annoying toys.""

Now this is definitely a subtle invitation.  He practically just told me that no one will interrupt us.

We watched Adam Ruins Everything while laying down, and we started to slowly cuddle.  I couldn't believe it.  The guy I had a crush on for so many years, the guy I was practically in love with, is in the same bed as me!  

Our fingers makes circles on each others skin, and he eventually pulls his shorts down and forcefully shoves my head toward his crotch.  We both enjoy ourselves until the deed is done, and then he gets up, cleans himself off and the rolls over and falls asleep.  I kind of start to feel inklings of guilt for sleeping with a taken man.

The next morning, he wakes me up; my group for my German Project is hounding his phone because they knew I stayed at his house.  I get up and leave, and once I get to the group location, I start to spill the beans because Blue(F/16) and Purple(F/16) started to pry it out of me.  They jokingly shame me for doing it with someone who is dating another person.

Later that day, I message him and [this(these) conversation(s)](https://imgur.com/a/2BeX8) ensues.

The following days, Red and I are closer, but then one day, he skips school, but then a get a [message](https://imgur.com/a/orY0U) from Yellow, then Red starts [messaging me](https://imgur.com/a/kf4SV) as well.

I start to feel ganged up on right now

What I think happened, was that Red didn't want to get into hot water with Yellow, so he tucked tail and decided to fabricate what actually happened between him and me.  And he didn't want to be seen as a faggot that let a tranny suck his dick.  But the thing is that he instantly went from super close best friend to hating my guts, which was painful.  I loved the guy, and now i don't exist to him, and it just was painful. (not to discredit what Yellow is feeling, but yeah) . Also, Red and Green(M/16) become much closer friends . But to deal with the emotional pain, I start self harming and abusing drugs.

This is also where Blue and Purple start to show themselves as 'pot-stirrers' to get more drama going, which will be important later.


Red and Yellow keep on showing up my obligations.  Like they show up at marching band performances, and it's never apart, they're always together.  If your SO was raped, i don't think you would keep on showing up with him to places you know the supposed rapist would be at, would you?  

But I keep on getting super frustrated, so I make [this post](https://imgur.com/a/VVt1Z), which Yellow immediately responds to [in my DMs](https://imgur.com/a/RRRqF)
Eventually, some online rando comments ""Do you need me to kill someone?"" in a hyperbolic sense, as a form of support, but Yellow took that as a literal death threat and started telling people I had a hit out on her

A couple weeks pass, and in october, I attempt [an apology](https://imgur.com/a/jhb4n) to Red, and didn't go over so well
He blew up on me, and made me feel so awful about myself, that I attempted suicide.

So on New Years Eve, Green comes over to my house, and we play some games together, but I tried to cheat on my then-girlfriend with Green, because she lived about 3 hours away, and we only visited an hour at a time, so I didn't get any sexual relief, and Green was at my house and he was right there, so we almost did something.  He rejected during the initiation of the sexual encounter, saying that we shouldn't, alluding to me having a girlfriend.  Which then I stop,

In January 2017, I [message Purple](https://imgur.com/a/EsZaH) to ask for her advice, and she's upset with me, understandably,
This is where it's revealed that she knows about NYE
**important note**, under this context, Purple knows about NYE and seems to be under the presumption that it was consensual.

Fast forward to May 5th 2017,  We have a Pep band performance, and Green asks if I could take him home because he couldn't find his original ride, so I agree to take him home.  I see that he found his original ride, so I assumed he'd be riding with him.  
When I leave, I see Orange(F/16) leaving to walk by herself back home, which I tell her that I could take her home if she would want me to, so she gets in my car.  
Once I start to leave, Green jumps in my car will it's moving because he still wanted to come home with me, and then Orange jokingly says we should all go to Denny's, so we do lmao

We end up staying the night at our house, and he puts on a pair of my sweatpants because he was wearing kakhi pants, and we all kind of start cuddling, partially nude, while watching Netflix horror movies.  Anyone with any sort of sense could see that something would've been initiated. Which it does.  Orange and I start making out with his body and felatio is initiated, but halfway through, he jumps up and says No, so we both stop, and he gets up and walks home at like 3 am.  Orange and I are shook, and I get really upset because nothing like this happened to me before

He [messages me](https://imgur.com/a/sTnIx) the next day.

Funny thing is, all the rumors going around school have nothing to do with Orange (a cisgender female), everything is about how I violated Green, which makes this whole thing feel like a personal attack against me.  
I feel genuinely bad about myself here.  I continue abusing drugs and self harming.  I don't actively attempt suicide because graduation is coming up, but it was bittersweet because i didn't have anyone to celebrate with.  I do have multiple daily mental breakdowns.  I was even sent home from my job multiple days because I couldn't work.  I walked around school all mopey and shit so Purple and Blue start [harassing me](https://imgur.com/a/AnU8C) and started fabricating another accusation centered around the NYE encounter. Purple sees that me as playing the victim
Even though I have to eat lunch in the front office now, and literally all of my friends completely abandon me.  Hell, they even gaslit me so hard to make me believe I was genuinely a rapist.
This is where I felt true and absolute loneliness.  Everyone I knew hated me, and pretended I didn't exist.  It was truly the lowest point I have ever been, ever.

Green eventually wanted to drop it, and let me know through [a text](https://imgur.com/a/3WTdl), which I thought was very peculiar, but that didn't fix the damage to my mental health, my social life, or anything like that.  Its like my feelings were just ripped out of my chest, and I feel like I won't really truly be over it

I haven't really gone to therapy to sort any of this shit out

I'm currently in college, but I'm on academic probation because of my mental state (1.77 gpa).  I'm trying to get out of it, but I'm struggling
I'm having financial problems since my loans wont come through

I always feel alone because I don't have a roommate, so I just sit in my dorm room doing nothing a lot of the time
sometimes the feeling of complete and utter loneliness hits me at random times, like the same feeling i had when everyone i knew abandoned me after the accusations
i think its because i don't have that much of a close connection to that many people around here, up in college

I don't like hanging out in other peoples rooms because i always feel like im intruding, ergo i'm not wanted
Or if I am invited, it feels like we have to talk about or do something, like sometimes i just want company

Or since my dorm floor is very social justice-y, a lot of the time i don't feel like i can talk about my personal beliefs, or my opinions without it turning into a triggerfest since i'm a centrist

I have a couple friends on the floor, but they don't feel as close as I would like them to be
I usually feel excluded because of my personal beliefs

Sometimes I see graduates (from my HS) who still talk to those people, and it reminds me of how alone I am, and nobody wants me anymore.  I haven't had one high school person contact me since graduation

even though it was a year ago, it's still such a massive event that it's incredibly fresh in my mind

I just don't know what to do

tl;dr: old friends from high school falsely accused me of rape, which absolutely destroyed my social circle and mental health.  Now I'm in college on academic probation struggling to keep my sanity because I'm so alone, and I don't know what to do.

I have stayed in touch with her ever since and try to talk to her as much as I can.

93,"I’m in my earlier teens, and I feel like I’m wasting my childhood. A normal day goes like this: 

wake up, go to school, go home, do homework, play video games, go to bed, repeat. 

A day off I usually spend only playing video games, maybe doing something else.

I used to read a lot and spend more time with my family, but I feel like I’m getting addicted to playing video games. I play them with my friends, and talk to them, sometimes I hang out with them outside of gaming. 

My grandmother lives with us and is getting older and older, and I feel like I should be spending more time with her, because her time is limited.

I have really good grades in school, but my grades have begun slipping a bit. I used to have all As, but now I am beginning to get Bs more and more frequently. 

I hear about my parents having fun in high school, hanging out with friends and doing extra curricular activities, but I don’t. Albeit, I can’t drive yet, so maybe when I get my license I will do more?

100,"I have a dilemma and need some advice.
I’m 20 years old female, unemployed, vegan for 2 years now. I have a deep devotion to animals. I love animals ever since i was little. Dogs especially, mean the world to me. I’ve been baby sitting a puppy for my older brother. who seems to not really want the dog at all anymore. At first my father was totally against having a pit bull in the house. Once he saw how cute and innocent that tiny 2 month old pitbull really was, he gave in. Now that shes almost tripled in size in just 4 months of age, my dad is tired of the dog. Maybe he doesn’t see what i see. Maybe he’s just tired of me. My dad is probably tired of my bs and wants me out of the house already. 

I’ve taught her a lot. How to sit, lay down, high five, speak on command. She goes potty when i tell her, but when i’m not looking she secretly goes in the house. She’s only 4 months old and i think shes doing an amazing job with her efforts. she runs to the door when she has to go to the bathroom. My dad has been meaning to install a dog door (because we also have two smaller dogs in the house) but i think he’s too lazy to do it at the moment. 

Tonight he got angry, which he’s like that a least once a week maybe twice. I was washing the dishes, while my dad was trying to get the puppy to go outside. She already went out but he wants to make sure she doesn’t poop in the house. He tried calling her and encouraging her to go outside by herself but she just sat outside by the door looking at him through the screen door. 

I asked “is she just looking at you?” 

he said “yeah” and walked away from the door. 

Its awfully cold outside. It snowed just last night here. The puppy immediately scratched on the door, wanting to come inside. 

I said as i was still washing the dishes “you didn’t do it right, she thinks she’s in trouble” 

That when he got mad “well if she poops in the house i’m smacking her” 

I yelled back, “if you smack her then i’ll smack you! whats with your attitude?” I never talk to my dad like that, i don’t know what came over me. 

he got even more mad and said “then tell your brother to come and get her ‘cause i’m not dealing with this anymore. she needs to be potty trained and you don’t seem to be doing a good job about it. your brother should be picking her up soon, which i don’t even think he wants her anymore. I’d rather take her to the “pound” ‘cause i can’t deal with this!” 

I didnt finish washing the dishes but I continued to rinse of a spoon and said “okay dad” and put the spoon on the drying rack and slowly walked to my room and slammed the door. The puppy soon followed, so i let her in. i sat on the floor in my room and cried like a baby. 



i’d say i’m more strict with the puppy than with my other two smaller dogs. There are certain furniture that she isn’t allowed on, but my two dogs are. There are certain foods that she isn’t allowed to have, but my two dogs can. I do everything for the dogs, i walk them, feed them, play with them, teach them what to do and what not to do. The only thing i don’t do, is spend money. I don’t buy the food, my dad does. I’m with the puppy 24/7 and she stays with me, right by my side. The fact that my dad says all the time how he thinks the puppy should get “this” and “that”. And he yells at the two smaller dogs for growling at her, when i see the opposite. I see the puppy trying to steal dog bones from them. Thats why they’re growling. I tell her to step back and keep her distance, she needs to know her place. Maybe i’m doing a bad job at training her. I’m a bad sitter, i know it. Maybe my dad just doesn’t see how much she’s growing and maturing, like how i see her. She means a lot to me now.

My dad doesn’t train the puppy or interact with her. He tells her good morning and pets her when shes being a good girl, but other than that, nothing. 

Am i doing a bad job at training her? I feel like I’ve been lazy lately. What should i do about my dad and I? I feel like its clearly my fault since she is my responsibility.

A few years ago I was accepted to a high ranking county/magnet high school, and also accepted into a specialized stem program in my town high school, but being that the magnet high school ranked far better than my town hs, i decided to go there.

Now, this teacher ( Mr. B ) saw a lot of potential in me and really advised me against this decision but I had been adamant in my decision to go.

Next year I’ll be taking AP Chem but my teachers don’t offer summer classes or anything but my goal is to get a five. I’m really, really determined and I know I’ll need all the help I can get. Mr. B, back in my town hs, has been known as one of the best teachers to teach AP chem, and he even holds classes in the summer. 

Should I contact him and ask if I could participate? How do I even ask? At any chance he gets, he expresses his real hatred towards students who go to my high school. In the period where I had to make my decision, he called those who went to the magnet school “stupid.” 

I’m not sure what to do. I really hope he sees me as a student with a real determination to learn, not as a rival.

She's doesn't teach jack shit, her lectures consist of her reading straight off the powerpoint which is obviously copied from a text book word for word. She know's pretty much nothing about what she's teaching, assigns homework from an online textbook she herself doesn't understand how to work and is unclear when it comes to labs. If you ask her for help or questions on the lab she will tell you to go ask another student or to read the unclear broad directions from the lab book. I once asked her a question regarding how to conduct an experiment for a lab and she said to pretty much ask another student and figure it out as she didn't know herself what to do. 

I'm not the only student who is struggling. Out of the 14 kids left in my class all of them are lost and struggling and if you look her up online her teaching ratings sum up exactly what I'm saying here. Her work load is ridiculous and honestly compared to other teachers in the school she is possibly the worst one. I want to drop ever so badly but my parents are telling me to stick it out because I am ""Behind on credits"" and that i should just be able to get good grades on this shit but so far I'm already at a C/D in the class and super behind on the labs. I could have dropped it a few weeks ago and gotten there money back for the class but they wouldn't let it happen.

For instance my homework due tommorow consists of Approx. 180 definitions which we must find through reading 3 chapters from the stupid online textbook which give or take is approx 100-120 pages. Plus an additional 60 questions. I can't do this. I'm about to have a mental and emotional breakdown man. I'm abusing adderall just to get through her class couple that with my anger I feel like her class is going to lead to me acting out. 

How do I get my parents to understand that I cannot do this class and need to drop so I can later take this class with a different professor and keep my grades up? They just think I'm being lazy when in reality I'm busting my ass for this class and just getting smacked in the face with all this shit. Not sure if it matters but I'm in a community college as a non-bio major. ",12Feb2018,2

I’ve been wanting to cut the ties with her for a while now (reasons I won’t bother going into) but I’m scared once I do, she’ll see no reason to keep my secrets anymore. I feel like I have to stay friends just for the sake of ensuring her lips stay shut. 

I tried distancing myself and replying less to her messages on Facebook but she would just come on stronger, I think she suspects I’m trying to get away. I ended up deactivating my Facebook entirely. I’m scared to just block her because I’m good friends with her boyfriend and I don’t want drama. ",12Feb2018,4

128,"I do not know how to deal with this person. He's obsessed with me. He tries to spy on me and I'm pretty sure he's tried to frame me for things. He used to heckle me a while ago but that has stopped for the most part - other neighbours probably found it irritating. 

My strategy has been to ignore him because there is obviously something wrong with his brain? I'm not interesting enough to warrant his kind of obsession so I assumed he would move on and it would blow over.

Maybe I offended him in the elevator? I don't know what he looks like. Maybe he thinks we're rivals? Or maybe he's in love with me?

Should I buy him some flowers and tell him we can't be together?

I already have a bit of a vision on how I want to go about it which is non-typical, like making everything public and adding very few friends. I would really only use it as a vessel to share a few things with whoever would be interested enough to look into it. In the back of my mind I kind of want to be convinced not to join, but I would like to hear out anyone's experience with or philosophy about facebook in general.

130,"BACKGROUND - I have a bachelor's/master's degree in speech pathology.  I've been in the field for a little over two years, and I'm just unhappy in it full-time.  I would like to maintain my skills and keep a few private clients, but I am done with this career full-time. 

REASONS WHY - being a speech therapist is similar to being a teacher in that you spend a lot of time ""off the clock' writing up paperwork, doing billing, and preparing for your sessions the next day.  I find that while I enjoy conducting evaluations and acting as a consultant, helping departments develop, organizing therapy schedules, I don't enjoy doing treatment all day.  It's totally draining, you literally talk all day long, non-stop.  Most settings you work in have unrealistic workloads and quite frankly the pay isn't worth the stress.

I'm interviewing for HR positions.

They will probably ask me ""why do you want to leave speech therapy?""

How do I state my reasons without sounding totally negative?

I was thinking of saying something along the lines of ""While I do enjoy some aspects of the field, I am finding that I don't enjoy doing speech therapy itself.  I do enjoy helping departments develop, connect, and I like providing training and helping problem solve.  I feel like these skills would easily translate over to an HR position, and taking a position like this would help me towards achieving my long-term career goals.""

Is that okay?

134,"This is a repost, a few things happened last week that may speed the process up.

Hi Reddit, I really hope you can help me with this question I've been asking myself for a few months now.

My SO [25M] and I [25F] have been together for nearly 7 years. For the last year we have only been seeing one-another every weekend/second weekend due to the different cities we work in. We live about 2 hours drive from one-another. He is currently at a job making double what I make and would easily be able to support both of us for a while. He would like me to quit my job (where I am very frustrated at), move to his city and look for another job whilst doing freelance work online. Honestly that's what I want to do as well, but when I talk to my parents about this they are very against me moving to another city without a job.

The company I am working at will probably not be in business for much longer as our lead developer quit last week and had most of the knowledge of how the system works, as he was the one who built the entire system over the last few years. The rest of us who are working here are recent graduates or still students as the company did not want to shell out a salary for a more senior developer. None of us have been working here for more than a year.

I understand that I am an adult and must make my own decisions, but they are also much more experience in life and don't want me to make the wrong choice. My SOs parents are happy for me to be moving to his city, even if it means that we won't be able to visit them as much.

We plan on getting engaged this year and married next year (hopefully), so I would have to move there at some point. I am on a month-to-month lease and would also need to notify my landlord that I would be moving within a month.

The big question is to move without a job and continue looking for one there, whilst my SO pays most of the bills (I would be able to pay my bills with my savings for a few months), or stay at my current job and only move down when I find a replacement?

TLDR: SO of 6 years wants me to move to a new city and support me while I look for a job there, but parents want me to stay in my current city for the unforeseeable future and wait till I get a job there.

136,"I’m a male college freshman living on an all male floor. We started our second semester about a month ago when our three week winter break ended. During the first semester, I got along very well with the guys in my residence hall. We were constantly either doing schoolwork together or going on crazy adventures together. You know, typical college stuff. I was really happy about this since it had been years since I had a solid group of friends that I could rely on. 

But since second semester started, that’s all changed. This girl who none of us previously knew started coming to my hall every day after classes ended and spending the whole day flirting with everyone until she went back to her room to sleep. I go to a tech school with a 3:1 ratio, so everyone here was very pleased by this. 

I didn’t know why, but from the first day this was happening, she hated me. While she was happy to chat with, cuddle with, and touch the faces of everyone else, she wouldn’t even talk to me unless I said something to her first. 

After a week, she wouldn’t even look at me, and I still didn’t know why. I would normally be okay with one person being rude to me, but soon, the rest of my hall started copying her behavior. They completely ignore me as well, in hopes of getting on her good side and eventually having sex with her. 

This has gone on up to today, and it shows no signs of stopping. Every night, all of my friends pile up in the same room as this bitch and have fun together, while I sit in my room alone, knowing how I’ll be treated if I go in there. She even comes with when they do something outside the dorm. It seems like she spends more time here every day. I sometimes hear them telling jokes about me behind my back, which really kills me. 

The loneliness I’ve experienced as a result of all this has made me depressed. I don’t think I can handle living like this for much longer. I need my friends back. I only have two other friends outside of my hall, and I don’t want to rely on them too much. 

I’ve tried talking to some of the guys in my hall about this, but they haven’t offered any real solutions and don’t seem to care. They’ve even had the audacity to lecture me about “bro code” while clearly in violation of it themselves. 

I’d move to a different room, but I can’t find anyone who wants another roommate. I would talk to the girl directly about this, but there’s no way she’d listen to me. All I’ve been able to do is make some petty jabs at those involved, which obviously hasn’t helped.

Can anyone think of a constructive way to handle this situation?

TL;DR pretty much all of my friends have abandoned me to go after a girl who hates me for no reason.

Edit: Thanks for the support. This got a lot more comments than I expected. It’s good to know that people care. I’ll try some of your suggestions.",12Feb2018,21
137,"Let me start with this, I love my father. He raised me with a good moral balance, a good sense of worth, of money, and of self. He has always been an inspiration to me, personally. He grew up in a broken home, abused, working class or less, left home at 15 (chased out at gunpoint, actually), went through hard times, eventually met my mom, put himself through school, worked hard, got a good job, they got married, had me, and we've always lived pretty well off in nice middle-to-upper-middle class suburbs. My dad was one of the few driven individuals who was able to jump class lines upwards because of his own hard work and dedication. I can recognize that I'm an incredibly lucky person, and I've never gone without anything I've needed.

He's always been a fiscal conservative, but he's been lately starting to show this weird side of hatefulness and racism that I've never known him to have before. It's been very sad in recent years to watch him get sucked further and further down the neo-conservative, racist, weird nazi-esque side of the new republican political machine. To quote one of our most recent conversations:

""culture is being defined by money in this country and every other country. Government cheese and koolaide isn't a culture it's an entitlement. Only when we get tired of koolaide and cheese do we get off out asses and learn to provide for ourselves. Until then, the lazy will claim unfair or discrimination. So we give them more so they shut up. That's our mistake. We should let them figure this shit out on their own. To claim they can't get ahead because of prejudices is chickenshit. If they have something to offer, someone will pay for it. Works pretty good for them when they are on the street selling drugs. Oh wait that's my white privilege fault too......right. Only in America is it shameful to be a successful white male......sad. Keep in mind, I heard this bullshit my whole life.....even when we were very very poor.""

This kind of hateful rhetoric is new to me, but he claims he's never changed his stance on these things.

I'm almost 30, married, and my wife and I are hoping to start expanding our family in the next year or so. My dad is beyond committed to the grandchild he doesn't even have yet. He's incredibly generous with what he has and gives freely to family members whenever they need anything. I want the dad that I grew up with to be a part of my future child's life, but at the same time, as a man and as a responsible adult, I can't allow the next generation of humans to be exposed to these kinds of hateful ideas. I've tried reasoning with him and trying to change his mind about political things, but this is something I don't think he'll ever get past.

Is there anything I can say or do to keep him around and involved without letting him poison the minds of my future kids?",12Feb2018,3
138,"I basically just wanted to ask for advice because I tend to not think things through before I do them. And yes I know this sounds like a real waste of my time but I honestly live for weird, thrilling shit like this. 

I've got Tuesday off work so my plan is to dig out my old school backpack, throw in a bottle of something strong, and head off at 7AM and blend into the crowd of kids going into the school. The thing is.. I still look like a fuckin kid. Customers all the time ask me what high school I go to. And also, my high school experience was a total dud, due to being very reserved and shy. Since graduating, I've done all kinds of shit and I'm a pretty confident person now. I'm also able to hide intoxication pretty well, so I basically just want to have a drink and chat it up with some high-schoolers for old time's sake.

139,"Hey r/advice, never been here before but looking for some solid advice. Firstly, I have the standard university roommate issues with 2 guys who don't clean anything and I am left to constantly be cleaning and making sure our place doesn't fall into total disaster. I've tried speaking to them through good and bad and it works for a couple days but it just ends up regretting back to normal. They refuse to clean and it's gotten to the point where I'm so disgusted with things and so tired of cleaning, especially the bathroom, that I have spent a week at a friend's because I just feel gross in my own apartment. 

The second thing is more specific to one of them and it has to do with bills in the apartment. I was the first person that lived here so the hydro and internet bills are both in my name. I pay them each month and although there have been some issues payment is usually on time or when asked. Recently however, I've hit a wall with issues around one roommate who has now decided he wants to jump on this Bitcoin craze and has dropped thousands of dollars on mining rigs despite the fact that we share and electricity bill. He is home almost 24 hours a day, rarely actually attends lectures and already runs a space heater, computer, and light all day while getting stoned in his room and it shows on our bill. We've sucked it up as the current split isn't that much although we know it is him driving up costs. With him now thinking about introducing an all new energy sucking piece of equipment into our apartment that I'm rarely even in because of the afformentioned issues, how do I go about dealing with the split of expenses when the bill inevitably goes higher?

143,"Background: I am a 22 year old female lesbian college senior. I am an education major (English and French) and I love what I do. I work as an RA I love living with coworkers who are like my best friends now. I have a really supportive, amazing family who I am extremely close to. I don't have a significant other but I have mostly gotten over an ex, and I have been dating a little which is nice. You'd think I'd be really happy all the time but sometimes I'm not.

Sadly, I have struggled with procrastination since high school. I was pretty sad during those times but I was dealing with accepting my sexuality and also with a longtime crush on a friend. In college, I found out that I have ADD, which I thought might explain the extreme procrastination and not-really-getting-my-stuff-done-until-middle-of-the-night-before-it's-due. But let it be known that I'm actually a great student... I just wait forever to do it. I also procrastinate things I want to do. Call friends. Text parents. Read for pleasure. Watch French movies. Workout. I'll just watch stupid buzzfeed videos or The Office reruns, or sit in the RA office talking to people about something we've already talked about before. I don't like doing these things, really. I just do them. I figure ADD could explain some, I don't have a lot of impulse control. But also, like... I should be able to get myself to get off my ass and do something that I know I WANT to do, right? Not sabotage myself, like I do everytime? This definitely impacted by last relationship, it impacts my sleep and workout habits (therefore, kinda, my health), and a little bit impacts my educational success. It's so frustrating. I've been trying to fix myself and my habits that make my life stressful and unhappy but it hasn't worked all four years of college yet. I'm sick of it.

I wouldn't categorize my life as unhappy. But I DO things, my dumb, non-self-controlled actions, that make it unhappy sometimes. My family also has a long history of mental illness. My dad and sister deal with depression. I would categorize theirs as much more detrimental to their lives than mine, like they both got to points where they were all around extremely unhappy. I'm not. But I can't find ways to live the kind of life I want to! I don't want to say that I'm depressed because I feel sometimes like I'm not. I'm much happier generally than they are. But happy people don't make choices like I do (like write this fucking text to reddit at 12:37 on a Sunday night when I have a French assignment due tomorrow at 11 and a lesson plan due ASAP that I already got an extension on).

I already take ADD medicine but it doesn't work well and I can't take more because too much gives me a lot of anxiety, takes away my appetite, as well as makes me feel like kind of a robot.

Do you guys think I sound, like actually depressed? Or fine but I need to work some shit through? I tried to talk to a therapist but I didn't really have much to say to her after a few months. Should I try taking meds? My fellow English major friend who used to be like me, late on stuff and kinda apathetic and not often reading anymore, seemed so happy recently. He does the readings and reads for fun. He seems happy and jokey and better than I've ever known him. He went on meds and all I can think is wow, I want to be happy like that. Some days I'm like, I'm fine. And others I feel like I'm spiraling. Give me your thoughts, even though I know that only mine can really tell me what's up.",12Feb2018,4
144,"In the beginning of 2016 I was taking a year (or two) well needed break from college and started working full time. I'm 18. Bored and lonely and looking for meaningless interactions, so where do people who are bored and horny go to get their fix? Tinder. I had my fun with the app for a while but I started to lay low so that I could maybe focus on going back to school. One day, I changed my tinder bio to something about sacrificing human blood as a big fuck you to the app and how I just stopped taking it seriously. 

Time goes by and I finally get a comment referring to my vulgar bio. The person who I felt understood me and my weird antics at the time actually ended up ruining my life. Fast forward to a month and me and this dude are talking almost every day. One night he invites me to a party and every anxious bit of myself said ""don't go with him to this party."" 

Well I obviously went if he ruined my life. 

so, everything is going right in the beginning as it should.  I'm clearly very naive and blinded by an older man who showered me with attention. Vibes hit off pretty quickly which was something that I was never used to. I literally couldn't see anything wrong with him. He was Charismatic. Funny. Dominant. Really really really dominant.........Driving down a very narrow road, he turns to me and asks my to be his girlfriend. Looking back at him I only saw this person in this moment and nothing else. I didn't see his past and I didn't see why he really asked me to be his girlfriend. 

I know that everyone has a past and everyone has skeletons in their closet but his skeletons latched onto my throat so tight by the time I realized I wasn't breathing the damage was already done. 

I found out he had a daughter.....that wasn't really his daughter. I'm a very open minded person and I always try to understand things from different perspectives. The way he portrayed his path was very depressing and saddening. I felt for him. I barely knew him when he told me what happened but I wished I could have taken it all away and that's where I went wrong. 

Finding out your baby isn't really yours has got to be one of the most disheartening things any men could ever experience. I understood why he victimized himself until that's all he seemed to do. He placed himself as the victim in this tale so that it was difficult for me to see it any other way. ""Look at how much is done to me! I can't possibly do any wrong"" ""everyone in my life has wronged me"" 

For the next couple of months I was his girlfriend and I was also his therapist. He'd call me every night either yelling or screaming about his shitty job and his shitty life and after a while it took a tole on me. 

Each month I found out something different about this man and each month had something to do with the mother of his not- so-child. It was hard for me to picture him cheating on me with the his ex because of the unforgivable thing she did to him. 

She cheated on him and had a beautiful baby girl that he kindve helped her raise. A year later she decided to tell the real father about his new daughter and found her self in his bed....again. I think the last thing anyone would consider would be the reunion of this toxic love affair. Their relationship was founded on cheating from the very beginning to the very end, yet I doubted his abilities of what he could do to me. 

I don't respect anyone who cheats. I think there is something deeply wrong with a person who does nothing but cheat. lie. sneak. repeat. So why did I give him a pass on his shitty reputation? 

He made me believe he was broken beyond compare. The intense conversations of the woes of his past led me to believe he really wanted to change. The commentary from his friends about how much I changed him and how ""wild"" he used to be before I came along gave me hope and made me see potential in him. 

The months grew worse and worse and at some point he decided to stop faking. One day he told me was still attracted to 15 year old girls. He was 24 at the time. He said he never stopped fantasizing about them and that's where things really took a turn in our relationship and I didn't know what to do. Now I think he told me this because no one would believe me. I tried showing him the proper etiquettes of BDSM, specifically Daddy Dom and Submissive's. He never listened to me. NEVER. Some nights I wouldn't consent to sex and he didn't care. I disclosed my safe word with this man. I disclosed what I was comfortable with and what I wasn't and he never listened to any of it. 

Between blissful moments and emotionally abusive moments I wounded up pregnant, at 18. I assumed he was filled with joy of the idea of finally having a child of his own but soon noticed that he just wanted me to be pregnant so he could throw it in his ex girlfriends face as an explicit revenge ploy. I didn't want to make my News public but he made an excuse to tell his ex anyways as well as all of Facebook. He even picked out godparents without my permission. It didn't matter if I yelled NO or YES he didn't care to listen to me at all. I felt alone. I felt trapped. I felt unwanted and used.  I asked him if his feelings were real and he lied. I asked him if he was still in love with her and he lied.

I miscarried a couple days into my second trimester. I only heard one heartbeat. It didn't take long before he realized that I failed at giving him the one thing he wanted in this world. He stopped touching me. He started to insult me more. I was truly broken and I couldn't figure out how I got this bad. I had to learn how to heal on my own. 

His actions towards me worsened. He started to compare me to little girls all the time. He connected activities of mine to little girls and all of it creeped me out. He tried giving me panties in little girl sections. I'd tell him how much I hate looking like a 12 year old and he'd tell me he loved it. I became more depressed. Stopped initiating sex. Pretended to be sick all the time. I had break downs regularly. He didn't care for any of it because he was the one causing it in the first place. I thought he was just coping with the loss of the baby and I was there for him because of the promises he made to me, because of his proposal to me to be his wife and how he wanted us to become closer in light of the trauma. He went back to school and I was still mourning. I was told to get over it and stop being a bum. I knew that this man was not the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. 

Two nights before he broke up with me I tried to admit myself in the hospital. I broke down to him about it and i attempted to break up with him because of my mental health. I couldn't do it. So he did it for me, quick, careless, and selfish. 

The night he broke up with me was also the night I exposed him for everything he's ever done to me. I took some of it back because of how much I loved him. I punished myself for making it so public but I should stayed true to my word. I let him win in all the wrong ways. He blindsided me and ultimately left me homeless. I expected him to care for me and to help me get through a traumatic experience that was hell for both of us, but I was wrong. I've been hurt ever since. I never knew how to really cope with the miscarriage because I still believe it was just apart of his scheme to win his ex back. I was there for him immensely and the way he went about things was extremely Immature and senseless.

He got out of his computer chair and choked me. To this day I can't remember what I said to him to make him want to choke me. The break up itself was overwhelming and scary. 

The man who held doors open for me was also the man who blew my phone up any time I went out with friends. He talked shit about my best friend for no reason at all. He made sure I needed him. He's the nice guy one who told me where I should cut next time so people don't see the scars. The caring man who was nice to his mother was also the man who manipulated, gaslighted, and controlled me in all aspects disregarding the fact that his own mother went through the same shit with his father. The same thoughtful man who told me depression isn't real and that I should just block everything out and be cold as ice. 

I'm just a crazy bitch who exposed him. I'm the desperate naive little girl who depended on a man who could do nothing for her. He wasn't sure if he wanted me or not after the break up so he made sure no one else would either. 

He contacted me out of the blue two weeks after my 20th birthday. I feel as if the wounds have opened up again and I feel everything all at once every single day. All the small red flags eat at me. All the huge red flags tear me apart. I can't get over the wasted year I had with him. I believe he has been hacking me due to the saved photo of myself on his phone that came from my private Instagram and the recent hacking on my Facebook. This man scares me in more ways than one. 

My tinder match turned into a real monster and I don't know how to heal from it all. I thought he was my first love but I know I was nothing to him. I know how dangerous he is and he shouldn't be a parent he should be in a psych ward. 

How do I get past this traumatic experience? I'm freaking myself out every day over possibly being hacked by my ex who ruined my life and I don't know how to let it go and finally move on with my life.

145,"I'm 24 years old, left at 18 for the army and moved back home with my mother. The house she and her boyfriend were renting went up for sale, so we and my two brothers had to move into my sister's house. Things are cramped, but not terrible. My sister doesn't charge us for anything as long as we help out around the house, and there's no limit to our stay. Honestly, it's a blessing.

My mother isn't happy about it. She's used to having her own place, but now she doesn't work so she can't afford it. To make it worse, she broke up with the boyfriend who supported her while I was gone. Therefore, I've been delegated to be the one financially responsible for moving out. 

We can't rent, as I don't make 3x any monthly rent in California. However, if I pay off some debt, I MIGHT be qualified for a FHA loan to buy a house. Which at first I was cool with. 

It's hit me recently that I am 24, single, and never truly lived on my own before. I'm ready to move out on my own and have my own life. If I buy a house for everybody to move into, I may never be able to afford to move out on my own, while also paying that mortgage. I won't get the opportunity for independence. And if I can somehow afford to buy a home, it'll leave me scraping by each month.

Does it make me a shitty person for wanting to get my own place instead of buying a house for her?

149,"So. I have a lot bottled up and I need to let it out and just get some guidance on what to do.

Firstly. I started talking to someone I was having a bit of a crush on, and we seemed to hit it off, and she said she'd love to date me. But, then she started getting behaviors like my abusive ex, so I kinda backed off, then she posted about her boyfriend today so it hurt me that she probably didn't even want me in the first place, she probably just wanted to use me. So that hurt.

Now, yesterday, my theatre had a valentines party and my best friend, a girl I've had a crush on since freshman year, was there. We were a bit awkward because she admitted to having emotions towards me but then told me she only had those emotions because of how hurt she was by her boyfriend recently. But eventually, we stopped being awkward and just talked again. We felt connected again and it was nice. Then I drove her home and she told me she wanted me to put my hand on her thigh while I drove. I was really nervous but she moved my hand up and relaxed me a lot. Then, after I got up to her house, she kissed my cheek before she left. That left me very happy but also very confused, and she texted me and said she just wanted to be friends and wanted our friendship to grow stronger.

So now I'm just here. I feel like I'm just existing. I'm left hurt by someone moving on from me so quickly and prepared to be hurt after left so confused by my best friend. I don't know what to do and I don't know how to keep all these emotions in check. I need someone to help me. Please. I don't want these feelings to stay long.",12Feb2018,1

I'm not sure if I want to branch out with new people and try living with them for a new experience. The new friends are okay friends but not as close as me and BFF. 

I've talked with BFF and she understands my view and we know that we'll still be best friends even if we aren't living together. But at the same time, I'm afraid that we'll grow apart (which is probably an unreasonable assumption). ",12Feb2018,1
153,"Friday night, after I got home, I found out my roommate had died. I got home around 11 pm, and he wasn't there, which was very odd for him. I called his phone, the police answered, and at first they said he was found unresponsive in his car, then after I explained who I was, they told me they found him deceased in his car. 
He was a 62 year old naturalized US citizen from Georgia (the country). We met back in November at my job and bonded over the fact we were both foreigners from post-Soviet countries and spoke Russian. He didn't have a place to stay (he had just gotten to Dallas TX) so I invited him to stay with me until his situation got better. We ended up becoming friends and I let him stay with me. He liked my animals a lot and loved playing with them and walking the dog. We all miss him. 
He didn't have any family in this country. He once told me that in case something happens to him, he has his sister's number (she lives in Belgium) in his wallet. I asked the police to look, they found it, gave it to me and asked me to contact his family. I found his daughter (she's in Moscow) through social media and told her about what happened. 
I also received a call from his ex-wife who lives in another state, that was today. I think she got the news from his daughter, I was told his sister knows about it, and asked me to find out how they can get his ashes after cremation. 
I don't know what to do, I am not a family member, but I was the closest thing he had to that in Dallas. I don't know how the legalities work, or what the state is going to do with his body. I know for sure he had just gotten his Texas driver's license and it's registered under my address, would that help? 
I went to his work to ask about what happened, his GM told me the security found him and called 911. He also said that he'd be happy to help with anything. Tomorrow I am going to the church he had gone to a couple of times and ask if they can help with the burial. He was Orthodox Christian and I think he'd want to be buried. 
The police gave the medical examiner's office phone number and told me to call them, I'm gonna do that tomorrow morning as well, and hopefully they'll tell me how to proceed from there. 
Any advice about how to get him buried/retrieve his ashes would be much appreciated.

154,"I’m so tired and drained from life lately and I’m just at a loss here. Not sure where else to turn. My brother and myself currently live together at our parents while I get back on feet and get moved and I work 6 days a week. I’m hardly home but all I do is come home to unwind, watch some YouTube or play ps4 and then sleep, wake up, work and repeat. I take medication for stress and have vitamins and other things I considered safe in my room. But found out that things have been going missing.

At first I chalked it up to being so exhausted that the total 8 or so hours I’m home for the day that I must have just misplaced them. I put a new lock on my door because this hasn’t been the first occurrence of same said family member rummaging through my stuff. Money goes missing, pills, random things.

I paid all of my bills for the month as I do the second I get paid and now have money for food left. I can’t currently buy a new doorknob or anything. I wanted to buy a small security camera but there’s no use because he’d just say “oh that’s not me.” Or something around those lines. And yes I know it is him because while the household is all gone for the day, he stays home and doesn’t do anything. I’m sure he’s severely depressed. But he has also stolen my parents pain medication for very life threatening surgeries and I’m over his shit honestly.

He gets angry and sometimes very violent when confronted and has only admitted once on the numerous occasions it has happened. There were pills missing out of my bottle over the weekend while I was at work. And I lock my door every time I head to work. It came with two keys and I cannot locate the second. It’s likely he is using that or a credit card, or going through my window which I will now lock. I confronted him earlier today and he asks “well what kind of pills are they?” I replied it doesn’t matter what it is and there were clearly more out of them than normal. I filled my medicine on the 5th of this month. Take one a day. And get a 3 month fill so I don’t have to repeatedly go back. Out of the 90 there are 55 left. 

Which blows because now I have to go however many days waiting to go back. I am on meds currently because of a very difficult last year and a half that I have had and am trying to be done with them. But then after the conversation he has been in his room and will hardly leave it, not that that is unusual because he never does. I’m just so tired and I work too hard to have the things I work for be taken. I am at a total loss. I’ve just basically accepted that this will continue until I move.

But when we're around people who don't know me very well i behave myself properly, even so i just don't think he wants me around his other friends, Adam Bryan and Chris, who we share classes with and have sunday league games with. I've only ever hung out with him when we get food, never with Adam Bryan and Chris. And they're nice people, i'd like to be friendlier with them.

It's weird, he's given me advice with dating, hooked me up with someone, given me school/career advice, we've played video games together, things he's told me he really only does for friends. But sometimes i don't get the feeling we're friends. Like when we do hang out outside of school he'll happily talk to me, but when Adam Bryan or Chris are around, i feel ignored.

I recently got a new job and I was flew in to Jakarta to see how they operate the branch there. I only stayed for 5 days and I’ve already flown back to Singapore to start the company here. During my 5 days there, I met the county manager there and she gave me advise on how to run the company when I go back to Singapore. During that short time, I realized that I wanted to be friends with her.

The thing is, I’m very introverted and I have a hard time speaking to people not in my inner circle. 

The reason I wanted to be friends with her is because she seems interesting. She’s an extrovert who loves writing (she’s really good at it.). She also stars in some youtube videos and she’s super funny, both in her videos and in real life. She’s also smart, like the person you can have intellectual conversations with. She used to write in a blog which talks about some things about her life. After reading those, I found out that we have a lot of things in common.

180,"I've just graduated high school and while waiting for university to start, I've taken up a part time job just to fill my spare time and get some retail experience. From the thousands upon thousands of applications I launched, the only one that responded was a somewhat high-end women's fashion retail store, which at the time seemed like an amazing opportunity. However, now I'm having doubts about the job, and I'm not sure if its just me being inexperienced (this is my first job ever, and I'm the youngest on the team) or if it's truly a toxic environment.

The store is broken up into 3 parts - front, mid, and back. The fitting rooms are in the back, and the counter is in the middle section. I've worked for about a week, and I've been positioned in the front every single time, meaning my job is to greet customers, tell them all the promotions, help them pick out clothes, and then hand them over to someone working in the fitting rooms. Every time I leave my section, I'm yelled at and told to return to my spot at the front. Essentially, I do most of the work in making the customer interested in buying our products, but I don't actually get to make the sale - the person working the fitting rooms/register does - and as a result, I have very low KPIs. In fact, since I am fluent in Mandarin (the only one on the team who is), the manager pretty much told me that I would only be working with Mandarin-speaking customers, and I was expected to hand over anyone else to the English-only employees. Not only this, but I was told that I couldn't go on my break without being ""dismissed"" by the manager, a practice that I was not aware of and was never mentioned to me. As a result, I had to go to my break 30 minutes late as the manager dealt with something else before ""dismissing"" me.

I can't help feeling like this is unfair, and I'm seriously considering leaving this job. Of course, I have considered the possibility that it's just because I'm new to this job and that this is just the reality of commission based retail.

She's basically like a sister to me.). She does have some problems like the occasional really big mood swings and depression. She also had some problems with drug abuse. I always stood beside her and did my best to help her out in her time of need. The last two days we haven't spoke much except a few messages here and there. 
Last night she told me that she might be going to a psychiatric hospital and told me that she doesn't want to talk about it. I talked to her for a bit today (ofc I sent her a few messages regarding that and other things last night and this morning) and she said that she still doesn't want to talk about it. I respect that of course and if she really wants to deal with this problem herself or with her parents ONLY I'm not going to force myself into the problem that badly (even tho I REALLY want to help her get through this and I'm prepared to drop everything I planned for the next week or two just to help her).

200,"Hello all, just to provide some context behind my title; I'm a 3rd year undergraduate student who is currently living in student housing with three other guys. We just signed over our lease for the 2018/2019 term and have brought on aboard an individual who I had lived with in residence in first-year. This particular individual had caused me an immense amount of anxiety and psychological turmoil near the tail end of the semester due to a very parasitic personality. To summarize, I decided to branch away from him and live with some other guys in my 2nd year.

Fast forward to now in 2018, we were scrambling to fill a vacancy and ended up asking said roommate from 1st year to fill in the spot. I am starting to experience a lot of anxiety moving into my 4th year and having him as a housemate, as the past few days of catching up with him have revealed that he is no different in his ways and intentions at all. Moving out and going through the hassle of finding a new tenant and a new housemate for myself is absolute last resort, which is why I am surveying as many people as I can to gauge what others have done in similar situations.

I want to know how to beat the mind of a manipulator - do I play passive and impermeable by showing him that I am not bothered nor affected by his abusive and manipulative comments, or do I flip that and go aggressive? Obviously this situation is slightly different than first-year, in which we were both sharing the same room, whereas here I have my own room, can make my own schedule, etc.

Any comments, anecdotal advice or stories would all be appreciated.",12Feb2018,1

However, since it falls on a school night I won't be back home until 5:45 which leaves me little time to study/get ready. She's fine with doing it sometime on the weekend so is it odd to suggest doing something Friday night?

203,"So where I come from (Quebec) there is a pre-universitary program called ""cegep"" between high school and university which is usually two years long (4 semesters).
I was thinking of taking a 5th semester to diminish the workload, be able to do more than just schoolwork, take classes that actually interest me, have better grades and overall be less stressed.

The reason I'm hesitating is because a majority of the people I know will graduate before me, and because most university programs don't start in the winter semester (fall semester: August to December, winter semester: January to May). I might have to wait a whole other semester to start uni.

So the story begins with me getting a fairly poor GPA of 2.5 in my first semester.
I was devastated and kinda stopped going to university for some time in my 2nd semester.
Until the college mails me a letter that in order to participate in the final exams I would need to have an attendance of at least 75 percent and obviously it wasn't 
The semester ends and I end up getting 5 ""techinal Fs"". I wasn't allowed to retake the exams and I would have to clear those courses in the summer semester. 
But the thing was I could only pick up 2 subjects and I had 3 prerequisite courses which I needed to clear. 
So I pick two and now I'm in my 4th semester where I would need to drop another prerequisite course to pick up my previous prerequisite course.
And I also realized that at this point it is mostly impossible for me to end up with a CGPA of 3.5 because of those ""technical Fs""

207,"So, my apartment is half a house, other half is another apartment, and there's a standalone house just behind us with its own driveway that goes through to the alley. We have a small parking lot for ourselves, with 4 spots. 4 people live in this place (all the apartments, total). 3 of us use the parking spots, and the lady in back uses her driveway to park. She has also been known to create another parking spot in front of her house.

On top of all this, we are connected to a parking lot for an abandoned doctors office. People from adjacent houses use it but at any given time there's at least 10 spots free. Parking is not in short supply.

But the lady behind us has been causing us issues. She moved in around December and we've told her once not to have her guests fill our parking spots. Yes, we can use the doc office parking lot, but we live there. We should be able to park in our own lot. For a while it was fine but recently she's been having different people over a lot more. Which is fine. Except for a few problems.

Still taking up our parking spots. Most of the time they use the one free one which is fine. Don't care.

But then, she has people coming over at 2 am and parking behind ours cars, and sitting out there. There's one guy that parked in our lot, music so loud it shook my walls, while I was trying to sleep. He sat out there for 10 mins.

Yesterday, she had someone over that parked in our spot, so I parked in the one free one closet to her. This morning, two spots were free but there was someone parked directly behind me. Not in a spot, parked along the edge of the lot, which again small. It's hard enough as it is to back out normally without hitting my own apartment. I barely had room to back out and almost hit them. I had to drive through the other two spots to get out. 

Its just aggravating. We've already tried talking to her and now it's worse. I don't like being the person to go and make issues but it's common sense- don't block others cars in, especially overnight. And I leave at the same time every morning, though she's I'm sure she's probably sleeping so she might not know. Even still. Don't block cars. And they can easily parking in the other parking lot. It's not like it's across the street or anything. It's an extra 5 feet away, and directly next to her house.

I don't know if the Landlady will actually do anything though. She is part of an actual popular business in town we have to go through so maybe. I'm iffy about talking to the lady herself again. She seems like a bitch and I don't like the idea of confronting her when I'm home alone, which is generally all the problems happen. ",12Feb2018,3
208,"Last year around January 2017 my fiance got his student loan info to start paying back. He has 3 loans and at the time owed about 23k, he said he could make the payments and I trusted that he could. Fast forward to now and he hasn't been making payments on time and hasn't been putting more than the minimum on each loan. He now owes about 26k because of interest and he doesn't care. I have explained how he can pay them off quicker and he will be on board for a week then will spend the $300 that should go towards his loans on fast food, video games or something that isn't considered a NEED. I explained need vs want to him and he just kinda brushed it off as ""well I need coffee"" and ""I need food while I'm at work"". I make lunch and supper for us doing meal prepping and there's always snacks at our place so there's no need for fast food. I have offered to make coffee at home but he always says ""no it's okay I can do it"". 

Last night I got really mad, my car was acting up and I was stuck at the grocery store with a dead car. I called him and asked if he could pick me up (we live 5 miles away) once a tow truck was there and he said he was busy and couldn't. Luckily my parents are a few miles down the road and picked me up and brought me home. 

I didn't have a car today to get to work and my fiance wasn't working today so I used his car and his whole passenger seat and back seats were filled with so many coffee cups and fast food bags. He had coffee stains and oil stains everywhere from fast food grease and I was pissed. He had at least $200 of fast food in his car and he lied about not going out everyday for fast food. It took me 40 minutes to clean out his car and I feel like I'm his mom at this point that all I do is nag him about this and that. 

If I ask him to put away the dishes or shut the light off when he's not in another room he acts like I'm just being grumpy. I can't even explain how many times I have broken down crying because of how angry I get when he breaks promises or doens't follow through with something. I have started only doing my dishes, laundry, etc and our apartment is becoming a dump because everything just keeps piling up. I'm sorry if this is all over the place. I'm really upset and I want to freak out. I don't think it's fair for me to help him pay his student loans if he is just gonna slack and I don't think it's fair to do all the household stuff if he has 2 days off a week and works a short day 1 day a week. He is capable of helping but just doesn't want to. 

When he lived with his parents they would threaten to kick him out, they would take away his internet, take away his phone, etc and they said that's all they could do to actually get him to do stuff. I don't want it to come to that point but he clearly needs a big kick in the butt to see what's going on. Any advice is welcome. 

TLDR: my fiance is a lazy butt that doesn't want to help with chores or pay his student loans. He is blowing his money and doesn't see how I'm hurting because of it. ",12Feb2018,2

215,"Hi, everyone. I posted this before and didn't really receive any good advice amd just got a telling off for fighting in the first, which I know is stupid etc. So sorry that is is long but this may be interesting to other people.

I'm only fifteen and lost a fight to a seventeen-year-old, I went home with my face a mess and my parents were raging and called the cops on this guy, who is now apparently facing a battery charge. But I'm so embarrassed about losing and need some advice on how to get over this.

For a start, I've been in a few fights with bullies for picking on people smaller than them, including my friends. My first fight when I was 13 was when the toughest guy in my year attacked me because I asked him why he's bullying my friend (simple question, I asked it exactly how it's worded here) and he went apeshit. Well, I sorta overpowered him and kept him in a lock until it broke up, and eventually we got along. Since then, I was notorious for ""beating"" the toughest in my year and since then, people respected me and a few hated me but oh well. I got into a few minor fights after that but nothing serious, but I did win as I've worked out for a while and know a little martial arts. I'm not an expert, but I can fight. However, last year, I was jumped by a 16-year-old because my little brother said something to him and he blamed for me for telling my brother to say that (when I didn't) and I ended up with a concussion because I was kicked in the head. He got arrested.

Well, recently, my ""hero"" or ""tough"" guy persona that my whole year gave me got absolutely destroyed a few days back and I'm still shook up by what happened and I need some advice. Basically, someone the year below me began bullying my little brother (who is in the same year as this kid), for his size. I saw this happening one day, and I simply told this kid to leave him alone. No threats whatsoever, but they left him alone.

When I got home, I got a message from this kid's brother (who is again 17, he is friends with the guy who jumped me before so I guess he followed his friend's steps and had a grudge against me for no reason) He acccused me of threatening his brother. So we argued, and he offered to fight me because I outsmarted him. I agreed to fight and I sorta knew I was going to lose, considering he is older and he mentioned in our conversation that he could beat his friend (the one that jumped me before).

We organised a fair fight and I left my house to face him and I got really nervous when I saw a huge crowd at the place. I was relieved when he approached me, shook my hand and told me that everyone here is just hanging around and he was with the guy who jumped me before and a few other of his scumbag friends sitting around a fire and drinking. He offered me to join them and being a little uneasy by being with these people (because of my experience with them before, they're unpredictable, and I'm gonna be honest, I'm shit-scared of them when they're in a group especially the guy who jumped me before being there also). I decided it was time to leave and I was prepared to. The guy I was supposed to fight put a stone in his hand and said that he wanted to test out his hits. Just then, he sucker punched me extremely hard and went crazy on me. I fought back and punched him a few times but he was clearly faster and eventually I had to give up but he kept hitting. I could hear his friends telling him to ""smash me"" and it was broken up by a girl who started to cry for me. Even if I did win (which I almost did), his friends would have all jumped me again. I never went to the ground so he never had the chance of kicking me, but we both still remained standing while fighting. But I had to go home with a bust nose and this guy is now in serious trouble. But I'm extremely angry and I'm scared of going back to school and hearing about it (thankfully, this guy doesn't go to school).

How do I get over this? I know this guy is facing what he deserves and I also gave him a black eye, but why do people offer a fair fight and do that?",12Feb2018,0
216,"Hello everyone,

Although I've been passively lurking on this sub for a long time already, never had the urge to post anything till now. I know that this sub isn't meant for a topic like this and that specific subs already exist, but I feel that you'll be the only ones who could even understand my situation. I usually sort things in my head quite easily, but this one has been bugging me so hard I'm unable to explain it to anyone so they understand it from my point of view.

The thing is, I've been given the opportunity of a life time to start in an excellent workplace (variable working hours, work from home days etc) with a stimulating competitive salary and included mentorship, almost seems unrealistic how good it is, but doing something I truly despise (over a period of a few years I should be transitioning to something I would like to do) in a small secluded town I've been in for so damn long that I know every part of it - I like taking really long walks, exploring new surroundings, especially through nature - but the town also only has one natural place a person can go to. I don't rely on extroverted activities, but from time to time I like to talk to open minded people. All the open minded people have moved out, there's nobody normal I know, actually there almost isn't anyone anymore I know. By going with this option, I would be a very successful business person, with a lot of money, and in the long run, a very stable career, but I've never been chasing money, nor do I find satisfaction in materialism. I feel as if I'll get depressed if I get into that working routine, having all my passions ignored, staying in the same spot, doing nothing.

On the other hand, a strange gut feeling is driving me to a different place, a new place, a new bigger town, with lots of positive and open minded people, insisting that I come there. It's surrounded with nature, rivers, sea, lots of places I could start exploring and really enjoy in my free time. I can get a job doing something I like for an average pay in an average workplace (fixed working hours day by day), but with not even nearly all the work benefits and knowledge I could obtain from the first job. I have no idea how my career would look like in the long run or if I'll be satisfied on this job, colleagues etc. I feel as if I would be much happier there, although I don't know where I would end up, what expects me and why do I have such a strong feeling drawing me there.

First option is my minds choice, and the second option is my hearts choice. I can decide for one only and follow that path in the future. I'm still very young, so am I just being naive and unrealistic for even debating over a gut feeling into the unknown or stability people can only dream of?

218,"So recently i've finished highschool and there was this girl there, lets call her Mary. Me and Mary were pretty good friends during highschool but when it ended contact all but ceased. fast forward about a month and were both at this party and I think she was sending me some signals. Firstly when everyone was together and talking she asked me out of the blue ""You gonna get some pussy tonight anon?"" It absolutely blind sighted me and I made my excuses. Next I should note that the party basically split in two, with a group in the front and one in the back. I say this because I was moving to the back group when I caught her from behind. She jumped then said ""oh, I thought you were gonna smack my ass"" which again kinda shocked me. I dont remember the details but then she said something along the lines of ""I like the attention"".

This might seem obvious at first but remember I've had NO contact with this chick for a like a month. This adds to the fact that she is taller than me (Am pretty short) and that I would consider her pretty firmly out of my league.

220,"One of my (chosen/street) brothers exs comes over about 10 years back and I meet her for the first time. It hits me that I have no choice but to love her. My heart was set and I was a bit miffed honestly. I had other plans,

She was with a guy but we were young and I knew it wasn't going to last. It persists still but it really shouldn't. We will get to that.

She cheated on him a lot and tried to brake up with him but he would stock her and hang out with her brother to make that hard on her. One day sitting in her car she told me she had broken it off with him and I asked her if she could be with me. I had to come clean that I had always cared and that I had kept back beacuse I didn't want that to color my advice to her. She trusted me and I value that. I want my advice to be good. 

 That conversation went off the rails and she ended up with an exbuddy of mine. Then when that fell apart after her living in my house with that buddy. She went back to her old man. We were friends after that but things got worse. We were never as close again.

 She clearly still had feelings for me as recently as a year ago but she is giving me the silent treatment. And prior to having seen her a year ago she had been giving me the silent treatment for nearly a year. She took off that night claiming she got a work call but I feel like she was afraid we would get imminent. We never have. I've always been very respectful. We never even kissed. She was a little afraid I was going to rape her early in the night but I explained there was no way that would happen without a safe word, we had taken lsd after that and it was nearly done working when she left.

 She has an std she doesn't want to give me. Its very common and honestly I wouldn't care if it was AIDS. She has been supporting the same deadbeat sense he lost his job in the first two years of their relationship. {They were together almost a year before we met.}  She claims it was shit after the first eight months and he is quantifiably her live-in rapist. I've asked strait up. ""If he wanted to have sex and you didn't then would you be able to stop it."" She has always said no. There's a lot more to it. like the strong possibility he intentionally contracted that STD in order to keep her loyal. I could go on but I think you get it by now and I don't want to dwell in hate.

I think the turning point were she shut off and stoped really talking to me was after a small party were her best friend was over and she was fooling around with my brother who introduced me to her. I spoke to her some about stuff and she seems to think all I wanted from her was sex. I told her that if all I wanted was sex I have had it day one she laughed at me and I was crossfaded so I decided to take her friend from kind of not liking me to banging that night. By sun up we were fucking loudly. I fractured my pelvis and she's a sex addict now. Apparently still trying to get it that good just one more time. And that's really hard for the girl I love because her brother has a similar addiction to methamphetamine. Honestly the man's quite a poet. I seriously feel for him. ""Pulling off another peace of my soul for one more fleeting taste of what it means to be whole"" 

I need to fix this. I'd love some advice. I'd kill him but she figured out after the third guy who raped her died how I do. I just didn't know how bad it was yet. Back then all I knew is that I'd seen him hit her one time. I knew that it wasn't an outburst. it was sadistic and manipulative. from that moment on I knew that he was garbage but not to what extent. She made me promise not to kill him. Swore she would never forgive me. Even if I did she could end up with worse and honestly I've grown up a lot. Its not the way.

I'm not trying to be a knight in shining armor. I'm not stuck on the idea of her being with me. I love her and feel like she loves me too but I just want to help her. That's my objective. Its going to hurt if she ends up with anyone else of course. Especially if it's  a buddy again but if she's happy I can live with it. As it stands she's planning to kill herself. She's got the date set and everything. Only me and two of my brothers know. One of those two brothers is not so slowly losing his mind and strugleing to recover while he's repeatedly imprisoned for things he's been imprisoned for all ready. Courts are not listening and cops are even starting to see somethings wrong. the other one. The very same who introduced me. Just lost his fiance and is struggling to support her younger brother.  God bless them both they have their own problems to deal with.

I don't want sympathy. I don't need people to tell me I'm a fuck up and that most of this is my fault. It may well be true but that's not productive and this is a soft subject for me.

 If you can't bring anything to the table don't sit down. The stakes are too high. 

If you have any advice or questions you think could lead you to a potential solution please share them.

Thanks in advance if you got this far. Whatever your beliefs if you think you can help here simply do. I'd have given up a long time ago if that was an option. My heart won't let me. So I emplore you, if you have it in you to snap your fingers and make it right you'll have an ally in me for life. I know nothing worthwhile is ever that easy but easy is comparitive and this burden seems beyond my means.

221,"Me and this girl broke up at the beginning of January. She cheated on me and the used me as a rebound. But it has had me in a really bad depression and i've been having a hard time to not isolate myself. And with valentine's day coming up i'm getting reminders to get her to gift I was gonna get and just keep thinking of her, despite how shitty it was. I've been down about breakups before, but this one is extra bad since I feel so used. It was cloud 9 then an instant drop. I've never had anything like it.

226,"My friend ""Jessica"" has told me (a woman also) numerous times about her concern and fear of being left out. She has been left out before by her friends and even her boyfriend. (when I wasn't around) So I understand why she doubts everyone. Everytime I invite friends over I always invite her. She's the first one I even think about inviting after my sister. 

A week ago my boyfriend ""Peter"" invited one of his friends to come to drink with him. Everything after this was not planned at all and happened totally spontaneously. Another mutual friend ""Mike"" had been texting me and Peter about meeting up. Two other friends came to our place to fix something they had been talking about earlier that week, they were not invited but of course they were welcome. They brought booze, we started drinking and later that night we left to Mike's place. 

The next day Jessica saw a video of that night and asked me ""Why wasn't I invited?"" and got mad at me for not inviting her to Mike's place, even though she and Mike are friends. I didn't invite anyone, the whole night was so spontaneous. She blames me like I planned everything and especially not inviting her. Anyone could have invited her but I'm the one who gets shit on. Mike invited us to his place and he could have invited Jessica also but for some reason he didn't and I get blamed for it. All people mentioned are mutual friends. 

Am I a bad friend or is Jessica being unreasonable? What can I do to stop her being upset with me? I hate confrontation and don't know how to fix this. I don't want to take the blame and apologize for something that I feel like i didn't do. What even was my mistake? Knowing about her fears and then hang with our mutual friends without her? I don't think Mike knows about her fear but I do so maybe she thinks it was my duty to include her? 

Earlier that night she was at a bar and invited my sister to come meet her and not me. This is absolutely fine by me, I think it's healthy and understandable to not spend all our free time with the same people. Knowing this how can she feel she has the right to be upset with me for not inviting her to another mutual friends place? She did the same thing to me hours before I did that same ""mistake"" to her.

227,"A little background. I have been working the same hardware store job since sophomore year in high school under the same boss. great guy, retired halfway thru 2017. I buckled down, quit my side job because my hours changed and also they gave me a raise off the bat (dollar and 50 cents wow) with promise of  a bigger raise and ultimately the manager job with salary and all that good shit. well I was strung along this far because everyone told me oh stick it out you'll be made. nobody including me and my co worker saw it coming. I knew something was up when the schedule came in Saturday night and they had cut my hours but we don't work Sundays I didn't have time to react. im looking for another job as we speak, but sitting here right now after being fucked this place is driving me insane. the new manager is literally standing over on one side with a clipboard writing numbers down like hes actually doing something but hasn't approached a single customer basically pointing them all to me because he doesn't know jack shit. would it be in my best interest to stick it out and give a professional 2 weeks even though its making me bug out or should I just quit now. sorry its such a mess, I've got a lot on my mind right now literally any advice would help edit: keep in mind if I stay for any amount of time at all they're going to make me train this guy which I refuse to do. I already tore up my notes I took from before my boss retired, and they don't pay me enough to do what I do let alone hold this guys hand and train him on a new computer system

231,"Hey y'all! Hope all you fine people are doing well today. I'm not sure where to go to ask this question but I figure some folks who have experiences similar to my mother can help me out.

Basically my mother has post-polio. She's had polio since she was 5 and has been fairly independent through most of her life. However post-polio definitely takes a toll on the body and makes life a little harder. Couple with this with her binge eating from her depression, and you can imagine how tough it can be.

My father has been, aside from myself, the primary person to take care of her. However, he was recently diagnosed with stage 4 renal cell carcinoma. He was diagnosed last year, and as of this year, they declared him terminal with 6-12 months. I pray everyday that he can make it and pray for a miracle, but I also have to be practical.

I am 24 years old with a B.S in psych but am currently trying to get into Web Dev and currently have a part time job. Considering the road ahead for myself and with where I'm at financially, I don't think I could take care of my mother.

Thus we are here. My mother has a pension of 42k a year and lives in northern NJ, which isn't very much for the area. She is 2-3 years away from 65 and currently has very good health insurance (she worked for the government). She plans to apply for Medicaid when she can. Aside from us, and her somewhat independent abilities, this is all she has.

I'm worried because she doesn't have a plan in place. She simply says ""I'm gunna sell the house"" and ""My friend spoke about these independent living communities"". This is too vague and she needs a full pan. She needs an A, B and C plan with order of priority to make this as smooth as possible. She also needs a list of services so that she can maximize her ability to be taken care of. I've also mentioned part time work as a translator, but she shot that down inaccurately by saying ""you need a license for that."" She also says she wants to sell the house and I kind of agree with her, but she could also rent put the downstairs which is very spacious ( maybe 900-1200 sqft?) Property taxes on the house are about 10k a year so I'm not sure if this plus an RN would be best or just moving to a home/community.

I don't know whether to speak to a lawyer, or a healthcare provider, or what type of healthcare provider, etc.

If anyone has any experience or advice, please share it. If be very grateful and it would definitely help me sleep easier. I want to make sure she's taken care of. If you need any more information, let me know. Thanks!",12Feb2018,4

233,"So a little background: I recently moved with my husband across the states for his new job. He loves it so much and I’m so happy for him! We’ve had issues getting an apartment due to credit history. Still dealing with that. I got a job in September as an assistant to the office admin/receptionist. The job sounded great and was promised a raise and my own desk and training as a medical assistant. It’s February and none of this has happened. 

Fast forward to now: I’m miserable. I’m left alone a lot to handle the office while other workers travel to different locations. I wouldn’t have taken the job if I knew I would be alone. We have gone through 3 office managers in 3 months. They hire people that have quit in the past (terrible mean people). The office manager won’t back anyone up on anything in front of customers/ patients. I get texts on the weekend or after hours about work stuff so I never feel like I get a break. We accrue 1 day of PTO a month. There’s constant drama in this small office and I’ve kept out of it, but it makes the environment so uneasy. I’m just ready to go. 

I can’t find anything that seems remotely reasonable with what I make now. I have been a receptionist for 3 years and did retail before for 3 years. I don’t know that I even want to be in the medical field any longer. 

So my question is... with this alone free time that I have what can I be doing to get out of here? Any good job sites other than indeed? 

I just need encouragement.

234,"I'm 19, in my second year of college, and a junior by credit hours. I'm a Computer Science major at FSU and after I get my B.S. I have plans to get my M.S. in Computer Science right after I graduate through a program offered at my college where our senior year hours will count towards our M.S. as well.

I love my major. I have no doubts that this is the right path for me. There is so much I want to do in the major, there is still so much I want to learn and improve upon. My problem is that I cannot bring myself to go to class as often as I should. Academically, I have been doing fine, I have a 3.56 GPA.

I wake up, with plenty of time to get ready, but then I just sit in bed, not wanting to do anything. I know the solution is to just force myself up and to go, but some part of me just cannot will myself to get up. I rationalize to myself that it's okay, but even then I feel guilty. It makes me feel like I am going to fail college, that I won't be able to get my degree, that I will have lost this great opportunity in this major because of myself.

I don't know what to do. I'm doing decent in my classes right now, but I feel so behind from missing so much. I hate myself, I feel like I'm going to throw all of this away and waste all of this. I know I just need to hold out for a few years. The worst part about all of this is that I want to end up teaching at the university and working in the field. I need to stop doing this.

I tell myself every day and night that I can't keep doing this. I keep saying that it isn't too late for me to turn this around. But when I wake up, getting myself out of bed to get ready and go to class feels like the hardest task I have ever taken on in my life. I'm interested in most of these classes too, but I just feel so lazy and unwilling to leave.

241,I'm 17 right now turning 18 in July of 2018. I really want to grow myself and my character if that makes sense.

244,"I kinda just want someone's opinion on this, my wife and I both feel like we're being treated unfairly some days. 

We live with 2 of our friends and their daughter. We recently lost our jobs (like within the last month), but before that we we're paying our equal parts in bills and rent, putting food in the house, and since we've lost our jobs we've also been going to food pantries and asking our families for support with other personal financial stuff like toiletries. I just got a new job and started this last week, which because of this issue, is the only time I leave the house. 

Now, the reason we haven't just moved out is because they requested help watching their 4yo daughter. My question is, is this a fair trade off? We're here watching their daughter for 12+ hours a day, pretty much all week. We feed her, clothe her, bathe her some days. We deal with most of her tantrums and the killer part is having to answer her repeatedly asking where mommy and daddy are, and her telling us how much she misses them. We clean the house up so when they do get home, it isn't a mess. We do their laundry because when they take their clothes off at the end of the night they put them directly in the washer, not  a basket. Which prevents us from washing our clothes when we need to. On of that, we were also given the task of being her personal driver because she has driving anxiety. So we use  her vehicle but we have to take her pretty much where ever she wants/needs to go, unless her husband is available to do it instead (one of us will stay at the house to watch her daughter, the other will cart her around on request without a moment's notice.)

Anyway, they both work quite early (6am he goes in and she's in around 8-9am, their daughter is up and running around by 7-8am) and then usually after work, they go do... Whatever. Literally whatever. They only really take care of her when they don't have plans, on their days off which is rare and then it's also rare that they're home to put her to bed around 9pm. I just don't understand how it is that people can push their kids off on people they call their friends, and then complain about how much they miss her. 

This last weekend the girl had off from work 2 days in a row and chose to go to Victoria secret at the mall 45 minutes away with her husband (which she supposedly is divorcing, yet he still lives with us. It's half the reason we moved in to begin with.) and they were gone pretty much all day, and we we're here with her daughter. And the next day she did the same thing. I understand wanting to have a life and free time of your own, but we neglect things that we have to do to watch their daughter, like doing job applications and running our own errands and having our own personal life.

247,"I've heard you should *always* counteroffer when a new employer is offering you a new job, but I just don't know if it's appropriate in this case or how to ask for it. So here's my situation... I'm in my mid 30s, highly educated, and I've never gotten a good foothold in a career. A combination of bad timing and limited options (from prioritizing my wife's career) have led me to building a resume of disparate jobs each lasting about two years (never been fired, and I'm not a job hopper).

248,"Hello, 
this is going to be a long text but I'd really really appreciate it, if anyone'd read all of it.
So, I'm a 15 1/2 yrs old girl and I've been suffering from depression since I was 12 and am seeing a psychologist since the end of 2016. Things have gotten better but I'm currently in a really bad mood and it feels like my depression is coming back to haunt me. I even started cutting again. 
But that doesn't necessarily belong to my ACTUAL 'question'.
So one part that has gone worse bc of my depression is my image of myself, especially when it comes to my legs.
I just think they're fat asf even though I even have a thigh gap and and I'm severely underweight according to my BMI.
But we'll get to that.
So when I was kid I wasn't really 'fat' but I think I was pretty close to get to that kind of weight instead of being 'thin', if you get what I mean.
When I was in 6th grade (ab 155cm height and 45kg weight) my best friend started dieting and wanted me to lose weight as well which made me super insecure bc she already was thin asf and I just felt even more.. fat.
I stopped weighing myself for around 2 years but I probably weighed over 50kg with a height of 156/7cm.
Then, at the end of 7th grade I started extreme dieting and on some days I would just eat sth for dinner and there were also some days when I completely ate nothing for more than 30 hours.
However, I did not count calories at that time.
I weighed myself about 2 or 3 months after for the first time and was at 45kg which made me really happy because I realized that I lost a lot of what I had gained during the phase I didn't weigh myself but definitely gained weight back then.
But I also grew to 158.5 cm (also my current height) and my bmi was at the very bottom of normal weight.
I started to lose more and stayed at 42kg for about a year.
In April 2017 however, I first started to get under 40kg. Just for a short time, but I was there.
In 2017 I started calories but not to lose weight but because I wanted to keep my weight at 40kg.
Several people stated how skinny I am and that they think I lost a LOT. (in a good way)
But I just don't see myself as a skinny person. yeah, maybe me arms are skinny. Maybe the fact, that all my bones are visible and bothering me while sitting on hard chairs are a sign of that but I just feel so fucking fat.
In December I went down to 38kg due to getting braces which prevented me from eating a lot.
Now I'm at 38.8kg and every 0.xkg I'm gaining is making me feel as if I've gotten 3 times heavier. (bmi = 15.3, severely underweight starts at ab 16.8 at my age)
Srsly, I gained 0.2kg and was about to cry when I saw my legs that appeared so much more fat.
I also can't stop counting calories, I just hate not to have control over myself.
My psychologist told me to at least get back to 40kg bc if I dropped to like 35kg she's need to tell my parents and I'd need to go to a clinic, that's why i'm trying to gain weight atm but it's really hard for me.
On the other side, my brother is stuffing so much food inside him which literally makes me lose my appetite. I just hate it when people have like no control at all over themselves.
Is that already considered an eating disorder?
I don't want to lose weight, don't get me wrong, I know how dangerous my currenr weight is. But I just am so fucking scared of gaining weight and I love the feeling of shedding weight.

251,"I turned 29 recently. Single, no kids, from a Western country. 

I have a four-year arts degree and a law degree. Worked on-and-off as a litigator/legal assistant/whatever for about two years after getting called to the bar before deciding that I f*cking hated it moving overseas to take a year off while I was still young-ish. I was in criminal defence, which I found stressful and, ultimately, unrewarding. I don't want to go back to it. It jaded me. It didn't pay much. It was a miserable, disheartening experience. Walking away from it has been difficult, but I've finally come to terms with the fact that I don't want to be a lawyer, or work in the field. I'm just not wired for it. 

I'm working right now as an ESL teacher in Asia. Teaching has never been my long-term plan. I'm basically just taking a year off to get outside, get out of the rut, and figure out what I need to do with myself. I haven't made much progress in this department. 

Basically... what do I do? I am contemplating going back to school, and trying to get a post-grad diploma in HR with a work placement or something to elbow my way into that field... but I don't know. Am I too old to be going back to college at this point? I could probably afford it, but what if I just hate that, too? Am I the problem? 

Who else has been pushing 30 and feeling like they're starting over? I don't think my previous work experience has many skills that are transferable or relevant to other fields (people often say that having a law degree qualifies you for a lot of other work... this appears to be BS, especially if you studied/worked in criminal law). I really want to do something more interesting than a minimum wage whatever job, but increasingly I fear that may be what I'm qualified for without at least taking some courses or something. 

Whatever I do, if it isn't going back to law, my parents will be disappointed. That's most of the reason I stayed with it for as long as I did, but I can't do it anymore. They've been assisting me financially my whole life--paying off my student loans and also paying on average 50-75% of my rent (when I was employed full time I would pay it; when I was only doing part-time stuff or unemployed they would pay it). I've never asked them to do this, but I know that if I just do something random when I get back they won't feel inclined to help me out anymore, or I won't feel inclined to accept their help anymore, and they will just be quietly disappointed until they both die. I've never truly supported myself (until I moved overseas, actually). I'm, thankfully, debt-free, although I feel serious pressure to just not do a lot of things that I want to do because my parents wouldn't like it, or understand it. They're like ""oh, there's no work in your field?"" It's not that there isn't work, it's that it actively makes me miserable. They've never worked a job like that before, they don't get it, and I don't really expect them to. I think this just may be making it more difficult for me to decide what I need to do, or what options there are for me. 

I think I might just need perspective. Sorry for the rant. Please help. ",12Feb2018,2
254,"Let's start from the beginning. It was the end of Highschool. I ( I am a boy to be clear) went through a lot of stress and I came physically aware of it. I got this pain in my chest and at a certain moment I thought I could die any day. So I was depressed, badly. So I asked this girl out, an old good friend I hadn't seen in years, just to spend my final hours having fun with her. I only contacted her. To my surprise she said yes. She gave me a reason to keep on fighting. She's the reason why I am able to post this today. Last week I told her she got me out of my depression because she said yes to that date.  I also told I was eternally greatful and that I felt sorry I wasn't there for her when she needed me. She appreciated the letter and know we're planning to have dinner.  I didn't tell her yet she saved my life, but I'm going to soon. The thing is, I've always felt something for this girl, not because of her looks, but yes, she's pretty. I also feel like nothing will ever be enough to thank her enough. I want her to be happy at all costs. I would do anything for her.
So what should I do. First become close friends again ( I didn't see her in years) and then tell her I have these feelings for her?

Of course, their next question is “What kind?” ... I don’t want to answer that; I’m unwilling to talk to work/college acquaintances about my mental health.

I then needed money so I donated plasma. I basically donated plasma so I could smoke weed. It's a huge secret, and I'm scared my parents might find out or something. I mean, I'm not hurting anyone so I don't know what the big deal is.

I feel sad a lot. I have no one who I can talk to about my problems. I can't even go to therapy anymore because I'm taking five classes and can't really afford to miss class.

Can I just rely on email therapy or something? Or should I see someone on campus. I might be able to see one person on campus but the problem is the counselor there can only see you 8 times and that is pretty much it. It's for immediate issues, not long term issues like mine.

I just really loved getting stoned. I don't even drink anymore. I used to combine the two but it wasn't fun. I like smoking way more than drinking.

So I go to university and work at an art gallery. I do all my work. Then drive home an hour to smoke pot. I only smoke on the weekends because I don't have any place to smoke on the weekdays.

I would smoke a lot during the day. As soon as I wake up I can't wait to smoke a bowl. Is there anything really wrong with that? It's not like I'm hurting anyone. I just feel guilty and ashamed a lot of the time.

I keep feeling sad. And smoking sort of takes away that sadness I guess. It's an escape. Once I went two weeks without smoking because I was traveling to Texas. I can go without it, I just feel sad without it.

It makes me happy and helps me deal with my PTSD. I'm wondering if I have an addiction. Doesn't an addiction impact your work? I still go to class everyday and do all my school work. I don't know what the big deal is, yet I still feel sad.

I just feel really lonely. I've never had a girlfriend before. I just feel sad all the time. I do go to therapy and take medicine.",12Feb2018,3

269,"Hello! I have a small-medium online shop. I basically get in contact with independent artists who use their art to create things mostly in the form of stickers, keychains, enamel pins, patches, and miscellaneous goods. I help them out by buying their products at wholesale prices, reselling (with their permission of course), and also creating a name and business for myself in the meantime. So, that's explained. 

I recently decided that I'm gonna find some 'brand embassadors' and people to sponsor. It'll help me grow and also give them some free goodies, you know how all that goes. I'd be doing this mostly on Instagram. I'm not talking people with millions of followers, just people with up to 3k just to push my brand a bit more. 

The problem is, I don't know what niche of people to even look into? For example, a cyclist would be sponsored by bike part or clothing companies. Gamers would be sponsored by controller or headset companies, for example.

I just can't even begin thinking where to look and who to look for. If you know of some notable people for an example or what kind of niche would be interested in promoting my products (as listed above) and also being able to help me out, by having a following of the same types of people, please let me know in the comments.

270,"**LENGTHY POST BUT HELP!!!* I live in a city where the houses are very very close to each other, if not feet away, usually touching. We live in the city, so obviously parking is extremely crowded at times on the street. My roommates and I have been over the top with how kind and respectful we are of my neighbor and her property IE. help moving in her stuff when she moved in and every day we see her we say ""Hey! How are you, quickly catch up and say: ""Have a wonderful day!"" We have tried to be as nice as possible to avoid any potential issues. (I understand that this is only two brief examples but the point I'm trying to make is that we are kind, respectful neighbors.)

There is a conjoined house attached to the back of my house, so we do not have parking in the back of the alley. My neighbor, does not have a conjoined house/duplex in the back, so she has four open parking spots behind her house. Behind the four open cemented spots is a grass plot of land that can have two cars pull into it to extend parking. Next to the grass plot there is a shed that is perpendicular to the grass spots, so you can parallel park next to the shed (which nobody does or ever has). This shed is partially on my land lords property. There are two people who live in their house with 7 potential spots (including the shed spot).

I used to park in the grass area thinking it was my landlords property, which he still thinks it might be his - because it connects to the property of the house he owns that is attached to the back of my house. My neighbor's landlord, is a very nice guy who bought the house next to us recently and has been fixing it up the last year, so I have gotten to know him well. He has seen me pull into and park in the grass area multiple times to which he smiled and waved and carried on with his day. -- So the landlord had no issue with me parking there.

My neighbor, is new to the city. She only knows a handful of people (which she has personally said to us) and it is VERY rare that she has company over. Her roommate, (technically downstairs occupant because they live in a duplex) is hardly there (nor do they know each other) so I assume she spends her time with some sort of significant other or family in town.

One day, I received a very long message from my neighbor explaining to me that she will tow me if I parked in the grass spots behind her house again. I was polite, and apologized and expressed that it was to my knowledge that it was my landlords property. I also explained that since I had a new vehicle it would be really nice if I could park in one of the spots in the grass for the time being so my car does not get side swiped on the street parking. I just wanted to do this till our problem was resolved w/ the landlord to which she said ""No, I would rather you not because ""my man"" stays here some nights."" I obliged and she got our landlords involved - keep in mind she has 7 spots for two people - and my landlord who is very easy going shot me a text saying ""Hey it sounds like you have a real B**** of a neighbor. Just leave it be and be the bigger man. I would rather not get into the technicalities of our properties. F her."" (talking about the 4 concrete spots and 2 grass spots - not the shed)

No problem! It has been months since this happened. Normality has perused where we see our neighbor and have pleasant conversations about what we have been up to etc. She seems very excited to see us every time we walk by so we are under the impression that she does enjoy being neighbors with us.

My new car has been side swiped twice on the street parking since. Not her fault, but if she could have been kind enough to let me park there it would have been prevented. I can't hold this against her though, since it was her property.

It was pouring rain last night and there was absolutely no street parking. I had just gone to the grocery store and had a lot of groceries. I scanned the streets and there was no parallel parking anywhere near my house. I then pulled into the alleyway to see if the spots my landlord owns were empty - they were not (these spots are used by my neighbors connected to the back of my house who I know from highschool so they do not mind when we park there at times.) There was no parking but for her 6 spots - 4 concrete 2 grass (she was not there) and the parallel spot next to the shed which was never previously discussed. I parked next to the shed leaving the two grass spots, and 4 paved spots open for her. I woke up to drive to work this morning at 8:00AM and my car was gone. There are not any ""no parking signs,"" next to the shed like the ones that she recently put in her grass lot next to the paved area.

So, she had me towed for being parked there over night, which the shed was never previously discussed. My landlord said it was partially on his property but I cannot get my money back from the towing agency - at least yet.

I do not want any advice about ""taking the high road"" like I had done before when she was being unreasonable. I have been far too nice for her to go behind my back and to call and get me towed on a spot we have not discussed on a Sunday night before I have work the next morning and not simply text or facebook message me to move and save me the towing expense, uber, and time of having to deal with all of this. It was an overall shady and unkind thing to do to someone who has always treated you with respect.

Please give me clever ideas for revenge that would not harm her or that are not over the top. I would obviously have to wait a little while before I do anything but REDDIT give me some funny advice on pranks to a shitty neighbor. Also do not mention civil claims court or dealing with property zoning. I want sweet sweet revenge.

272,"I live with two roommates. Each of us has a cat (three cats in total). We've split the litter responsibilities by having a physical chore chart that hangs by our front door with each of our names on it and a ""scoop the cat litter"" tile that we move from person to person after we do it.

For months I've been trying desperately to get one of my roommates to scoop within 2 days of it being her turn (we all agreed, we needscoop every other day at minimum). She often will go the entire week with the tile on her name, to the point of the litter being disgusting. 

And, because it built up so long, when it's my turn (I'm after her) I almost always have to scrap dried hunks of urine from the bottom. So not only is she doing it infrequently, but she's doing a poor job when it's her turn.

When I remind her, her excuse is always ""I forgot"" or ""Sorry, I was busy"" or ""I'm tired."" We all work similar hours and are home a similar amount of time, so I don't buy the busy excuse or even the tired excuse (it takes 5 minutes, come on).

I find myself having to text her and remind her to do the litter when it's her turn constantly. Even worse, she always responds to these texts passive aggressively (like, at least if she were like ""So sorry! I'll be right on it"" I wouldn't have to fear a personal attack each time I remind her). My other roommate does the litter on time, but is not comfortable reminding her. So, I end up being the nagging mom in the house.

In my opinion, forgetting this often is not an excuse. You can forget to do the dishes. You can forget to sweep. But you can't forget to take care of a living being.

I've tried asking her if there's a better way to remind her, or a better system to set up so she'll remember, but she says she can't think of one. Nope, me reminding her every time and her responding aggressively is her preferred reminder method.

How can I get her to ""remember"" to do a shared, minimal, necessary responsibility without being her mom??

TL;DR: How do I get my irresponsible roommate to clean up cat shit once a week, without me personally having to remind her?

281,"I already posted this to r/offmychest but didn’t get any response, so I thought I’d post here as well:

Alright, the title is definitely over-simplifying it, so I’ll just tell the whole story, I apologize for the word wall. I’m probably giving wayyyyy more detail than necessary, but I feel like everything needs to be said so you’ll understand the situation. I’ll try to make a TL;DR once I’m finished. I only have one friend left to talk to at this point and I’ve already talked to him about this more than I think he’s cared to listen to, and he’s too close to me and the girl, who I’ll call A, to really give me unbiased advice, so I’ve come here. 

So I might as well start at the beginning. I met A at the beginning of 11th grade (last year), and we hit it off really well, like, really really well. I’ve never met someone who I connected with more naturally in my whole life. After talking to her once I knew I wanted to be friends with her, and soon after realized I hoped for more. We texted day and night for a week and a half/two weeks every free moment we had. We’d be up until 1 or 2 in the morning talking and it was great. But after this, we decided to hang out together with my friend and his girlfriend. She seemed really excited and I was really happy that we were gonna get to hang out outside of school for once, but she never showed up. After about 20 minutes of waiting, she finally texted me and told me she had a migraine and couldn’t make it. I had my suspicions that it was just an excuse but I wasn’t sure. That night, I told her how I felt and asked her how she felt about me, and she told me she liked me but didn’t have time in her life for a relationship. She said there was too much chaos in her life. This was a real bummer but I thought maybe it was more of a “no for now” than a definite no. Then, a few weeks later, she started dating another guy, who we’ll call S. After this we still remained friends, and I eventually put my feelings behind me (sort of). 

Last semester (12th grade), we had a class together and we would always joke around and have fun. There kind of seemed like there was something between us, but I pushed those thoughts out of my mind since she was dating S. Nothing too eventful. 

Now, here’s where things started happening. With the semester over, I wasn’t going to attend high school anymore, so I wouldn’t get to see her anymore, and I had a week off before I started college. We ended up deciding to go see a movie with my buddy (B) and his friend (K), who is now his girlfriend. B drove us all there, and me and A sat in the back. During the ride, we were joking around a lot and having fun, and we kept inadvertently touching each other on the hand or leg then quickly pulling back. At one point, B saw an abandoned barn and we stopped to check it out, which A was very opposed to. But we went on nonetheless, and once we got in, A started acting scared and clutched my arm and put her head against me. Then she dragged me back out and to the car, still holding me. It seemed weird but I wasn’t sure what to make of it. 

After this, we finally got to the theater. During the movie, we leaned very close to one another and whispered back and forth a lot, still joking around. (Don’t worry, there wasn’t anyone around us and we were quiet. We’re not those annoying people at the theater.) And I noticed her texting her boyfriend during the movie. At this point, I realized this upset me, but tried to tell myself not to get upset. I was still trying to convince myself I didn’t have feelings for her. Anyway, after the movie finished, we headed back, and it was much the same as the way there. There was one thing that happened that was very awkward though: she had leaned in to say something to B up front, and I leaned in to whisper something in her ear as a joke, but she turned toward me at the same time, so we were a couple inches from each other’s face. We just looked at each other for a few seconds then pulled back. I tried to explain it wasn’t what it looked like, but she didn’t seem bothered, so we just moved on. After we got to B’s house, me and A stood outside talking for quite a while, and I told her to text me whenever she wanted to. 

As soon as I got home, she texted me and we proceeded to text until 3 in the morning. She asked if I was trying to kiss her in the car, and I told her I wasn’t. Then she basically seemed to be suggesting that if I had, she probably would have gone with it, but didn’t want to say it outright. She told me she still had feelings for me sometimes and that was why she had been so distant for a long time. She also told me her boyfriend was very angry about her hanging out with me even though he told her it was okay. 

For the next few days, we texted and called nearly nonstop from the time we got up until 3 or 4 in the morning. On Thursday, we started to discuss some very serious issues. She had been sexually assaulted by a female friend a few years back, even though she hadn’t ever thought of it that way. (She got her drunk and left hickies up and down her whole body while she was passed out and the friend was 18 while she was 15). While we were talking, A came to the realization that this had caused her to be very bothered by sexual contact. Then she told me how her boyfriend didn’t care when she told him she didn’t want to do anything, but he made her have sex with him anyway and would get very angry at her when she was on her period and make her do other things instead (which she hated doing and told him so). All of this was very hard for me to hear because I care about A so much and I can’t imagine anyone treating such a sweet person like that, much less two. She told me she would talk to S (presumably to break up) and also told me how thankful she was that I listened to everything she had to say and how important our friendship was to her. 

Before I talk about Friday, I should mention that she was subtly trying to hint that I should talk to her friend, E, because she thought we’d be good together. I found this weird because I knew she had feelings for me and she had to know I did too. I think she was trying to push me off onto her because she felt like she’d just hurt me. Anyway, we had decided to watch a movie together Friday night because she loves Moana and I hadn’t seen it. A was going to E’s house that night, so we planned to watch the movie sometime after I got off work, but E wanted to invite me to eat dinner with them. Somehow I let A talk me into this, which led to a very awkward couple hours. When we finally finished up and I got home, A slipped away from E’s house and came over. While we watched the movie, A kept leaning in toward me and eventually leaned against my shoulder. I wasn’t sure what to do at first but I eventually put my arm around her and we started cuddling. We sat like this silently for a long time. Once the movie finished, she jumped up very quickly, and I assumed it was because she realized what time it must be. She left and later that night, we talked again. She told me that she wasn’t leaning in to cuddle, she was just exhausted and falling asleep because she had stayed up so late the night before. I felt awful when I heard that because I realized how uncomfortable I must have made her. Then she tried to convince me I should give E a chance so I told A how I felt. I told her she the only girl I wanted to be with, and if I couldn’t be with her I wasn’t really interested in anything else right now, certainly not someone she’s friends with. I told her I knew it wasn’t the right time but until it was, I wasn’t ready for something else. 

The next day, she was at S’s house for a few hours, which I thought seemed strange since I assumed she was breaking up with him. It shouldn’t take that long. That night, she didn’t seem to want to talk about it, so I left it alone. She convinced me to watch a romantic movie and tell her what I thought of it. We talked about that and she was flirting with me a little. Then on Sunday, I decided to ask her what happened with S. She said she talked to him about all the stuff she told me and that he felt really bad and told her he would do whatever he could to help her work through it. She said she understood if I didn’t want to talk to her anymore, and I told her I needed some time to think things through, so I waited until Tuesday to talk to her again. That week, we texted some, but not nearly as much as the week before. On Saturday, me and B went out to eat and coincidentally ended up at the same restaurant A and S were at. A told me S was very angry that I was there. 

The next day I told her how I thought she needed to break up with S. I made it very clear I wasn’t saying these things to get him out of the way, I said it because I was concerned for her. I reminded her how she told me he would get angry at her over everything and would get jealous anytime she hung out with anyone other than him. And, most importantly, the issue with him not taking “no” for an answer. She then told me that it wasn’t like that, she said she pretended to enjoy it and he had no idea she wasn’t into it. Which was totally contrary to what she had told me before. I tend to believe what she told me originally more. Her response this day seemed very prepared and not genuine, whereas she seemed very honest and emotional before. She said she “owed him a chance to change” which I think is a stupid reason, and told her so. But, to be fair, he’s given up weed (which he was pretty much addicted to) and is going out and doing more stuff with her now. I’m just afraid he’s just doing it temporarily to keep her. I hope I’m wrong but I can easily see him going right back to the way he was. 

She didn’t text me at all that following week. This week (the next week), I decided to text her about it and she told me we couldn’t talk in private text messages anymore because S doesn’t like it. She said we could only talk in a group chat we have with E and B. I also found out from E that A has been very distant with her lately as well. 

Now I don’t know what the hell to do. I care about A so much but I don’t know what I can do for her. I want us to still be friends because I can’t bear not having her as a friend. She was one of my best friends. She was the only one I have other than B. I don’t want to see her get hurt again, but I feel like S will. I want her to be happy, and if being with S makes her happy, I don’t want to ruin it, but I don’t know how we can be friends if he’s so opposed to me being in her life. I’ve tried to think about what I should do. I’ve thought about telling her I want to still be friends and see if she’s willing to do it even though it makes him mad. I’ve thought about just leaving her alone and hoping she comes back on her own, but I doubt that will actually happen because she’s going to basic training in June. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to date her right now, I just want to be friends and make sure S treats her right. 

As a side note, she borrowed a couple books from me and I want them back at some point. I hate to ask for them now because she hasn’t finished them yet, but I’m afraid if I wait for a couple months until she is, it’s gonna be really awkward asking for them back.

291,"Throwaway here.

Tl;dr: early 20s, always been skinny but starting to get a bit bigger (155lbs 5""9, was around 135/140 a few years ago, 150 a few weeks ago) and it's making my stomach feel physically heavy and giving me anxiety. Even though I don't look much fatter... Is this normal...?

This has been on my mind the last few weeks, and it's bothering me more and more. I've always been a pretty skinny guy, I'm in my early 20s, around 5""9 and ~155 pounds and in okay shape, which is still... Solid. But over the last few years I've been gaining weight exponentially faster it seems. A few years ago I was a lot closer to 130/135, and just a year ago I was 140/145. A couple months ago I was 150, but now I'm pushing 155. I have been working out a bit, but not that much (so it's not muscle), and my scale has a feature to tell me my fat % and that's gone from like 8% to 14%.

Now I still look pretty good, but when I sit I feel my stomach weighing me down and putting more pressure on my body. I can't sleep properly because I feel like a marshmallow... Even though like I said I still look pretty fit. Is it even healthy for me to try and lose weight when I'm only 150/155? How can I ease this unexpected anxiety? I'm sitting at my desk and feeling my stomach press against my ribs and it's stressing me out. Feels a bit suffocating. But people keep telling me I'm being ridiculous because I'm ""so skinny"".

293,"I have been married to a guy for two years. A couple months ago I started a new job. The guy that trained me was always really flirty with me and we joked around a lot. I just viewed him as a friend at first. However after a month, my feelings changed and I wanted to be with him. About three weeks ago, I asked him if he could help me study for a test we had to take. He came over to my apartment when my husband wasn't here. We studied for a couple hours and talked about ourselves. I realized we had a lot of things in common and just felt an even stronger connection. I ended up hugging and kissing him on the cheek. We locked eyes and looked at each other for a few seconds and we kissed on the lips. I pushed him off of me and told we shouldn't be doing this and that Im married. However after a couple seconds I pulled him towards me and started kissing him again. We ended up eventually having sex on the bed. He stayed the night and left right before my husband got home from work. 


I know it's wrong but the coworker and I have been seeing each other every day since. Sometimes he comes over to my place and other times I go over to his. We have had sex many times. He told me last night that he's in love with me and wants me to be with him.

I love my husband but I'm not sure if I want to be with him anymore. He's never here and never wants to do anything besides watch tv when he is here.

310,"So, I'm here on reddit asking for advice because I'm not sure how to proceed. Let me break it down for you:

I attend a masters program at a university in the US. To pay for this, I managed to get a job as Graduate Research Assistant which pays full tuition and a $1000 a month stipend.

The problem is, the professor I work for does not speak very clear English. He is Asian and I'm not sure where specifically he is from or what his first language is, but it is clearly not English. Even though he has been a professor at my university for years, and has published research, I have an extremely hard time trying to understand him and complete the assignments he gives me. Even when we correspond via email his glaring grammatical and other errors make it difficult to understand him. When I meet with him in his office, I usually spend a full hour continually asking, ""can you explain that again"" or something along those lines. Eventually we run out of time and I just have to nod my head and agree and hope I can sort it out over an email later. 

there's only so much time for us to meet, and our meetings are more about trying to understand what he's saying more than being about even trying to understand the assignments i'm given. The hardest part isn't doing the work itself, its figuring out what the hell this guy even wants or is trying to say to me. Once I can decipher what he wants from me, I have an okay time doing it, but reaching that point is getting harder and harder as my assignments get more difficult...

I haven't mentioned this to anyone yet at the University, but it is well known among the student body in my major that the professor I work for doesn't speak clear English, and people who take his classes often suffer because of this.

Fortunately I (through blind luck and not really me being good at networking) made personal friends with the head of the department. This was obviously a huge factor in me not only getting accepted into the masters program but receiving a position as a GRA in the first place. I'm hesitant to go to the department head and complain about the professor i work for... i'm hesitant to tell anyone about it because i'm not really sure what to say or how to bring it up.

What, if anything, should i do???

EDIT:
I just really don't want to receive poor ratings from this professor as a GRA and not be selected to do it again next semester. I'll have to drop out of the masters program and it will have been a waste. please help!",12Feb2018,1

318,"I'm an organizer for a group on meetup.com and i've assigned a few co-organizers who also schedule group events. 

Today one of my organizers posted an event and they need to buy tickets in advance so she said in order to attend that you would have to come to one of her other meetups and pay her in person. 

I nicely suggested that she use venom or paypal instead of expecting members to attend another meetup just to be able to attend a future meet. She responded saying that she doesn't trust stuff like venom and paypal. 

As the main organizer I don't feel right about our group hosting an event where members would actually have to attend another meetup that might not be convenient for them or not be in their budget if they want to get a spot for a future meetup.

1: Just ignore it and hope that anyone who wants to go will be able to meet with her beforehand to pay 

2: Send her a message and actually tell her she has to provide a way for members to pay through a service

I am disgustingly selfish - I can only think of myself. I'm unable to feel empathy or bring myself to care about anyone else or their problems. I have no one close to me except for my boyfriend of 1 year. He is literally the only person of importance in my life. No friends, no family, no one else.

When I try to look into my future, I don't see this selfishness going away. I see it getting worse. I swear I have that LOTR/Hobbit ""dragon sickness"". I think only of material things, treasures. They are all I crave. I spend all day thinking of material possessions that I want to own. I'm willing to step on anyone to reach what it is that I want. I use people, lie to people, cheat, steal. All to obtain material things and money.

I worry if someone can actually live like this. Can people go through their entire lives happily having nothing but material things? Can you actually be so conceited and wrapped up in your possessions that you are happy that way forever? Or will some horrid, unending regret manifest at some point?

Right now, nothing in life brings me more happiness than obtaining the material things that I desire. Not even my boyfriend, which I am disgusted to say. If I'm being honest with myself, I think this mentality of mine developed from losing pretty much everyone that was important to me. I think I've had enough of being hurt by people, and I'm turning permanently to material things.

335,"Background: I have worked for Megan at her non-profit animal sanctuary for six years. Megan keeps roughly 15 exotic animals,  the facility is licensed through the appropriate government agencies. Megan suffers from a hereditary organ issue and has been sick the entirety of my time there. She is up for a new organ this summer, where she will leave and be away for multiple months. Megan has become more difficult to work with over the years, I had an incident last year with her chewing me out for picking up a call while washing some dishes. She accused me of ""not being here for the animals."" Her son apologized to me and said that being sick has had a big effect over the years.

Staff are technically all volunteers. We need seven, we have four. Her adult children used to work with us, they have since refused to be involved. One just up and left town last month, with a months notice. She pays us under the table when she can, but in six years I have made probably $200, comparative to the $2000 I have spent on gas, as the sanctuary is an hour's drive from my house, each way. I work a single 5 hour shift a week, I also have two paying jobs and I am a full-time student. 

Megan has been consistently becoming more tense with me over the last six months, it started with her calling me at ten pm, accusing me of harming one of the animals, his eye was swollen. She asked me if I hit him with a shovel. The next day she texted saying it was normal and made no sense. To me, these are wild animals. They live outside in large yards, they dig, they fight each other sometimes. Swollen eyes are going to occur. 

**The now:** Megan told me to hang a new tarp Thursday. As I was hanging it, an animal inside the enclosure grabbed the corner, tug-of-war ensued, the bottom seam of the tarp rips clean off in a straight line. Bummer. I still hang the tarp, it unfortunately will not last as long, but it still provides shade.

Megan texts me yesterday asking why I cut it. I tell her I didn't and what happened. This is what I receive:

&gt;The odds of that are highly unlikely Norman. Now lets have the truth plz. Not to mention thru all the biting they did to the other tarp no of that led to  a perfectly Straight tear. Noir in my 30 years have I seen any animal bites lead to a unjagged straight tear. This is not that important to lie about. What happened really? If you had the idea to tear it after he bit it thats just a goofy  mistake not the end of the world, the truth plz.....

I respond: Megan, I have no reason to rip up a tarp before hanging it, that makes no sense. The rip made it actually harder to hang because it took the holes off. He grabbed it by the corner and it ripped at the seam when I pulled it back. You can see the strip in the recycling. She gets back:

&gt;Ok, so he had alot of the tRp when he got a bite. How did he get so much of the tRp thru the fence¿? If he had a corner and u pulled it, it should just tear the corner, and if you kept pulling tearing along, that makes no sense bevause u had 95%of the tarp and he had 5 %, aka the corner. Seriously the probabability is in the tens of millions mathematically. There is only 2 ways that clean line got there intentionally or a tug of war with the tarp, and Shilo had the majority of the tarp, and you grabbed the the corner from him and he kept pulling.Either way that would not be happening thru the fence. Bottom line the tarp is not much good now it will start to frey and un weave immediately  with the large edge missing. When u come next week we can reenact and let  me how the miracle tear occured. I have torn many a tarp. The only straight tears I have ever got is if I cut it for one reason or another or the tarp is supper old, and I am holding the molding and it tears straight away from the old falling apart tarp that has nothing left to it other than the out side molding pretty much. This tarp was in good shape. Certainly if I see proof otherwise, happy to apologize and admit my error. 



I have not responded. I wanted to tell her how hurtful it is to be treated so suspiciously after six years. I also want to tell her that I am incredibly uncomfortable and unwilling to test rip another tarp to see if it rips the same way! What happens if it doesn't? Like what the fuck? I am about to be 27 years old. I'm busting my ass around my life trying to do all the things I care about and I can't deal with being this busy and treated like I am some sort of lying enemy. I care so much about the animals. I have raised thousands of dollars in donations at fundraisers that I have organized and thrown with no assistance from Megan, work her daughter took credit for. I have come in sick, I have worked in the dumping rain and mud, I have worked on Christmas, I have worked on my birthday. I care. 

**Can anyone please help me with a response? Should I just quit over texting? Do I go back? What do I say? I would hate to not get to say goodbye to the animals. I love them.**

As we have worked together, I have noticed that we have a lot in common. We're both 40 and single. We text each other memes, both at work and after. We both play video games. We have very similar political opinions. We finish each other's sentences sometimes. All the things that would normally signal ""hey, maybe we should explore this"". 

Of course, the obstacle to this is the fact that I am her manager. I am very aware of how it might look from the outside. And I know, even in today's environment, with things like the ""#MeToo movement"" and the like, it would be questionable at best. I am technically in a position of power relative to her, though I don't quite have the power to outright fire her or affect her salary in a significant way. Even without the current political climate, I feel it's questionable ethically.

On the other hand, due to the area I'm in, I don't have many options when it comes to relationships. And this sort of connection is the sort that, if it was not for the professional relationship, I would kick myself for not at least making an attempt.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not in love with this woman. I see potential. And I feel that we are both adults enough that if we decided against pursuing anything, we could both be professional and move on. I feel that I am adult enough that if she turned me down, I could continue professionally without any negative bias towards her.

Lately I've been very interested in film (I've always been) and am currently seriously considering majoring it and becoming a director. But I'm already becoming a senior which means I'll have to apply to college by the end of this year. 

Do you think it's worth for me to go to film school or should I stick with a path in science? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks",12Feb2018,2
344,"Hello. Like the title says, I have an eyelash that curved backwards and is in my eye. And lemme make it clear, there are two parts of my body where no one may touch me without me freaking out or attacking. My neck, and my eyes. Long story short, I came home from school, told my mother, and she has tried for the last 3 hours to get it out using a mixture of eye drops and a q tip. But no matter what, I keep jerking my head away or something. I can’t stand my eye being forced open the way it is, and at best I can only last 2 seconds of her touching the area without my flipping out. It’s gotten so bad that I’ve even screamed or even cried. I know, I’m a big baby. I’m honestly beyond words for how ashamed of myself that I am. But I mean, this whole thing fills me with complete and utter horror. I’d say I’m scared, but that would be an understatement. I’m absolutely terrified of anyone touching my eye or anywhere near it. After about 2 hours of me acting like a baby she eventually ran out of patience. There’s honestly nothing she can do, and there’s nothing a doctor could do either. I’ve always been HORRIBLE with eye drops, so that makes it a million times worse. And sadly crying will not get it out. I really truly can’t calm down when this whole thing is happening, it’s just straight up impossible. And believe me when I say, I’m not controlling myself when I jerk my head away. That’s my body doing that on its own. I know that sounds like an excuse but I am being 100% honest. I really truly don’t mean to, it just happens. I can’t even begin to explain the kinda mixture of pain and dryness that I feel with it being in there, and how much pain I feel when my mom tries to get it out. And I should mention it’s not just one loose eyelash. It’s three eyelashes still attached to my eyelid. We’re both super afraid of it scratching my eye, or even worse, it makes my eye get infected. What I’m asking is, what I do I do? I’m so unbelievably horrified of my eye being touched. I know, I’m a bit baby, and like I said I am deeply ashamed of myself. But I just can’t control it. And I think it’s safe to say that It’s not coming out through the usual means of using a q tip or something. I’m honestly really scared of it scratching my eye, or absolute worst case scenario, I end up losing my eye because of this. Someone please help me here, I really am scared and this really hurts.

Hello


I recently hooked up with a guy who tends to talk about butt stuff a lot and I'll usually reply with ""yikes"" or something because I'm not experienced and I know it needs to be discussed and warmed up and not spontaneous.


The other day he was fingering me and I yelled ow but he didnt stop. I let out a few more painful sounds before I asked him how many fingers he was using. He told me two but it certainly didnt feel that way. He also didnt respond the first time and I had to ask him tbree times with a more stern voice each time, which I feel like confirms my suspicions.


He moved on to finger my ass which I had never done before. I said ow a few times really uncomfortably and told him to stop him doing that although he tried again a few times. He was really rough but I didnt say anything because I didnt want to kill the ""mood"", assuming there ever even was one. Im mad at myself for not yelling at him to fucking stop. I know that was stupid of me.


Instead, I just looked at him and said ""so when are you going to fuck me"". So he turned me over and started doing his thing and he was touching my butthole too I guess. After a few thrusts, he pulls put and fully penetrates my asshole with his entire dick. I screamed in pain and my body went forward trying to get away. I yelled ""OUT GET IT OUT JESUS FUCK"" and he didnt immediately pull out, I kept yelling and telling him to stop until he eventually did. He pulled out and laughed and said ""yo I totally came in there"" and then looked at his dick and asked me why I was bleeding. That event of him in the ""wrong hole"" lasted maybe a few seconds but it felt like forever.


Im having a hard time feeling sympathy for myself because of some of the things I said/didnt say/wasnt clear about. When I asked him to fuck me I didnt really specify the hole? Could I have helped myself by stopping him before when it was just his fingers? I dont know that to think. I feel disgusting.


This happened a few days ago and im beyond furious with him and myself, not to mention extremely sore and feeling helpless.


I guess what I'm trying to ask is: was this rape? Was it sexual assault? Or is this entirely on me? I really dont know what to think and I'm all kinds of confused and anxious the last few days.


Thanks

351,"so about two months ago i left my job at Lowe’s to work at an ice cream shop. at first, the manager was super sweet and i heard from every other manager that she loved me as a supervisor. then, within the last two weeks, there has been a slight movement of her pushing me closer to becoming a manager along with a few others that help to run the stores. however, i’m quick to believe things are wrong because whenever i ask about it now, she avoids answering even though i see her posting on the website we use for our schedule. on top of that, she just isn’t friendly like she used to be and keeps even her texts short and to the point; not friendly at all like they used to be.

along with my manager suddenly becoming cold towards me, there are some other supervisors who will post on the schedule website about something being done wrong yet not naming me personally. i finally realized rather than taking that (since i am a relatively new supervisor and still getting used to everything) i should confront the problem head on. so i texted the coworker who (ironically, today) posted saying i made a chocolate sauce wrong and told her i knew it was me who had made them so could she please text me the real recipe since i had been sent the wrong one a good while back. of course, no response. and i’m sure i wouldn’t hear back until a day later.

i work with people ranging in age from 16-21 and the kids who are just scoopers and not supervisors are some of the sweetest people ever. it’s the supervisors, and all but one manager that are completely rude and out to get everyone it seems. should i take all of this as a sign i should pack up and leave this job since my manager can’t be honest with me about possibly not wanting me as a manager anymore, or should i just lay low for a while and then try to check in with everyone a few weeks down the line?",12Feb2018,2

354,"Hey guys. As the title says, I'm applying to my school's nursing program. I finished my freshman year with a 4.0, but over this past summer, as I was enrolled in 3 classes, my grandpa unexpectedly passed away (who raised me). This took a heavy toll on my heart and as much as I tried, I couldn't finish out the summer courses strong. I got an F in one and 2 C's in the other two which both require a B in order to be accepted by the program I'm in.

I retook the class I got an F in last semester and finished with an A. I am currently retaking the 2 classes I got a C in this semester and hope to finish both with an A (however, the school of nursing will not be able to view this semester's transcripts, and the F and two C's will show up on the transcript as well).

Basically, what's the best way to explain this to admissions? I'd like to write about it in my personal statement. The death of my grandfather really got me to focus and value a nursing career but at the cost of doing horribly for one semester as I processed everything and took care of grieving family members. I don't want them to think I'm making it up or making excuses. It is what it is and I am doing my best to work with it.

So I am a college student (18M) new to my university this semester.

I feel like my life isn’t interesting enough and after the initial couple questions I always seem to end up giving a blank stare and not knowing where to take the conversation next. How can I be less awkward? What else is there to talk about besides family sports and hobbies and home? I just feel very lost and my awkward interaction is definitely preventing me from making new friends. What do I do? And how can I be less awkward? Also I just broke up with a girlfriend of over a year who’d been cheating on me near the end. I don’t really know how to interact with others now since she took up so much of my time.

So for some background, I am a mid 20s professional working in the mental health field. I am independent and I have critical thinking skills. Not to mention common sense. So bear that in mind. However, I am contemplating taking a huge risk for the sake of my own mental health and because life is too short. 

My job is good. I know my job is good. But I hate it. I feel sick every day I have to go in. I know my quality of care for my clients is declining, and that makes me more stressed. I should not be at this level of stress as my previous jobs were 1000x more stressful. 

I am starting medication for depression/anxiety.  These are two things I’ve been able to manage without medication since I was a teenager. I feel like I have lost this battle. 

The logical side of me tells me to wait it out until I find a new job. The bigger part of me is saying to take a leave of absence at my job and focus on myself. Even just quit without notice. Then volunteer and spend time outside and discovering what I love about life again. Focus on finding a fulfilling job. Focus on finding myself. Even drive Uber for income in the meantime.  Take this huge risk. I feel less stressed about the risk than about showing up for work tomorrow.  This has been on my mind for months and gnawing need to stop suffering in this short life is killing me.

370,"Hi friends.

I'm just writing to see if any of you have suddenly had issues with speech. In the last year or so, I've noticed myself having a real problem with expressing anything verbally. Meaning anything from expressing feelings and thoughts to friends, to relaying basic information to my coworkers. Even when I go out with friends where I'm comfortable and generally content, talking with people and trying to say what I'm thinking is like pulling teeth. What I aim to say is clearly laid out in my mind, but then I go to speak and all hell breaks loose. I stutter, can't think of what words to use, sometimes I don't think before I speak and just say whatever (which is never good lol), or go to talk and nothing comes out. It's like my brain overloads and freezes, and then just finally shuts down. Which in turn, makes me anxious to speak again. Because whomever I'm talking to can clearly see that I'm struggling, making it an uncomfortable situation that I feel guilty about afterward. I am someone that loved to talk and connect with people, so this whole change feels very detrimental.

Background: I should add that I am still recovering from severe depression (for the past 5 years) and a suicide attempt (2014). I am a 24 year old with ADD--not medicated, I don't drink excessively or do hard drugs. I smoke weed from time to time. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this before. I'm happy to take advice if you can relate. I'm considering seeing a professional on my own accord, but again, having problems with communicating thoughts. Even writing this from a throwaway account is difficult to do. 

So sorry if this post reads as completely ridiculous or comes off as whiny. I've tried googling what I'm experiencing and just seem to come to a dead end. Please be easy on me, thank you for reading. ",12Feb2018,3

373,"I'm 26, and despite what I consider working hard all my life, I've had a REALLY hard time finding a successful job/career. Instead I've been in and out of school - where you're basically your own boss. I finally landed an amazing job in a completely unrelated field to all of my studies on the premise that I have good people skills and am a willing learner. 


Now this real job stuff is really kicking my ass and making me face my insecurities. I'm constantly asking myself if I'm slow to learn and if it's just me, or is this job insanely hard. I'm going to speak my mind here in hopes someone with real job experience can weigh in.


To give a bit of context, I manage the front desk while simultaneously doing a job that requires a lot of focus. I prepare files for financial advisors to look at before they meet with clients, and at the same time I have to anticipate what they need in the meeting. It's basically 20-50% redundant stuff (that still takes a lot of focus) and the rest is seemingly something new. Every small detail is important, I can't spell someone's name wrong or get their age wrong, but at the same time I'm pulling information from many sources so it's easy to make little mistakes!


The big stuff is crazy. Everything feels like a crash course. I'll be doing regular file prep then suddenly - I have to do this big huge task! Say I'll be asked to make quotes based on what the boss wants, find the right forms, make sure they know what info they need to fill them out. Sounds easy but it's not. Forms are full of legal jargon and as I said it's a new field to me, I don't always know what I'm doing/what the end result looks like - or even why I'm doing it. This role has required me to completely learn something new in order to do it properly. 


But I've put in a massive effort. I've learned on my own time, taken the hit for making mistakes, asked for help, taken the hit for making a mistake that someone else TOLD ME TO DO, asked for feedback. So many things about the job are really difficult to manage on my own. 


Recently they noticed me struggling at managing the front desk and doing my other task at the same time - NO SHIT SHERLOCK. The job of preparing is extremely importabt and time sensitive, and at the front desk there are so many interruptions. They moved me to a different office, and I really noticed how much easier the job got - instantly. It's only been a few days and I'm making less mistakes. But I hope they don't think I'm shitty at my job because I can't sit at the front and do this properly. They even said many times that they feel like they set me up for failure by putting me up there, which is true but is an insane blow to the ego, but like always I've gotten the bullet.


When they hired me it was clear that it was a new role because of expansion. I spent the first 4 months shadowing, which was frustrating in its own right because the people I shadowed fucking suck at teaching. ""What is that?"" ""I don't know I just do it like that."" Then as I learned, I was quickly corrected by my manager for nearly everything because it became clear that there are multiple ways of doing one thing, and the way I learned was never the right way. That screwed me up in the learning process as I was constantly left to ponder which way was the right way. And even though they made a big deal about it, I would see traces of the job being done incorrectly from others who taught me. Very typical, but blown out of proportion. 


It's clear the person I took over the job of had it way easier. Her ""strengths"" are different, and she is NEVER allowed to sit at the front desk because she has poor soft skills and seems unproffesional. She got started off with very small bites at a time, and always had the comfort of a quiet office. I never got that head start. I was shadowing in the front, learning multiple complicated and complex roles until I landed on this one. I really hate to compare myself, but this job forces me to question why our job development was always so different. In my learning process she even suggested to my manager that I cocus on the things she used to do, to which my manager quickly and harshly declined. The truth was,, I was already doing that as a part of a way bigger job. 


As soon as I started taking over this job it was changing, ""improving"" - increasing the workload with every appointment and even the number of appointments I do a day. So the prep I do now is like double what she used to do. And what's worse, I was always required to know what the heck I'm doing. When I started out my first week I asked this girl what an acronym was, one that is VERY IMPORTANT and that we work closely with every day. The girl couldn't tell me what it meant (not just what it stood for!). She gets by just plugging in numbers. What a remarkable skill. I couldn't possibly do that even if I wanted to. Too much is demanded out of me. 


So here I am at the end of the day feeling defeated yet again because I almost missed one printout for an advisors appointment tomorrow, and even after I felt on top of my shot today, it made me feel really crappy. So what do you think? Is it me or does everyone feel like this at some point? Thank you in advance for skimming/reading this far.


Tl;Dr Not sure if my job is just hard and I was trained oddly or if I'm actually a slow learner who is bad at my job -examples being the fact that I was taught multiple ways that were incorrect, was at the front while trying to learn/do things that require focus, and the girl who I took over the rile from was taught to do her job completely differently.

I'm currently in grade school, my grades are all very good straight A's 93% or higher. But I just hate the feeling that a lot of my friends get better grades in their classes than I do, it's just this feeling of inferiority just pisses me off, I try using it as motivation to do better, but I just can't.

I was a masturbation addict and spent at least 2+ hours a day edging, but I joined r/nofap to start fresh and be more productive. Then there's the fact that I have a crush on some girl, and I'm just so confused on what I should do about her, she seems perfect (I know everyone is probably gonna say that about their crush, but it's true) she has literally near perfect grades 98% in all classes or higher. She's an athlete plays soccer, and the best mile run on the track team, she’s in National Honors Society at my school, one of the most prestigious clubs. The worst part is I don't know why I like her, is it because she looks cute, maybe cause she is really smart (although it does make me incredibly jealous, and I always get into an inferiority complex whenever she does better than me on something). I've been crushing on her for a little over a year now, and I thought I was making a lot of progress over the last couple of months, until a few weeks back when she called me her ""best friend"", then i realized since I was trying so long she hasn't really though of me in a romantic sort of way and just though of me as trying to be her friend. And now I'm starting to realize that she might be crushing on one of my other friends. Now this guy is just like her, very intelligent and a very talented soccer player also National Honors Society, all that other jazz.
