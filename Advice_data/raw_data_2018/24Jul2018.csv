0,"As the title says, my Mom suddenly passed last year and I'm realizing that my Dad (60 y/o) has never had to take care of himself before as an adult. My parents had very traditional gender roles: Mom cooked and cleaned, Dad fixed things around the house, paid the bills, etc. They are/were both well-educated, gainfully employed, very responsible and were able to impart that wisdom to me and my younger brother.

Now that she's passed, it's clear that he doesn't know how (or has the discipline), to keep up with daily chores, cook for himself or dress in clean clothes etc. Here are a few examples of issues I've noticed that were never problems when my Mom was around:

* No clean clothes. Dirty clothes scattered around the house.
* Fridge full of rotten food
* Dirty dishes everywhere. Often with moldy bits of food in them.
* Boxes and papers everywhere. He definitely has a hoarder mentality that's now unchecked without her.
* Personal hygiene getting worse
* Only eats take out
* Gaining weight
* Began consuming hard liquor and generally more alcohol. He never drank more than a beer in one sitting before.

With all these negatives in mind, I will say that he is very financially responsible. He doesn't have any debt and is generally very frugal, so I'm not concerned on this front. He's also not on drugs (to my knowledge), so I'm not worried about that either.

My concern is that I feel he's going down into a spiral without my Mom. I'm worried that he might get sick with all the spoiled food around. Or that the hoarding and general filth will get so bad that he and the house will become unrecognizable. Part of me thinks that this may be ""normal"". Anyone that goes through the sudden loss of a partner needs some kind of ""transition"" period... I just don't know if he'll snap out of it by himself...

Last notes: My Dad has always been a super stubborn and independent man. I've offered to help him around the house or to hire a house keeper but he refuses it every time. He's also the CEO of a small life-sciences company (co-founded with my Mom), and I'm sure some of these problems are because he's mentally exhausted from work and doesn't want to deal with these ""unimportant"" items.

So Reddit, I'm looking for advice. What should I do? I feel like any forced intervention to do a big ""clean up"" or give a lecture will be received terribly. I want to help teach him how to take care of himself, but I don't have any idea where to start...

Thanks in advanced for reading and sharing your thoughts.",24Jul2018,1
1,"As the title suggests, my friend is showing obvious signs of starving herself. 

So for some background information, she only works out twice a week for an hour each. This has been going on for about three months. To begin with, she was never that fat, she was about 140 pounds. Now she's 130.

Recently, we spent a whole weekend together and before this happened, she would rarely ever get sick after eating things. But during the whole weekend we were together, she got sick after eating literally everything. Keep in mind, we went to a couple of different places that we've eaten at before and there was never a problem until now. Now, she gets sick after putting anything in her mouth. (Sick as in diarrhea.) 

It doesn't stop there. **She used to have a lot of muscle, and used to be able to lift upwards of 50lbs.. She used to be able to beat me in arm wrestling in a second. But during the weekend, when we arm wrestled, I almost beat her. And I don't work out, at all.** I'm basically skin and bone with no muscle at all. So right there is evident that she's losing muscle mass.


All she's told me is that she eats a lot of cucumber and celery on most days. I don't know if she eats anything else, and if she does, I'm not sure if she retains any nutrition from it.

The sad thing is, I'm really her only friend and I know she won't talk to me or tell me the truth. I've tried asking multiple times and she keeps saying ""I'm okay after I use the washroom."" I told her if she was so sick, she should go home and she refused, saying that she was fine.

All she does is go on Instagram every day and stare at pictures of models, comparing herself to them and using their pictures to give herself inspiration to be skinny and try to ""become pretty"" and it's a terrible habit that I want her to stop. I'm at a loss for what to do, so any advice with this would be greatly appreciated. I'm worried and I care about her.


TL;DR: Friend constantly compares herself to Instagram models and is starving herself to try and become like them. She's hiding this from me and is in constant denial that there's anything wrong. Help, please?",24Jul2018,1
2,"I’m a male in college. We’re both in our early twenties. Maybe my biological clock is ticking, but I’ve been trying to pursue a romantic relationship over the past few years, daydreaming about all of the sweet things I’d do for a girl if she were my girlfriend, etc. I’m not an unattractive guy and I’m constantly working to improve myself in all areas of my life (physically, mentally, socially) so that when the right girl finally comes along, I can be the best version of myself for her.

I met this girl (we’ll call her L) at the start of the school year this past September and we hit it off well. I was instantly attracted to her and she definitely showed a lot of physical signs she was interested in me (constantly sitting next to me, feet pointed towards me at all times, bumping into me, intense eye contact, etc.). Being in the same group, we worked together on a lot of projects, and I flirted with her often. I knew she knew I liked her and she was definitely showing signs of being interested in me. I was hoping we’d be a couple by the end of the school year. I was so wrong. 

One day around November, she casually mentioned to another group member that she had a boyfriend while I was present. Obviously, I didn’t react in the moment but I was devastated inside (look through my post history if you want) and threw a fit with myself that night, running out of the house into the frigid autumn dark. Hole in my heart, I didn’t care. 

After that night, I stopped flirting with L. I did my best to distance myself from her in class. I never initiated any conversations with her outside of our class work. I guess I felt stung, betrayed in a way. I thought our feelings had been mutual but I definitely didn’t want to interfere with her relationship - now that I knew she had one. I closed myself off, and yet she still initiated conversations with me. I’d just reply back to be polite. And even though I’d tried so hard to distance myself from her, I’d always catch her giving me these long looks when I was around. Whatever. I spent the next several months feeling shitty about everything. I still kind of do.

Cutting off contact like that was the best for me, if a little immature. I knew I couldn’t be happy as long as I saw L with the other guy, so I isolated myself from her. I wanted to forget, and to move on. Fast forward to early July, and I randomly get a notification on my phone one morning that L followed me on Instagram. Okay...I wait 2 hours to make sure she didn’t do this by accident, because I don’t want anything to do with her anymore, before following back to be polite. 

I looked at her profile once. She had one picture of her with her slightly older boyfriend amidst dozens of photos. Until now. She knows I’m active on Instagram because I’ve seen her stories and she’s seen mine. Recently she posted a very coupley photo with her boyfriend along with a story of them doing things together. I deleted the app from my phone after seeing that.

Girls, I just don’t understand. Why rub your relationship in my face while I was doing so well at getting over everything? Why kick me when I’m already down? Why do some of you try to emotionally torture well-meaning guys like this? Was I really so wrong for wanting a relationship with L when I was certain our attraction was mutual, then pulling away when I found she was taken? Do I *really* deserve that? I’m sick of the games. I just want someone who will love me mutually - a girl to have fun with, cherish, learn, and grow with. 

Please don’t get me wrong. I am not, and never will  be, a r/niceguys guy whose victim card is his only card - who believes girls “owe” him a relationship just because he was nice to them once. It’s L’s absolute right and choice to have a boyfriend already. That is the very reason why I was so bent on distancing myself from her when I found out she was in a relationship - so I could never interfere with what she had going on. And if you think that I am, you can tell me that. I’m open to criticism. I just want to be better. 

I’m hurt. I definitely won’t be on Instagram for a while - it will be better for my mental health in general in the long run. I guess I’m just looking for answers. If I don’t get one, that’s fine, I appreciate you reading this anyway. 

TL;DR  Why do some girls feel the need to rub their relationships in the faces of guys who they know like them?

3,"Edgy/over-relatable title but whatever. Here's the meat of it. There's two concepts of identity. Either you make your own and nobody should have an influence on who you truly are, or that's a Disney-fed identity crisis and of course other people can define you. If you haven't guessed I tend to drift toward the latter class. We wouldn't accept anything else in this world as valid if it wasn't a composition of varying similar observations so why should character or identity be any different? For the most part what I really believe is that your identity is some part core principles and some part a composite of the views others have on you independant of your observation. Seen as how I cant always compile data on how people view me absent my awareness of them that ends up being mostly speculation. So r/advice, how am I supposed to do this? How am I supposed to figure out what I am in the world? Does it even matter or is it all a childish question?",24Jul2018,0

5,"Hello everyone!

So, I will just give a bit of context before starting the actual story

Me, her, and another boy (31M) are all in something that is kind of a summer camp. We're taking care of children and live with each other almost every minute, except when we sleep. I've met the girl twice before going to the camp and it was purely for work.

This girl got really close to me the last few days, but in a weird way.

It started with hugs, her jumping on my back, but then I got weird when we had to took kids at the pool?

She started to scratch on my skin with her pointy nails, then she would thrust these nails inside my skin, then she bite my ear?

Then, the days following that, my ear got bitten again (twice), she would sit on me whenever I was chilling, then it got weirder. She slapped me (not super hard, but still), tried to choke me (by going on my back first), and then she bite my arms REALLY hard this night (3 times).

She's a cool girl, but it's kinda creepy. It doesn't help that she says lots of things that makes me feel like we can't do anything together (you're a baby - because of my age -, I'd like to be with this person - who's super different from me -, etc..)

I'm more concerned about all of that biting and everything related to it. What could it mean?

Thanks.",24Jul2018,1
6,"Ok so basically back in April I agreed to let my sister and her family stay in my basement. It was a shit show start to finish and I asked them to move out July 1. 

They moved in with other family and got kicked back out. Had no where to go with their kids so I told them they could crash here for a few days. That was last Thursday. 

They’re in the process of trying to buy a house, closing date is end of August. I think she wants to try and stay until then but won’t ask me. My daughter is having surgery next week and I want them out before then. 

How can I break this to them? I don’t even know how to bring it up. I’ve had multiple panic attacks over this ordeal. They’re loud, messy, and I already booted them out once. I already know my mistake was even letting them come back in the first place but that ship has sailed and now I have to deal with what I’ve got in front of me. ",24Jul2018,1

12,"I am a 13 year old, and a few months ago my dad got very drunk and revealed to me that he was not in fact my biological father. 

It was the middle of the night and I was trying to sleep through the sound of my mom screaming at my dad for her to leave him alone. I asked for them to quiet down or take it somewhere else, even bringing up that my 18 month old sister was trying to sleep. My dad's anger turned to me, and I got screamed at. after a few minutes of shouting incoherent bullshit he started taking about how my mom was a cheater and told me about how I was a bastard accident who wasn't even his son. The next morning my mom confirmed this, and my parents got into another (Albeit calmer) argument.

 For the next month I really struggled, and I was hardly able to even participate in my genetics lesson in science. I spent a week of summer with my Grandmother on my Dad's side, and I felt like shit around her in fear she didn't love me because I wasn't her grandson. Now I'm with my Mom's parents for the rest of the summer, and she talks about my parents like they're living garbage. 

All of this is even worse because my mom is not in a good mental place and I'm worried my parent's will lose custody of me and my siblings, and we'll have to move to a small town in California with my grandparents or enter foster care. There's also the issue of me being openly transgender with my family and I'm growing increasingly worried that my parents and grandparents on my dad's side don't love me nearly as much as they love my little brother and sister.

14,"Title. I only have 2 close friends and it feels like only 1 out of the 2 actually enjoy my company. The other doesn't reply to my messages ever, doesn't even read em. He's always just silent around me unless we're smoking, that's the only time he gets sociable. Any other time he just puts on music and we just sit without saying a word to each other. It's maddeningly boring sometimes. I need friends, good friends. Friends who reciprocate care and respect. Friends who wanna go on adventures with me and explore the world rather than just sit inside, smoke, listen to tunes, and sleep. I just want a friendship that doesn't feel one sided.

Any advice on going about this? I know many of you will say ""just go out and say hello!"" But does that actually work? I mean back in the day sure, communities were a lot more tight back then. But nowadays, I feel like if I just approach someone and say ""Hey, you seem cool"" they'd get weirded out or it'd just end in small talk. Maybe it's because of my social anxiety, but I feel like the approach method wouldn't work idk. My fear of rejection is mainly what holds me back I think.

Also, do y'all know if there's like an app or website for making friends and meeting up? Like a platonic tinder if you will. It might help with the initial awkwardness of meeting a new person and stuff. Thanks :)",24Jul2018,0

19,"So, I work very hard so that I can have free time. I work then come home and clean, so that I can have some relaxation time before dinner. When I actually am able to get free time, I would like to, but never do anything fun, productive, captivating, or mentally stimulating. 

When I was younger I loved the satisfaction of playing videogames, the sense of ""completing missions"" felt like I was making some sort of progress in life. Now I feel that if I am playing videogames and it's not competitivly and/or professionaly it's not worth my free time. I still do love mentally stimulating things like playing the guitar and hanging out with the wife, but sadly, there are times where she has to study,  I can't be loud.

When i do get some free time I normally just sit around anxiously worry about how all the work I did was for nothing because now that I have free time I am doing nothing. Recently most of the free time I get is actively spend trying to find something to fill my free time with, actually that is what I am doing now!

She then asked me where her Taipei money was because apparently it wasn't in there and I told her that I didn't take any money.  I then asked her where she ""found"" my money and she avoided the question by saying that she already took it and put it in her wallet.  I said, that's not what I meant, where did you ""find"" the money and she didn't answer and changed her story to say that I still had Taipei and more Hong Kong money even though she hadn't mentioned it before.

25,"As context: I currently still live with both my mother &amp; father (71) except I am planning to move out mid-august. I have been out to my father since my senior year of high school (~3 yrs ago) and he's especially acknowledging of how I feel about my mom and my girlfriend whom I love to death. My mom is a traditional Taiwanese-immigrant who has practically built her family here alongside my father... My dad has always been my favorite and my mom knows this, so she gets her chance to scold me whenever she can. However, she's been brought up with a long list of issues-- growing up poor, alcoholic father, abusive mother, gambling addiction, absolute cut off from my older sister, (my dad &amp; I's) self diagnoses BPD, that she all very much projects onto me and guilts me into being submissive to her in whatever way she can. I don't know how to explain most of what she's said, but it would often be categorized into something of ""Tiger mom"" rhetoric that I often felt uncomfortable bringing it up with most friends who didn't understand, because all of it just sounds like harsh/controlling parenting, but the truth is that everything she says is so manipulative and I feel like I can never talk around her. I've been pretty much conditioned to be silent/talk at the level of a loud whisper, despite being pretty outgoing and outspoken with friends.

I have been diagnosed with clinical moderate depression since I was 16 and recently have developed (probable) clinical anxiety since last yr, especially after when my mom found my current gf (we've been dating for 3 yrs) and I sleeping together in the same bed (and she went crazy on me, told me all of my friends are bad friends, my job isn't to have friends but to work &amp; find a bf, etc etc). In that context, I've also never had my own room (shared it from age 6+) with my mom who used to come in to either check and see that I'm 1) in my room, 2) actually sleeping, or 3) is in their all day until she leaves ~6pm till anywhere from 12am-5pm the next day to gamble. That being said, I always have made it a priority of mine to be home as least as possible but every time I have to run into her, I get accumulated anxiety of the days I've gone without seeing her. 

Anyways, the thought of me moving out and her losing control over me would absolutely drive her nuts... But the idea of freedom and the idea of peace &amp; a place I can actually come home to vs. sleeping in my car everyday till my mom is out to me is just something I feel like I really need. My whole world revolves around her schedule and being scared of her. Ironically, I also know she is mentally unwell and probably extremely scared by her past and how her experience with my sister may have projected onto me, which leaves me so torn.

My best friend found a dog through a shelter who she fell in love with. It’s an 11 year old dog who has lost most of his teeth, so not the most desirable for most people. Her and her boyfriend sent in an application for this dog but got rejected because when they called the landlord he said absolutely no dogs. Almost everyone in the building has a dog, so they assumed it was allowed. They don’t want to call those people out on their dogs in case the landlord isn’t aware and evicts them. 

My friend is moving soon to a pet-friendly apartment, but she is worried that this particular dog won’t be available anymore by then. (And even if it is - the sooner it goes to a good home, the better, I think.) 

Here comes the part where I need advice:

Would I, realistically, be able to get the dog for her? I would say it’s for me and fill out the application in my name. I live in a place where dogs are allowed, so that wouldn’t be an issue. I’m certain I’ll get approved. However, my concern would be with any follow ups or vet issues etc. This is a senior dog, so he will need to go to the vet sooner or later. If the adoption papers are under my name, would it be an issue if she is the one taking them to the vet? 

Any advice on this would be very appreciated!

Then my mother texted me and said she didnt tell me sooner because she was ""afraid to say the wrong thing."" I unleashed 23 years of anger on my mother after telling her I wish her the best. I said things I've never said before. I even told her a about a repressed memory I remembered about my brother doing inappropriate things as a child and my mom saying it was normal. Basically this led to my brother calling me a psycho for making things up for attention. I blocked my mother so she can never contact me again (she barely talked to me as it is), and my sister who I am very close with also refuses to speak to me. I'm having a hard time with this, having three panic attacks in three days. I just need advice about what I should do and if I was right. My options are basically suffering through family events while my mother and brother tell my family how awful I am or trying to reconcile with my sister and always being seen as a liar in her eyes.

30,Or is being honest about your emotional insecurity bad because you are investing your emotions too much into something that you should rather ignore?,24Jul2018,2
31,"So, me and my best friend had been friends for many years now. We first met in middle school and we always made each other happy. We battled through middle school, made many fun memories, have had some fights that we regret. But at this point, our friendship is just so miserable and depressing. Nothing is the same anymore. The light is long gone. All she does now is complain about her problems and I listen, everyday, every hour, every second. I’m getting tired of it. I try to help her and make her laugh so she can forget but it’s like she doesn’t even notice it at all. I try my best to be happy for her and make her happy but nothing works (and I’m really bad at difficult feelings. I don’t know how to handle it what so ever). And yes, she does have anger problems. And I do as much research as I can do so I can help her but none will work. Whenever we talk about her anger problems all he says is “I can’t control it. You will never ever get what I feel. Just stop helping because you’d never suffered in a day in your life”. And I took that in a very bad way. It’s like she never listened to me because she knows I have bad anxiety, and I had many anxiety attacks at school before. So, I regretfully replied with something that probably made her more angry. I want help on this, really bad. I want the pass back, I want the smiles we used to share together, but I tried my best with all of my best ability. ",24Jul2018,1

33,"Hi fellow redditors,

I work as a sales operations manager for a pretty large financial service firm. Two months ago, my boss decided to promote me for an entirely new role that would be built out just for me. The role was announced to our entire management staff approximately 3 weeks ago. This was all announced before I learned any of the details of the new role, discussed pay, and accepted the offer. For the past 3 weeks I've been walking around getting congratulated on a position I know nothing about. Today, I reviewed the new contract for the role and saw an offer that was just a 2% increase from my current salary. I was shocked and couldn't say much other than that this was not what I expected and not enough for me to accept the position. I would be taking a minimum of an additional 5-10 hours of work a week, and run the risk of jumping into a new position that has no real set metrics to measure success. My boss knew that the number would upset me and even admitted that it wasn't the number they wanted for me, but it was a number set by the company president and HR. I find this all hard to believe, and even if that is the case, I know managers in lower positions making more than I would be with this promotion. I was promised more money, and while they didn't technically lie, I feel like I've been lied to.

Any advice on how I should proceed? My boss will be coming back to me tomorrow with new numbers. I want to be able to do the same. I finished the year last year with the highest KPIs to goal for the company and have stats on what I've brought to the table this far. 

Sorry for the large blocks of text. I'm typing this up as I ride a crowded NYC train. Thanks in advance for all the advice!",24Jul2018,2

35,"Well the situation, at least to me, is a bit more involved than the title may suggest. So, first off, the person this post centers around is probably the only person I’ve ever really felt a true romantic connection to, so that complicates things right off the bat. I tried a few years ago to start a relationship with them, but they weren’t interested, no hard feelings, we’re still friends, it’s all good. 

Anyways, we met up at a mutual friend’s party this summer after about a year of not talking and we start having conversations, they’ve really come into their own since we last talked and are somehow even more attractive and it’s nice and all and they tell me to text them. They end up texting me later that night, which leads to more texting and eventually we end up hanging out really casually for a little a few days later. Also a few days later, they leave on a trip on the other side of the country.

So we continue to text, I send a traveling music  playlist I created for them, they send a playlist back. Things are looking up even though they’re about to leave to go across the country. We continue to keep in contact either through FaceTime, phone calls, or texts, they send pictures and whatnot, it’s all good. Then they don’t respond and I wait it out a few days because, hey, they need their space and they’re out exploring and doing their thing and I don’t want to impose and bog them down.

But they never responded and I never sent anything because I just figured they probably aren’t interested in me the way I am in them, I think most people can feel this out. However, there’s still this voice in the back of mind saying “What if?” So they should be returning back home pretty soon and I’m not sure if i should reach out even after a couple weeks of not contacting each other at all.

My life has been the shittiest it’s been in awhile, and the anxiety of whether or not they actually *want* me to text them or whatever has been contributing to the overall shittiness. It’s just another problem, even if small, that I keep bottled up and a combination of large and small problems just sitting in my head are weighing me down, but that’s really another a conversation for another time. So I at least am attempting to solve this one.

Honestly, I’m probably overthinking a lot of this but this person means a lot to me and I just want things to be right and not miss a chance at anything, even if that chance probably doesn’t exist.",24Jul2018,1

49,"So my girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me. It happens, but there's something about it that really bothers me.  


Let's start from where things took a hard turn. We were a good 3 something years in when she told me she was sexually assaulted by a coworker. I don't mean the ""passing sexual remarks"" kind, I mean the ""got me drunk and forced me"" kind. After that, I backed off and gave her space to heal. From that point, we got farther and farther away from each other emotionally, I stopped sleeping in our bed with her, and our conversations got shorter and shorter until it felt like she was pretty much avoiding me.   


Cut to about 6 months later. I tried to make a move or two, but always got shot down (and immediately backed off, thinking she just wasn't ready). I made some nice dinners and we did a few nights on the town, but she just seemed to be going along with it instead of enjoying herself.

I have paid for his healthcare for the past 2 years and have been documenting all time I've had with him. It amounts to almost 3 weeks overnight and over 30 times picking him up from daycare or school. 

I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis 6 months after our son's birth, have struggled with it for some time but have gotten it to a good place. 

She has since become remarried as of March this year. Her new husband has job interviews in N.Y., VA, and NC and she told me she's taking our son with her.

Hello. To put it simply, I feel like Lady Bird. I am a teenage girl in high school, and I feel a bit disconnected and lost. I used to have a good relationship with my mom (I don’t see my dad), but every time I try to talk to her, it seems like she doesn’t really understand... I don’t know that sounds a bit angsty, but I just feel like when I bring up something that is troubling me, she doesn’t see eye to eye and can’t really help me fix it. Like Lady Bird, I worry about money and how good my house is and how I will pay for college, and I can’t tell my mom that because she will feel very offended and sad, and I understand that. I feel disconnected in the sense that I feel like I have no one to talk to. Sure I have acquaintances where I can muster small talk, but I don’t have someone close to me where I can talk about how I feel, almost like a therapist. Lady Bird has a best friend, and I do too, but I can’t talk to her about these types of things because she can’t really help me find a solution. Ugh I sound very pathetic. In all, I just can’t seem to find someone to talk to. I had a strange relationship with a guy, who I thought I trusted, but in the end, he like, brought down my self worth? I don’t know, just the thought of loving someone else in a healthy relationship doesn’t appeal to me anymore. As a girl, I dreamt of meeting the perfect guy, right? But now I can’t seem to have crushes or anything like that. I’m not gay lol, but I once heard that you have to love yourself before you love anyone else and I think that has something to do with my situation. I’m not self conscious with looks or anything, despite what this might infer, I just wish I had more opportunities I guess. I am very worrisome of who I am to others I feel like, and I may sound ungrateful but I just think I don’t really know how to appreciate what I have. I don’t know I am very lost and I want to make good friends, and I do this by being myself, but I am confused as to who I want to be and how to apply my traits. For example, I joined pom and cheer, and if anything it is sort of depleting my self confidence in the sense that I see girls that are very good at dancing and tumbling because they have been doing this stuff for many years, but I never had that opportunity because we were never really that fortunate. Jeez I sound so ungrateful and bratty. I go through lapses of depression where I just become so sad because I feel like I am locked up and unable to do things that others can do. I don’t really have motivation. I compare myself to others too much, where as I think if I had “this” then I’d be mentally stable -type. I don’t know what to do and sorry if I sound very jumbled I just am very disoriented. I’m sorry I hope someone can help me and I heard the first step to recovery is admitting, so that is what I am trying to do. Thanks I’m sorry",24Jul2018,2

My last boyfriend was the first person in a long time who I let my guard down with, I was probably more vulnerable with him than I've been with anyone, so for him to reject me feels very personal. He started being emotionally abusive during arguments and dumped me when I spoke-up about this, it was more about his issues than me but that he ended it so easily still feels like I wasn't valued. I'm sure he hates me now as he'd rather blame me than take responsibility for his behavior, which hurts as I want him to remember how good we were and to value me: remember I understood and accepted him, that I made him feel loved and wanted. I guess it's normal I want him to miss me and realize his mistake. 

I'm also worry about what he could be saying to other people about me - his family was excited about us and we broke-up just after visiting his sister for the first time, we have mutual acquaintances who were pretty invested in us but he's closer to them than they are to me so they'd likely get his side of the story but not mine. He's likely telling them I falsely accused him of emotional abuse, caused drama, or/and that I personally attacked him (none of which is true).

61,"**TL;DR - Was looking to nix the distance in an LDR by moving to his city (NYC) after graduation, we broke up before I even landed a job but remain on good terms, I'm still job hunting and still looking at jobs in that city, which I know the idea of me being there now makes him uncomfortable, but there are a number of jobs I’m really interested in located there. Trying to make sure if I moved there, it would be for the right reasons and not because I’m deluding myself.**

\[25F\] I was dating a guy \[25M\] during my last year of grad school who lived in NYC. I was planning to find work there after graduation so we wouldn’t have to do an LDR (I graduated this past May). His job really only exists in NYC, but my field is much more flexible. This was something we discussed together and both thought was for the best, but I had never really considered working/living in a city before our relationship. Before, I just figured I would live close to family, who are all in the middle of the EST time zone (trying not to give out too many place details). I have a young niece and was excited to be close to her since I wasn’t able to be around much while finishing grad school. But then this relationship came along, and I know how boy crazy this sounds on paper, but we had a lot of talks and both felt it was better to nix the distance than do an LDR just to not seem ""crazy"" by societal standards. We weren’t going to live together, just in the same city, and our families and friends were all on board. (We met at our friends’ wedding so the relationship started LDR.)

  
About a month and a half after graduating I hadn’t landed a job yet, and for mostly unrelated reasons we ended up splitting. Pretty amicable and we consider ourselves to be friends now. But because of the split, I essentially started my job search from scratch. I reset to thinking that I would look for work close to home, but as it turns out most of the jobs I’m actually interested in (and currently qualified for) exist primarily in larger cities in the northeast, and the jobs close to family are more mid-career level.

  
So as of now, I’m looking at jobs in the major NE cities as well as close to home, but I’m kind of hoping that I’ll find something in a city. Like I said, I never considered a city before the relationship, but it opened my eyes and made me confident that it’s something I could take on. I think one of three things will happen:  


1. I move to a city, like it, and stay indefinitely.
2. I move to a city, like it, but decide I would rather be closer to family.
3. I move to a city, don’t like, and move closer to family. 

Sometimes I trap myself in a ""I’ve thought something or said it out loud to someone so now I have to do it"" mindset, so I’m trying to be cautious that I’m not looking at cities now just because I was looking at cities before. I think this is more of a ""I want to see if I can do it"" sort of thing, and as an anxious person afraid of anything unknown there is definitely a scary aspect to all of this, but it’s exciting too. I’ve spent time in NYC/D.C./Boston and love them all, and assume I’d probably get along just as fine in other possible cities as well.

  
Currently, the job I want most and sounds like it was created for me is in NYC, and there’s a possibility to transfer to a mid-career level position closer to family later on with the same company. I know my ex isn’t thrilled about the idea of me moving to NYC. I got an interview offer a couple of weeks ago for a job I applied to before our breakup, and when I told him he had a freak out about it that I couldn’t end things and then still move to his city, but came back later and apologized and said I could do whatever I want and he would ""just deal."" He’s always accepting the responsibility for other people’s emotions, and I don’t want to put undue burden on him.

  
I totally understand where he’s coming from not wanting me in his vicinity, but it’s a huge city and what are the odds we would ever run into each other, right? I’ve decided I won’t tell him if I get any other interview offers, but I’m not sure what or if I would say if an actual job offer came in. I wouldn’t expect us to be close pals, honestly I’m not even expecting us to ever hang out at all. BUT, all of my mental images of NYC are memories that include him, so it’s hard for me to totally separate him from the idea of living there. I really enjoy him as a person, but our life goals are so different that we’ve already had to put ever getting back together totally off the table. We had to have that conversation to remove that option, because it was too difficult to be friends with the possibility lingering, however the breakup is recent enough that I still find my mind wandering to ""what-if,"" but I’m doing some serious mental work to squash those thoughts.

  
**General questions, but feel free to comment/give advice on whatever you think appropriate:** 

* **Am I out of bounds looking at jobs in NYC?**
* **Are there other perspectives I should be considering or questions I should be asking myself that I haven’t thought of yet?**
* **More generally, has anyone experienced something similar, either being the one looking to move or the one who already lives in the place? What did you learn from that situation?**

To my best recollection, it all initially started sometime around March/early April of this year, myself and my cousin would be coming home from boxing training when her reacquainted high-school best friend would offer to take us home so they (my cousin and her) could go out for a drive afterwards to have a catch-up/girly talk/whatever... the girl in question (referred to beyond this point as ""**B**"") was more or less a complete stranger to me, only very briefly having heard of her in passing conversations between myself and my cousin.

During the journey home, myself and **B** would exchange small talk or silly jokes, nothing overly serious or of real substance. 

Fast-forward perhaps a month (late April), myself and my cousin were taking part in our first amateur boxing fights, which **B** as well as some of our more mutual friends attended.  After my fight, naturally, I joined my friends in the crowd, only to find **B** amongst them. We hugged and she wished me well, again, nothing overly of substance.

For some reason, my interest is somewhat raised at this point, despite the fact we had only met on several occasions and for relatively short amounts of time.

I later decided to approach my cousin regarding the ""topic"" of **B**, I was told that she was *single* but recently out of what I believe was a loving two-year relationship. I'll spare details, but towards the end, apparently things were very turbulent and rather dramatic.

I'm unsure about the passage of time, but very shortly after (perhaps the next weekend), I was invited by my cousin and **B** to join them on a day out. Naturally, I went and it was a great time. However, during the day out, she kept referring to some tinder date/hook-up she was attending afterwards. Obviously, this raised questions, but I remained silent because it was none of my business, right?

*Between this stage and the next ""significant"" event below, we've established a group chat. I most definitely took this as a sign of interest, but I didn't read too much into it.*

Anyway, fast-forward again, perhaps a week or two. We've organised a night out. Myself, my cousin and **B**, we meet for drinks before the night itself and it's great. The banter is great, I feel like I'm really getting to know this girl and I'm genuinely enjoying her company. During this time, we (myself and **B**) quite vividly discussed our ""types"", sexual preferences etc... which was certainly new territory between myself and her, very much in a flirty kind of way. We leave for town and there's somewhat of a spark, but nothing happens, mostly because I didn't want to instigate something, only to have misread the situation. A very good night all in all.

*At this point, it may be worth noting that* **B** *is new to the whole partying/clubbing scene, due to her previous relationship. Again, no specifics, but this is important for later.*

Next is my cousins award ceremony. Myself and **B** have been invited to support her, but mostly for the inevitable night out afterwards. We had been drinking before the ceremony and **B** was noticeably more drunk than myself and my cousin when arriving at the ceremony.

She naturally gravitated towards me the entire night, often asking me to help with silly things, like guiding her towards the toilets, getting food/drinks with her etc...

For whatever reason, my cousin didn't end up coming on a night out afterwards, but myself, **B** and a mutual friend did. Again, nothing overly noteworthy happened, other than a single drunken kiss on the cheek.

*Between this point and the next significant event, nothing massive or of importance happened, mostly just conversing via whatsapp group chat.*

A week or two later, surprise, a third night out! Again, it was just myself, **B** and the cousin. However, something felt tangibly different this time. Before actually getting into town, we (myself and **B**) were both clearly very drunk, but she was very to the point and ""touchy-feely"" with me, for the lack of a better term.

Upon arriving into town, something just clicked and we didn't leave each other alone the entire night. We left early and ended up sleeping with each other.

The day after, we wholly agreed to not discuss it openly for my cousins sake (being best friends and all) and that it was ""for the lols"", despite us both agreeing it was great. It hasn't made any of our interactions awkward or anything since.

*At this point, it's worth noting we spoke ALOT afterwards. She would often be suggestive and insinuate that things might happen between us again. I was naturally VERY interested, but also cautious given what I had been told and what I would later learn.*

As is the theme, about another week passed. The 3 of us (**B**, myself and cousin) met for a quiet drink after work. We initially met to discuss a rather shocking revelation in my cousin's life, but she didn't feel much like talking, so myself and **B** somewhat took the reins.

It ended up being a 3-hour long face-to-face and heart-to-heart conversation about her past relationship (remember the one I described above? yeah.. I got wayyyyy too much information about it). She clearly wanted my advice, but ended by telling me she basically ""relapsed"" and slept with her ex again. I'm certainly no guru when it comes to these things, but I tried to be impartial with her (despite probably being incredibly biased) but insisted that she deserved better than her ex (and trust me, with context, this is absolutely an understatement).

In the end, she agreed but was visibly distressed at the entire situation. Internally, I was screaming because I knew I was somewhat catching feels for this girl, but I also knew I'd never be able to compete. I was *so* hurt, but I really tried to put on a brave face at this point.

*The previous event happened on the Monday of the given week, the following event would take place on the Friday evening of the same week.*

For the entirety of this week, all I had done was think about the conversation that had transpired on the Monday. What was the correct step beyond this point? This was uncharted territory for me, so I didn't know.

It was Friday evening and for the first time in what felt like forever, we had no plans for the weekend. I recall it being around about 11ish at night when I got a text from my cousin saying something along the lines of ""**B** is around having drinks, you should come too. We're just sitting and talking, not going out"". I agreed.

I arrived shortly after, both had been drinking for at least an hour by this point. The atmosphere in the room was different than normal, it just wasn't as comfortable and free-flowing as I had previously experienced.

I sit next to **B** and we talk, just as usual. She's openly reasonably flirtatious, great! But every so often, she would turn and almost secretly be tapping away at her phone screen. In her drunkenness, she had accidentally flashed the screen, which I caught a glimpse of whilst talking to her. As I very much suspected, she was texting her ex. I had to bite my tongue, but as stated above, I *really* was beginning to like this girl, but in the back of my mind I always had some kind of suspicious or reasonable doubt that this would happen.

But what made the entire situation so unbearable was that when my cousin left the room to refill one of our drinks, she would be suggestive and ""as normal"" but changed somewhat when my cousin re-entered the room.

I ended up changing seats, to distance myself from the situation in a kind of way, but I made the crucial mistake of letting my drunken self take control. I openly expressed how silly I thought she was for allowing herself to be absorbed by her ex again, that she would run into the same issues as before, but I still never revealed how I actually felt about **her**.

In the end, I removed myself entirely out of the situation because I was visibly very angry, but more so upset. Despite the fact I'd never be abusive, verbally or physically, I really didn't trust myself to not ignite the situation further. Does this make me a good friend? A control freak? I really don't know, honestly...

We didn't speak for about 5 days after this. She finally messaged me and we have made up, we've since been for a drink (as a friendship group) and the dust certainly seems to have settled. In hindsight, I feel like I knew too much and maybe the way I acted was immature, sure. But I also acted in what I very much felt at the time was her best interest; being straight to the point and honest.

I've discussed the night at length with my cousin and to quote what she said ""you have to allow her to make her own mistakes, it's the only way she is going to learn"". Obviously, I agree entirely with this sentiment, but I really do wish there was another way that (selfishly) suited me.

**So, now with the all of the necessary information out of the way, to my dilemma:**

Where do I go from here? I still very much like the girl, I really do. Do I grit my teeth and accept that I'll just be an ""option"", never first choice? Or do I play all of my cards and ask where her head is at regarding the entire situation?

Conversation certainly hasn't been as common between us, perhaps this is due to not knowing entirely where we both stand on the whole situation?

Most of this is probably conjecture and from the echo chamber that is my mind, but seriously, I'm ready to be done with this chapter of my life because yes, it's confusing, but also because it sucks not being in control of the outcome.

I'm sorry if the post was long, ramble-y or needlessly detailed. Sometimes, I like to think I'm reasonably eloquent, but maybe I'm not.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Here's to a hopefully ideal outcome! ",24Jul2018,1
63,"English is not my first language, but I'll do my best. 

So, last friday I was with this girl in school. Tbh I never considered myself a close friend of her, but I wanted to talk a bit with her. I was lying on the floor, she was next to me seated on the floor too. She put her glasses in my belly, I didn't feel anything, she neither told me anything. So, I seated too, glasses felt on the ground and apparently such a small fall made them to (a line in middle of the lense? It's not a crack line, is just like an scratch). She was a little mad at the moment but just said it was ok, it was an accident. The next day she texted me saying she told her father what happened and want me to pay half the price for fixing them. She knew it was an accident, she didn't even tell in that moment she put her glasses on me, so I said I wasn't going to help. Today, she was weird in the morning at school, I didn't mind until I heard she was saying to everyone (my prom decided to take a trip to a beach in my country as an activity for last year) that It was my fault she won't go to that trip because her parents made her decide between the glasses and the trip, and she said the glasses. She is well known is school for lying, manipulate people, I have mixed feelings towards her. She texted me again a few minutes saying, again, that her father told me something about paying them. I haven't opened the message.

She's always been older for her age and Todd is pretty damn immature. It's fucking weird. She's always been into older men as far as I know and has never expressed interested in someone so young. I genuinely do not understand what's going on here and how to approach it. I tried to tell her that maybe she should just wait to talk to him when he's at least 16 but she doesn't want to.

66,"I have a lake house in another state. The lawn got out of control. I was going to hire someone to do it, but out of sight out of mind. Her husband did it and she sent pictures. I told her to thank him for me as I didn’t ask him to do it. Then she asked if I had their address to send a check. Now I’ve tried to sell this house in the past, but they meet the potential buyers and bad mouth it. They tell lies to chase them away. They offered a ridiculously low amount to purchase it in the past. They’d like to level it for parking. I’m in a tight spot in that I appreciate the act, but I would never do something before working out details ahead of time. I’m annoyed that I feel stuck having to be nice to them when they have been so hateful in the past. I’m worried they will turn this into something nasty. They make me so very uneasy.

67,"I want to get this out of the way: I'm an advocate for legalizing recreational use of marijuana, and this post isn't meant to bash marijuana users. This is strictly an interpersonal problem between me and my friends that I need advice resolving.

Now, I used to smoke weed a few years back, but never really liked it. About a year ago, the last time I smoked, I felt really terrible/paranoid and had been feeling that way each time I smoked. So, I decided that weed wasn't for me and stopped smoking all-together. 

But of my core group of friends, 5 of them (group of about 7 depending on who you ask) really enjoy marijuana and use it almost every day. (If it matters, we're all in college). The issue I have is not their physical well-being and the detriment that weed is bringing into their lives alone, but the ""void"" it is creating between them, and myself and other two friends who don't smoke.

For example, almost every time I suggest we hang out, get some dinner, play some video games or something like that, they'll either A) Not respond, B) Hang out for a very short time and then leave to smoke, or C) Hang out with me but use my house to invite their friends over to smoke.

The issue which set me off most and drove me to post this was C). On more than one occasion, I'd invite my friends over when my parents were gone so we could hang out and drink. I'm not against them wanting to smoke a bit if we're all drinking, but my problem is that they will invite *other people who I didn't invite into my home* to smoke with them, and then crash at my house while paying little to no attention to me. For example, one night I invited 3 of them over, next thing I know there were about 4 extra dudes in my house, smoking in my driveway, winding up on my couch using my TV, while practically ignoring me completely.

I'm just not really sure how to confront them about this. Every time someone mentions anything negative about smoking weed, they get very defensive. I need some advice on how to handle this situation because the fact that their daily plans almost exclusively revolve around smoking weed makes me feel more and more distant from them as the days go by.",24Jul2018,2

71,"TL;DR at the bottom.

On Monday (Jul 16th) I texted a girl that I know and we had a conversation. I had known her for a while because we went to the same extracurricular activity but then we both left it and fell out of contact a bit. I would still see her, once in a few months or so, but on Monday I texted her and had a nice conversation for about an hour, until she went to bed. It was really a nice conversation, we both seemed pretty happy talking to each other.

The next day (Jul 17th), I ask her out on a date. This is how the conversation went (I copied the messages directly because I think this part is important): 

ME: I really wish I had done this in person but.. Would you like to go out for coffee or something with me sometime?

HER: I would actually love too, although I am actually seeing someone right now, so I don't know if this is what you meant or not, but it would be as friends. Type thing
HER: That's Ok right?

ME: Yeah, that's definitely ok :) Although tbh yeah that was what I meant, a friends type thing would still be great I think 😀

I don't really mind, honestly I'm at a point right now where I'm just thrilled to be friendzoned (no sarcasm). Point is, she clearly doesn't mind me. We talk for 2 hours until 2 am then she goes to bed. I feel like this is important because even though I asked her out, it's clear she isn't repelled or anything.  All is well. 

On Wednesday, I send her another message, kinda just continuing the conversation (it was an old video that I found of her and some other people, and I wrote ""found this"" that's all). She replies, a few minutes later I send her another photo with the message ""omg remember when we saw [thing that we saw]"". 

She hasn't replied since. For a few days when I would check my dms (this was on Instagram btw) it would constantly say ""Active 32min ago"" or ""Active 2h ago"", but she hasn't replied to my message. Today she read my message and left me on read.

 Here's what I know: 

- She's dating someone so she probably prioritizes talking to him over me
- She's doing summer school, which can be brutal so she might be focusing on that until it ends. However, last week she made time to talk with me after doing her summer school work, and she's definitely on Instagram so I really don't know why she's not replying. Maybe cause the work closer to the end of the course gets harder, but still.

Anyway, I'd really appreciate any advice on why this is and/or what I should do. Thanks!

TL;DR: Texted girl on Instagram last Monday, had nice conversation. Next day I ask her out, get friendzoned, am ok with it, we still chat for 2 hrs afterwards. Next day, I continue conversation, she does not reply. Hasn't replied since but definitely is on Instagram. Why/what do?

73,"Hi.

Throwaway, for obvious reasons.

I was in a car accident in June of this year. I was hit from the left by a drunk driver running an intersection and my car was thrown off a cliff. Long story short  I was very, very lucky to walk away with nothing but a broken wrist, a minor concussion, a few lacerations... Aswell as a branch that went straight through my neck. In one end, out the other. Right to left.

I was very lucky that the branch didn't hit any super important bones, vessels or nerves. Like really lucky. What it did do though was rupture my larynx and vocal cords. There was a lot of blood and after a couple hours in the hospital and a bit of panic related to my breathing, I was stable.

(Sorry if my srmtory is a little all over the place. I'm a bad story teller and a little emotional. Haha.)

So... After a few weeks of focusing on recovery... And everyone telling me I'll be able to return to university in a few weeks, I've starting adjusting to the fact that I may never speak again. The doctor was honest about my chances at a vocal cord/larynx transplant... And how they are experimental and most likely to be a disappointing road for me.

I am a 26 year male, in my final year of nursing, a job that relies heavily on my ability to communicate. My fiance is so unbelievably supportaive, and while she is very upset about my disability, has ensured her feelings have and will never change for me. (I'm almost convinced she'll enjoy a silent husband. Haha.).

Anyway. Sorry. My purpose for this post is... I don't really know what I can do with my life now...

What am I suppose to do if I can't speak? I sure as hell can't nurse... Even though everyone assures me I can... And that I should finish my degree.

I will finish my degree. I have 3 papers to go... Why would I not? But then, what next?

What do people do with this type of disability?
Is there a better suited community I could speak to about this?
I have an appointment with a post-trauma psychologist next week... But I'm not upset about what happened... I'm almost more excited for life. I could have died... But I just don't know what to do?

Sorry for the rambling...

If anyone can help, I would appreciate it.

Thank you..",24Jul2018,12

76,"**tl;dr**: I have a rare genetic disorder that makes me attract flies and mosquitos like crazy. I live in an arid desert climate and I have bites at the end of every day, from only being in my car and the grocery store. I'm followed by flies constantly. No one can seem to help me. I need new tactics. 

Sorry for the dramatic title, I'm just in a lot of pain and I can't stand the psychological torture of this any longer. You know mosquitos? They're unpleasant and kind of potentially dangerous, right? You know how flies are annoying? There's something worse than both of those, that many people have probably never met. There are these flies that prey on mammals, mostly livestock. You can tell them from the others because they're silent, and they are impossible to swat. You have to have two people and hit them with a spray bottle from multiple feet away to incapacitate them before you can kill them. I don't live near a barn yard or farming area, but I have bites from them every day, and sometimes they even breed nearby after they get a meal from me and I have to kill 20 of them. They fly directly at you and then crawl around under your clothes and bite at hem lines, leaving massive red welts that itch like crazy for days. 

I also attract some of the normal ones and mosquitos. I live in a very upscale place and if you met me you wouldn't necessarily guess that I have this problem. The stalking flies, bites, and risk of disease haunt me every day. I wake up itching or being bitten. It's almost as though they can see me from a long way off, because they find me and follow me everywhere, no matter what I wear or where I go. There is a medical explanation but I don't feel that it's important here. I've consulted with physicians, farmers, exterminators, and people who produce pesticides. Nothing really works against the bad ones, is what I've been told. I literally have a full body net suit that I wear when I travel in the tropics, but I don't want to have to wear it at home.

But when I look at people like navy seals, pro athletes, serial entrepreneurs, I just feel like a worm. I was severely depressed a couple of years ago, to the point of fantasizing about suicide multiple times per day. I nearly did it a couple of times, but I always backed out and the only thing I could think was how much of a coward I was for doing so. That depression is mostly better though. I have close friends,  but I can't ever confide in them because I'm afraid of pushing them away with all this stupid baggage I'm carrying around. And I'm afraid of being pitied and being weak. I don't deserve pity. Plenty of people don't have it as good as I do. I don't think anyone will ever want to be romantically involved with me either, because of my insecurity. I'm prone to jealousy, even though i know its bad. I constantly second guess myself too. I have a journal I keep to tell these things to but sometimes that's not enough. 

I don't think I'll ever be happy. I have alot. More than most. I come from a wealthy family. I've achieved more than alot of people my age too. But I constantly feel like a failure and a complete waste of space. There are people out there that when I compare myself to them side by side, I am a waste of space. 

How do I be happy?",24Jul2018,5
87,"I met someone and I liked them a lot. Like it always happens, I messed up and my emotions got out of hand. I didn't want to stop, and then I couldn't, even though I knew what was gonna happen, I wanted to cling to hope that I'd just luck out. I looked for this person left and right, up and down, anywhere I could find. I got desperate and started getting hyperaware. I was too scared, too ashamed, too embarrassed of myself. After I slowly snapped out of it, I kept a little hope, but I realized that I would always end up in the same place I started 4 years ago. So I wrote him, and I told him what I had been doing, why and how. 

And I realized that

I don't know what he wants, who he is or anything about his life. 
He just told me to pray and that he would call the police. I deleted his number from my phone. I deleted the messages. Anything that happens next is beyond my hands, I don't have any power, I can't do anything. I just wanted to live a normal life. But I'm gonna have to accept the futility of my actions, and even though I keep making wishes, I'm not worthy of gifts. I don't know what's inside of me or outside of me, and I can only ask for favors.

88,So I had added my crush on snap and followed her on insta like 2 weeks before my sophomore year ended and I have never talked to her before at school. We’ve had small conversations through snap and the other day I asked her if she could follow me back on insta and she did and I think she is starting to acknowledge me. Keep in mind I have never talked to her in real life and I want to ask her to hangout before school starts so the year doesn’t start off awkward. You think I should just randomly ask her if she wants to hangout or is it kinda weird since we’ve never spoken face to face? Im not sure what to do...,24Jul2018,1

90,"So I've known for years that I don't fall into the ""straight"" category. I don't have a particular label for myself, but I believe that sexuality is a spectrum, as well as the emotional spectrum. I generally find the same sex to be more physically appealing, while the opposite sex more appealing emotionally. And to me, love has a lot to do with those 2 halves coming together as a whole in someone else. Doesn't matter to me what gender the person is. Look at the person, the soul, the heart, not just a gender.

I grew up in a conservative, religious household where being gay or any kind definitely wasn't celebrated. I also went to private school. I ended up self-loathing most of my life, trying to deny this part of my identity. The thing is I've never wanted my sexuality to be my main identity. It's just a fraction of who I am.

I'm currently in a heterosexual relationship. And I am in love. This is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. They know about my sexuality. They're cool with it. We plan on getting married within the next few years when we're more stable. 

I just feel like I'm holding back my true self from everyone. It's something I've struggled with so hard over the years - hating myself, wishing it away, when now I love who I am. I want to celebrate who I am. I don't like holding anything back, I like being an open book. Very few people in my life know this about me. Mainly because a lot of my friends are religious. I know most of the general public wouldn't give a damn. It's just the people closest to me.

I really want to ""come out"" before I get married though. I just want to put it out there and move on. I hate feeling like I have a secret. I know I don't owe it to anyone. It's more so something for myself. But you're probably thinking, why would you come out when you're entering a heterosexual marriage? It might not seem logical. It might make people talk shit or start rumors or something. I can see the potential downfalls. But the more I think about it, the more I feel like I have to do it. 

Some people might slap a ""bi"" label on me and the biphobia is real. But just because I'm marrying someone of the opposite sex doesn't magically get rid of my feelings toward the same sex. And that's why I just want to validate it.

93,"TLDR: want to ask her out on a date but can’t figure out why I can’t do it and why I feel it’s not okay.

Hi reddit! This is my situation: I (18) been hooking up with my Best Friend’s (18) Sister (16). The thing is like this. My best friend and I know each other for a long time and I always made jokes about how her sister is super pretty and that I want to be with her, always joking, never meaning it. This year she started saying and encourage me to hook up with her and telling me she has no problem with her sister and I to be together, saying the same to her sister, and I always responded to her that I wouldn’t do it.

So one month ago, we went to a nightclub (where I’m from, with already being 16, you can enter) with my best friend (lets call her AP) her boyfriend (my other best friend (JB), yeah I’m the third wheel haha) and her sister (MP). They drank, I didn’t, and then my best friend took me apart of her sister and told me that she liked me and if I made a move on her she wouldn’t say no, thing that i never believe her. I was like “no I can’t. She’s your sister” and she tried to convince me. Then we all dance and in one moment both of my best friends left and I was alone with my BF’s Sister. And I kissed her, don’t know why but I did. Neither of my best friends saw us. So we kept it cool and pretended nothing happened. When they came back they asked me if something happened and I said “NO” and they replied with the only logical response for a 18 year old couple “you are a PUSSY”.

After the club we went to JB’s house. Him and AP went to JB’s room and MP and I to the guest room of the house. There we hooked up again and talked a lot, about life and stuff, and we slept together (not sex, just cuddle). Then we woke up earlier than JB and AP and pretended again nothing happened.

Then we met all 4 of us together a bunch of times and MP and I never said a thing. Until 2 days a go. We all got together and drank and when MP went to the bathroom, next to the guest room, I grabbed her and kiss her and we went inside the guest room. And we got caught. And we had to tell them that we already did it and they got mad but like really happy at the same time haha. We did the same thing in the guest room as the other time and we went to sleep. Yesterday we all got together again and OF COURSE the subject of the all night was MP and I. We all went to the beach and sat together and talked about stuff. MP and I all the time together, kissing, playing, etc (important cuz MP is known as a serious person an we never saw her been so loving with anyone). And now I’m like “hey I like this, lets not rush things, but I would love to see her again, but just us 2”.

So my thing is this: I want to ask her to a date but, I don’t know why, I can’t do it. Anyone have any idea why is that? I talked to AP and she told me to do it, but I just feel is wrong.

Sorry for the long post.

94,"Hey guys! I seem to find myself here more often than I'd like... it's definitely because I've been out of the game for 7 years up until a few months ago and have no idea what the hell I'm doing so cheers to that!

Anyways,

I've been seeing this guy for a few months and at first, we were just each other's booty call but it ended up becoming more than that. We started seeing each other almost every day, talking all the time, I met his parents (not as a girlfriend), etc. Well he left for Vietnam last month to test the waters in teaching English abroad. I am 100% supportive of this decision and I'm very very happy for him. 

When he left, he gave me the expectation that he was only going to be gone for a month. So in perspective, he should have been coming home within the next week or so. Turns out that he loves it and wants to stay a few more months. When he first told me this, I refused to wait for him and broke things off with him. That turned into a fight and him spewing things such as ""I didn't want this relationship anyways"", ""I don't want what we had"".

Later on he messages me and says he's sorry. I told him I wasn't going to talk to him about that kinda shit over text and I asked him to call me. We actually video called and he apologized so much, told me that he really really liked me, told me that he hooked up with a few girls and that it didn't feel right. He said exactly the words, ""I like you so much, it doesn't feel right with other people but with you it does."" 

I then got caught up in the whole waiting for him thing again and told him if he didn't come back by September, I would be done waiting for him. But he really fought back and said he didn't want to be done and that he likes me a lot, doesn't want to lose me over this and that if I liked him back, I would understand that this is something he needs to do now that he's already there. Which makes sense right? I mean, I do want him to be happy. If this is what is making him happy, then I want him to be there for a few months and keep teaching.

He has expressed that he cares about me a lot, has love for me, wants to pursue a relationship with me when he gets back.... 

I don't really have a specific question, I kind of just want to know what you guys think about this situation.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? I don't know what I'm doing but I know I really like him.",24Jul2018,1
95,So I’m entering sophomore year in a high school I dread but tolerate. I don’t really socialize there so my love life has been pretty desolate lately. My fl changed my whole perspective of life after dropping everything she had to go live in Mexico for a year and I spent my freshmen being depressed and just overall negative energy. But flashback to now I don’t think THAT MUCH like that anymore. I’ll have the occasional intrusive thoughts but for the most parts I can go through the day without something ruining my mood. I also am in this Quinceañera for my friend and she hooked me up with her cute friend. I found this as a way to finally stop being so lonely. But now my ex is coming back and honestly I feel like I still love her. She wasn’t perfect all except when she left and I just don’t know if it’s even worth trying to get back with my ex. Knowing her she’ll try strike something back up with me but I just don’t know if I should take the bait. So new girl or back with ex?,24Jul2018,1

I’m 17, graduating next year. My household is dysfunctional with a mother who care more about her new husband than her children. I don’t get fed properly (or when I do, it’s not healthy), and I work a shitty fast food job where my biggest biweekly check was 500. I live in Washington state. College is expensive and there’s no way I can afford it or grab good scholarships (my grades ranked when my mental health did for a semester, so my G. P. A is really bad). I thought of joining the Air Force for some sort of relief, however I’d need to lose 40 pounds to be proper weight. Gyms are expensive and if I grab a membership, I’d risk gas money and food money. I’d have until June next year to do that. I’m at a point where I don’t want to live anymore because I’m afraid of failing, and life is so expensive and going into debt would make it all worse. This is my last resort.

99,"Certainly, I am called this more often in my online interactions then my real life ones. I don't know if this is because I tend to be sarcastic and that doesn't come across well in written format. I don't know if it's because people are just more willing to be honest to you online. I don't know if I actually just behave differently online than IRL. Probably some combination of all of them. I tend to take things very literally and have failed to completely miss jokes here on reddit on a few occasions that ended up embarrassing me. All that being said, I think where I mostly get into trouble is when there is a topic I feel strongly about and that I feel I've done quite a bit of research into, I tend to call out people I think are spreading misinformation, a pet peeve of mine. Now ultimately, I don't want to make people feel bad or for people to think I'm an asshole. At the same time, I would still like to be able to discuss topics that are important to me in a constructive manner. What I do want is for people to understand how unhealthy the spread of misinformation is and if not change their minds on the topic at least encourage them to research it. I'm sure some of my assumptions and biases about society play into my problems. I'm a skeptic at heart, always have been. I am constantly frustrated with what we've allowed society to become (think George Costanza, ""WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY!"") and I feel like a huge number of people will remain wilfully ignorant just because we don't value critical thinking and exercising your brain is almost looked down upon. So I guess I probably project these feelings about society onto whomever I happen to be debating and that probably leads me to make unfair assumptions about what they'll do. The second big issue I have is once I get deep into a debate I start to get emotionally charged, I want to respond to the person as quickly as possible, it's almost like I feel like it's a race and I really really need to get this person to see things my way before time runs out. In this heightened emotional state I tend to be even more biased, more condescending, and probably just counter-productive to what my ultimate goal is. In the end, many times I'm sure the other person just walks away thinking, ""What an asshole."" And whatever I was trying to convince them of is completely lost, I'm not achieving my goal, it's a lose-lose situation.

109,"   I am a 22 year old man living in the and I will try to put this shortly because I always write too much. My family was middle class until I was about 5 and my dad became severely depressed and lost his job and never found one making more than 15 dollars an hour since then. He was always controlling but since that happened I guess since he couldn't control himself he decided that he needed to have control of something and took that out on my older brother and I. He always made arguments out of nothing and never admitted when he was wrong. My way of dealing with this was by just accepting it most of the time because whenever I did object I was just punished in some way. My brother was more rebellious than I and always got into intense shouting matches with my dad and my mother tried to be a mediating force but kind of had to pick sides sometimes and I usually just went to my room and tried to ignore it. My brother didn't have a way to deal with his emotional problems from these fights either and would just take it out on me. We shared a bedroom until we were about 12 so every night that this happened and other nights too when I was trying to sleep or anything he would just make fun of everything about me and break my possessions and sometimes even physically try to fight me. I never learned a healthy way to deal with these issues and never had anybody to talk to about them so I just used escapism and disassociation to deal with these problems. I just kind of escaped into videogames, books, music and TV shows my whole life and never really grew out of that.

    As a result of all of these issues, I developed a kind of jokester personality at school and never took myself or anything seriously at all. I never developed a real personality or understood who I was because my brother would break me down every single day whenever I admitted to enjoying anything at all. I never was able to try at anything because my subconscious mind decided that if I never tried or cared about anything then it wouldn't hurt as much getting made fun of for things. 

   I breezed through my classes and standardized tests in school as well as being in all of the advanced classes without ever doing homework or studying until about 12th grade when I started to smoke weed frequently. That year I completely gave up school and almost failed classes like ceramics, painting, and AP calculus because I didn't show up and when I did show up I just didn't pay attention at all in class. I had gotten a 32 on my ACT without studying and got a 4 on multiple AP tests but didn't really know what I wanted to do but was taking a pharmacy class and was somewhat intrigued by that so that's what I planned on doing after high school.

  I went to college and was planning to major in biochemistry. I had no money and missed the deadline where you could take it out of your college loans so had 0 textbooks, didn't know anybody there and my roommate was lame as fuck. I slept through my labs in like the 2nd week and autofailed 3 classes. I stopped showing up to my classes and just played videogames and watched TV for the rest of the semester. I had to move back in with my family who were not very supportive and worked to pay off my college debts. After I paid those off I moved into an apartment with a couple of my ""friends."" I used this time to experiment with drugs like acid, shrooms, cocaine, DXM, and some others to help find who I was and understand my place in the universe. When I was on acid it was like everything in the universe finally made sense. I also used my time in that apartment to begin yoga, meditation, cooking, journaling, making music, exercising, reading books again and a lot of other constructive pursuits. I took a loan out for a car and was unable to make payments for it and still owe 5000 dollars in debts that I have to pay. I moved back in with my parents about a year ago after my lease expired because I couldn't afford living on minimum wage. 

  After I moved back in with my parents, they were a lot more supportive about trying to help me but all of my hobbies broke down just by being near them and I fell back into my depressive hole. I started to do nothing but sit in my room and avoid them not even eating again and I can't get out of this hole while I'm with them. I know they are trying to help this time but I just need to get away from them at least until I can take care of myself but I can't afford to do that without a decent job.

  My parents want me to go back to school in 4 months but right now I think the best option is to learn web development and make a career out of that without going to school. I don't know how long it will take to become competent enough to start making money as I just started about a month ago and I think it will probably take a couple of years at least.

  The problem is that I just can't mentally live with these people for 2 more years. I can't eat when I'm near them, I just can't function at all around them. I need to be away from them to be myself but I can't afford to live with anybody else or alone and I don't have anyone who would help me out. I don't know what to do but I'm stuck with them and can't be a person around them. 

 I need to get away from my family but I don't want to get more debts by being at college when I know I can easily learn what I need to to become a web developer just by practicing and learning from books and the internet and they don't want me here for another 2 years and I can't think right when I am around them. If anybody has specific advice for this I would much appreciate it, I have nobody to talk to and I can't find the answer in myself or anywhere else.

In response to this, she screenshotted him asking her out in text messages and posted it on instagram, with a paragraph stating why people should never ask her out, and in the comments someone asked ""is he atleast hot?"" and she said ""no"". I felt it was rude of her to post all of this, and showed my friend to make sure it was actually him. He was extremely surprised, and cut off all efforts of trying to ask her out, and texted her that he just wanted to be friends cause he felt bad for her being alone all the time.

113,"My whole life I have had no direction, basically just floating down the river barely getting by. Throughout high school I was very introverted and had no friends besides the ones from childhood who all went to a different school. 

This past year I completed my first two semesters at university while rooming with my childhood friend. It definitely taught me a lot about who I wanna be along with what I’m passionate about. In this time I’ve rediscovered my passion of reading and writing and will definitely take that with me wherever I end up. 

I began this summer working at a gas station for minimum wage, just trying to save some money for the upcoming school year where I would be moving into my own place for the first time in my life with some friends. About a month ago though some guy came in while I was reading and we started a conversation about the book along with some other things and he said he was gonna give his boss a strong recommendation to hire me at a way higher paying job. I thought nothing of it at the time, I figured it would just come and go like a lot of things do. Soon enough though his company called me in for an interview which I accepted with some skepticism. I was informed that the job was in sales and the pay was purely commission. Like I said before I’m more introverted in nature so the thought of having to sell people things scared me off and I kind of liked being able to read all day at my gas station job.

I participated in the two interviews they gave me and a few days later I got a call that let me know I was hired if I wanted the job. We had discussed the figures that I could be making in the earlier interviews so I accepted. I figured I would take a chance on it, learn some good people skills and if all else fails I could easily find another gas station job where I could read all day. Now after my week of training I was finally beginning to work alone and I did surprisingly well. My first week by myself I got promoted by getting a certain amount of sales, in fact I’m pretty sure Ive gotten promoted faster than anyone else there. During this time the guy who hired me for the job has been my team leader and has also became a good friend. Since I’ve started I’ve been hearing a lot about how him and some of the other office members are starting an office in Texas, all the way across the country. While riding in the car one day I jokingly said “I wish I could go to Texas with you guys” he immediately replied and said “you can, in fact you should” with a serious face. I had never considered it before, but now I’m starting to think it’s a possibility. 

To sum things up I’m just wondering how to figure out what I really wanna do. On the one hand I have my friends at university and finishing up the last three years of college. Alternatively I could go and see what this new opportunity would hold for me in a different state, starting a completely new life away from everyone I know. Before this opportunity I could never see myself working in an office and I kind of still can’t, I had always seen myself going to India and studying meditation, but I do like the job and enjoy working hard as well as seeing the results and the thought of having my own office by this time next year making figures I had only dreamed of definitely excites me. I know that this is ultimately my decision and no one can tell me what the right move is for me, but I would appreciate any life advice that you guys would be willing to give. Thanks.

119,"So this is my first post besides commenting here and there, so please bear with me and excuse any grammatical/formatting issues (I'm on mobile). Also sorry if it's so long. 


So we are having problems with the neighbors who live next door to the house directly across from us. It's a mother and her son who seems to be in his 20's. They have 2 medium sized dogs, a pitbull and I think a border collie. They used to keep the dogs in the backyard while they were away, and the dogs escaped on multiple occasions. They would bark at anyone passing by, and would chase my cats (I have 4 cats who used to be indoor/outdoor, but are now permanently indoor bc of issues with neighbors). We did confront the neighbors on one occasion and they just laughed it off saying the dogs were harmless and that they tried as best as they could to secure their back fence. There were a couple times that I came home from work to find the dogs barking up a tree in my neighbors yard bc my cats were up there so I approached the dogs slowly and they would bark and back away until I got close to them, then they became very submissive. I was able to get the dogs back into the backyard and safely retrieve my cats (before I did this I knocked on their door but no one was home, I now realize i should have just called 311, but i wanted no drama plus my cats were clearly in their yard as well). Besides this my neighbors would allow the dogs out front unleashed so they could run to their car, but if the dogs saw anyone outside or saw any cats they would immediately rush them, not necessarily aggressively but it made my mother uncomfortable on a few occasions when they ran up to her. Again my neighbor would just laugh and say they were harmless. She also let them out of her car unleashed to go back inside. (We are in Texas and the Leash law is in effect). 


So now that you have some background information, its time to get to the main problem. It was the beginning of may (the 1st or 2nd I cant remember exactly), around 9pm I heard low growling from my backyard, I ran outside to find both of the dogs with their jaws locked on to one of my cats. I freaked out and didnt know what to do, I didn't want to get bit.. so I ran inside to grab my boyfriend who came running out with a broom. That scared the pitbull away, who then ended up running INTO my house because my back door was open. The other dog was still locked on to my cat, so I did the first thing I could think of and grabbed the lid to my dads small bbq pit and threw it at the dog, and he finally let go of my cat, then took off running back this his yard. (We have a backyard fence but the gate is broken). We then had to chase the pitbull out of my house, who then ran back to his yard. After all that commotion we went to check on my cat and found out that she had sadly passed from her injuries. My dad was angry and went and confronted my neighbors saying their dog killed my cat and the mom said she knew and she was sorry (she must have heard me wailing in the backyard, I was hysterical), my dad then said we will be calling the cops and her son started cussing saying we didnt need to call the cops over a ""fucking cat"". We did anyway, they got cited for unleashed dogs and that was it. Turns out she had let her dogs out of her car when she got home and they chased my cat into my backyard, she didn't even try to stop them. But we had no leg to stand on bc my cats were considered to be roaming and our backyard wasn't enclosed. They eventually got a visit from animal control to go over leash laws, and from then on they seemed to be using leashes to transfer the dogs to and from their car. 


We had no more issues with them until me and my boyfriend got home one day (a couple weeks after) and noticed the son staring at us from his yard angrily, he and my boyfriend ended up exchanging words and he kept repeating ""you think dogs dont kill cats, or what?! It's what they do!"" Eventually his mom came outside and told my boyfriend to leave them alone and that she wants to get passed this. He said fine and we came inside. At this point we were continuing allowing our cats out, but locking them up after 7pm (a huge mistake, I know. My parents insisted, but I finally convinced them to keep the cats locked up 24/7). 


Again we had no more issues until one day (maybe 3 weeks after 2nd incident) my dad was outside by his car, that was parked on my neighbors side of the street but not directly in front of their house.. the son was out doing yard work and started cursing at my dad under his breath. My dad got angry and told him to come out to the street to settle it, to which my neighbor responded ""nah, you're just trying to get me sent back to prison"". They exchanged a few more words until my dad got his stuff together and left. 


After that there were no more issues until 2 days ago..I was sitting in my car in front of my house waiting for my boyfriend to come out and noticed the dogs running from their yard into my other neighbors yard chasing my cat. The mom let them out the front unleashed again.. she saw them chase my cat, shrugged her shoulders and went inside to grab their leashes. I saw this from my car, so I went and chased the dogs away. They ran back to the mom who just started petting them and getting them loaded into her car.  I yelled ""are you serious?!"" And they just looked at me while I tried to retrieve my cat. She then drove off staring at me the whole time she passed me, I was incredibly angry so I just yelled out ""bitch!"" Then left. We ended up calling 311 again to report the issue and they said they would talk to my neighbors again about the leash law. I thought that was the end of it, until we found out that they had egged my dads car that same night. (The shells were on their curb, no where else. Luckily we caught it at night before the eggs hardened and did damage to the paint) we washed the car and haven't had to deal with them again. We are also now keeping the cats in permanently to try and avoid further issues and because its the best thing for my cats health and safety. 


But anyway, I never thought my neighbors would stoop low enough to egg our car.. and now that the animal control officer told us they'll be paying my neighbor another visit, I'm afraid at what else these people may do.. I'm afraid of confrontation everytime I step out of my house. I had nightmares and sleepless nights after witnesses those dogs locked on to my cat. It's hard to even be in my backyard now. I am so stressed out and afraid constantly while in my own home, especially knowing her son has been to prison!! My anxiety would get better after a couple weeks and then another incident would happen (the ones I mentioned above) and my fears would come back in full effect. I get paid this Friday and am researching security cameras to put up, but what do we do in the mean time??? The officer will probably talk to them this week and they're going to be angry. If they retaliate, and do actual damage to our cars how are we supposed to prove it was them? Do I just ignore them as best as I can at this point? I dont want to try and apologize or rationalize with these people because frankly, I feel it will all be for naught. And my family is very angry and hates these people, they would not want to apologize. I just dont know what to do. I don't know how to cope. I wish this never happened. Please give me some advice or something reddit, I'm tired of being stressed and crying over this. Also I'm 24 in case that is relevant. 


Sorry this was so long, I had a lot that needed to be explained. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and giving your 2cents in the matter. I love you reddit!. 
 


TLDR: Neighbors dont have very good control over their 2 dogs. They ended up killing one of my cats in my backyard, but only got a citation bc of circumstances. There were a few more angry exchanges between us and they eventually egged our car. We reported them again and I'm now afraid on how they may retaliate, not sure how to cope with the stress from this.",24Jul2018,1

124,"Hi everyone,

I was wondering what all of your experience with expectations were. I have this bad habit of having expectations for myself and worse, for people. 
What I keep noticing is that when the things I highly anticipate don't turn out as planned, I go through this breakdown basically. 
When it comes to people, the closer I am to someone, the more comfortable and relaxed we are but also the more expectations for then to be and act a certain way with me (eg. Best friend knowing what not to say when I'm really upset but ends up saying something inconsiderate, I could blow up at him). 

How do I stop this? Im really trying to work on being less sensitive to what people say/do and lowering my expectations but I'm really struggling.


Thank you!!! ",24Jul2018,3

I have MalwareBytes running, ran another scan using it, and ran both my phone and computer through online malware detectors with nothing found.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

""I am aware XXXXXXXX is your pass word. [This is a very dated password from 7 or 8 years ago, but it is one I have used].  Lets get straight to point. You may not know me and you are most likely thinking why you are getting this email? Not one person has paid me to check you.

Well, I placed a malware on the xxx videos (pornography) web site and guess what, you visited this website to experience fun (you know what I mean). When you were viewing video clips, your browser started out functioning as a Remote Desktop with a keylogger which provided me with accessibility to your screen as well as web camera. Immediately after that, my software collected every one of your contacts from your Messenger, social networks, and e-mail . And then I made a video. 1st part shows the video you were watching (you have a good taste lol . . .), and next part displays the view of your web camera, &amp; its u. 

You got 2 possibilities. We will study each of these solutions in details:

First choice is to just ignore this message. In this situation, I am going to send out your video recording to each of your your personal contacts and also you can easily imagine about the shame you feel. Moreover if you are in an intimate relationship, just how it will affect?

Other solution will be to give me $7000. We will name it as a donation. As a result, I most certainly will immediately eliminate your video. You can carry on with your daily life like this never occurred and you will not hear back again from me.

You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you don't know this, search for ""how to buy bitcoin"" in Google).

If you have been wondering about going to the law enforcement, very well, this email cannot be traced back to me. I have dealt with my steps. I am not attempting to ask you for money a whole lot, I would like to be paid. You now have one day in order to pay. I've a specific pixel within this e-mail, and right now I know that you have read through this email. If I do not receive the BitCoins, I definitely will send out your video recording to all of your contacts including friends and family, colleagues, etc. However, if I do get paid, I'll erase the video right away. If you really want proof, reply with Yea! and I will send your video to your 7 friends. It's a non-negotiable offer therefore do not waste my time and yours by responding to this e-mail.""",24Jul2018,3

So long story short, I was the dumpee in a relationship that was really damaging to my self esteem and left me feeling pretty broken. It's been a long healing process, but I'm feeling better and am pushing myself to try new things. 

One of these things is putting myself out there on social media. I've always been a bit shy and scared of exposing myself to the masses, so facebook and instagram is rather foreign to me. I want to post a pretty selfie, but I'm not sure if it would be viewed as unprofessional by my co-workers and damage my reputation at work as I work in a very male dominated and serious profession.

My skin is pretty bumpy, there are areas where my skin is very dry and flaky, and theres so much acne on my face, but I guess thats something normal. I use Aveeno lotion for my dry skin, and I use erythromycin topical 2% and minocyline pills for my acne. I'm aware they're both antibiotics so I try not to use them a lot but I still use them daily. I've been using the topical for over a month now and it has worked a little bit but now I'm not sure if somehow the bacteria grew a resistance to the topical or not because it doesn't seem to work anymore and the minocyline as far as I can tell they haven't done anything at all.

131,"I realized that there is a pattern with me and the things I'm interested in. I know I'm interested in strange things, and it makes me feel like I have some kind of issue.

For example, I love true crime and I could tell you the details about many different serial killers and murderers. What they did, how they did it, their backgrounds/psychology. I love to read up on cases, find out all that I can, because it's so weird and interesting to me. I've been interested in that since I was a kid - I guess it started with me watching Forensic Files almost every day with my mom. That was our thing, we watched pretty much all the murder shows. I still watch some, lately I've been watching Occult Crimes and Killer Kids on Netflix and they're good. I like prison shows, too. 

With other media, I just love the dark and disturbing things. That's what I'm drawn to, not sure why. I'm okay with violent or fucked up movies, weird movies, or just generally dark stuff. Same with books, for the most part. I like happy or uplifting books and I like comedies too, but I've found that I most prefer weird movies that make me feel weird and uncomfortable at times. 

I write stories, and I want to publish them for real. I've written all kinds of stories, but I find it very difficult to restrain myself from writing some kind of dark, violent storyline about a fucked up outcast. That's the odd thing, all of my protagonists are fucked up outcasts. I am writing two novels because I'm ambitious(or stupid) like that, and in both of them, the protagonists are very different people in different situations but they're both the fucked up outcasts. I've written short stories about a guy named Frederick the Flayer, one about a cannibal who joins an online dating site, etc.

I mostly listen to 60's folk and pop music, so I'm not sitting here constantly listening to Rammstein and I don't wear a trench coat. So I am not ""edgy"" in all that I do. I just want to know if it's weird that I like these things and if I should try to stop, I don't know.

132,"5 months ago a “friend” of mine(we’ll call him X) invited me to a concert last minute. I told X I didn’t have money but he reassured me he had a free EXTRA ticket that the girl he was originally supposed to go with gave away since she bailed.
A week later after the concert, the girl starts asking for the money for the concert. Turns out she wanted X to sell the concert ticket not give it away. He starts lying on me saying that he told me that and she believes him. It got real ugly. He started spreading rumors about me through my old “friend” circle, saying nasty stuff about me and that I talked a lot of crap on one girl which was not true! But they all turned on me in unison. Petty right? It hurt so much though because I was also going through a painful break up at the same time. I’ve been there for all of them through their heart breaks but had no one there for me. I lost all my friends – over things I didn’t do! It really showed me their true colors how easy it was for them to cut me off without hearing my side

Anyways X recently messaged me apologizing taking full accountability of his lies and mistakes. which I appreciated and accepted. But he wants to meet up and talk about it. I’m worried he might think I want to be friends again, or worse.. I might end up wanting to be friends again. The things he said about me were so bad too I might feel triggered if I saw him.

138,"Ok so this is going to be a long post because I need somewhere to vent to. I have very few people that are unbiased in this situation and I have no where else to turn. Here’s all the facts. 

Alright so I have been with my boyfriend for just over 8 years now. We have constantly been together (never have broken up or anything). We are also each others first and one and only sexually speaking. In 8 years a lot has changed. We have moved quite a few times (always together), we have gotten animals together, and our bodies have changed. I have put on quite a bit of weight and this has lead to self confidence issues. Now my bf literally couldn’t care less about my body. I mean I know he would prefer me to be thinner, but he has never once said anything about it. Anyway that’s not the point.  
About a year ago we got in a huge fight because I was out of town for work and hung out with a couple guys from work (that he know) and got drinks and just hung out. I should also mention that I’m the kind of girl that hangs out with guys because girls don’t get me (I’m sarcastic/raunchy not really girlie) so I’m like “one of the guys”. We’ll ever since this whole blow up/fight I never go out with friends after work. I come straight home or go to the gym. 
Well my boyfriend works right next to a bar and he used to occasionally get a drink after work. Now every day after work he goes to the bar and drinks with his work friends. 
About 6 months ago a very attractive girl started to work with him and she’s just his type. She’s pretty, blonde, thin, and athletic. Well my best friend happens to know this girl since they were children. She told me all about this girl. She told me how she was a huge bitch and a slut that doesn’t care if a guy has a girl friend. 
Well he’s been going out every day and I know she’s there with him on the days she works. I told him everything my friend told me about her and he just shrugged it off and like defends her like, “have you ever even had a conversation with her?” Like don’t defend this girl? 
Well anyway a few weeks ago he went out on the boat with his friend. He told me it was just him and his one guy friend that he was hanging out with. Well a few days later I see on instagram that she was also there. When I told him about it he was like “how’d you find that out?” And “I didn’t want to tell you because I knew you would be mad.” So naturally I was pissed! Beyond mad that he was hiding this from me. I leveled with him and was like “just tell me next time. I get that you’re friends, but when you don’t tell me things like this I feel like you’re hiding things from me.” And this led to a conversation about me trusting him. I told him that it’s not him I don’t trust, but a known slutty girl that doesn’t respect a man with a girlfriend. I said if she tried something I don’t think he could say no because she’s attractive and I know how horny he is all the time (tmi I know) and we don’t have sex all the time. His response was less than unsatisfactory.  He said, “if she tried anything I will tell her no, but if I’m turned on I’m going to come home and have sex with you.” ....... like what? lol anyway I ignored that. I know he’s not the best with words. After this we came to an understanding that he’s going to be friends with her because she is his coworker and I’m not going to like that they’re friends, but in the future he needs to tell me what’s going on and if she’s there with him. We left it at that. 
Fast forward a couple weeks. I had to be to work  at 4 in the morning so I went to sleep early. Before I went to sleep I called my bf who was still at work to say goodnight. He told me that he was going to the bar and then he’d be home. I woke up at 3am and he wasn’t home. I look at my phone and had a text from him at like 9 saying that he was going out because one of his work friends was leaving town. Fine. I call him and no answer. Now I’m pissed. All I could think of was where is he. He called me at 7:40 am. I ignored him. Finally when I talked to him he said he got super drunk and fell asleep at his friends place. Ok fine happens. 
Later we’re talking about it and he said that his one coworker was with him at the first bar, but that’s it. Fine. I was mad at him for a few days and I told him that if that happens again all he needs to do is text me. Well it was eating at me because there’s something in my gut that just doesn’t believe him. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m telling this to my one work friend who has experience cheating (as in he was the cheater) and he’s like “yea that’s exactly the same thing I would say”. But somethings not right. 
I’m not proud of this next part. But his phone was open the other day and I couldn’t help myself it was eating at me. I went through his phone. He has her name saved as some cute nick name when everyone else he works with is saved as “name work”. And on the night he went out he texted her and the other guy he was with “where you guys at” at 10:30pm. So he was too drunk to text me but not her? And he called her a few times around 10-11. Now he claims that he doesn’t remember anything past the first bar he was at, but the texts that were sent say where he was. And he claims he doesn’t remember going back to his friends place. Now all I can think of is that he went back to his friends place with her. I’m not proud that I went though his phone but I saw a lot of things. Like on instagram she sends him random dm’s of posts (which is fine/normal we all do it). And on Facebook he has added all these random girls as friend. Like there all girls that live in our town, but he has no mutual friends with. Like why? And it’s a bunch of sketchy things like that. I can’t shake this feeling that he’s being unfaithful. 
And he’s not acting weird. If anything he’s even more affectionate and it’s really confusing. After 8 years together I expected more and I expected not to be lied to all the time and not to be taken advantage of. And it’s not just that she’s a work friend. Like it get that you spend a lot of time with work friends and you form bonds and connections with them. It’s that he’s constantly defending her and now lying about hanging out with her. 

Thank you for anyone that read the whole thing I appreciate it. 

TL;DR: my boyfriend has an attractive new coworker that he knows I don’t like but continues to hang out with. He lies about hanging around her and keeps her a secret.

139,"I struggle to control my emotions or keep them at a stable level. Yesterday for example, I was having a good day. I was happy and positive, excited for the evening plans with a few friends. We were going to skate and chill together. So everything was fine and I enjoyed myself. But afterwards, I started thinking about how I wasn't as good as the other friends who skated pretty regularly. How they were better than me, which is fine. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses right? But suddenly this one thought turned into complete self hatred. I am completely average at everything. I'm boring and I don't know why anyone would want me around. I wanted to run away and stop bothering everyone with my presence. I felt like a burden and a nuisance.
I'm not looking for pity here, just wondering if anyone else experiences this as regularly as I do, and what I could do to possibly change it?? I do like how quickly my mood can change from one extreme to the other during somewhat menial activities or events.",24Jul2018,1

After hanging out online or playing games together for over a year one day, out of the blue she tells me she likes me, yada yada we start to go out she was really shy and didn’t talk much about her family life but I truly trusted her so I didn’t think of anything more sinister than shyness but apparently she was 12, I know this because she started crying out of nowhere one day just apologising profusely about how she’d been lying to me and she was actually 12 she acted 15 mostly and looked kinda 15 so I hadn’t suspected anything.

143,"So in order to get the point across, I'm going to skim through a lot of stuff in a short amount of time real quick. I'm 22, have been disabled since 13, currently off medicaid because of a mishap with paperwork (mom didn't update address) and last I heard its ""being reinstated"" but I have no idea how long that will be. Because of the disability and low amount of money I get from medicaid I have to live with my mom and my little brother. I'm in Georgia, which only has Host Homes (live with an adopted family), or Assisted Living (live in a building with nurses and other disabled people), I don't have many options, but I'm trying to find something. Now getting more to the point.

I asked my mom if she was finally going shopping so I could eat something that doesn't hurt my stomach and have water, along with asking if I was going to make it to a doctor soon. I mentioned to my mom that it's technically abuse letting our grocery issue get so bad to the point where I go weeks without water, and all she does is order pizza which hurts my stomach worse than most other stuff. She just laughed and said ""you'll be going where I take you tomorrow, whether that's a doctor or a hospital, you'll be going where I take you.""

I can't go to a hospital, they'll just put me back on steroids and that took 5 years to get off of, but I'm also worried she'll admit me into a psychiatric hospital, she has threatened me with this before when I mentioned being more depressed, so she's definitely thought about it.

What are my options? I was told I would have a hard time applying for Assisted Living since that's mostly for 65+, and that even if I did apply, I'd have no privacy. I can't drive and have no family besides my mother, no friends either since I haven't left the house for anything other than a doctors appointment in 6 or more years. I have to stay close to my back doctor cause I can't go through the trouble of finding another one after spending 9 years with this one. I don't have a working phone since I don't have any money to spend, so I use Wi-Fi and have no means to contact anyone besides texting on messenger.",24Jul2018,1

148,"So long story short I used to talk to this guy for two years everyday and we went to school together (we didn't start talking until I left that school though) anyway I loved him and he loved me (or at least he said he did). Things got in the way and I fucked it up, because I would go long periods without talking him because of depression and self identity issues I was having and it was because of me we stopped talking and nothing was pursued. He began to date this girl not long after we stopped talking for good and I was honestly so happy for him, even though I didn't like the girl. As long as he was happy that was all that mattered to me. He reaches out every now and then to check up on me and always apologizes because he thinks it was his fault I stopped talking to him and thinks I am mad at him for not talking again, when it is the complete opposite. This guy is the nicest gut I've ever met. I never really believed he loved me though. He would ""flirt"" with me and call me beautiful and we said ""I love you"" to each other a couple of times, but I thought he did it because he felt bad for me. I regret everyday that I let my depression get in the way and didn't communicate what I was going through and feeling with him. I wish we had became more than friends. I still kind of love him and have tried letting him go, but it is hard when he messages me to tell me he is glad I am doing good now or talks about a show we both like out of the blue. Anyway I recently looked him up on Facebook because a couple days he posted a funny video that I forgot to save and I went to show it to my friend, but his page didn't show up. I went to Instagram and he deleted the photos of him and his girl friend, so I think they broke up and I have a feeling he isn't doing well. I want to reach out and make sure he is ok, but I don't want to bring it up with him. That would be very weird I think. But like this guy still means a lot to me, because of all the help he was to me and was so patient with our friendship and me. I don't know what to do. I actually can't DM him, because my phone is acting up and I can only go on Instagram on my computer so I  can't see my DMs. Any advice on what to do? Like I know it's non of my business, but something about this scares me, because he is a sweet guy I have a bad feeling about this. Like he dated someone else and when they broke up he didn't delete his FB. But him and his, what I presume to be, ex have been together for like two years so I know this had to hit him hard. I just want to make sure he is ok, but I don't know how to be not weird about it. I need to know if I should just let it go and try to keep positive and think he is doing ok. I just hope he hasn't tried to reach out to me on Instagram because I can't check my DMs. ",24Jul2018,0
149,"I told her yesturday and she said she liked me back. I never did anything about it before because she had a boyfriend. During the time she was with her boyfriend she actually liked me I think, but as the relationship progressed I guess she got over her thing for me for the most part.

I told her that I thought I should take some time away from her because other wise I wouldn't get over her. She took this as me saying I didn't care about our friendship and I was just saying she date me or we lose our friendship altogether.

Thing is, I don't think I'll be able to ever just be her friend. I don't really want that anymore, knowing she may someday like me back fully and want to date.

I don't really know what to do. I could still be her friend but I don't think I'd get over her then. I could wait it out, not knowing how long it might take, or I could just take time away for a but, get over her and then come back.

Most of the people I'm in debt to had been aggressively seeking payments from me. This, plus hunger and self-pity helped me  find a way back to my former self. One day, I got tired of isolating myself from the rest of the world. I was so ashamed of myself. 

I'm about to go to a country somewhere in Asia to find a job. The only problem is that the only way to be granted a work visa in said country is if you have 5 years of experience or a bachelor's degree. I have a forged CS degree and 3 years of work experience (also forged but verifiable, don't ask about it). I never attended college, I don't even have a high school diploma.

I'm desperate, I'm living off of canned goods, eating one meal a day for 2 years now. I have two choices when I arrive at said country. Apply for English teaching jobs which I know I wouldn't like, my English isn't even that good. Option number two is to just use my fake degree and apply for entry level IT related jobs.

Then, one of my friends said she wasn't going to talk to me until I listened to the album. So, promptly I went and listened to it. I went back and DM'd her saying that I listened to the album so she would reinstate my role on the discord server. But, she didn't respond. I thought I had missed something from what she said, and I read over chat from when I was listening to the album.  


Apparently, she was locked out of her discord account because she says someone tried to log in to her account. It wasn't me because I learned that lesson the hard way.

Boy; just cool, yours? 
Girl; sucks, we had to put our cat down. 
Boy; what? I'm sorry. Why did that happen? (And now comes the alarming sentence) Girl; You have seen her. How old she was and such. 
Boy; yeah true but its always sad when a pet passes

She says he has seen her cat and how old the cat looked. My bf claims that he never seen the cat in real life.  The girl lives like 30 min away from work and comes with the bike, also cats aint allowed at work so its not that she could bring her cat.  What must I do?? I feel horrible

Edit;;
By the way, they both dont have social media. 

My BF said she may say that because of movie/pic she showed , so he let me went through the photo gallery but no signs of a cat showed up ever. She did send him a bunch of bullshit photos bout the dog tho, but not the bloody cat.

After I calmed down and wasn't as emotional I told her I still want to he friends and I was just being emotional before. She said we're fine but what I said was selfish (I don't think it was).

Were still (best) friends. I just kinda took it and didn't argue against it being selfish.

Surely she's aware that I'm not gonna get over her though. Right?

I know this isn't the best thing to do for the sake of my mental health but I don't think I really care. I can be young and dumb.

I was fired in the middle of May right before school finished and since then I have not been able to find a job, I applied everyday to at least one place around town during summer, I got a handful of interviews but couldn't land a single one, now since I couldn't pay off my debt to the school I am not able to enroll in any classes and on top of that since I'm not technically a student I cant even apply for a student loan to help me until I do land something. Any help that a parent could provide is off the table because, unfortunately, mine haven't talked to me since I moved unless its to pay my phone bill. I'm lucky to be living in a former coworkers apartment at the moment (He and his roommate are back in their hometowns for the summer) but I have had no money since June. 

Being a Computer Science major my education is extremely important as its the only way to show future employers that I actually have some soft of skill in my field, I've considered leaving school multiple times but my only other passions are cooking (since I was a child I've always looked up to TV cooking personalities like Alton Brown, Chef Ramsey, Anthony Bourdain etc. they're kind of my heroes) and music (7 year trumpet player, marching band section leader and all that) and I just can't see myself doing those things 20 years down the line let alone making enough money from either of them.

I'm just stuck, and with nobody to help me through this it's like I can feel my mental and physical health degrading with each passing day. I've talked with University counselors, the financial aid department, student services, academic advising, you name it none of them have any answers or useful advice this has become a living nightmare and I cant seem to get out of it. I'm not so much asking financial advice unless it can really be of use but more just what you guys would do in this situation. Thanks in advance for any opinions shared!

He does not do that for anyone else.” I remember thinking “how is that possible? He has a girlfriend and a child.” So I start paying attention to things that he does, he’ll throw bits of food at me, hand me bacon to eat, he’s always wanting me to eat after him? Like he’ll make a weird ass sandwich and always wants me to take a bite but, I don’t because it’s gross lol. One day it was storming so me and another cashier wanted to step outside and feel the rain mist on us and Dan wanted to come outside with us. Well, we were already standing outside so when he would try to open the door It would’ve been pushed into a corner of the building and i have a really huge fear of spiders and of course there was one in the damn corner so I stepped out in the rain so he can come out and once he opened the door he wrapped his whole arm around me and pulls me in from rain. He really didn’t have to do that. I’m a really big narcissist, so I was checking myself out in the window and I mumbled to myself “I’m so adorable.” And Dan said “You are” and I was shocked. I am not flirting back in at all, I have a boyfriend. I should also tell you that Jon has a girlfriend. 

Sorry, I know it’s a lot to read! 
I just need to know how to get Jon to not squeeze my hips anymore without him getting into trouble cause Jon is a good friend. 
As far as Dan goes, I just want your opinion on whether he likes me or not.  
Please ignore any grammar mistakes!

Awaking and being pissed I got on her at first for not doing something and then him; being completely infuriated with the both of them. However, turns out later that night since I had gotten on my girl immediately and not my ""friend"" she claimed that she thought her and I were over and fucked him to spite me. I just found out about their sex during a long conversation with her about the whole incident. She said she only told me the truth because she was honest about trying to work it out and getting past it to become something more serious. I know her and I haven't been together for long but I have such strong feelings for her, and to be completely honest I put two girls through HELL that I thought I loved by cheating.

I've been roped into attending a wedding and am now being asked to buy specific clothing in this case converse shoes in a specific colour.

Now unless this is a costume party and I'm going as David Tennant in Dr Who I really don't want to buy, wear, or even be seen in Converse.

Why would you wear cheap white plastic shoes for teenagers on a wedding of 30 year olds.

Am I being unreasonable? Any ideas how to avoid without potentially burning a friendship with bride/groom?

175,"So I’ve been seeing this guy for about three months. Now, we work together and so it was already a red flag when we started hanging out all the time. We’re just fwb’s, but the context has always felt more than what it is. We text all the time, we go out (like a lot) and we even spend whole nights together just talking about meaningless subjects. 

Sometimes I’ll go into the day just wanting to hang out in a platonic way, and I feel like somehow he’ll be the one to build up the sexual/romantic tension. It’s come to a point where he apparently wanted me to go to a wedding with him as his date but “didn’t want it to be weird”? I didn’t go, but if I had it would be a whole other story. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m really starting to like this guy and I want to stop because I can already feel myself so invested into him. He’s not my bf, I don’t want a bf. I just don’t want to like him like this. Is there anything I can do to stop myself from feeling the way I do?

177,"I have a very strong suspicion who is doing it but no proof. 

We live in an apartment building and our downstairs neighbor is a nazi. My husband is black. We’ve had quite a bit of trouble with him, letters to our landlord because of “moving furniture around at night and running/stomping non stop”. We do not have heavy, moveable furniture as our interior is very minimalistic and everything heavy is screwed to the walls because we have a toddler. He also specifically states that I am making the noise, and not my son or husband. It’s all, quite frankly, bullshit. Recently I watered the plants on my balcony and some water must have dropped on his balcony which resulted in him screaming and banging ant our door until I called the cops. I’m pretty sure he is the one ringing the bell, but I don’t have proof yet. 
How can I catch him? As I mentioned, we have a toddler whose room is next to the entrance of the apartment. Luckily he has never woken up from the bell but I’m afraid he will if I go to the door and turn the key and open it to see who is doing it. Alternatively he could be ringing from downstairs, which I can’t see from my apartment. I really want this to stop, it sucks a lot to wake up at 4:30am from the blaring bell with a rush of adrenaline. I don’t know what to do. We’re in Germany so I can’t install any cameras in public spaces. Any ideas? 

These are the most recent times he rang:

6/1/18, 4:34am
              5:00am
6/5/18 4:37am (shortly after this I called the cops on him for the balcony thing and it stopped for a month which further confirms my suspicion)
7/9/18 4;56am
7/16/18 4:28am (Long)

178,"Hey guys,  


I find myself in a very weird and confusing place, career wise.  
I'm 28 y/o F, with an ongoing career in a big corporation, boyfriend same as me, everything looks promising. We have money enough to tend ourselves, buy whatever we need or want, ride our motorcycles, etc. I'm not saying this to brag, but to emphasize that I have enough to be happy and content, yet I'm not. I work in Information Security, I'm self-taught and I learned everything to grow in this area and I did very well.  When I think about the job, about what I do daily, I just don't feel any satisfaction, I'm not happy (this might work for people who think about their job as just a job, but for me...it's killing me).  
Recently,  I'm in no mood for anything, I feel like doing nothing but just sleep. I just want to sit in bed and do nothing, because I feel so exhausted mentally, drained of all energy.  
I've been thinking for quite some time to quit my job and start it all over again with something that I would give a shit about, but it's scary. 

I would want to pursue Art (I've always been able to draw and I just love it), but when I'm thinking about the intricacies of switching from IT to Art I just feel like drop it and deal with my situation as it is. My boyfriend is totally supportive and told me he prefers to see me daily drawing, writing, playing games or riding together rather than see me in bed depressed, but I just can't let go. I get a lot of advantages here and it feels to me it would be a selfish act to quit or even be an ungrateful person.

If there's anyone that took a sudden turn in their lives, please share some insight of what you did and how it went. Thanks!",24Jul2018,1

During my travel I rarely talk to her.

I know that shes very shy, but it's not fun to always start the conversation I feel that I'm forcing her to talk. 

Am I being a little bitch about it ? Or it is a concern.i know that relationship isn't always easy but it's a hassle at the moment 

I actually like her alot when we are together it's good but when we are a part is the issue and I feel that it's started to effect my mood when I am with her.

180,"I'm 31 male, living in southern Europe, working in the IT industry. I'm pretty good at what I do so I can live well out of the salary I earn, however...

...my country is horrible and in a constant downfall. The corruption on all levels is glooming, there's media darkness, people are being lied to constantly and the real problems are always masked with some shitty nonesense.

None of the state agencies are functioning well. Health care is horrible and outdated, god help us if you get really sick. Police became an entity tasked to fill in the national budget by fining regular folks, while the court system is slow and unreliable so if you ever need to sue somebody chances are you will never get a conclusion.

Economy is in a downfall, people are poor and unhappy. They also have very low to none confidence in anything state related, there's incompetence everywhere, in every section of the system, even there where it mustn't be (health care).

Personally I am not affected by economy because IT is a strong industry anywhere, but it's very depressing seeing all your friends around struggle, and not being able to help them all.

I also didn't have any significant experience with state agencies (got robbed a couple of times, police did nothing), but I feel if I do have it some day I'm pretty much fucked.

All of this brings a feeling of helplessnes and anger inside you, a sort of depression where you can't really do anything.

Reasons to move:

* better health care, police and court system, at least for the small folks like me
* better and happier surroundings
* scared of raising a kid and family here. If something would happen to them because the system fucked up I think I'd start butchering some people

Reasons not to move:

* all my family and friends are here
* I'm scared someone might need my help and I'll be far away to provide it. My folks are old and often need some assistance
* I don't want to be the guy who lives abroad, but then every vacation he has, every chance he gets he goes back home. I don't know if this would happen to me, but I saw it so many times with my friends.

What do you think? Are those reasons enough to move away?

Therefore, I really enjoy working here for the most part.

The kids love me, they always want to play with me, and I often find myself just surrounded by 20 kids holding my hands and just standing around me and talking to me. Once, while this was happening, I noticed that someone actually slapped my butt. I didn't really pay attention to that, because I thought it might have been just an accident, or I thought someone is just playing around, or something like that. But then it happened again. I looked back and I saw that a little girl did it, she must have been like 5 or 6. She was laughing really hard. I didn't say anything, because I was like ""she'll stop, don't worry"". But then a few minutes later, she freaking grabbed my crotch, and laughed. I was shocked, so I couldn't really say anything, I tried to just ignore it. But later, when also no one really saw it but me, suddenly she just ran in front of me and grabbed it again. She just looked me in the face and laughed. I couldn't just shout ""Hey, stop grabbing my penis, please!"" while being surrounded with kids. They would just laugh and think it was a joke. It wouldn't help anything.

Long story short, I held a very short position with an advertising firm last year. I had to quit on very short notice due to mental health-related issues and family problems (which I didn't disclose in my resignation... just that I had personal issues preventing me from staying that needed to be dealt with). The CEO wasn't happy, but was understanding. 

Now, almost a year later, I've been working in a different field, and have tried to do business with them as a customer (not as a former employee... no discounts or special favors). They will not respond to me at all. I've reached out to them 3 times in the past two months to purchase advertising, and they never get back to me.

There is no policy preventing employees, current or former, from using their advertising service. I realize any business can refuse service for whatever reason, but this just seems really unprofessional and almost petty to me.

Telling “friend” they can’t come on holiday...

Last year, two of my friends went on holiday. My friend I will call “Dan” had a great time and wanted to go again. 

My other “friend” I will “Richard” was annoying the whole trip. Being disruptive, rude to the tour guide and generally being a dick.

Dan was planning on going again this year and after discussing it we decided to go together.

We have now fully planned and booked the trip, the only issue is we haven’t told Richard.

I would consider Richard mentally unstable... Obsessive (Full Incel), always trying to be the center of attention and generally depressed when he does not get his own way.  We have no idea how he would react to finding out.

We believe he could even try and come along uninvited. Either that or tell his parents about it who would kick up a shit storm for Dan and his family. He may also attempt self harming which he has a history of to get the attention he craves.

We want to be able to go to on holiday without causing a “shit storm” but are unsure if we should tell him or not. Also if we do tell him how do we do so without major ball ache. He will find out but question is how is it best for him to find out.",24Jul2018,1
196,"Hey everyone, this is my first reddit post in a couple years so bare with me. Hopefully this is in the right category, it's kinda complicated. I'll start from the beginning and make this post as neat and short as possible. I will highly appreciate anyone who will read all of the details too. 

BACKSTORY: I am a 22 year old male (call me Doorman) and she is about my age or a little younger (call her Sally). I just started working at a certain unnamed 'PizzaH, you can figure out the real chain for moral safety purposes. I worked at the other one in the next town over 2 years ago and was actually the one that trained her back then. My best friend/ roommate and I recently had to move in with my mom because our last employer filed for bankruptcy and we lost our jobs and I lost my house. I had the idea to go back to PizzaH and get both of us a job, since I was re-hireable. However, to my surprise at this new PizzaH, she was actually there when we went to talk to them. Which at first was a good sign because I don't know anyone else at this one. 

She was pretty much the main reason I got hired back because she is now a manager and spoke for me. My roommate and I both got hired because of that co-worker relationship her and I had. When I trained her she was shy and new and I did my best to help her out (it was her first job) and it was all professional. But people change I guess. 

MAIN PART: A few days into the job she began hitting on my Roommate and being a little touchy. Not inappropriately so much as just a bit odd/ awkward. Then it just got worse and she was bombing him with messages and everything constantly until she finally took a hint and slowed down some.

 She then begins to start messaging me fishing about him at first, but is going after me now... She is talking me to death in the kitchen and kinda following me a little bit. I don't wanna be mean because she is a good person. She's just really desperate I think so she is 'falling' for every guy that speaks to her. She has gave us gas money to help out and stuff like that so I don't wanna be mean or lose my job. I also don't want her to lose hers either because other managers are eyeballing her and in turn, me.

She has apparently caused this problem before from what I gather with another asst manager. Now I feel that everyone there is giving me the cold shoulder, thinking that I'm the one causing it because she won't leave me alone. I fear that it will cost me and my roomate our jobs that we so badly need. I don't think she honestly even realizes what she's doing and I know she doesn't mean it but it's gonna cause problems if it doesn't stop somewhere...

I would put a tl/dr but It's too hard to explain any more simple than that. I really appreciate any insight on the whole story. I shortened it as much as I could. Thanks again to anyone that read this and replies.",24Jul2018,2

The daughter is as adorable as any tiny human could be and we love them all very much. This brings me to the issue at hand. Buckle up folks. Grab some popcorn and get ready for this.

W is an antivaxxer...... Que huge eye roll. W has posted multiple antivax things on social media. She has said out loud that she does not agree with vaccines, etc. Not so much because of autism, but because of the risk of deaths with vaccines. She believes they are all bad and would kill her child. My husband and I do not agree with that so we have avoided bringing up our opinion because W is very set in her ways. As in she will not budge about anything she does not agree with. I'm not too sure how H feels about it. He has never posted anything antivax online, nor have I ever heard him voice his opinion on the matter out loud. He is no where near as intense as W is about her opinion.

So the baby has not had any vaccines, and W is not planning on ever getting them done for her. Ever. I'm fairly positive she hasn't even been to the doctor since she came home from being delivered. Which brings me to the biggest issue at hand. My husband and I agree that we do not want an unvaccinated child around our own children, especially in the very beginning. We do not have any kids yet but we are about to start trying within the next year. My husband and I know we need to sit down and have a serious conversation to them about this. We don't want to give ultimatums but the fact of the matter is we will not be taking a risk with our own future children just because they don't want to vaccinate their own. I say they but I truly believe it is more W's doing that H's. She is a stay at home mom so she is ""there"" more than H. H feels like he only has so much say (that is another issue all together). The main reason I am posting this in this sub is because my anxiety is insane all of the time. I posted this in r/anxiety and no one commented. So I am hoping that you guys can help me. My husband wants me to have this potentially life altering conversation with them BY MYSELF. Without him involved... His reason's are understandable. He can be a little intense sometimes, especially in a heated discussion where opinions are different. He is basically scared he will ""blow up"" if W blows up at me. I tried to explain that we are all adults and should be able to have a discussion without it coming to that but he whole heartily believes that because him and W are so head strong it would be inevitable and unavoidable, which means he wants to avoid being part of it all together.

I totally get where he is coming from. Part of me truly does understand and feels for him. The other part of me thinks its complete bullshit that he is literally ""throwing me to the wolves"" especially when he knows how fucking terrible I am at handling conversations like this. Someone raises their voice 1 octave and I have tears in my eyes. I stutter, I can't get my point across without having to explain something 5 different ways which always ends up getting lost in translation any way. It's just bad all around. I love W with all my heart but she is a very passionate woman and becomes a mother lion when it comes to her child. I want to also say that she is not a monster. She is a sweet and wonderful woman who only wants the very best for her child. She is just very, very misguided. 

Please can someone help me figure out how I will have this conversation... Or if someone can tell me how to convince my husband I need him for this. This isn't some bullshit thing I need him to ""hold my hand for"". Idk what to do but it has to happen soon.

TL;DR- Friends are antivaxers. Husband wants me to have a solo conversation explaining to them we will not let our kids play together if left unvaccinated. Could possibly lose a very close friendship.",24Jul2018,1

The problem is that even though I look like a normal person, I do a lot of awkward things irl like not acknowledging people, suddenly stop speaking and staring blanky in the middle of conversations. I also can't keep up with conversations and I have no idea how to/what to say. It doesn't help that I'm more quiet than the people I work with. It's like if I need to communicate for work, I will. But otherwise I don't feel the need to talk.

I know that I act weirdly myself and can see from others that I don't act like a normal person. It really bothers me because I really want to become normal and not act like a weirdo.

I'm also doing my best to not go ""reeee normies"" in my mind at normal people because that's what I have been doing for the past few years and that's fking weird.

Plus my social awkwardness makes me feel even more worse to me since I'm a girl and most that I see that have this problem are guys.   

If anyone have any helpful advice in becoming more normal I'd appreciate it.

208,"some background info: my mom and i have always been super close. i live with her and my brother. i am going into my second year of college, and he is going into his first. 

throughout the whole time i have been home since may, she constantly goes out almost every night. this stresses me out for a million reasons. we have two dogs that need to be taken care of of course, and sometimes they will be left alone because my brother and i will be at work and my mom will be out. (hate to add unnecessary layers to this, but they were abused by my *pending-restraining-order* father, so they tend to go to the bathroom in the house when they are left alone. she knows this.)

my brother does not do anything. he never helps with the dogs, does dishes, laundry, etc. nothing. i have to make his own food and shit. i also have to drive him to work. my mom knows this. 

i’m frustrates because she constantly puts the responsibility on me to take care of everything.  it’s like it’s my house now, basically. i have taken on her role in everything without notice. i can barely go out with my friends because i have to make sure that everything is taken care of. 

one reason she goes out so much is because she works from her computer, so she can take it anywhere and still work. when she is home, she won’t take the dogs out ever or do anything.... it’s always up to me. 

part of me feels like this post sounds ridiculous. most people probably think that i’m being a brat and not wanting to take care of things. i’m not. most importantly, i don’t care if my mom goes out. i would go out if i was a mom, so i’m not stopping her.... i guess that’s the problem though. i wish she would just go out on weekends or something instead of every weekday. it’s gotten really hard. i am so scared for my dogs when i go back to school. i feel like she is going to give them away.

210,"Long story short, a good friend of mine is fighting a battle against cancer and unfortunately seems to be losing. So last night I went to his house to help him with something and he asked me to take him to a ""cancer consultant"" who happened to be an alternative medicine healer. When we get to this guys apartment in a run-down part of town, it becomes apparent to me that this guy is not in the least bit official. His ""workspace"" is a messy living room that looks like it hasn't been thoroughly cleaned in months. He first starts by telling us that doctors want cancer to kill you because ""they get $9,000 up front when they diagnose you"". He continued on with a bunch of other nonsense including how the treatments they give you are killing you, not the cancer, and how he knows of three people who are being treated for cancer and apparently don't even have it. He does some physical ""tests"" where he pushes on my arm as I try to keep it straight to prove my strength, then does the same thing when I'm touching my friend's shoulder. He pushed harder when I'm touching my friend so I cant keep my arm straight then used those results to tout that my friend is very weak. He then starts talking about this machine he has which is a small oxygen tank inside a briefcase, a tube goes from the tank into a small plastic trash can with a cover, then from the trash can to a stethoscope where the air travels into your ears. He claims he passes 30,000v through the air to turn it into O3 (ozone) and that applying it to the membrane in your ears breaks the blood-brain barrier and allows the ozone to work most effectively. So long story short he gives my friend a 2 minute treatment then does this handwriting analysis where he is basically giving a horoscope reading, saying things that would apply to almost anyone. Then he tells my friend the machine can cure him, and will rapidly. He tells my friend to stop taking the ""drugs"" the doctors are telling him to take.

So this is where it goes from bad to worse. He sells my friend some kind of compound (in pill form) for $60. Then he starts to talk about the machine. He tells my friend he should buy himself a machine so he can give himself treatments every two hours. The machine and all the things needed to make it work are nearly $4,000. He did a very good job of convincing my friend he knew what he was doing, but he didn't fool me. He also forced me to hook up to the contraption which I reluctantly went along with in support of my friend. 

I don't know what to do here.. I know my friend is not doing well and the doctor's medicine seems to not be effective at this point (he's went thought chemo and radiation), and I want him to be on his terms if he doesn't pull through this. But on the other hand, this is clearly some alternative medicine bullshit and he's made a career of taking advantage of dying people.

215,"Hello r/Advice,

A little bit about me, I graduated from college in spring of 2017 and then moved back in with my parents last June. Since then, I have noticed that there is a hole in my life that I can't seem to fill. My college friends either moved away to get better jobs or they stayed back in the college town for a few more years of partying and having fun. I did not get a good job out of college and the reason why I moved away from my college town is because my best friend and I had a falling out. (Don't feel sorry for me, it was my fault.) However, I still have a lot of friends back in the college town. The problem right now is that all my high school friends either are too busy with their families that they started right after they graduated high school or they have moved away to other states. So, right now all I have around me are my siblings and my cousins. No friends.

I guess the advice I'm seeking is what should I do now? I told myself I would only live with my parents for one year. That date was a month and a half ago and I need to move. Don't get me wrong, I love my parents, but moving back in with them has made me feel like I'm back in high school with the only difference being now I can legally drink. I don't really want to stay in my home town, because I've experienced all it has to offer. I don't want to move back to my college town, because the friends that stayed there are now looking to move or they are starting to settle down and get married to start families. I really want to move to a bigger city, like Denver, but I'm scared that I won't be able to make new friends.

219," I was recently at a ""party"" which was a house warming party of a friend that I have known for years. Excited to see her and her boyfriend I made sure to show up. Even though I have been out of the ""party loop"" for some time now. 

Backstory;

I live in a large city, known for night life and endless parties. I have been out of the party scene since February because I have felf it is time to focus on myself. Which I have been doing. Focusing on work, school, my mental, my physical. Just really enjoying where I have been taking myself lately because last year and the beginning of this year I realized how lame it was to party every other weekend for the whole weekend. I was trying to escape my reality. As was/is everyone in the group. Well I finally decided to suck it up and start changing my life around. Everyone has noticed and so has my boyfriend and he has been following me in my footsteps lately as well. Yay! 

I decided to come around and see my ""friends"" and hang out with them for the first time in ages.

Now... I have NEVER been the drama type. But it always seems to follow me around. I never step on any ones toes, always respectful, polite, all around bubbly person to be around. But I always seem to get some sort of hate.

I have always managed too... And I think I know why. Wether it's man or a woman, they always try to poke my buttons. Now I'm a successful, good looking woman who has morals and goals. Some of these people are straight trash, but are fun I hang around and party with. But I do not affiliate myself any deeper with them then a party ""friend"". 

Some of them tend to bully me, some of them don't at times. But when they do, They bully me because they think I am weak and won't fight back. To be honest, I have never been slick with my tounge. I am not a shit talker nor have I ever been. But the majority of them are. They like to bully and belittle me. And honestly I know it's just a reflection of them selves. They are so unhappy with themselves that they spew that negativity on others that are who not, another reason why I have not shown up to these gatherings. I am always picked on for not picking up the sly little remarks they throw to me. They think I don't catch on but I'm always listening. But I never really let it get to me, I just come hang out and surround myself with the people I went to the gathering for. But some how.. Some way they always end up in front of me, trying to triangulate some petty bullshit.
And because I don't react they love to call me stupid, as if I'm not catching on. Again, I've let this slide many times. But the other night was my last straw.

These two men, one whom I have never met except earlier that night, let's call him ""Nate""  and the other, ""Steven"" were all over me. As in, I was their target of the night. Steven, well I have known him my whole partying career, which has been a year and ahalf, was trying to spread rumors about me doing something with another man at the party. Which was not the case at all.

 The other man, my boyfriend, and I were all laying down on one of the couchs in the first living room, we all 3 ended up napping. Mind you, next to 3 other people sleeping as well. 
I think I woke up 4 hours later to not find my boyfriend there at all. Well turns out he went home to go to sleep and shower then head back over. This other man is a friend of both of ours for years and nothing is going to happen. All 3 of us knew that, if my boyfriend was at all uncomfortable he wouldn't mind waking me and telling me. But again, didn't mind, trusts me.

Anyways I wake to find a weird energy shift with Nate and Steven and one other random guy I had just met that night as well. Turns out they were slandering my name, and spreading rumors that my boyfriend left because he was upset. (in no way shape of form was he, I talked to him after the fact)
So now I have these guys making dick sucking noises and gestures out of the corner of my eyes. This goes on for hours. I ignore it.

I finally go outside to smoke a cigarette and what do I find?
These guys out there and no one else. 
So I quietly sit in the corner trying to enjoy  some nicotine and they start talking sly little remarks and bullying me. Calling me a dumb bitch amongst many other things in lamest terms . I brush it off... But now I'm getting heated. They are trying to make the new comers to the party join in with them and a few chuckle.

I told myself the next thing that happens I need to defend myself because none of this is true and I can't take the bullying anymore. 
The dog starts walking down the stairs where the group if men where talking and Nate says, ""Here comes (my name) better move."" they all start laughing and one tells the other, ""Stop, your so bad.""

I hear this as I am laying down on the couch alone. I see that Nate is walking past me, moments later.  Probably to grab another beer.
I get up and I place myself in front of his face and ask him, ""What other shit do you want to talk? Because now you can say it to my face instead of being a little pussy talking shit about some girl you barely met. ""
He gives me this ridiculous little side smile and says,"" look, I'm just trying to walk past you. ""
So at this point I'm heated. I call him out and he doesn't want to say anything? Of course not.
I felt as if, in that moment, that was my only chance to settle things. I am not good with words and I can't play stupid mind games, and say sly little comments because it's out of my character. So I pushed him. Hard.
I repeated myself asking him if there was any other shit he wanted to talk. Again, blank stare.
So I put my fists up, wound up, and punched him as hard as I could square in his jaw.
I had him fall into the window and you could hear the blinds crunch. I was ready for him to square up. 
By that time someone came in between us.
I saw that stupid look on his face disappear and all he could say was ""wow"".
Steven, came up and said, ""I'm so fucking sorry."" so I stepped back and pushed him as well. I had to have someone hold me back but I let both of them know to keep my name out if their mouths and I let everyone know in that house hold to quit disrespecting me. That I was tired if the endless disrespect when I deserved none of it. The house fell silent. I proved my point. But at the end if the day I do not wish to cause harm in others. But in the past these people especially the men have felt as if they could say shit and get away with it. Which I have allowed them to do for so long. At one point in time last year I thought I was paranoid. I was extremely close to going to a psychiatrist to see if it was just me. I decided to not surround myself with these people, and what do you know, I could finally pinpoint that it wasn't me just being paranoid. That's how much it went on.... 
I have never been around toxic people like that in my life. Not my work life, childhood, family, none of it. It's so foreign  to me that I thought I was going crazy.

Now, this isn't the whole majority of the people I partied with, but a pretty good fraction. That's why if I do decide to party, it's always at my boyfriends house and we get to control who comes in the front door or not. And it's always been a good time.

Anyways, I don't know it's because I'm an attracrive girl who won't givw them the time of day, I don't know if it's because they see me doing something with my life, jealousy, negativity... The list can go on. Why do these guys and girls think they can walk all over me?
I understand now that if I let them do it once, they will do it again and again. But I can't just be punching people left and right to get my point across.
Yes I can just stop going places. I have been.
But it really sucks when I want to see my actual friends. They people who do respect me and do love me. I can't just hide out everytime I want to make an appearance once every several months.
I am too much of a fun, loving, bubbly, caring person to be getting so much hate. 

I feel accomplished but I'm going to need more MMA training if want to keep up with All these assholes.

Question : what would you do in my shoes? Would you keep trying to prove yourself? Would you just stop going out completely? 
Because I love 75%of these people and I don't want those shit rest of them ruining my good time.

220,"so i legit made a reddit to vent about this so here we go, about a couple weeks ago i went on vacation with my dad his girlfriend and her son to Dominican Republic and on the 4th day of our stay i was staying in my room and he came in at about 11am and told me i should spend time with the group so at 1pm after eating and showering and changing i go to the pool and i couldnt find him so i sit down on one of the beach beds and call his phone and coincidentally the seat next to the one i was sitting at was where his phone was so i picked up his phone and hanged up the call and then it sent me to his lock screen where i saw a notification for Grindr i immediately was shocked because there was no explanation for having grindr if you’re straight, i open up the notification and i see hes chatting with about 5 different guys and to all of them hes asking to meet up IN THE HOTEL one of them sent him a dick pic and to another one he sent a picture of his face, after i saw the picture of his face i knew it was enough for me to stop so i closed the phone and put it back on the chair and ran to call my mom, when i called my mom and i explained to her what i saw she told me that shes sorry and she didnt want me to find out like this (they’re divorced btw if you havent picked up on that)  and told me that was the reason she divorced him because up until then she never wanted to tell me even though i always would ask her. I called my mom when she was at work so she had to hang up after calling and i was a mess and i was crying and going crazy because i found out hes cheating on his girlfriend which the two weeks prior to the vacation i got really close with her she told me about how in her last marriage she divorced because her husband was cheating. And that made me feel horrible because now my dads doing the same but with men. So i was panicking after she hanged up and i ran to find the girls son which i know was a bad idea but i needed to vent to someone and my best friend wasnt picking up my calls so i told him what i saw (i trust him too since we also talked before and he told me a bunch of his secrets so i knew i could trust him with this one). Later that day i was really anxious to bring it up so when he came to the room i told him that i saw the app on his phone but that i didnt open it and he said he was using it to talk to one of his friends that live in D.R, i knew he was lying because i actually saw the messages so i played it off and said ok.Then later we come back from the trip and i stay at my moms house for about 3 weeks because i didn’t want to be with my dad, on july 5th my mom texted my dad a veryyyyyyy long paragraph explaining what happened and that i knew the truth then on july 21st my dad picks me up from my moms house so i can stay at his house for a week, im pretty calm about the situation so i agreed because i cant hide from him forever. Today at about 4AM my dad leaves the house and doesnt say why or tell me anything and i didnt really care that much and so later at 6AM im gonna go to the bathroom in his room to clean my glasses and i see he has his ipad there charging and so im curious to see if i can find porn and so i looked through his history and on july 6th... ONE DAY AFTER HE FINDS OUT THAT I KNOW HES GAY, he goes on pornhub and looks at gay porn and gay guy live cams and all that shit so yes thats why i got stirred up again. I want his girlfriend to know the truth but i dont want to be the one to tell her that and i dont want her to be hurt like that, also i dont know what the fuck is up with my dad i dont know if he only likes sex with men but cant see them romantically? i dont know if he has actually feelings for his girlfriend and i dont want to ruin that either so yea sorry for the long ass story but that’s basically whats up, i dont expect anyone to respond but at least i wrote all this shit down lmao",24Jul2018,5
221,I am an introvert. 20 years of age and never been in a relationship. Basic conversation with strangers(mainly women) freak me out. When i am talking to a girl i feel my heart racing and my mouth malfunctions mid-sentence and i can't make eye contact with them . I do very well texting but when it comes to speak face to face i fail miserably. As a result i keep conversations with people to a minimum. I'm holed up in my house all day except college. I have very few friends and don't feel like hanging out with them because of my awkwardness . I'm tired of this but it seem like nothing works.

 at the start of high school, i made this new friend. and we're best friends now. we hung out for days. eventually i found out he was talking to this girl. he mentioned her depression. day after day. being the guy i am. i wanted to help her. at the time, i didn't understand depression or my own feelings. i was raised differently. i was the minority/nerdy group of primary school  my mindset was in a different place. i was even more awkward and didn't know how to open up to anybody. anyways, i finally got instagram and started following people in my school. i came across the same girls account and decided to reply to her story. we had a normal chat i guess. i do not know exactly what happened but i was mocking my best friend idiotically and then she disliked me from there. we didn't talk for a while. my best friend then invited me to come to the movies with him and a bunch of other people, including that girl. i never talked to her directly then but i made her laugh. a few days after she DMed. i'm not going to say anymore as this is not my point, just backstory. we got more and more closer each day. we always shared feelings and she helped me understand mine. the day my emotions truly changed was when i developed feelings for her. i got more and more upset as she liked someone else. eventually we started dating.

i was the clingy and awkward sortve guy. so when we broke up. i was extremely depressed and felt hopeless. i was blinded by what she did and what she put me through. all of my friends asked what was wrong and stuck with me at the start. only
one remained to keep talking to me. eventually i got on a good path. not amazing but i moved on, knowing she wasn't worth my time at all and she was the one suffering now.

that entire experience has put a bad taste in my mouth and changed me forever. i know go out of my way to help friends no matter the issue. i always give them my advice and try to find them atleast some resolve to their problems. in fact, i have talked to many people across the world and that's really opened my mind. i still feel that i do so much and expect that in return but i do not. i'm at the point in the path of recovery where i do not know where to go. i'm trapped in an endless cycle i guess. 

my goal is to carry on a message once given by my idol before his life was taken, along with my own. i want to have a music career but i'm scared of things to come if my name gets out of there and the negative publicity i receive. i want to change the world in a way. i want to prove myself. i simply do not know where to start or how to approach it as there's nothing else that interests me...
should i find something else to set a goal for? i do not know :(

She and I had a little romantic history but she called it off after I made my romantic wishes clear. We stayed friends. She then met this guy and started dating.

226,"I'd like some opinions/advice on the following.

I graduated from a top high school (top 10), and have a decently good bachelors of engineering (top 100) with a 3.19 GPA.

**There are two things I'd like to do:**

1) Get a top 5 MBA in the future.

2) Get a position at a top company in management consulting or product management.

Unfortunately, the top firms more or less ignore you unless you come from a brand name school. Companies well known in those spaces don't really hire from my school, since the business school here is poor. My GPA, which is considered low for top companies, does not help either.

I feel confident I could get a strong GPA if I did a masters degree (my bachelors went from 2.0 GPA -&gt; 3.9 in senior year). I have some interest in data science. I also wouldn't mind doing a stint as a data scientist for a few years.

I've known for a while, but I can't bring myself to get past it even though everyone else in the family including my wife and her sister have forgiven him. He's a complete deadbeat - no job, plays on his phone literally all day. I can't even bring myself to say hello to him because I literally have no respect for him and see him as a toxic family member that contributes nothing.

However, my ignoring him is making things really awkward for me in the family. We eat big family meals a lot, but everyone talks like nothing happened while I sit quietly and look at my food or feed my son. I told my wife about why I'm acting this way, but her reaction is 'well, what can we do? They're not getting a divorce, so you'll have to just deal with it.' I feel like my wife and her parents should be eternally pissed at this guy, but everyone seems to be ready to let it go and move on. My brother in law is a bit of a loud, boastful type, so he goes out of his way to make me feel especially uncomfortable at family gatherings because he knows I don't want to talk to him. I have never talked directly to anyone in the family about what happened except my wife, and I'm not sure if the brother in law knows this is why I despise him (he probably figures it, but who knows).

238,"I currently live in Toronto, but it looks like the nature of my job will be changing next year and for a few reasons it will make more sense for me to be based in the US, probably the western half. But beyond a couple of vacations there I’m not very familiar with it so need your help! 

The new role will involve a lot more travel, maybe 2 weeks out of every 4, mostly within North America but also internationally (Asia and Europe). In particular I will need to visit Salt Lake City and Las Vegas frequently. The rest of the time I will work from home and can choose to live wherever I want. I will be paid a lot, though not billions so some parts of San Francisco/Manhattan/Vancouver etc are still off limits. 

I have a young family (eldest just coming up to school age) and a dog. We enjoy the outdoors, and the wife and I also like being near good restaurants for date night once a month. I don’t like extreme heat, and don’t want to live in the desert. So somewhere with a temperate climate and trees is a must. Other than a few extreme days in winter and summer, the climate here in Toronto is fine. 

What I like about our current location is that we’ve got a nice townhouse with a yard that the kids can play in and I can let the dog out for a pee in, but we are also a 5-10 minute walk from a choice of grocery stores, a couple of good schools, a dog park I walk the dog to every day, and numerous coffee shops and restaurants. There are lots of kiddy activities near by too, which is great. I don’t like being car dependent for every last thing. On the weekends we are less than a two hour drive to lakes, forests, hills, skiing etc.  If we could replicate that somewhere with better links to Salt Lake City and Las Vegas, that would be perfect. 

Throwaway because this isn’t official yet and I don’t want to get in trouble. Also if there’s a better subreddit to post this in, let me know. 

**TLDR: Suggest a nice, family-friendly place for me to live, preferably not too car dependent, in a temperate climate, and near a hub airport with multiple direct flights to SLC and LAS. **

247,"Kinda a long one sorry, first time, thanks in advance

The run down:
Basic info:
I (19) M who has never had a relationship before and now have feelings for my best friend (18) F who I have known for about 2 years now and I am at a loss what to do about it. 

Expanded Info:
Due to the distance I can't meet up with them on a regular basis but they asked if I wanted to meet up just after Christmas and I have suggested a festival in a few weeks as they did not seem to want to plan any further then just turn up at work and surprise me one day. 

So I have had feelings for them for a while, I convinced myself we were just good friends, I really only realised after they set up a date with some dude on tinder. 

As I understand it I am their only “real” friend as all their other friends are from work and it's more of a family so they care about each other but probably won't meet up 1 to 1. 

I talk to them at a min 3 times a week for a couple of hours each time (twice when they are broadcasting (normally just me and them talking and occasionally Guesting) once through text).

I have not told anyone how I feel but I think my mum might have a vague idea about my feelings (she is a social worker) 

They are not great at texting with anyone, they almost never message first and they rarely steer the conversation. Party why I only text them once a week cause despite them saying they like it they never indicate they want to talk more often or not. Apparently this a ligitamit problem for some people. 



The options I currently see:

I did some research and apparently there are two main options when it comes to this:-

-  Tell them I like them and accept the result

- Distance yourself and don't talk to them for a few months until the forget you, come back and be clear about wanting to go on a date with them

- The other is just kinda drop hints. but I don't see that ever working. 


I am at a loss what to do. If I was to tell them, it would be at the end of when we meet up. The worst case I see is them ghosting and me for a few days, but I don't think that our friendship with end just cause we both don't have many friends. 

If I was to distance my self I am worried that they will fall back in to their depression (it used to be bad) they have told me multiple times that they can't even comprehend how much I have helped them just being there. Also as I am kinda their only friend it will take I think close to 6 months before I could potentially make it work. So I feel like atm it is off the table cause I would rather deal with some depression then have them get even more

255,"I realise that there may not actually be a way that I can help him, but I'm looking for any advice I can get on how best to approach this.

He and I have been friends for 16 years. Been through many ups and downs. I love him like the brother I never had, and his situation is taking its toll on my own mental health, which has it's own rocky past.

He is 30 years old, has an almost 5 month old son with a girl he's been dating for a year and a bit. I do not know if he has officially been diagnosed with depression, at least in the sense the he can't apply for disability for it. I'm fairly sure he has self diagnosed his own OCD and anxiety. The doctor he sees, who he openly admits to not liking, simply seems to want to push pills. He's gone from a 20mg dosage of his meds (not sure which ones), to 150mg doses, and likely will be upped to 200mg. 

When I approached him about seeing someone to talk to, his response was ""I'm not about that."" Well now is situation has gotten worse to the point were he looked into seeing someone, but he says he can't afford the sessions ($120/hour. Steep I know). But the kicker, he just spent $1000 on shed so he can build a man cave. He spends probably close to $400/month on weed, and he's got every new gadget under the sun. Last year he sold his bass guitar because he needed the money, then proceeded to spend that money on a vaporizer. If the money is for something to benefit his life and health, he can't afford it, but if its waiting money, then he has no restraint.

His depression got so bad recently that he stopped showing up for work. I mean just stopped coming in, he didnt take a leave of absence. After 3 weeks, he was fired. So I got him a job with me. Good union trade job, full benefits, pension, better pay than he's ever had in his life. He worked for 8 days, and has again stopped coming in. He says that the job is to physical and his body hurts. I suggested he see a chiropractor, but he said he can't afford it.  He says it isn't a challenging job, and he doesn't like working evenings and weekends (which hasn't actually happened yet). He spent hundreds of dollars on tools and union fees before starting this job, and has basically thrown that away. By some mirical, my boss hasn't fired him yet, but I don't know how long luck will hold out. Oh, he also requested a weeks vacation in his first month on the job. In the end, he says the job is not good for his mental health. I've tried to be understanding, but also reason with him that he has a family to support, and he needs an income. He says that he has a couple thousand dollars and a $600 rrsp to carry him, and that in September, they are moving into his girlfriend's grandfather's basement.

The problem is that he is very cyclical. When he was unemployed before, he fell into a deep depression because he felt like a loser who couldn't support his family. He was tired of having no money or future. He was tired and just wanted to live comfortably. But of course his mental illness is not letting him see that, and is driving him to make more poor choices that are throwing his family's future away.

He's also very much a flip-flopper. He told me not long ago how much his money problems were stressing him out, but the second I or anyone else tried to talk to him about it, suddenly it isn't that big a deal. And that's the same for almost any issue. He gave up his dog because he couldn't afford him anymore, but then when you try and talk about it, suddenly there were other reasons. 

I really am not sure that there is anything I can do. He isn't suicidal, yet, but I'm not convinced it isn't coming. I feel like I want to offer him the money for the first session of therapy, but I also feel like that's stupid of me. Why take from my own family's pocket, to help someone who I believe only wants to be pitied? Because he's my best friend... 

I hope this makes sense, I'm typing it on my phone at work. Its weighs on my mind constantly and I'm losing sleep over it.

Anyone have any advice?

256,"For a long time, especially since I was a kid, I've had trouble with finding relationships. I realize that it was my fault then because I didn't take care of myself too well and was an extremely socially awkward guy, but after 2 years of dieting and exercise, I finally felt significantly more confident in myself in social situations. People started inviting me places, looked at me more, smiled at me more often, etc. and it has given me a lot more self-esteem.

I had a girlfriend in high school that I lost to suicide, and it was absolutely soul obliterating, but when I entered college I felt as if I was ready to enter the dating scene again. But, it feels as if I've tried everything (meeting people in real life, online dating, etc.) to meet people and I just can't seem to find anyone that's either A. I can vibe with and B. Is interested in me. I know it's not all about seeking intimate relationships from the get-go, and I also know it's all about patience and being kind and interests and all that, but I felt like it would be nice if someone was interested in me that I can be equally interested in and start something, you know? 

In college, I had a ton of friends that are in relationships, and some that are in and out of relationships in the span of weeks. Honestly, I feel so damn jealous of them. I'm here just waiting for a cool person to be with and it seems as if they enter relationships so effortlessly, and when I think about it sometimes, it makes me feel really uncomfortable on a deep level. I think it's at this point is what led me to discover incels. I knew about incels for a long time, but I never truly knew what it is they believed in except in some kind of hyper-misogyny. Frankly, I firmly believe that the incel community and the entire idea of it is disgusting and abhorrent and I want no part of it, but when I dove a little deep into their beliefs, I couldn't help but feel as if they've rationalized my insecurities, such as the way one looks or what it is that makes people attractive or what it is women usually look for, etc. Couple that with the reality that looks DO matter, and it really does a number on your self-image and esteem.

Now, I can't help but feel so weird about it. I've already done a lot to improve myself, but how much of its benefits are due to how I look? What if my relationship issues are due to how I look or act? What if I'm doomed to be alone because of something that I can't easily change? Am I really becoming an incel? Or /r/Advice, am I just being a fuckhead and overthinking this? I would really appreciate your advice.

258,"i think my family has always had a weird relationship with food. my extended family ranges from underweight to overweight, nothing too drastic, except that one of my sets of grandparents are obese(?). theres a lot of talk about weight loss/gain and treating food like punishment/reward, which basically is a set up for failure. i (15) used to be a middle normal BMI weight until i got self conscious and turned to a kinda unhealthy mindset and now im 7 or so pounds underweight (but i dont look like it LOL). this made my other sister (13) start to envy me, asking me how i got so skinny and how she wanted my legs (girl trust me you dont want to be this with all the obsessive calorie counting and stupid aimless worrying) and i think my youngest sister (10) is taking these words and sort of manifesting it into not eating because she ""doesnt feel hungry"". she could also be doing it to be the opposite of my brother (8) who is overweight and has an obvious food problem. since my mother denies this problem, we take it into our own hands to lead him in the right direction (the younger two shame him more than what is appropriate, but its better than letting him eat himself to obesity). i think this all creates food problems for all of us, but i cant help but think i started all of this shit by selfishly wanting to lose a few pounds. it has been a constant effort from my family to get her to eat more, but she just never clears her plate and doesnt eat unless prompted. she doesnt like real food and will really only gets close to finishing sweets. this would be normal if she was like, 5 or so, but shes too old for these behaviors. she uses a lot of self deprecating language like calling herself ugly or fat, and shes honestly VERY attention seeking and in need of validation constantly. we keep trying to nudge her towards healthy habits and warning her of the risks of under eating (kinda ironic coming from me but yknow), but she just gets snappy and annoyed. what more can i do to help this situation in general? am i way overreacting and is this a normal thing that kids do? i just want my family to be happy and i dont want to prevent that.

And he’s claiming hit and run and will be taking things to the cops/Insurance. 

Car went to the collision centre. Reported it and asked for some advice. 
Lady said it wouldn’t be a hit and run because he came in to report it and that he stayed while the truck left. But the truck is now claiming all this stuff. 

And the truck never showed to collision or anything. He said that the cops turned him away.

A little background, I’m 21, getting married in a month. My sister is 29. Her “best friend” is the materialistic two faced type. The instant she opened her mouth, I had a bad vibe. 

But my sister was friends with her and didn’t want to hurt her feelings. I should have but that’s in the past now. 

They planned this trip together to go to Cuba, for a week. (In a week). 
This girl is cynical about love, cynical about marriages. Turned me right off on being friendly. 

But that was my problem. My sisters problem is that she went to a bar a few night ago “without telling” her best friend. And she now keeps telling my sister that she’s not loyal, that her guilt trips won’t work on her anymore. That she’s hungry for attention. 

My sister and I are talking, and she’s telling me that she planned this trip to Cuba with that friend. But she doesn’t know how she can do it now because her friend keeps freaking out on her.

267,"I live in a condo where houses are built with no space in-between. A couple moved next door about more than a month ago, and they've been making lots of noises every day that don't seem reasonable, with a few day exceptions, 

These noises sound like objects hitting the wall (next to mine or another one) or the floor, along with some slammed doors and slammed slideable windows. They often happen since 7:20 AM, through 9 AM, 10 AM, 12, 2 PM, 4 PM... They take place at multiple times of the day, sometimes between 30 mins. or so, 10 mins. 1 hr. etc. This has been going on for about a month, almost continuously.

They sound way too clearly for the “double wall” which is supposed to insulate the other house's sounds, and there was a family living in that place before that didn't make as many noises, so I know this isn't normal. This situation gives me anxiety and it makes me feel uncomfortable to be in my own house, and my room, because these noises can happen at any moment. 

My mom and I thought their noises (frequent knocks, bangs or *blows* against what seems to be our side of the wall, which at times has even made some furniture vibrate a little) were happening because they were still moving in, but it's been more than a month now, and it seems like this is how they live inside their house; which represents an obvious problem.

I've tried being friendly to them all along, in order to not create conflict when I was going to tell them about this (because some people lack the decency to recognize their own faults, and get incredibly upset and even violent). At first I casually exchanged some words with the wife and I gave her a bag of brownies as a way to welcome them: she liked them and was friendly to me. Some days afterwards, I approached her mother, who's been staying with them to help with chores, for another motive and she liked me. The husband is another story, this guy has the looks of an aggressive, selfish person. 

A few days ago, I finally tried telling them about my problem and this guy had been the one to “greet” me inside, after the mother invited me in. I felt intimidated by him and couldn't properly explain my problem; also because he was giving me a facial expression, as I was speaking, **as if** I was giving him the middle finger right in front of him. He just didn't comprehend how I could possibly be hearing these noises, but he visibly contained himself (because he obviously didn't like me saying to him that they were making noises which disturb my activities and comfort), probably because his wife's mother was there. He said that they made all the noises that take place normally inside a house, but that they would be more careful from there on: Well, they don't hear us making all the noises they make, and I continue to hear them.

Some weeks ago, they also had this obnoxious get-together, probably for the World Cup. I could hear them and other people in that house shouting a lot, and they were banging a wall with their hands apparently, and it sounded too much. There was music which played past midnight. It's not the only instance of the guy yelling.

**How should I approach them to make them understand this needs to stop?** How could I make them stop behaving like that? How can I explain this to them without creating conflict? Should I ask my condo's manager for help or another person with more authority? I don't know what to do; I just know that it's not right to keep tolerating this.

268,"tl;dr Brother is trans, mother, though approving, doesn't really acknowledge him as a man, might have detrimental impact on the family and especially my brother's mental health. 

This is going to be a long one. 

My brother is transgender. He came out several years ago. It made sense to me, growing up with him, and having always been very pro-LGBT, being a gay man myself (my family is *very* queer), it didn't take long for me to begin to refer to him as my brother, using his proper name and pronouns. 

He came out to my Mom, who, though she said she'd always love him, and couldn't care less whether he identified as a woman or a man, she refuses to call him by his proper name, at least in his absence. It's been quite some time since he came out that they've met face-to-face due to past tensions, but her rational for not doing so is ""that wasn't the name I gave her"" and ""she will always be my baby girl."" 

My Mom isn't stupid. She was actually born in the deep south in the mountains with no electricity or plumbing. Through dealing with extremely alcoholic and abusive parents, moving numerous times due to evictions, moving up north, and having the State take my Aunts and Uncles not old enough and emancipating her, she escaped childhood trauma through her art, her passion for which began in Elementary School when a teacher, recognizing her talent, gifted her an art kit. In High School, she took *all* the available art credits to the point they basically gave her free reign by herself during art class. My Mom went to college for Human Resources, but dropped out due to the birth of my transgender brother and other issues. She's suffered from what we suspect to be mental trauma for years and though I won't make any excuses, I feel like she's gotten better now; she's mellowed out.

My brother suffered at the hands of a molester in High School, who my Mom was dating. We all loved him, and I don't think any of us would have suspected him of doing something so unforgivable. I was heartbroken. He moved away, out of country. He was like a father figure to me, and after finding out what he'd done, I felt sick. I remember listening to Mom talk to him on the phone, before the truth was revealed, and just standing in the doorway with my hands propped against it crying. I also remember laying awake in our bedroom, listening to them talking about what happened in the living room. They were both traumatized, my brother especially. This event is pertinent because it would prove to have a lasting effect on my mother and brother's relationship.   

Due to other events which I hold my mother to be almost wholly at fault, they don't talk anymore. They have basically no relationship. It hurts me to my core. It hurts my mother to the core. My family on my mother's side is all sorts of fucked up, and I've resolved to ensure that our family never devolves into what my Aunts and Uncles have become: Selfish, alienated from everyone, hardly talking to anyone unless they need something, broken. I'm pretty big on family, at least in principle, and although I don't believe in love by fiat, I feel like we should, ideally, look out for each other. It's pretty lonely without a family, and I feel like it would be better for everyone if we all got along. I cannot force them to, however, and I understand why my brother doesn't hold my mother with high regard, but I know that my mother's refusal to acknowledge him by his preferred pronouns will have a detrimental impact on the family and might cause a familial schism. 

And I know that my brother, suffering from bipolar disorder and PTSD, might go into a mental episode if/when he is ever regarded contrary to his identity, because I feel like, to him, it's rejection, and also, our father really doesn't regard him as a him and ultimately objects to the idea of trans gendered people. (He's a conservative leaning to wingnut who supports the President, if that gives you an idea) 

So I guess I'm seeking advice on how to mitigate the situation. All advice wanted, but please don't ask me to cut anyone off, because honestly, this family is all I have.  ",24Jul2018,0
269,"I'm not sure if people would understand this, but here goes:

I \[23 M\] have always wanted one thing, to have some privacy from my twin brother. He always insisted on being in the same class with me all the way to college (including college). He would follow me around everywhere, do everything I did, he would only make friends with my friends. If we went to parties, he would always follow me around. If I wanted to skip class so that I could walk a girl home (for example) or try to approach girls at parties, he would always be there, next to me, just being awkward. We are very different, he is like a little brother that wants to hang out with his older brother. 

It's pretty hard to explain this, but he was always very awkward and because of that I missed out on a lot of stuff. I blew my first relationship because of his behavior and it was very, very hard for me to approach girls because of this. I had ZERO privacy, all the time, and I couldn't really approach girls, when I had the chance and I'm sure I could have gotten a few. The only times I got close to a few girls were when he wasn't around. It may sound like whining, but I've been having this regret for 10 years now, that amplified over the years, and I'm so mad because I tried so many times to change class, to go to different colleges and so on, but I always let my mother and my brother talk me into going together.

I know that a lot of people wouldn't understand this and I may be judged because of this, but I've been regretting this for so long now, I wish I didn't let my family talk me into this, but now it's too late, I guess. I feel a lot of remorse and I just want to get over it.",24Jul2018,1

My parents are very traditional people, so they won’t invest their money or time into anything related to mental health care. I can kind of understand that because of the enervation GAP, but it’s hard for me to just live like this. I feel like everyday I’m getting worse and worse.

276,"So i'm just trying to make sense of what has been going on recently and i have always found coming on here is the best therapy. I have just recently turned 18 so i am legal to drink from where i am from just as a disclaimer. But recently I have been feeling some type of way about my friendship group, i am friends with 3 people which of whom i will name J,C and R. 

Ages ago me, C and R had fallen out with J since she was a person who was always centre of attention. She had a massive personality but started treating us badly so we took a 'break' away from her and even though that had happened and i was angry with J  i would still speak to her because I felt bad for her and i wouldn't like anyone feeling like they where alone. I had eventually seen a change in J as she had got herself in a job and i had seen a massive maturity and I knew she was sorry for her actions so I had told the other two girls that I was getting bored of this whole thing and that they had enough time to get over it so we should all act like adults and just leave it at what it was. 

Recently, J had been working for long periods of time so it was difficult to see her and I had noticed the other two where consistently meeting each other and I was stuck at home alone. We live on a small island so I do walk a lot and dont have any travel route to the girls. However, R and C both have motor bikes so they are able to meet whenever they like so I am left out quite a bit. I was upset by this and of course sometimes when you're upset you vent those feelings to someone and that wasn't the two girls that where upsetting me. I had recently been away so I hadn't seen the two girls for 2 weeks and when I did it was my birthday and then the next day C's birthday. On C's birthday someone had told them everything I had said but of course with Chinese whispers things got twisted and they confronted me in town.

I was being blamed for b\*\*\*\*ing behind their backs. They had said that I always preach about being straight forward with people however I wasn't and that I had said that after a festival were all going away to that I wanted to completely end the friendship. I however feel that I was not talking behind their back in a bad way so wouldn't consider it as B\*\*\*ing, I have also stopped being straight forward with the girls because I felt like any time I would that i would just be attacked for stating what i felt so I havent in a long time especially as i've matured and felt like unnecessary drama was unneeded, and I also didn't say i WANTED it to end I just said that I felt like it would soon since i cant be bothered for petty drama and i knew i was going to get fed up of being left out of everything. Now I have found out from J that she did mention it to the other two girls how i had been feeling because she said she owed it to me so that the other girls could see where i was coming from and so that it could just be sorted out. 

However, that came with the consequence of R and C being really nasty behind my back. They where laughing at me, making me out to be a stalker because i seen their location on snap maps and thats how I knew they where together but I would never intentionally be a creep but I only did it because on one day plans where meant to be made and I hadn't heard from them so i just looked to see if they where both at their own homes so that I would know that no plans where going to be made but i seen them together instead. I felt like this was very disrespectful and then they started saying that i need to get over it and that they thought with me going away that my attitude would go away and that i would calm down. I then was out with J and R and R kept on being really nasty towards my friends whom they dont know which i found extremely disrespectful since i have been friends with him  for 7 years and it wasn't right and then R just kept on being horrible and snapping at J. 

I, like said before have matured and I know i will be going away with them in August and Im just tired of it all. Im being told left right and centre to just leave them be and but then also to confront them since they did it to me in the middle of town infront of a load of people.

277,"so i feel extremely guilty about something i've done. my sister had an abortion and i was one of her few support systems as our mother is very religious and therefore she didn't tell her. i obviously couldn't talk a whole lot to my sister about it because i'm not that great with words and it was hard for her to speak on, but i did the best i could. i ended up confiding in my best friend about it who would never ever speak on it to anyone and another close friend who i have recently learned isn't a very trustworthy person and likes to chat to others about everyone's drama. i'd like to think she has enough respect to not mention it to other people, but i feel so fucking guilty for having told her about something that wasn't mine to tell and it's killing me inside. even worse, my anxiety is dragging me through the what ifs of if it gets around and somehow got back to my sister or worse, my mom. i didnt have any ill intentions talking about it and did so more to confide in my close friend and in good faith. am i a bad person??? and should i maybe talk to my other friend and emphasize the weight of this situation and reiterate that it shouldn't be spread around? she is pretty understanding in terms of personal circumstances but i just don't trust her enough to believe she wouldn't spill to someone. i'm also anxious at the fact that if i try to distance myself from this friend in the future that she might decide its ok to talk about or even use it against me?? fuck idk my mind is racing..",24Jul2018,1

279,"Hi. So I'm currently long-distance ""dating"" a total drama queen, have been for half a year. Every time she gets upset with something related to me she either blocks me on Twitter or deactivates her account, which is honestly so fucking childish and dramatic. Yesterday would have been the 24th time she's done something like that and I'm honestly tired of it. She'll pretend to want communication, but when nothing goes her way she'll just go back to childish bullshit. I've never met her but have the opportunity to next month, but I have researched her, where she lives etc. She is a real person so I'm not worried about that, I'm just tired of her hardly ever wanting to deal with things in a mature manner. She's also 32 and slept with 61 guys. Hold off on the 'slut' comments because I'm not interested in hearing those. Maybe she's been with so many guys because she can't hold a stable relationship. I'm probably just ranting at this point but I honestly just want some advice. What do you do with a woman who acts this way? I care about her so I don't really want to end things, but at this point it probably wouldn't matter to me. If any of you have been through something similar and have any advice on how the fuck to deal with this, let me know.

282,"Hi, I don’t post on Reddit a lot, but this has been bothering me a lot lately and I’m just very confused. 

So my whole life I’ve wanted to be an animator 2D, 3D either one was fine with me. Up until my senior year in High School where i realized I didn’t have a passion for it, I didn’t take time out to practice it on my own or anything of the sort. I got good at drawing and painting though, but those don’t make very good money especially at the level I’m at.

Now, after Graduating High School and going to State College I don’t know what I want to be. I thought about history teacher since I’ve always been good at it and its my Dad passion, but that kinda fell through for me I’m not into it as much as I thought. I was thinking of a Biology degree so i could become a Park Ranger and thats my best idea so far, but they don’t make much money, plus its hard to get a job there.

I’ve been trying to think of things but every idea always has its downside that is really heavy, and makes it seem like i don’t want to do it for the rest of my life. Not looking for a specific answer to my problem, just some advice on where to go next?",24Jul2018,1

284,"Hello Reddit,
I recently met a man on FetLife. He told me his name was Jim.  I have a spanking fetish and sometimes it can be difficult to meet partners through normal channels. He seemed to be everything I ever wanted. He claimed to be 39, divorced, with two adopted children from Guatemala. When I told him I wanted to be a foster parent, he said he did too. He told me he was “Spiritual non-religious” and even joined me in my nightly prayer and morning meditation when we slept together. I told him I’d always wanted to live in a Spanish-speaking country for a year to become fluent and be of service. He told me that he had done so and was already fluent. He was literally everything I could ever dream up. 

I found out his real name because he accidentally introduced himself in front of me by it to someone else.   I asked him about it and he said that when his dad died, he decided to change his name to his Grandfather’s name (Jim), also he used a fake name on Fetish sites. I could excuse that, because that’s fairly common. Then he took a work call and I overheard the name of the company he worked for. SO I looked on LinkedIn. I found the company and I found his real last name. After a little googling, I found out that he is a conservative church’s lead pastor. He’s still married. He lived in Mexico for a year because he and his wife did a mission trip together with their kids. His wife seems like a lovely woman tbh.

I texted him a link to the page and said “So you’re still married?” And he said “Not for much longer” 🙄🤢

I stated that it’s really nice that he had a PhD proving his Godliness, but I am going to work on developing a real relationship with a higher power and pray for him and his family and I told him to get help because they deserve better. I also gave him a link to an article about “Rape by deception” and wrote WWJD underneath it. 

I am feeling very powerless. 

All of a sudden Barney’s character on How I Met Your Mother seems a heck of a lot more sinister than I had bothered to consider previously. 

I feel used, taken advantage of, and violated. 

I’m not sure what to do next. I don’t want to out him, I feel like staying mad at him will just poison myself and he’s doing a bang of job of destroying his life without my help. I also don’t want to get tangled up in that drama. 

I just don’t know how to trust. 
My last ex was emotionally manipulative, the one before cheated on me, the one two before that told my I needed a boob job and then left me. 

I need some words of wisdom about how to forgive, how to move on, and how to trust again. 

TL;DR I slept with a man and later found out he's a married pastor. How do I trust again?",24Jul2018,1

They are both 52, and I feel like time is running out, im trying really hard to make something great out of myself.

I think my Mom and Dad are slowly becoming more depressed, I really dont know what to do, what to say.

To be honest, I am afraid one of them gonna kill them self, I think its a lot they dont want to tell me, to keep me happy..

I just want to help in anyway I can, I have already asked if it is money, and if I can join the family in sharing or paying the bills but they wont let me. 

I already asked if there is anything I can do or anything they need help with. 

I just feel so useless and so out of time, I think about them all the time, I cant even do my own work properly cause they are always back of my mind, I almost cry every night just because I cant think of a solution.. 

I think it started, when I wanted to study 3D and Animation to be an artist for games, which they dont quite get.

After I finished that study I am looking for teams, or trying to work on myself and my portofolio, while I work as a retailer. 

Right now I applied for engineering something my Dad really wanted me to do, just to see if that helps them to be happy.. hopefully. 

Aswell when I was a kid, I was disrespectful I shouted, and cried for stuff. There have been many times recently I might have been rude out of frustration of general stuff, without me thinking that they are getting old, they forget stuff, they try...but I remember my dad said he was just the same when he was a kid, and know that I am 22 I finally get it..

293,"2 years ago, I walked out on my fast food job that I had been working at for 7 months. It was my first job after high school and I did a lot of hard work for them. I quit because I was being harassed by the managers and my coworkers, and many times I was expected to clock out of my shift early and finish doing certain tasks because I was going to risk getting overtime. Lots of times this wasn't even my fault as the person for the night shift would arrive late or they would schedule them at 4:00 which means if I was clocked in until 4:00 I would get overtime. I had to rush every day just to get out of there and get paid my full wage. The managers and staff called me a horrible nickname that made fun of my anxiety, and I went along with it because I wanted to fit in and not start problems.. But over time it really started to get under my skin because it was incessant. I got into arguments with my coworkers, one time I dropped a lot of food I was supposed to make on the ground and my coworker laughed at me and took a picture. My coworkers would constantly point out ""mistakes"" that I made, yet purposefully do things the wrong way to save time. If I said that they were doing it the wrong way they said ""Don't be a snitch"" or else and threatened me with vague threats.

I don't think I deserved this, I tried to be a good employee and I constantly covered for people's shifts when we were short-staffed even though I did not have to. Sometimes if I did not want to cover for a shift, my managers would ask me the next day where I was and what I was doing, what was so important that I could not come in. It made me so upset. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I got sick one day and I had to call out in the morning. At first my asshole manager got really upset and said ""How could you do this to us? You know how bad we need you today"" (they said this all the time) and then I told him I was throwing up, he was probably pissed so later he texted me back ""Then you have to take the day off"" because that's the rule when you work with food. I was only sick for a day, but they make you take 3 days off from work, and then they did not schedule me for a few days after I was getting better. They made me bring in a doctor's note and said that if I didn't bring the note there would be problems. When I came back, things were weird and different, people had been leaving before that to work at a different store, and they were starting to become significantly understaffed. I was asked to interview someone and I asked him a couple questions, but I couldn't come up with a lot so I left it up to my other coworker, and then my manager got upset with my for not coming up with enough questions. People were angry, and our new food prep guy was late one day and my manager FLIPPED OUT, he started to slam pots and pans into their places and look at anyone who glanced in his direction with a look of murder. He yelled out in stress and was like ""I'M GONNA FIRE THIS FUCKING IDIOT"" in the middle of everyone but I kind of felt bad for that guy because the job he took on was really stressful and they put a lot of pressure on him right off the bat. The dude did not even have a care, and he eventually showed up. I was starting to get really scared of the possibility that someone where I was working might want to hurt me, it could have just been my anxiety but I got into multiple verbal altercations with people and I was being harassed, I was also threatened a few times. I was so weak and non-assertive back then that I felt like I should just deal with this, I really needed the money and I didn't have much other prospects going on so I stuck it out for the 7 months of all this. A few days before I quit, one of my coworkers even put a ""kick me"" sign on my back, and I walked into the adjacent store to get a drink and one of the girls working there saw it and took it off me, showing me. She said: ""They're such assholes over there!"" and the first thing I wanted to say was ""Nah, they're just messing with me they do it all the time, it's funny!"" but I was really mad. I mentioned it to the manager like it was funny and she was laughing at me like ""Oh? I don't know who put it there"" (she was a bitch). How I quit was one day during rush I was late opening the store because we had a big catering order, and my manager wanted me to take my break, I told him I should skip it because we were already in rush and he was like ""Are you sure?"" and I said yes I just wanted to look good to them because I was worried about my job. That was a really bad day, I was so hungry and I just had to stay there, and then when I asked for a drink of water that same manager was like ""Really BisexualStoner? You know you can't leave during rush."" So I was like okay I will be fine.. Then a few minutes later she said ""Do it real quick"" and I went into the back and I got in trouble because of when I called out to the prep guy to make the food, I said he needed to make rice but I guess he had a full pan of it in the back and he was telling me about it but I didn't pay attention. He got all mad at me but didn't harass me because he was one of the nicer coworkers, I just felt really bad for disappointing him. At this point I felt like every one of my coworkers despised me. My lips were so chapped and dry, I had blisters on them because of standing in the heat talking and not getting water after that. I finally got my break and my thoughts started focusing on one thing.. Leaving. I just wanted to go, I knew some people had done it before, gone out on their breaks and just did not return. I did not eat anything and I went out into my car and started crying, I looked like a monster. I had deep dark bags under my eyes and my lips were covered in blisters from dryness (this has never happened to me before or since then). I kept crying through most of the 10 minutes of my break and then I just started driving, at first I wanted food but then I wanted to be away, I knew that my mom and her boyfriend were going to be so angry with me for quitting and they were. Thus began a really bad period of time in my family until I got another job. I did realize how much better I felt not having to work there almost instantaneously, though. I was really lost and I did not even know what kind of job I was going to do, but it was good to be out of there. Even when I worked my next job in retail which wasn't the greatest, my coworkers did not outright harass me in front of customers, or call me in to cover shifts every other week (though it did happen occasionally). I even was a cashier, which was something I struggled to do at my first job because I felt like there was a lot of pressure and it was more involved because you had to count your own drawer and all this stuff.

Anyway, thoughts about that job come up often and they make me feel really upset. I do not like thinking about that time in my life. When I walked out, I never returned, even though my manager texted me and told me he would write my last paycheck. It might be something like $150 which would definitely help me out. It's been 2 years though, and they sent me a letter after the fact letting me know that they terminated me because I did not show up for work around that time. To be honest, I have only been in there one other time since then and thankfully did not have to talk to anyone I knew, lots of people quit or got fired around the same time I did. I just don't want to sit in that small little office for however many times I have to, and the owner is very vindictive and might try to drag out the process.",24Jul2018,3
294,"I turn it over and over in my head several times a day: if you aren't moving to a new place for a job or to be with someone, how do you pick a new place to live?

Some background:

My husband and I have been working towards a full-time, mobile living and traveling lifestyle for years now. We finally left the midwest a few months ago and have since been enjoying life on the west coast. Secondary goals to traveling to see amazing places are to gather information and experiences on where we want to live. This mobile lifestyle is great right now but in the next year we hope to have found a place we want to buy land/house to start a family and new life. 

There is nothing *wrong* with the midwest; people are friendly, prices are doable, we have connections and history there. But there's also my family which is very triggering (me having kids will surely make this worse). We both work for ourselves so we don't *need* to be there.

**The big debate about moving from the midwest is trying to find a place we like more; this includes:**

• Less severe weather, mild winters and summers (less humidity) • Mid-level city with diversity • Dog friendly

Most of our big decisions come from a place of, ""why not now?"" ...Why not live tiny? Why not go mobile? Why not move across the country?

**So far, we've considered Albuquerque (hot but not humid) and Oregon. Concerns:**

• If we move to a new place, how badly will I miss our old community (plenty of great acquaintances, a few best friends, tolerable family)?

• Can I (someone with depression) live in Oregon where it rains a lot with little sunshine? 

So Reddit, with all this in mind, where do you live? Would you recommend it? What would propel you to look for greener grass? ",24Jul2018,2

297,"I'm not entirely sure how to start describing this, I guess at the beginning would be good. There are a lot of potential hobbies I would like to do like drawing, writing and making music, just to name a few. But more often than not I can't because some kind of ulterior motive creeps into my mind. This ulterior motive makes me question why I want to do what I want to do, just to get to the conclusion that it's not worth it.

Let's use drawing as an example. I want to draw because I'd like to express my thoughts, simply as a creative outlet. But then I think I should become really good at this, so I can make money with it. And suddenly it's no longer about being creative, it's about becoming good enough to make money. But becoming even decent at drawing takes years to achieve. It's a marathon, I know that. But because I can't become good quick enough, I'm getting discouraged. Comparing myself to other people takes place, I feel insecure, ask myself: *""What for?""* and stop drawing altogether.

Game development was a hobby of mine (got burned after trying it professionally). Lately, I've been having the urge to make something again. I wanted to start out with some level design and pretty much instantly had doubts and wondered why I should even try. *""Nothing that I create would be used anywhere. So it's just wasted, right?""* And even if I do manage to find a reason, it's a bad one. *""I could sell what I make on the marketplace""* (Unreal Engine 4) followed by *""I lack experience and other people have probably done a better job at creating whatever I think of.""* Instead of just doing something I instantly question myself, fall back on a bad reason which just ends in discouragement and disappointment.

I remember my youth when I would just dabble in whatever for the fun of it. Following some Photoshop tutorial to create planets, suns and space scenes? Sure why not, sounds fun! Nowadays, I would ask myself: *""What for?""* and not do it. Back then I would create some stupid little Flash animations for no reason (horrendous quality) but I enjoyed myself, and I didn't care if anyone would ever see it. I created landscape scenes in Terragen, built maps for Half-Life/Half-Life 2 (and any mods that come to mind) without ever having a chance of any of those ending up on a server. But I still did it. For fun. No ulterior motive. No *""I could use this to make money""* or *""I do this so I can show it to people""*. I just explored and did these activities for fun and for myself.

I want that back. I want to do stuff for fun, for curiosity and enjoyment and no ulterior motive, and no questioning *""What for?""*. How do I do that?",24Jul2018,1
298,"I didn’t really know what to tag this as because it’s got a lot of layers, but here we go.

August of 2017, I relocated from the suburbs of Chicago to Nova Scotia. I did so knowing fully that, because of the distance, I was moving away from my family (who I am very close to) and would, as a result, miss out on a lot of things.

I got hired on for a contract position which does not give vacation time, but rather 4% pay increase in lieu of vacation. The business gives everyone two weeks off for Christmas, so the vacation wasn’t a big deal to me. Fast forward to April. I take a week of unpaid/mixed with overtime to be able to go home for my younger sibling’s college graduation, and then spend a week with my family at home. Total of 6 work days off.

Now, I’m torn. Because of my job’s vacation policy (or lack-thereof) I was unable to attend my sister’s wedding. In the company’s defense, my sister changed her wedding date and gave me two week’s notice, making it near impossible to attend. I was assured by my family that she would be holding a reception separately, at a time that I was planning to be home, as the job’s contract was supposed to be terminated.

Contract was extended, and now I’m faced with a choice. Every year, I go on a fishing trip with my dad, my uncles, and both of my grandfathers (each 90+ years old). I’m scared that, if I am not able to come home, I may not get another one of those trips solely due to their age, and the likelihood of the resort we frequent being shut down, as the owners are phasing out.

Additionally, I won’t be able to attend my sister’s wedding reception, which I’m already broken up over the fact I missed her wedding.

Moving to Canada was costly, and as a result, my savings is depleted from about 5 months pay savings to about 2 months pay.

So, my choice is essentially this:

Find a new job in the next few weeks and quit this job.

Quit this job and go home and go on the trip, and move back here blindly, with no work, and just figure it out/potentially liquidate my savings.

Don’t go, stay in my job.

I have weighed all of the options over and over again but I really need some help.

We live in a laxed gun law state so its actually pretty scary, considering hes put a gun to his sisters head (police report we were able to obtain for court purposes)  Ive called cops and nothing ever seems to change, just results in us being in and out of court with an injunction against him. Now last night after police being called due to him taking photos of my family. He had his friend/neighbour texting my number (we have a fsbo sign in front of the house and we saw him staggering to the sign to take the number and stagger away) at late hours pretending to be a potential buyer, asking weird questions about the house. We know it's just to gain information on whats going on in with our house, since one of the police calls resulted in the police telling us that our harrassing neighbour doesnt think we are really moving. I would love advice on how to deal with all of this, or what actions to take, because at this point im not sure what to do. ",24Jul2018,1
301,"I feel like I hate my ex-best-friend/crush because if I didn't, I know I'd love her.  I now feel like I was too clingy and I read too much into those misleading things she said. I now don't know whether I hate her or if I hate myself. I keep blaming myself and I don't know why. I feel like I could have done something more, but also feel like I tried too much. I cant help but feel like I'm being dramatic, but I cant stop hurting.

**Any tips to find a way to move on? How can I understand what I feel?**

Below is some context, in case you're curious.

Context: I used to have really strong positive feelings for my best friend. I think I loved her. After 5 years of friendship, I started realizing that she was saying some oddly flirty things to me and then immediately denying it. She kept doing things things that made everyone blame me and overall, I think she had a pretty negative impact in my life. I started feeling caged up, not knowing where to go, because in my head I still really loved her and admired her. One day, I decided to tell her I had feelings for her. She pretended to act O.K. with it but after a few days, she blocked me on all social media and refused to talk to me in person. That's when I started hating her, because I considered that instead of her pretended to be O.K. with it before, she should have told me the truth.   
I realized the perfect vision I had made up in my head of her was probably not true. I got really depressed because I kept vying for the feelings that I felt when I was around her. I wanted to find a person to fill the void. This went on for 2 years. I was still terribly depressed. 

My therapist told me that if she really cared about me she wouldn't have blocked me out like that and that I should just move on. That answer wasn't good enough for me because I wanted to believe there was a better reason for her just shutting me out. **This is where I messed up.** I started searching for ways to talk to her. When she finally responded,  she acted like we where still best friends and just said ""You're an amazing friend. I was stupid"". It seemed sketchy to me. It sounded like a response she made just to shut me up and move on. She then proceeded to tell me I was a hypocrite for wanting her to be nice to me when all I had done was be mean to her. She told me I didn't have the right to tell her she was misleading and made me fell down sometimes. I didn't know how to respond. Since then I've been feeling more hate, yet I cant get her out of my head. I miss her terribly. ",24Jul2018,1
302,"## This post is going to be a lot of backstory on what I feel, what I've gone through and what my issues are. My question is how should I move on from here? Who should I go to? Am I alone in feeling this way? Any advice is appreciated. So here we go.

I don't know where to start. I've been avoiding talking about it or writing it down, because it makes me immediately sobb and I'm not sure why. I don't like being that emotional girl who can't stop crying and I find it hard to even put into words what I'm feeling. So I keep on pushing it down, but it won't stop resurfacing. So here's my first attempt at tackling this battle i've faced my whole life.

It started in grade school. I grew up in a small town with a class at around 50. I lived out in the country, so if I wasn't at school or dropped off at a friends house, I was alone. My brother and I didn't hang out too much, so I found myself alone in my bedroom most of the time. Don't get me wrong. I had friends, but I didn't have a ""best friend"". I always wanted that. My ""best friend"" had other friends that she would hang out with more and I was often chosen second. I would have given anything to be someone's number 1. I constantly searched for that. I made friend after friend, calling them my best friends and then being let down. This extended into middle school. One day a new girl arrived at school and I was excited. We ended up being best friends and hanging out all the time. This went on for a year or so and one day out of nowhere, she decided she didn't want to be friends with me anymore. She never liked me, I tried way too hard and was fake (apparently). Another blow. This was freshman year of high school.

From an outside perspective, I seemed popular. I would hang out with people and did have friends, but I felt alone. I hung out with different people every week, making lists in my journal of who my new best friend would be. It was pathetic. Not sure where my obsession with having a best friend was, but I think I just wanted to be someone's number 1. I wanted someone I could always go to. One that would drop something important and drive an hour to come see me. Not that you could this young, but you get the point.

Then Myspace came along. Through Myspace I had met a girl from another small town not far from me. She introduced me to her friends and a new journey started. Me and these friends laugh about it now, but when I first started being friends with them, we all had lunch and they sat me down and had a discussion on whether or not I could be apart of their friend group. Like an interview. Stupid, but I digress. I ended up transferring schools and hung out with this group of people. They were more like me. We shared the same interests and we had a lot of fun hanging out. But still, there was this distance. I wasn't number 1 to any of them. I always drove to go see them, but whenever I wanted to do it at my house, they would complain about the 15 minute drive. I've always been the person, to change around my schedule or to inconvenience myself, in order to make someone else happy. I wish for once people would do the same for me. This was high school. I had what I would consider my best friend but again she had her sister and many others that she would hang out with.

Let's fast forward to college. Same shit, different day. I had friends I really liked, but they all had that one other person they preferred more. Great. Then I met my ex. He fell head over heels instantly. He always reached out, paid for flights for me to come see him every month, the whole nine yards. It felt really good, and in that time, I fell for him too. 7 months in, he proposed, and I moved to a different state. I was happy and hopeful. I should have noticed the signs when I moved to be with him, but I was too young and stupid to realize what was happening. We got married, and it was horrible from the start. I don't want to go into much detail because, well I don't like talking about it. But we would have horrible arguments over stupid shit. He would refuse to stop touching me when I asked, but it was just tickling and friendly wrestling right? He didn't care about my feelings, when I cried he wouldn't batt an eye. He made me go crazy. He was very into traditional marriage, so he called the shots. Within a month, he decided we were going to move away from my home into his home state, with a 1 week window for saying goodbye. So I moved to this different state, and I had never been more alone. But I wanted to be a good wife. I was very religious at the time (divorce wasn't an option), and convinced that any problem I had in this relationship was me over reacting. This went on for years. We moved so often that I was never really able to hold a friendship, then we finally stayed in a city for more than a year. I started a job, and made friends there.

There was one girl there that I got really close to. We really were best friends. She had never had one either, so she really appreciated everything I did for her, and she did the same. I knew she wasn't a great person, but that didn't matter. She did drugs, cheated, all of that. But best friends help each other with that shit right? Months pass, and we are inseparable. But then things started getting weird. The texts grew smaller, the excuses became more consistent and we weren't hanging out very much at all. I was going through a really tough time with my horrible marriage and needed a friend more than ever. I texted her telling her everything and saying that I really needed a friend right now. She pretty much told me that she couldn't help me. Great. Now I'm really alone. She contacts me 6 months later saying sorry and that it was her boyfriend that made her stop hanging out with me. Whatever, I don't deal with that shit, we were no longer friends and it was staying that way. I'd rather be alone that with someone horrible.

I finally got the nerve to end things with my husband. I met a new guy at work and our relationship started immediately. I know I should have had time for myself and to be single, but I couldn't let this one go. He was the one and I knew it. I'm still with him to this day, but we will get to him later. At this time, I had another friend. She was the girl I went to for everything. She was good at that, but at the same time there was something off about her. The problems she had with other people, and the way she overreacted to everything and got mad for no reason. I brushed it off at the time, but it didn't take long until I realized she was crazy. This friendship ended bad, but like I said before, I don't deal with that shit, and she was no longer my friend.

Now here I was with an amazing boyfriend, who I would definitely consider my best friend, and a few girlfriends. Life was good. I was happy. I got really close to this girl, and she really was a great friend and someone I loved hanging out with, and then about a month ago, she announced that she was moving away. This is when things started to resurface. I would say that it all boils down to bad timing. I find out my best friend is moving away, my other friend has a boyfriend and a kid, so I barely see her, and I find myself just hanging with my boyfriend. No problem, he really is my best friend, and he treats me right and I see a future. However, whenever we fight (which isn't very often) I find myself alone again. I live far away from all of my family, and I don't really have many friends. It hurts and it's hard.

So that's the context. Sorry for the life story, but honestly it feels good to write it all out.

Let's move onto current day. My boyfriend just started his own business and this is a really crucial time. He has the opportunity of a lifetime and these last few weeks are make or break it. As a good girlfriend, I want to be there for him. I am there for him. I've been helping in anyway I can, and have dedicated entire weekends. He's very thankful, and has been telling me so. However, he's unable to be there for me. He's working 14 hour days and has his mind completely occupied, like he should. This is his future and I understand that he needs to focus on that, but it couldn't have come at a worse time. Honestly, I need someone right now. I want to talk it out with him, but theres literally no time for that and I don't want to spend his little free time, weighing him down with my problems. In a week he's going to have his free time back. I wanted to just wait it out, but last night, it came to a head. I was looking forward to spending time with him last night. I really really really needed it. But when he came home after a stressful day, I decided to bring up something that bothered me that happened with him and I. Bad decision. With all the stress he's been enduring, he couldn't handle it, and freaked out. I'm not going to justify his actions, but I can't imagine what he's going through. 4 hours of sleep, actual hard labor, and all of the pressure to do everything perfectly. He really does have the opportunity of a lifetime and he doesn't want to mess this up. So anyways. I didn't get the night I needed. It ended alright, he apologized, let go of his anger, and we ended up watching a movie and going to bed. Honestly, I really needed him when we were laying in bed. I wanted to talk through everything, cry in his arms, and get it off my chest. But he was already exhausted and was going to get 4 hours of sleep, so I decided to tell him that I was fine and went to sleep. But laying there and thinking about everything, I couldn't help but cry. I didn't want to disturb him so I went to the bathroom and cried my heart out. I did this for about 15 minutes and came back to bed. Within 10 seconds he turned around and just hugged me tightly for a long time. We didn't speak, he just held me. I definitely wasn't expecting it, but I definitely needed it. He left early this morning for work. I woke up with sadness. My face is puffy, and at any moment I could just cry. He can't really text, so I probably won't see him until late tonight. I'm not sure how tonight will go down and I'm not sure how long I can hold off talking to him, since I literally can't hold back the emotion. So that's the story.

I don't know where to start. I've been avoiding talking about it or writing it down, because it makes me immediately sobb and I'm not sure why. I don't like being that emotional girl who can't stop crying and I find it hard to even put into words what I'm feeling. So I keep on pushing it down, but it won't stop resurfacing.

I wasn't sure how to format this post, so I just wanted to write down some random thoughts about this whole thing.

\-I have lived out of state for about 5 years now, and only 1 friend from home has ever visited me. She wasn't even that close to me, she's just a nice person that likes to travel. My best friend from home has never visited me. That really sticks with me. She has always considered me an amazing friend and tells me that I am unlike her other friends and that she appreciates how kind I am. But still no visits. I know she's bad financially, but still. She's visited her other friend twice, and one of our mutual friends when she moved away for college. But never me.

\-My mind goes in between, I am so alone, I don't have any good friends, to I do have people that love me and I'm lucky. I tell myself that everyone deals with this. When you become an adult, everyone has their own life and friendships are not as close. I'm not sure what's true, but I don't want to live in a world where I don't have a close friend.

\-People say that you need to love yourself and be okay with being alone before you can truly love someone or to be happy. But I do love myself. For God's sakes I live far away from all of my family. I do enjoy being alone sometimes. I can have a night to myself without feeling the need to hang out with somebody. But I don't think people were mean't to live alone.

\- My friends brought up the fact that I seem to move on quickly from people. Like my ex, I was able to get a divorce and be okay about it. When my friend went crazy and we stopped being friends abruptly, I was able to just move on. They say it seems to contradict my personality because I'm a very nice person and get along with everybody. But I think I've just gotten good at moving on. I've had to. When one friendship doesn't work you move onto the next. I don't know. But for some people, it comes off as cold-hearted. I'm trying to figure out who I am. Am I cold-hearted? Or am I used to disappointment. I just want people to love me, so when one doesn't, I look for other people to.

Please let me know that I'm not alone. Getting this off my chest has been therapeutic enough, but I would love any advice you guys have. Thank you for listening.

TL;DR My whole life I've dealt with being 2nd place. I was never anybody's best friend. When I did find a ""best friend"" something always happened. This has lead to me being insecure and lonely. One thing lead to another and here I am, with my best friend moving away. I have an amazing boyfriend, however right now, I really really need somebody to talk to about my issues and I need to feel loved. However he's starting his own business and is in a very crucial time so he's unable to be there for me. Now I really feel alone because I live away from all of my family. What should I do and how should I move on from here. I suck at TL;DR's.",24Jul2018,1
303,Hello guys am gaving some problem i would like to talk to someone,24Jul2018,1
304,"Well, I realized that I am not capable to feel love to anyone. I don't know where to start and I feel lost right now. Should I go to see doctor? or psychologist? Or is it even real, am I just very confused? 

I realized that all my relationships with people are all about fun, nothing more. I don't speak to people because I miss them. I have never felt such emotions. I always feel like people I am friends with don't really like me and always could stop chatting with me. I don't know why, but I never had good friendship with anyone. I just talk with people because they find me fun to talk with, same goes for me. 

I never had girlfriend (I am a guy, 22). I think that I am average looking. Not attractive one but also not ugly, I guess. I had crush on some girls, but when I think about them there were nothing special about those girls and I was somehow obsessed with image in my mind, so as I realized they were different from my perception I felt indifferent. 

I don't really feel anything towards my family. Yeah, I appreciate that I have decent family. I am grateful to what they did for me. So I try to spend time with family. But I have never called them because I wanted to. I did it because it would be not normal if I will not call them sometimes. Majority of times the family reunion happens because of my parent initiative. I just say yes. It is normal for me to speak with my dad for 5 minutes on phone in a month. Nothing more. 

After thinking about this, I somehow felt like that something is wrong. Why other people can easily go and hang out with each other and want to see each other after? Why they miss each other? Or what makes them feel like they want to hug each other? I always envied my friends who could easily hug other people. I thought the difference between us is that I may be shy, but after I tried to do what they do I didn't feel anything. That is not me. 

I can easily go somewhere alone like restaurants or movies. And I go out with other guys just because of thought that it could be fun, but never because they are dear to me or something like that. I think I don't have anyone dear. I have never felt lonely. I pretty much enjoy my company. I always have what to do while alone. 

For a long time I was thinking about being alone for the rest of my life and I wanted to change it. However, it seems that I can't, even if I would like to. I don't feel that anyone is any special. Everyone else seems to be good on their own way, Therefore I just don't have favorite people. Not only people, but also animals, food (I can easily eat anything, and pretty much enjoy any food, therefore I always experiment with new food),games, books, movies. I just made agreement with myself on things that I consider as ""favorite"",so I won't look weird if someone asks. 

I was talking with other guys and friends on how they could describe love. The things they described sounds very vague. All this year I thought that my understanding of love is normal, but after what people say I feel alienated. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know what to think about. I could not find anything relevant on the Internet and I would avoid making self diagnose. I would be happy to hear any suggestions. 

TLDR: I doubt that I capable to love anyone and don't know how to verify it or whom to ask. I don't know what to do ",24Jul2018,1
305,"Some background: We're moving out of an apartment and my Dad is in a rehab center doing physical therapy because he had 3 ""mini strokes"", the doctors called it, he can't move his left arm or leg... he's making progress though :) I don't live at home anymore but I came back to see my Dad and to help out.
Story: My relatives on my Dad's side want to help but I'm getting SO SICK of being told what to do and when. We aren't moving for another 2 weeks at best and all we've been doing since I got here is pack. We're moving from an apartment to a house and this is actually my last day here. I would like to have a nice meal out with my sister and my mom at least one last time because I don't come back till December and my aunt texts me the usual ""any progress?"" And tells me she's been trying to contact my mom but has gotten no answer... I wonder why *sarcasm*.... And so she tells me to ask my mom where she is and what she's doing because they want to come RIGHT NOW to pack. I mean, not even asking us. SAYING we're gonna be there at 11am... Like no woman. No. I told her we're going out to eat. She said someone should go get the food, bring it back, eat and keep packing. And I wanted to send her this... ""They are LITERALLY moving next month, in a week at the soonest and they dont even have the keys to the new place. Not sure why you want to be in charge of all of this when its THEM moving. I know you want to help because you love us and we love you too, you have helped us a lot and we appreciate it so much, but we want to do what WE want to do and I know its gonna be a shitstorm once you see this but I'm going to have a nice meal out with my family on my last day here. Thank you.
Bye""

What I mean by that my parents don't normally help; for example when I go through a low mood I ask my mum for help or comfort she normally leaves the room (because of being tired) sometimes she can stay in the room and can help but it rarely happens and it makes me feel like I am not a normal person therefore I should not be treated as one as well as feeling stressed.
On the other hand my dad it is hard to talk to him without getting him angry. Sometimes he can appear calm while other times he can be angry which is hard to form a stable relationship with him. For example I recently wanted to go sleepover with friend but considering it was sorta far away(30 mins away) he gotten angry because of the distance and lashed out on me shouting at me that I am not sleepover. Arguments normally end him criticizing me and comparing me to my older brother or him shouting insults at me. I do tell my mum about this issue but the problem is she is a busy person so she

307," First off, SORRY THIS IS SO LONG BUT I NEED TO GET THIS OFF MY CHEST. Ok let me break it down for y'all so you can please help me understand the mindset of this 26 year old male that I expressed interest in. My former co-worker introduced us to one another via Instagram couple months back. We would chat every now and then on Instagram. He was very forward in how he was possibly interested in hooking up and I figured ok this guy is cute lets see what happens. Back in April, I met him. We met with our friends around us. Him and I ended up going for a walk and I thought I would make a move on him. He kinda rejected me which left me very confused because he was so brazen and upfront about how he wanted to possibly hook up when we met. Anyway, once my friends left and it was just him and I, we went into his car and went for a drive. He seemed chill during the car ride. He ended up parking in a vacant parking lot. It was then when he pulled me close to him. I told him to kiss me. We kissed and ended up in the back seat on his car. We did not have sex but we were foolin around a bit. During us fooling around, he came paranoid that people might be watching us. I told him to not worry about it and to relax. He was very distracted and could not loosen up. After awhile he moved back in the front seat and we drove off. This is where things got really weird. His mood went from 0 to 100 within seconds. He became increasingly agitated while driving and seemed upset with me that I did not know where he was going. I kept thinking to myself what the hell happened? We were just chillin then all of a sudden he got super upset and angry. The whole car ride home he barely spoke to me. When we got to my place, I offered to give him a kiss goodnight. He rejected the kiss and said ""No I dont want to cuz I dont feel like it"". I did not say anything, got out of his car and went inside my house. I texted my friend right afterwards and told her I dont know what the hell his problem is and that something maybe seriously wrong with him. That weekend, it really bothered me that things ended up like that so that Monday I texted him a very friendly mature message basically stating that things were off that night and I would understand if he did not want to speak to me anymore but wanted to offer my friendship to him if he wants it. He wrote back thanking me for that and said at this point, its best we just be friends. After that we did not speak for awhile. It was just weird. I kept telling myself I would reach out to him soon but never could. His moods were so off I didnt know what I was going to get. Fast forward to a little over a month ago and my coworker who set us up told me that he was looking for a job. I told her to have him get at me and I could help him find something since I do have some connections. Couple days later I hear back from him stating that he needs my help looking for work. I asked him how he was doin and then asked if he had a resume I could look at. He did not reply back. Fast forward to a week or so after that, my coworker had a show that she was performing at so I went to her show that night. I knew he was going to be there because she told me beforehand that he was there. I walked in and did not see him so I went to the bar. My coworker told me that she told him I was there. After I get my drink I go to my coworker and I feel a tap on my shoulder. It was him and he let out a loud ""whats up!"" to me. I gave him a hug and asked how he was doin. I promised myself I was completely going to friendzone this guy all night. He seemed excited to see me. Throughout the night, he was making his rounds all over the club. I would see him talk to other girls but didnt think of it. He always ended up around me again. He was being flirty but I wasnt taking it serious. He was even telling me things that had a sexual innuendo to them but again I brushed them off. Later that night, I went outside the club and chilled for a bit. My ears could not take anymore loud obnoxious music. He comes out 20 minutes later and basically chills with me throughout the remainder of the night. My college friend who happened to have been at the party asked me if he was my boyfriend. I said no. She said that she thinks he is into me. I brushed it off and told her I highly doubt that. He asked me what I was doing for the rest of the night. I told him I had no plans and wasnt really tired nor did I want to go home. He asked if he could take a lyft with me. I said fine. We took the lyft to his place. When we got out of the car we were walkin to the house he was stayin at and while I was talkin he pulls me in and kisses me so passionately. I fell for it. I kissed him back. I liked him and wanted him so bad I couldnt help myself. I told him that I liked him. After the kiss and since he told me that he shares a room, we went back into his car and fooled around. Again no sex but I did end up giving him a handjob. This time us fooling around wasnt so weird. I actually enjoyed it and he seemed more calm and relaxed. He drove me home afterwards and we were talkin and having good conversations about what we wanted out of a relationship. While we were in the car, I told him that when I texted him a couple months back saying I meant when I said I was open to being his friend he said that it would be nice to have a friend in the city (he is not from the city I am and is it relatively new here) When we got to my place I told him to have a good night. We did not kiss goodnight. I was afraid he was going to say no again. After that, I texted him a couple days later because he was traveling to another city for a job interview. I asked him how things were goin and we had a casual conversation about it. The 2nd time we spoke I asked him what his plans were for July 4th. He said he might be coming back into town. I told him I had movie tickets and asked if he wanted to go see a movie. He said sure and will hit me up when he comes into town. The 4th rolls around. I dont hear from him. I kept telling myself please dont have him ditch me. That evening, I texted him stating that I was sorry we missed the movie and hope everything is okay. He never responded back. Cut to an hour later after I text him that he posts an instagram story saying that he was in the same town I was just chillin and showed video of his friend. I could not believe it. I could not believe he had to nerve to post and saying that knowing that I could watch it. I was upset. An hour after he posted the video, he deleted it. I wonder if he knew he gor caught. He viewed my instagram story which he NEVER used to do that same day. Ever since then he has watched my instagram stories, which I thought was telling because he started watching them after he ghosted me. We have not spoken since, Yesterday, I found out he unfollowed me on Instagram. I just dont get it. Is it something I did? Is he not interested even in being my friend? This guy is so confusing and hard to read I cannot figure it out. Please help! I would love to hear a guys opinion on this! ",24Jul2018,2

I have had an OK relationship with them thus far, but last night I had a panic attack and it got kind of ugly. (Lots of crying, hair pulling, etc.) They called EMS on me, and I don’t really feel as though it was the right thing to do but I know they felt they were helping. The hospital let me go and I walked back through the city at night alone. When I got back to my room, my roommate was sleeping in someone else’s room because she was scared of what had happened. This morning, I tried to say I was sorry and received a rather curt response of “We don’t want to talk about it.” I got it, I just couldn’t contain myself from crying because I had been through something traumatic too, and no one wanted to know how I was doing. Today they texted me (they’re talking as a group) and said they don’t feel comfortable anymore in the room and that they need time to process what happened. Also that they can’t take care of me. I don’t want to be taken care of. Anyway, I have called an RA to mediate the conversation tomorrow, but I don’t know if it will help. Before last night, I really liked these people. I thought they liked me. Now I feel as though I’m some kind of monster. I feel as though I burned bridges that I spent the whole summer building. I’m not sure what to do anymore.

310,"First, some background:

I'm (15F) a junior in high school. Unpopular opinion but I love high school. I have plenty of friends, I'm on varsity soccer and lacrosse, I'm in the QSA and Girl Up club and I'm ASB President (first ever junior!!). I wouldn't necessarily consider myself popular, I don't hang out with the popular crowd - I'm just well liked. I am friends with most every group and could hang out with anyone. I hang w the popular kids when I want, the leadership kids, the jocks, the drama geeks, the mathletes, etc. I don't really have drama with anyone and high school has gone pretty awesome for me so far. I like the social part of school and I sorta like the academics. I love learning but I have some shitty teachers.

I completely understand why some people hate high school. I know some people feel excluded, they might hate certain teachers, they might feel as if there is nothing that appeals to them. I get it, not everyone loves football games and homecoming. Our school is pretty average. We live in a nice area and our school is very white. I know some minorities have a hard time fitting in. We have average sports,  an average drama department, a really good leadership program, REALLY good academics, and a average/below average sense of school spirit.

I have this vision where just everyone loves coming to school and looks forward to all the rallies, tailgates, film festivals, etc., all the events leadership puts on. I know this is clearly very optimistic and I know this won't be achievable in just one year but I want to start. As ASB prez this year and hopefully next year i genuinely wanna improve our school. I know some kids have this negative view on leadership - they see it as a cult that just makes posters and such. But our leadership class actually does a lot. We have 90 people that consist of class officers, student life, student support, environmental, diversity, community outreach, tech, rallies, and more. We do put on your usual events such as hoco, rallies, tailgates, etc. but we also have film festivals, video game competitions, dance competitions, we put on tailgates for our plays, we have care week, and diversity workshops, we fundraise for our 50+ clubs. We do a lot more than just make posters. 

Yet some people still hate coming to school, feel excluded, and SHIT on leadership. I often don't understand why. We work hard to put on these fun events. We try to reach out to everyone in the school. All of our events are optional. Often I'm at school from 6am to 9pm just working hard to create these things that maybe make school a bit more enjoyable. Our leadership program is very selective and it's not an easy A. People are in the class if they want to make a difference. We work hard to not just recognize sports and instead all departments.

Yet at the football games, not many people show up, there isn't much cheering - we never have a huge turnout at our events except for hoco, prom and such. Some people hate leadership and there's just a general sense of bad school spirit.

How do I increase our spirit (with events, ideas, anything) and at the same time create a culture of inclusiveness and love?

TL;DR My school has no school spirit and a negative/competitive environment , how do I change this?",24Jul2018,2

320,"Hello everyone!

I’m in a bit of a predicament here.

First, here’s my quick background: 
In 2015, I fell 15ft head first into a concrete basement. I fractured my spine and suffered traumatic brain injury. After tons of struggling, including a 2 month stay at a physical rehab facility, I began to fall downward. My depression was very bad. Almost a year later, my family and I moved out to Maryland for better psychiatric treatment. I stayed at MedStar psychiatric facility twice in a couple months. Still, nothing helped. I began writing suicide notes and feeing the urge to walk into traffic. We then moved to Baltimore.

I was put in a schizo unit at Johns Hopkins. I was there for a couple weeks and they decided to make me undergo ECT on an outpatient basis. One day in ECT, the head doctor caught me telling my mom I was suicidal. They immediately brought me down to the psych ER. That place was hell, just like a prison. A day later I was transported to a young adult unit in the hospital. I stayed there for 2 months and i felt amazing when I left. And then for the bajillionth time, I was put back into the young adult unit for med changes. The team of doctors decided to have me on a case study since I was so bad. I was interviewed by 15 doctors and 10+ nurses on a conference room. They found a solution. Prozac, Lithium, Propanylol, Prazosin, Seroquel, and a few others. I was released and I felt incredible. I’ve been out of the hospital since. I’ve had blips here and there where I dip into a dark depression, but they only last 5 days at most.

My family and I are from Colorado. My mom can’t do anything outside because of the heat and humidity. She has fibromyalgia and sweats so much just walking outside. Earlier this week my sister started blaming me for her losing friends and that she has none here. She says that everyone hates it here. Sure, I miss Colorado, but Baltimore has felt like home! 

Most of all: I’m terrified that I’ll become suicidal again and not have Johns Hopkins to help me out. If it weren’t for that hospital, I would’ve killed myself a while back. I’m now happy, but I don’t want to jeopardize myself. I’m 20, so my sister just tells me to stay here. I currently have a job coach who is getting me a job, since I haven’t had one for 3 years due to the accident.

See? I’m incredibly afraid and I don’t know what to do. I don’t have enough independence yet to be on my own in Baltimore. I’m learning skills everyday thru my outpatient therapist, psychiatrist, and occupational therapist.

What should I do?",24Jul2018,1

323,"Well ill keep this short, even though this could be a novel.

Im 28 and beginning to see the stage in life where i must start taking care of my parents. They are both in thier late 60s and have problems with addiction. 

My father has been frequenting the casino more and more every year, this has been happening for nearly 10 years. The past few years have gotten really bad. He called my older sister last nightnand told her that he has a problem and that he needs to be able to call her when ever hes having the urge to gamble.

My mother has chronic pain conditions, i  inherited her genetics of chronic pain. When i was 18 she began abusing her pain medication. She was forced into early retirement and only makes $400/month. She miraculously beat the addiction by herself and manages to inly take pain medication maybe twice a month. I know this is unheard of for an addict to use occasionally, but she manages it. Im fairly sure she abuses other meds slightly, but not the opioids, so ill take it. 

Over the years she has basically become addicted to shopping (she has no money). Her house is beginning to fill up with stuff, it looks like a mild episode of Hoarders. When she gets money from retirement or my father, she instantly spends it. She will then need to burrow money from me or my sister to afford doctors or gas money. 

To make it all worse, her breathing is terrible. She has severe lung issues due to 50 years of smoking. She managed to quit 3 years ago, but the smoking destroyed her independance and mobility. 

It feels like myself and my sister have begun raising our parents. It wouldnt be as stressful if they werent self destructive. Im so stressed and upset all the time. I feel lost and hurt. I have no idea what to do, i dont feel like im doing enough.

Backstory:  
-mother was from jersey shore
-father from Hudson valley
-they bought a shore house when they married and agreed us kids would school in NY and summer in NJ. 
-mother passed away in 2008 after a long bout with cancer. 
-our mother constantly said she's leaving the house to us.  
-her Will left everything to my dad, but requested that if my dad passed away as well, that her half of the shore house goes to me and my sister. 

Now, many years later.  My sister has been given an ultimatum.  My father allowed her to live at the shore house after college while she got her first job and figured life out.  It's now been 5-6 years and she is still living at the house.  She leaves the place very messy and doesn't do maintenance unless bothered to do it.  She has been living with 50k+ salary for 4 years, but not paying rent.   

My father has been yelling at her for years to take better care of the house.  She has not done that.  

Now the ultimatum: 

He says that she can still live there, but will need to sign a lease.  She will pay 700 per month in rent (three BR beach house) and will be required to keep the house in a certain condition.  

My sister is up-in-arms about this and is calling on me to stick up for her.  She keeps saying ""he's going to sell our house"" , ""mom left this for us and he's just kicking me out so he can sell it"".   

I want to stick up for my sister, but I can't help but think she is wrong in this scenario.  I tell her that all adults have to pay rent and she's been lucky to not have to for this long.

When I saw that movie, it felt as if it were most of my life on reel. Ever since a kid , I've had instances when I would be playing in my room all by myself , making up scenarios and acting them out,hours would go by without me noticing. I never felt the need for company , I could conjure up real-life scenarios and act them out. So,yeah basically , I kept on doing that a lot.  

Cut to , 18yo me, I realised I still do that a lot when left alone, except now I go on these long political/philosophical rants about certain topics and pace back and forth and imagine in my head that there is someone who I'm talking to or as if I'm addressing a convention hall. Other recurring scenario is that of me being interviewed as some famous hotshot in the future.  Also, sometimes I make up imaginary rendezvous(plural) in my head with people I know ,and control the whole conversation like it's from a movie scene. I know it's kinda messed up , but I never thought this would be a problem so never put the brakes on this recurring behaviour of mine.

I never did anything like this as a kid and I don’t know if I missed out or this is just a thing kids do.

I asked her if there were any boys there and she said no but also said a few girls want to invite boys next year when they’re 14.  

I don’t know if I should let her go with the mixed group though. To be fair most boys she knows aren’t trouble makers as she comes from a very post school where trouble makers are very rare

As an adult, looking at the entire situation it is very clear to me that the sexual abuse coupled with the emotional and psychological abuse I went through as a child (all at the hands of the same man, my father) has profoundly impacted the way I view myself, my relationships, *everything*.

337,"Just over a month ago a guy messaged me on an online dating app. We started talking every day and since then we’ve been talking non stop. We’ve had 3 dates, and the last “date” turned into an all weekend Friday-Saturday-Sunday thing. I stayed round his house, we watched movies, went for meals, went for walks, had sex etc.

He has said that he isn’t seeing anyone else right now and I’ve said the same. However. I’ve realised that I’m starting to really like him. We get on SO well he makes me feel very comfortable. 

I’ve had a row of bad experiences. Guys sticking around until I fall for them, then ghosting. Cheating etc. I just have a hard time believing that I’m “good enough” it’s all very complicated.

Over the past day or so, I have this gut wrenching feeling that I’m going to go onto WhatsApp and see his picture has disappeared where he’s ghosted. Just like the rest.

I can’t have that happen again. I don’t want to tar him with the same brush but when you’ve been through it, you can’t help but wonder.

Should I talk to him about it? Or will I seem crazy?

340,"Like the title says, i got a really old debt to a dealer. 

Back when i was attending Senior High (2012), i was broke and lived in a flat near my school. I got pretty hooked on weed, went to a dealer who had supplied me for quite some time at that point. Stupid me, fronted weed worth 90-100$, told him i'd pay him at the end of the month, and yeah you guessed it, never paid him. 

Anyway, my stoner period continued for a while, never answered him, got a new phone number, never heard from him ever since, and haven't bumped into him yet, and haven't had the balls to confront him. I'm currently living in another city. Since then i cut off the weed, started studying, got work and made some money, so really there's been no excuse except the fact that i didn't have the money back then.

I recently discovered that i actually blocked him on facebook back then (pretty paranoid i guess), and it got me thinking if i should reach out and be like ""i owe you money man"", or if i should just leave it. I don't have his phone number, so this is the only way i could get in touch with him. Given that he's just some ordinary on-the-side dealerish type, who didn't bother tracking me down, i guess i could just let i be, but i still get kindda paranoid whenever returning to my home town.

We had very similar tastes in a lot of things so our conversations via text messages were great and even when we hung out in person we had a good time. They were the only person I knew that was really into the things as deeply as I was and it was great to have that person to talk to about it. BUT as time went on, their flaws while spending time in person became harder and harder to deal with. Always being obscenely loud when in public, drunk more often then not, getting very angry if they aren't the center of attention, and the most aggravating: talking over about 75% of the sentences I start. Our text message conversations are still great, but I think thats because none of those flaws can come through via text. And it's gotten to the point that I can't deal with hanging out with them in person, because every time ends with me just leaving angry and embarrassed.

Never had a relationship, I'm not a freak tho' (I hope). It just wasn't meant to be yet. 

Anyway, I have been talking with this girl for about a month (texts, we live in different cities, we met at university, but since it's summer and my hometown is not where the university is, you can figure it out...)

I have strong reasons to believe the feelings are the same on both sides, we talk almost daily and there are some other details which are not worth mentioning which make me believe that she likes me too. (99.9999 certain) 

Yesterday we ended up our chat in a way which made me think that I should expect news from her today, and since I was the one who initiated our conversation yesterday, I thought it would be a good idea to simply wait for her to holler, I don't wanna be too sticky. 

I am about to get to sleep and that message never popped up today. I'm feeling sad and at the same time confused, and not only because she did not text me, but because I don't know if she was expecting me to text her first. If I knew that she was too tired and not in the mood to talk, I would have been better. 

I don't know what is wrong with me, I think I shouldn't be so sad because we did not talk for one day, after all she is not obliged to text me daily.

We have a snap streak daily on like 130 right now. We used to talk every day but now it's just streaks when we message each other.

I even verified our building contract with selections that they did it wrong.

After talking with the painter, he felt that there is no way to re-do everything due to the scope of the work and said he may have to just cut me a check for mishap.

I live in a ground floor flat and my window is pretty shitty. I can hear cars driving by or people talking in front of my window.

Since I live in a really old building in Vienna, the Walls are like 10 metres thicc, so I'm guessing ""the sound is coming in through the closed window"".

My idea was to buy a big board and just put Acoustic Foam on both sides, and put it in front of the window, when it's getting to loud. 

My question is, does it actually reduce the incoming sound? 

If somebody has experience with Acoustic Foam I would be thankful for any help.

350,"This is a throwaway account because I don't want anyone to find this and link it to me.

So, to cut a long story short. My sister and I were abused by my step uncle from the ages of about 6 - 10. My family moved at that time, and our step dad started abusing us. This stopped at 13 due to some eagle eared people who recognised that something that was said wasn't right. Mum was great and has supported us through the next 25 years or so. 

What I need advice on: My brothers were abusing me as well. They were younger than me (by a year) but were bigger and could hold me down. My sister hasn't said this happened to her and she is the type that would have said something. 

My brothers are jerks. They are aggressive towards my sister and I, they belittle us constantly and Mum says they are just being them and they are like that with everyone. No, they aren't like that to everyone because they would be fired from their jobs if they spoke like that and were being aggressive and threatening. It's getting to the point that I don't know what to do. I can't cope with the way they are treating me, but nothing I say seems to help. I am in counselling, but dread seeing them.

I've tried thinking of all the differences between the two cities, as well as any behavior changes. At first I thought maybe diet, but disproved that pretty quick. Wasn't water or caffeine intake. Exercise wasn't a factor either. Then I thought about the cities I was in. My college city is well above sea level, very mild in temperature, pretty dry, and close to the ocean. The city my family lives in is close to sea level, in a dry grassland surrounded by farms, very hot, and constantly smells of manure and fertilizer.

Eventually she left her job to move cities and find a new job for her mental health.

355,"So we have a little bit of a situation folks; it’s about my schedule and how I’m freaking out daily. I’m going into my junior year of high school. I want to play soccer in the fall- practice is twice a week and games on weekends. I also am planning on taking the PSAT, ACT, maybe SAT, two SAT subject tests, I’m signed up for AP Calc, and I want to self study AP Lang. I have to self study for everything but AP Calc. However, I do have block scheduling which means that I’ll have four classes per half of a year, and APs are the second half. I have an additional problem with the fact I’m taking chemistry, British lit, precalc and Advanced composition at the same time and I’m afraid the Lit and the Comp are too much at once?

 My psat is in October, act in October or December, SAT in November or December, subject tests in the spring, AP tests in the spring. I’m intensely stressed, so much to the point I end up having anxiety attacks and not getting work done for weeks at a time.

I can’t tell anyone because everyone says that I’m smart, so I have everything ‘under control’. I’ve attempted to bring up my feelings with friends, relatives, and teachers and they all have this response- ‘oh, it’s you. You’ll do great.’ 

They have NO CLUE if I’ll do great or not. No one can know that. I could fail every damn class and lose my chance at getting into a good school. That’s what I’m terrified of. 

On top of this I’m feeling the pressure to get a job. All of my friends work. My parents said that as long as I succeed in school they’ll help in college but I’m so scared that I’ll fail in school that I think I need a job. And i don’t want them to carry me through college. I have other siblings they should worry about. We’re not bad off, but I still don’t know if that’s a good idea.

But should I get a job? Soccer practice wouldn’t be that bad at twice a week, and there are some flexible positions near me. But will I be able to juggle my classes and the tests I’ll be taking with that going on? 

Basically here’s what I need advice on:

How do I study for all these tests?

Do I play soccer and/or get a job?

How do I learn to trust myself?

He works two jobs I think. From my understanding...the only chances he gets for free time, he goes to the gym to work out. Basically, he gets up, goes to work job one, goes to the gym, goes to work job two, goes home to spend time with his family, sleeps, repeat. Given that...I haven't seen him in an entire year. Last time I saw him was July 2017, and it's obviously now July 2018. So, someone said to me, ""Why not go to the gym with him for once?""

Not a bad idea, but...I dunno. I've never been to a gym to ""work out"" before. I don't even know what I would do. And, I'm not a very fit person. I've been working on that, but, baby steps. I figured I'd go to a gym eventually, but, I don't feel quite ""there"" yet. That'd be taking a huge step. And, I think he does go with other people and I'm afraid what they'd think of me. Also, sometimes he goes with his younger brother who doesn't like me any much.

Also...What's with it with siblings of friends not liking their siblings friends? Hope you get what I'm trying to say...I feel like that always happens.

So...I dunno. I just feel like, he himself would appreciate it if I asked him, but...I dunno how it'd work. I've never been to a gym to ""work out"" before, what would I even do? And I feel like, he'd try to all focused and ""in the zone"" and I might distract him. And if he goes with other people, and I'm someone that's never done this before...I might embarrass myself in front of them, which might in turn embarrass him.

A few months later he went on a homophobic Facebook rant in which he basically said he didn't like gay people, what they do is wrong, and he feels sorry for them. My sister, who's in a long-term relationship with a girl he previously said was like another daughter, was devastated and furious. I was too on her behalf, and we unfriended him. They haven't spoken much or seen each other since, and I know this has the potential to go to their deathbeds without intervention. So this weekend I'm going to try to talk to him about it.

We know my dad loves us, and we both want him to understand some things so that we can all move past this and have at least something of a relationship again. But he is extremely challenging to talk to. He is the world's worst communicator. He's one of those ""I'm always right and everyone else can go to hell"" types. In his view, his feelings are really powerful and they matter a lot, but he has no empathy, and he seems to not even understand that he has the potential to hurt other people by talking. So when we're talking and I don't agree with him, he condescendingly tells me I'm wrong. Of course this makes me feel defensive, which inevitably derails any conversation into an argument. 

I need advice on how to keep a conversation calm and on topic, and especially how to keep from arguing about religion. And how to keep from getting angry. I have a few ideas, but I've never done this kind of thing before. I figure I'll start by laying down ground rules, like using ""I feel"" statements instead of starting sentences with ""you."" Maybe telling him that before we speak, we have to think first about whether what we are going to say might make the other person feel attacked. I'll try to have the conversation somewhere where we can get up and walk away to cool off if needed. Does anyone have any other tips? I feel like this is a very important conversation and I need it to go as smoothly as possible.",24Jul2018,2

370,"Hello!

I'm  an introvert and my girlfriend is the biggest outgoing, extroverted nature-freak. We don't live together but she plans to devote  her life to traveling and exploring ""different countries"". She is also  not sure if she wants children. We're both in our early 20s. I want to  settle down at some point, have a kid.

Whenever  we talk about this, I see that immaturity, that level of high standards  that the younger generation often falls for - watching the world and  the life at large through rosy shades of adulthood. I've met innumerable  youths with dreams like these and I can't help but ask- how many really  do get to live this dream? Are they even viable, or realistic goals?  Unless you're an extraordinary veteran in your field with too much time  and money on your hands or a lucky kid spending your parents'  hard-earned fortune on world tours, I don't think this is a possibility.  To be honest, the only viable world tour package I found covered just  the major cities across the globe in 3 months. And it costs nothing  short of $20,000 USD minimum. Possibly even more with misc expenses. Not  sure who can afford to take these trips frequently like that (going on a  3 month vacation (without pay, ofc) every year is a nice way to get  yourself fired no matter how much of a genius you are, even as a CEO of a  company you can't afford that luxury). Now one pattern I've noticed is  that everyone I've met with these dreams has never actually had a job.  They're all college-goers (including my girlfriend). I have 5 years of  industry experience and I know enough to say- these are all pipe dreams.  Sure you can go camping, visit a state in your own country maybe even  go overseas once in a while, but not REMOTELY as close to what my  girlfriend and said people daydream about.

I  guess my question is: Should I break the bad news to her or break up  with her? Because obviously, if our long-term goals are so different,  there's no point in staying together. But at the same time, I love her  so much that I can't stand the thought of her getting shattered in a few  years from now when she realizes the harsh reality of the world at  large as opposed to her dreams and what she sacrificed for that whole  lotta nothingness. I mean, don't get me wrong I've had friends whose  parents had worked for international oil and steel giants and they get  transferred to different countries depending on the project every couple  of years. The only other case that comes to mind is the traveling  agents but even they mostly take the trips for business, not pleasure.  And by no means am I saying that I don't like traveling or I'm stopping  her from going wherever she wants. In fact, I've been extremely  supportive of her going places of her own accord. But whenever I ask her  about my dreams, she either changes the subject or goes silent or  avoids the topic. My parents have always had plenty itch to go see the  world, but they also had and brought up their children just fine while  also simultaneously making time for their family trips every once in a  while. I do wish the best for her and no one would be happier than me if  she actually gets what she wants but I know for a fact that she's  setting herself up for disappointment and that just makes it that much  harder for me to break up with her since I've always been there for her  whenever she gets depressed. Aside from this ""conflict"", we're very happy. And I swear to God, she's the purest, most innocent, joyful, everyone's-best-interests-at-heart, environmentalist, human/animal rights activist-type, good samaritan, polite, considerate, kind, genuine, top-of-the-line human being I've ever met in all of my 24 years. And yes, I meant every single word of that.

What do I do?",24Jul2018,1
371,"Since we were kids, my cousin and I have been very close despite our major differences in personality. This all changed when she got together with her boyfriend last year. We started to grow apart, as I became uncomfortable with her and her boyfriend, him being not the best member of society (jailed multiple times, into heavy drugs, etc).

Back in February of this year, she called me at 10 pm needing to talk. Not seeing her for months, I knew that this was important, so I went to her place and she proceeded to tell me everything he had done to her. Not only was there emotional abuse, but physical abuse. Her boyfriend would tell her to take pictures down of herself on social media if she's showing too much skin, and be constantly telling her to shut up when she was talking, causing this once very extroverted girl to become very soft spoken and afraid to even speak. They'd argue like cats and dogs. He would steal money she earned from her purse, him being unemployed. He would hit her. She showed me bruises that had been on her body for weeks. She told me she blacked out once, when he shoved her against the kitchen counter, hitting her head directly on the corner. She also had a cracked molar from a punch. We cried and hugged each other a lot that night. Her boyfriend was in jail for a few weeks, and she said she would break up with him when he got out. She begged me if she ever got back together with him to stop her.

Despite all of this, she didn't break up with him.

I had hung out with her a few times after this. When I told her to break up with him, she would say she's just using him for her advantage to get back at him. I told her that it's immature and she should just end it. She told me she was planning on it, and was looking forward to be single over the summer. I saw her a few other times in family settings, and would say things like he's not good for you and, he's preventing you from living a successful life. It wasn't the right time to have a deep conversation.

She hasn't been single this summer and is still with him. For one reason or another I have distanced myself even more with her, treating her like someone I don't really know. I have anxiety issues and honestly am afraid of her, as she's unpredictable at times and loves drama. I still love her so much and feel like I am letting her down for not trying harder to convince her to leave him.

Should I try and convince her to leave him one last time? What should I say to her and how should I bring it up?

TL:DR My cousin is in an abusive relationship, which is both emotionally and physically abusive. Should I/How can I convince her to leave him?",24Jul2018,5

374,"We actually made out, actually basically dry fucked on her sofa, it was pretty heated actually... we kissed/touched/grinded for over 2 hours until we had to stop because she’s with someone else. Anyway I’m just happy it happened with someone I trust (she’s a close friend). 

The reason why it never happened before was basically I weighed 240 pounds (110 kilos) and was fat my whole childhood/early adulthood and in the past 2-3 years I got sick of it and lost 100 pounds (45 kilos); I’m about 145 pounds/65 kilos now, bought new classy clothes, grew a decently attractive beard and generally some girls at work even tell me I’m attractive, which I don’t want to believe because I think I still see myself as I always have, fat, gross, not horribly ugly but simply too blubby and definitely not boyfriend material. 

My friend who I kissed said that she was surprised by actually how natural and not forced it was, and the whole evening was actually super hot and she was really getting crazy. She knew it was my first time but she couldn’t let us fuck because she’s with someone else and I respect that.

My question is, am I a loser for being born in 1994 and only opening up/blooming now? I feel like I don’t really care but at the same time I feel like I need some closure; for the longest time I was in denial and insisted I don’t need a girlfriend because relationships and even just sex is complicated (to justify not having sex or even kissing anyone, the truth being I was overweight/obese and insecure). But now that I’m in good shape, idk maybe it’s the hormones or tesosterone but I feel like it’s natural and I need this. Maybe I’m just maturing (probably?). I think I’m just overthinking due to having a different mindset all my life.

375,"Hello, 

I'm currently in a bit of a dilemma. I'm going into my junior year for a finance major in a big city in the US. I currently have two jobs: 
One at my school as an office assistant and the other is at a very large brewery (guarantee our beer is in your town, also all over the world) as front of house staff. 

My job at my school as an office assistant doesn't pay very well and since it's at my school, they limit my hours weekly. That being said, they still like me there 5 days a week in order to be present daily. I mainly got the job for references, and so far it's paying off. I'm meeting a ton of doctors and racking up references. Recently started talking with my schools Dean of Finance and Administration. However, financially I barely make enough to pay for living expenses. 

At my other job at the brewery, the pay is much better with tips. It's an awesome environment, the people are great. Although I'm beginning to get tired of the restaurant industry, as I've worked in it for about 5 years now since I was 16. I would make more money there and live comfortably during school, but no references other than restaurant references. 

Originally my plan was to work both, however, my office job runs until 5pm. Shifts at the brewery start at 3:30. Also, the brewery requires three days available. So I've been working every day including weekends in order to keep my availability open enough to work both jobs. But I'm always getting one shift covered in the week in order to stay at my office job, and I'm getting exhausted working both. 

So, my question is: Should I stay at my office job for the references in order to use them in the future, especially considering the fact that networking is so important, even more in my major. Or should I stay at my brewery job in order to make more money in college and live a little more comfortably; financially speaking? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",24Jul2018,1
377,"On Friday, I have work, and because I start somewhat earlier than normal, I am going to be splitting for the beginning of the shift. Splitting is where you accept a delivery of at least a dozen pallets full of stock, and then start splitting it, literally, into cages representing different aisles.

Splitting is a lot of fun (because you do it in massive group, and it is fast-moving), but it is the most physically demanding role there is. There is a lot of twisting and up and backs involved. I know I am going to get dizzy, that's not such a problem, but I am concerned about my hip.

After almost every shift, my hip feels sore. JUST sore, like it is more of an annoyance than anything. I have had many aches and pains that have turned out to be entirely inconsequential when I start working. However, I have never had to do anything this heavy before. 

How should I go about it? If I get hurt, then they are going to say ""why didn't you tell anyone?"" but if it isn't going to be a problem, then I don't want to burden the team by sitting out. I cannot tell until I try it.

391,"I need some advice or help on navigating my current work situation.   Sorry for the wall of text!!


I have been the target of retaliation from a coworker for one of their friends getting fired.  Said friend assaulted, in the open office, another coworker.  In front of a packed 100+ person office.   Both myself who witnessed it, and the victim, have been treated with hostility and contempt.



I am unsure if other witnesses are also receiving this treatment but because I was ther and asked the victim if they were ok (they were not!) I believe that automatically they believe I ""snitched"" on their friend.  



This behaviour started with myself and another witness being called ""assholes"" when I asked the other what was going on, as the perpetrator was being called into the office. 


This escalated from that to fully being ignored and isolated from conversation, avoidance, and small, spoken dissenting remarks towards how the company was handling what had happened.  


In an unfortunate turn of events, my desk was relocated next to this coworker, and received the entire silent treatment with disdain that I was speaking, when a third coworker came up to chat.


I have told my boss everything from the start, who assured me that not only was it not my fault as a witness, but there were many witnesses and we were not named.   So the person treating me poorly is doing so under pure speculation for one, but retaliating against me for giving a statement that got their friend fired.



My desk was moved at my request elsewhere, and this coworker (who did not know I was in the vicinity) audibly and loudly said ""YES, it's gonna be a good day!!!"" In celebration that I was being moved.

I've kept my boss in the loop on this and that I feel a lot of hostility just sitting and doing my job.  I am remaining professional and I have not engaged this individual, but I really don't like the way they are trying to make me feel while I am at work. 


I also know that the victim of this event has been given the silent treatment as well, complete with avoidance and lack of acknowledgement.

Believe me, if I had a way to get my license on my own (my town has a population of less than 2,600 so you can get an idea) so I could get a job and pay for my own college tuition, I would.

My dad loves guns. He has at least a dozen of them, along with several adapters and other accessories. He spends at least $100 on these things every month. Most of the time he won’t even tell my mom about these purchases until she checks the bank statement. He tries to keep this stuff hidden and believes the government will try to come and steal his guns so he needs to keep a good stock of it before there are no guns any longer.

He had been in medical leave for a while, and all he does all day long is watch gun videos on YouTube. Sometimes he will watch conspiracy theory videos or military videos concerning the powerful weapons they have to destroy the enemy. It doesn’t help matters that my dad has severe anger issues which scares me. 

I mean, if he is not sleeping, he is watching things dealing with guns or other destructive weapons. My dad will spend $200-400 on a gun very few months when he’s on medical leave yet they somehow don’t have enough money to pay for my online community college. Guns are a priority for him (my mom too), not my education. 

Is this crossing the line into “obsession” territory, especially since this could be considered a dangerous one? I wouldn’t be surprised at all if he was on some list for all the guns he buys and the gun videos he watches all the time until 2 AM. Sometimes he’ll bring his own guns into the living room just to look at them and play with them.

396,"I have basically accepted that I'm as healthy mentally as I'm going to get. Not suicidal anymore, but still have my bad days and have near constant fatigue. My issues are as follows.

1: Need to sleep 12+ hours a day.

2: Anxiety makes social aspects of life difficult.

3: Not many people are wanting to hire someone who's almost 26 and has 4 months of work experience on their resume that can be accounted for (the rest is freelance).

I don't really see how I can support myself financially and ever have a meaningful relationship of any kind. I'd like to be a dad some day, but that possibility seems to be less and less likely every day.

397,"I was on Latin American Cupid looking up chicks in my area. Have never had issues with it.

I connect with a hot girl who only has one picture and is pretty hot. We exchange a couple of messages – she tells me to contact her on WhatsApp. 

We get onto WhatsApp and after a couple of whatever questions I send her a photo of me and she sends me one more of her. she tells me that she does sensual massage. Honestly I play along just because I’m curious and ask her how much, if she does anything else, just because I was bored. She tells me she needs to talk to her boss and a soon as I hear that I just say thanks but no thanks and block her.

A few hours later I get a very disturbing message from another number with death threats and images of cartel violence from her “Boss”. The messages say “forwarded” so I can only assume they were copy/pasted from another message he had written. 

I block that number too and then get a voice message from another number. The person addresses me by first name (which appears on whatsapp) and mentions the city I live in (which from what I can tell does not show up on my dating profile)

I block that number too. That all went down yesterday. Haven’t heard since.

It’s obviously causing me a great deal of stress. What do you think I should do??

400,"I'm taking a summer PE class in high school. Yesterday, Andrew got really mad at Terry (fake names). Terry had accidentally elbowed Andrew really hard during basketball, and Andrew pushed back. They agreed to fight after school. They both consented to the fight.

Andrew got beaten up very badly by the end. Broken nose, bruised face, he probably had to go to the doctor afterward.

People watched this fight very happily. Andrew was getting really hurt, and people were having a great time watching it happen. They observed it like it was some kind of concert. They were laughing really hard, and almost no one seemed in the slightest bit concerned.

I didn't actually go to see the fight, but someone showed me a video of it afterward. I thought it was horrible.

I'm not really making any judgments about Andrew/Terry or about the people who watched. They're two consenting individuals, and they did what they wanted to do. But I feel like I'm in another world. To me, that fight was the most disgusting thing I've seen in a while. I HATE violence. But other people (it felt like everyone else) seemed to be loving it.

There might be others who feel the same way as me, but just haven't spoken their mind aloud. But I can assure you that the majority of people who know about this fight, have only shown signs of approval.

It's also possible that I'm not reading people correctly... maybe some people are laughing out of discomfort. But when so many people look like they're enjoying the scene of someone getting beaten up that badly, they are probably enjoying it, just as it appears they are.

Has anyone else ever felt this kind of disconnect with their peers?",24Jul2018,2

404,"Hi there, early 20s female here. I have a boyfriend who's a tad bit attached. When I met him I did like him a lot but was looking for something more casual. He didn't want something casual, so I figured, ""hey, I like this guy a lot, why not get into a relationship with him and try it out?"" Fast forward to 2 years later, we're living together, with my dad (to support him as my parents are splitting, this is somewhat important later) and he's become extremely attached, won't let me go out with my friends without a million questions, gets upset when he feels like I missed an ""important"" detail, just wants to sit around the house with me, alone each day. I've been picking up extra shifts at work just to be able to spend time by myself. I'm starting to feel closed in and like I need out, and some freedom (we're so young and he just wants to get married and buy a house and I DO NOT want to do that and have been clear). I want freedom, but I also want to remain his friend, and not break his heart. I'm also afraid of what to do when it comes to moving away from each other, I want to be there to support my dad and so I don't know if me moving out is much of an option, and I don't want to just kick him out, although his parents would welcome him back with open arms.

409,"I'm 32 years old and still live with my dad. Over the years there have been a few problems with my sisters (BiPolar and Borderline), one tried to sue my dad after my mom passed away, and the other (bipolar) is very insecure and hypocritical who used me a lot and treats me like her ""dumb insecure brother"". Over the years I've been an awkward guy growing up, never really fitting in, and no talent in anything to give me a leg up. I got tired of the way I felt I was being treated, and figured something could be done about it when I went to college. But, sticking up for myself, being moody, and also trying to make friends didn't work out so well. 

My family are sort of Rednecks and have hard nosed opinions about some things that are a bit out of touch and offensive, since I'm looked at as lazy and ""weak"" they are hard on me whenever there is an interaction, more of passive aggressive and sly comments. During college and my twenties, decided to be open about my opinions, and it backfired. Now, they think, I think they are stupid. My sister turned a new leaf I guess, but she is CRAZY (not because of bipolar, I understand there is a stigma attached to it) as a person, all the mistakes and horrible things she has done is buried deep in delusion and blaming others. She, along with others who have gossiped, now have a weird idea about me, now instead of being dumb I'm self-important, mean, knows no better, and treated like a child. 

I did develop a defensiveness, because I can't just seem to figure anyone or anything out. The irony is, it's like I'm turning into the thing I don't want to be. Which is insecure, paranoid, and unmotivated. 

Odd thing is, everyone gets along and has their lives going, the one thing I've always been bad at were keeping friends and getting along with others. I've tried all that I can think of, but for some reason a person just finds something wrong with me every time. 

I've never been good at sticking up for myself, and have gotten blamed for things because of misunderstandings or outright lies. In this sense I am stupid. I feel trapped and cornered in my own mind. Really angry these days, when I just want to get started on something. But, with the ridicule in the past, there is a lack of a reserve of anything positive I could tell myself in order to say ""fuck them"".

Tired of holding everything in.

We were friends through middle school and most of high school, really falling off once 12th year started and declining further as the years went. We were pretty close, if only because we were both rather miserable and needed a friend, but regardless of the reason we used to talk every day and help each other out of tight spots whenever we needed it. 
Two or three years ago, we got into a disagreement over personal beliefs/philosophies, leading her to block me on everything after expressing that she thought I was repulsive/evil/other synonyms like that. Catching up to today, I saw her and her family at Wal-Mart and wanted to say hi but hesitated out of fear that she'd snap at me publicly.

419," BACKGROUND: I (29-M) have been working in a small office for the past 4 years in which my department is at this point, is 3 people.  A new employee (23-F) started about 6 months ago and we have had a seemingly positive relationship. The issue starts in that I am very interested in her, but she has a boyfriend, so apart from occasional workplace teasing and humorous conversation between us, I do not openly flirt with her and do not speak about relationships to her. I also have no intentions of making any moves on her while she is in a relationship. But would most likely ask her out if she broke up. If i had to guess, I would say that she knows that I am interested in her at some level. We follow each other on various social media, but do not directly message often.

TODAY: Her car is in at the mechanics and she did not have a ride today, as the car she had borrowed for the past few days from a family member was being used. I gave her a lift home once last week, and today I offered to drive her home and she declined and said she already had someone who was going to pick her up. Driving on my way home, I noticed her walking (she only lives about 3 miles away, so walking home is not unreasonable) and pulled over and asked her if she was okay. She said ""i'm fine i'm just walking, okay?"" and seemed quite angry at me pulling over. I haven't really seen her act angry in this way at work.

QUESTION: When we see each other tomorrow, how should i act? I understand this is a remarkably childish question for someone my age, but due to our proximity and tasks at work, we will need to interact with each other tomorrow. I feel that i should have taken the hint that she didn't want me to drive her, and am thinking about apologizing, even though my intentions were good.  I am thinking of doing either that or just completely ignored that it happened when i see her tomorrow.

I've always been single. I know it is probably because of my little opportunities to meet guys and that I am shy, but it seriously hurts sometimes. And guys at my school won't date me anyways since everyone at my school makes fun of me for being a single virgin. I know I'm not undateable, because I'm quite popular actually (have been homecoming princess one year) and get told I'm pretty all the time. If I switch schools they won't know about my reputation. I might have a shot at being normal. Also, if it ends up being worse there (which I doubt is possible), I only have one year left so it doesn't matter.

I have nothing to lose in regards for switching schools, because I only have a few real friendships. The school I want to go to has over a thousand students, so a lot more guys. My friend who went there says there is such an abundance of guys she has never been single while there.  

I know this sounds baby-ish, and whiny, but it really does hurt to be single still. I just want to get my first kiss over with before college. I want to know what high school love is like. I want a high school sweetheart, even if it doesn't last. I want to go to at least one dance with a guy. I don't want to have to skip my senior prom, because I can't get a date (and no I'm not going alone. I went to junior prom alone and it was so awful I left early and cried). I don't want to be the only freshman virgin when I go to college. And I've heard all of the ""high school relationships aren't meaningful"", ""I wish I waited.."", ""I didn't have a relationship until I was X years old, and have never been happier!"" and all that bs. I don't care if it is meaningful or not anymore. If I can find a guy ok with kissing me, and having sex with me even just once I'm good. I'm sick of being ridiculed because I've never had a boyfriend. I want this stupid crap over with. 

Yeah, I'm sure I'll get a meaningful boyfriend when I'm in college or working or something, but based on how people talk I should just be ok with the fact that he'd be my first, and I'd be his 438th? lol no. That would make me completely insecure. I want a long term relationship with someone on the same level as me. and finding an 18-23 year old guy in college that is a kissless virgin like me? unlikely.

So should I just hope for some miracle that a guy at my school will like me despite my reputation and stigma or actually take action? Like yeah, it's important to me to graduate with my childhood friends, and go to school where I'm used to, but it's \*more\* important for me to find a guy that will take my first kiss, and virginity so that I can be normal like other girls..
