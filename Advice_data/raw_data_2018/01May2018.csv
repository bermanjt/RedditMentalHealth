0,"I'm a 20-year-old guy who has completed a semester and a half but failed out and lost my scholarship as a result. The primary reasons for failing out were a combination of complete lack motivation (self-care/work), as well as significant marijuana usage and no management of my mental health issues (suicidal ideation/depression). 

Upon returning home from my 3rd semester I was hospitalized by my choice for being suicidal and spent about a week there. I got two jobs (7days/week)after about a month out of the hospital and was living at home but was then kicked out after my parents caught me smoking again.

I continued working both jobs but just gave up after  I got in a minor accident about a 2 weeks ago and am now  just working one full-time job. I'm living temporarily with my grandparents while I work and save for an apartment.

My parents have still stayed supportive, although now from a distance, but after a conversation tonight, things don't seem to be heading any more uphill than any other recent events. After the car accident, I was told that I would have to stay clean for the duration at my grandparents.

I've been clean for the past two weeks, been on time and doing well at work, and have remained on my meds. However, I was honest with my parents and told them I intended to use again (if and) when I had my own place and car.

I still feel emotionally numb, despite the sobriety, and while I intend on continuing to try to move forward and try to get back to school, I just can't seem to believe that I will be any happier completely sober. Especially considering the reality of my current life.

My question(s):
-Have you ever been in a similar situation?
-Do you have advice on me moving forward?

2,"I'm at the planning stage of a story I've been tossing around for years. At its core, it's a commentary on corruption and oppression, and given the state of our country today, racism is the underlying theme in both of these issues.

I (the author) am white, but in my mind, the main character of my story is half-black.

The main problem for me is that it feels insincere to write from a black man's pov, especially since my story revolves so heavily around the war on drugs, gang culture, and the mass incarceration of minorities for drug related crimes, topics that I have a lot of opinions on, but no real experience with, largely due to white privilege.

On the other hand, writing the main character as white would come off as incredibly preachy, and would result in another case of the white savior narrative.

Any advice?",01May2018,3
3,"# The non-healthy relation

I have a fetish for bdsm/degradation/humiliation since my teenage years \(maybe because I was constantly bullied\).

At 18, I met a girl and it was nice with her. The only problem was in bed: When very excited, I would go back to very basic toughs and back to my fetish, mostly I would want degrade/control \(insults, putting her on her knees/all fours\).

Things got out of hand and it got worse and worse \(no physical violence but mean thoughts and insults, even outside sex\).

We were aware of that and I tried to manage that and refrain myself but we had to quit each\-over that since I couldn't control myself.

# After the relation 

Of course, in hindsight, I should have consulted a specialist, that's what I did a few months after, without much success but at least I work on the problem.

So, for me the question is a bit like ""**How to live your life after you've been a murderer ?**"" kind of thing.

My initial solution was simple: No more girls for me \(worked out for now\)

But It's been a year since I live with this shame/regret/pain/guilt everyday and i feel like I didn't change much \(stills have dreams of my fetish\)

Of course, I contemplate suicide almost everyday as the #1 solution.

My current ideas to deal with that:

* Be very passionate about stuff outside romance/sex \(biking, reading, volunteering for the common good\)
* Have a way to channel this fetish into something positive \(writing fiction about it maybe\)
* Instead of suicide, give myself 5 years to become a ""good"" human \(having healthy relationships where I care deeply for others, instead of my usual narcissism\)
* Have a chemical/physical castration or simply more continue to consult

But since \*\*I've missed the obvious before\*\* \(""see a specialist""\), maybe I'm missing something obvious again.

That's why, if you have any advice, would love to take it.",01May2018,8
5,"Please god tell me how do you deal with the anxiety of phone calls? 
Basically any phone call....... But.....

Especially when you know the conversation is going to be tense.... Or somehow change your relationships, like with family or a group of friends.

But even like catching up with an old friend or calling a repair person to schedule an appt. 

Oh and the 2nd worst (cause the worst is when its gonna be tense with family or friends) is when I have to call some kind of business (like Verizon or internet, electric, etc) to deal with, well, some kind of business b.s. lol

14,"**TLDR: downstairs neighbor constantly complaining about my walking, should I ignore her, go to management, or...? Just re-signed lease**

I live on the second floor of a two story complex. When I moved in, I had laminate put in the living room bc I have a dog who has the occasional accident like any other dog. There is carpet in the bedroom. 

Additional bit of info- I live on the west coast but work east coast hours meaning I’m typically up at 4:30AM and this cannot be changed. Nature of my job. 

Downstairs neighbor moved in about 3 month after me. Pretty trashy (ya know kids running around in diapers while she’s puffing cigs &amp; drinking bud lights) but whatever. I said hellos blah blah welcome. 
One day she asked to have wine sometime so I said sure and gave her my number (never happened).

Fast forward 9 months, I just re-signed my lease and one more morning I’m walking the 9 steps from my bed to the shower and in those 9 steps she texts me “you are SO FUCKING LOUD.”


She never told me she could hear me walk barefoot. 


Anyways you can guess where this is going. Now it has become a 2-3 times per week thing. She sends these batshit irrational novels to me about how ‘it’s not my fault but she can’t BELIEVE mgmt out laminate in a second story apt!’ (It’s just my living room) and ‘her kids are woken up at 4:30 every morning and she CANT LIVE LIKE THIS.’



I bought a runner for my hallway and my bathroom.  I bought slippers. I tiptoe as much as I can. Nothing is working. 

I understand it must be tough having young kids but I also have to live my life without constant fear of barrage of psycho text messages. I work an incredibly stressful job and being patient and kind with her meltdowns is getting exhausting. 

The question is - what can I do? Can I ask mgmt to move her? I JUST resigned my lease not knowing she was miserable. 
Should I just stop responding?

15,Let me start by saying I am the asshole in this situation. I am a 29 F and I married the person I believed was the love of my life. He's an awesome guy but I've come to realize that I am not in love with him anymore. I would say I care about him but my actions are saying something else. I cheated on him a few months ago and we separated for a small amount of time and even went to counseling. After being separated we moved back in together and things were great for a few days. Then I found myself wondering if we got back together too soon. We have a great friendship but I am honestly not in love with him. I want to be but it's not like I'm going to wake up one day and fall in love. He has told me numerous of times that he doesn't feel wanted and that I haven't flirted with him in years. Also we have gone months without having sex. I honestly regret coming back home and making all of these promises that I'm not sure I can keep. I don't want to hurt him again as far as stepping outside my marriage again. I also don't want to feel trapped anymore. I know I need to ask him for a divorce I just don't know how. ,01May2018,1
17,"I met my ex two years ago when I was a junior in high school &amp; he was a senior. We were friends first/had the same friend group, but he started flirting and we both had caught feelings, so we became a thing. One thing that bothered me from the start (I should have seen this as a sign), was that he didn't invite me to his senior prom as a date....because his ""guy friends didn't have dates and he didn't want to be the only one with a date &amp; make them feel awkward""....which was fine, I accepted it at the time cuz i really liked him.

I found out a few days later through a mutual friend (who was at the prom) that he was seen dancing with this blonde girl (for a few hours according to our friend &amp; hanging out with her too) who was in his grade &amp; was an acquaintance of his. Let me tell you, she's gorgeous...I know I'm a pretty good looking girl myself, but this friend is beautiful. I confronted him about this &amp; he denied it completely &amp; said that it must have been two other people that they mistook for him. He asked me then to be his girlfriend/make us serious and that he was totally devoted to only me, so I said yes lets make this official.

Fall rolls around and He goes off to university. And guess who else is there? This same blonde girl that he was apparently dancing with. I decide to not let this bother me b/c he was dating me and liked me, maybe she was just a friend.

Anyway things with us started to fall apart around January (after about 7 months of dating). He was distant and we barely saw each other (he said he was busy with uni...) and we barely texted. We tried to fix it but he wouldn't put any effort in, so we ended it.

This is the gut wrenching thing....I was on facebook about 3 weeks after and I see a status that he'd been tagged in: the blonde friend of his had made a relationship status with him....so he literally dove into a relationship with her right after. I was fuming and texted him angrily telling him what a dick move that was etc, but he just apologized and literally had the audactiy to say he wanted to sitll be friends with me/didn't want to ""lose me completley"". I decided to go NC.

He and this girl lasted a while...about 9 months. They broke up a month ago and he just reached out a few days ago telling me about their split &amp; how he would love to see me. I told him I needed more time to think about hanging out as he had really upset me/went behind my back...who knows what kind of stuff he and this girl were really doing when he and I were together?? And now I'm 100% sure it was this girl who he was dancing with at prom.

Right now we are talking casually &amp; such. He keeps apologizing and saying he made a mistake and he misses me, overall sounding very optimistic and saying he thinks we can work. However he also say that he understands why I'm wary...but he thinks we should ""keep an open mind"" and try again despite.

Should I give him the second chance? I'm honestly really stuck. Him reaching out caught me off guard and I'm all confused with whether to go forward or block him completely.

18," I have recently discovered she believes she is Bi sexual. Which is fine except she is 10 and may not entirely understand. Although I'm not sure about that because she is pretty intelligent.

19,"Hey there Reddit,

Just a HS student here having some trouble with my partner on a collaborative project. This is a major science project which takes up our entire third trimester and part of our second. It is obviously substantial. 

In the beginning of the project, I was assigned no groupmates. I was ecstatic. I understood that the profs wanted us to work together, but I couldn't have been happier. I was already started on an independent project that applied perfectly to the criteria for the assignment, so I went with it. A few weeks had passed, and this project was my baby. All my idea, all my work. I knew how things were going to go. I knew the tests I'd run, I knew the presentation I'd make, and I knew the grade I'd get. All was well. 

That is, until a group of three girls started having girl drama. They were best friends, but became angry at eachother for less than a week. Girls at my school are treated as helpless, sacred beings. They are given special privilege to make them happy in any way possible. Because of this, the group was split up. Groups were originally created based on topics of interest. When the group of girls was divided, topics of interest were not really taken into account. Two of the girls stayed together to work on a project, but one (we'll call her Julia) joined my group. Perfect.

Julia had zero interest in my project. Go figure. I was guaranteed by my mentor that my topic would not need to change, and I talked this over with Julia. Julia seemed alright with it at the time. She, being a very short-term thinker, was eager to get out of her temporary drama. I say temporary because she is now having a grand old time with the aforementioned female groupmates. All went pretty smoothly for the first two weeks; she and I worked well together, and she started to understand the project I was working on. Things deteriorated from there.

It started with little jokes. She and I would tease eachother. We were actually starting to get pretty friendly. Then began the phase of the project where we create a presentation and report. She's a very artsy-fartsy kinda girl, so she was eager to create our powerpoint. Unfortunately, she decided that Google Slides (the program that everyone is required to use) did not suit her needs. None of the mentors seemed to have a problem with it. Perfect. What do you want to use instead, Julia? Canva. For those of you unaware, Canva is a free online graphic design tool for creating infographics, pamphlets, etc. Canva also has very limited collaboration features. Long story short, I never had any way to create, edit, or just work on our powerpoint. Our powerpoint counts for over 40% of the grade on our project. Perfect.

No problem, I said. I'll just talk to her and we'll switch to something else that allows me to work on our powerpoint. Nope. She wouldn't have it. I tried to calmly explain to her that I wouldn't be able to work on what is arguably the most important part of the project, and that this was obviously a major issue. She still saw no problem. I talked to my mentor. She told me that I could just relay my creations and edits through her. This was atrocious! Being told I'm not to work on my own powerpoint? What the hell? 

Well, that was almost a month ago. Still can't work on our powerpoint outside of asking her to make edits and hoping she does. Unfortunately, she is not the most receptive to feedback. In fact, she gets angry when I give her feedback. She's nasty. She yells, throws insults, and just comes up with personal, uncalled-for shit. Profs witness this. Profs couldn't care less. I just got pulled aside for ten minutes for my mentor to tell me that I am no longer allowed to collaborate with my partner. She claimed that I was being mean to her and harassing her. Look, I'm guilty of being annoyed. I might show it more than I think. But I don't do anything close to what she does. I am not allowed to talk to her about the project in person anymore. I have to email her. I have to CC our mentor. I know that it seems like I've done something to provoke that. For all I know, I might've. But I am clueless as to what it is. 

The final presentation is a week from today, and I'm pissed. I can't do jack shit. I was tasked with writing a sixty second elevator pitch. That's it. That's all I get. This project was mine. I had the idea. I ran the tests. I got the numbers. I did the research. She slapped together a presentation that looks nice but conveys very little information. I still don't think she could interpret the results of our tests if asked to. 

How do I prevent things like this from happening in the future? Is there anything I can do right now? What should I take away from this? How do I voice my frustrations?

**TL;DR** My partner on a major group project has wreaked havoc on my work and has effectively stolen my project.

Thanks,

22,"I need advice, I hope I’m looking in the right place. Please excuse the formatting, I’m on mobile.
I work full time as a one-year old teacher at a daycare. About a week ago, I noticed an itchy rash on my arm. I happened to have a doctors appointment and they diagnosed it as ringworm and prescribed an antifungal cream. I am almost certain I picked it up at the daycare.

I let my boss know of the diagnosis and that it was being treated. I did not expect much from her as this daycare consistantly has outbreaks such as pink eye due to being lax about doctors clearance notes, and management typically recommending we do not send kids home despite fever or other symptoms. She told me she would let the parents know there was at least “one case” of ringworm in the classroom. She didn’t.

I treated it over the weekend, but when I came back to work I noticed that 8/10 of the kids in my classroom are now covered in a ringworm like rash, seemingly a lot more advanced than mine. I have also noticed it on children in classrooms that interact with mine throughout the day. These children are under 2 years old. I am at a loss as to what I should do.

Will we keep reinfecting eachother? Is there anything I can do to prevent the spread? Will the children be okay if they aren’t being treated? Should I overstep my boss’s boundaries and mention it to parents who might not be receptive? Should I be making a phone call to the Department of Health?

I love my job and these kids, but I am concerned. Thank you for reading.

28,"So I have been in shitty jobs the last four years. I graduated from a highly regarded college, full scholarship, and have a lot of potential (or at least that's what people say); intelligence, empathy. Anyway, I've worked my ass off in several creative projects outside of work that I'd hope would take off. They haven't really. I've gotten quite bitter about others who definitely don't have as much going for them, but somehow seem to move up in the world, despite either not being good people or just having that ""thing"" that I am missing.

My current job *had* the potential to turn into a good job. I am a temp that was supposed to go perm, but apparently I'm not stepping up enough for that. My boss won't fire me, just keeps me around in the hopes that I'll change (supposedly), while continuing to not really treat me like part of the team and is in general a negative energy. My other coworkers are cool though and the job itself is stable albeit boring/I feel like an outcast thanks to my boss.

Anyway, part of me is sad that I'm not included as part of the team and wants to leave, but part of me is terrified that since I am not qualified for employers (I have a very clear ""administrative assistant"" background - which I suck at by the way) - I don't want to go through the job hunting process again, especially when it's probably NOT going to be a job that is better than what I have currently. (I was fired from 2 jobs in the last 4 years) 

My ideal situation is to do something freelance/on my own terms. I'm a creative at heart but it's very hard to get noticed as a creative and I've been at it for ~2 years or so, whereas others have been 10+ years working their asses off. I feel like I'm not ready to take a gamble on making it if i might never, but the thought of having a straight office job makes me depressed. So I guess this job I'm in now would allow me to hustle that harder. But it's also just... not working a lot of the time? I'm just not an office person I think, or at least, I don't understand how to play by the rules of an office. 

I guess I don't know what to do as it seems that staying at this job sucks, whereas leaving also sucks, and I don't have any ""career"" or ""profession"" that would allow me to switch to something better suited for me, and probably wouldn't get that for 1-2 years minimum. 

I feel like a loser that my situation hasn't improved in 4 years. What do I do?",01May2018,2

30,"I'm a 25 year old woman in Chicago. Just moved back home to be closer to family. I'm in that beautiful phase where I'm in desperate need of friends but don't know how to make them without being in school. All of my friends have moved away and I'm lonely. 

To add to that I'm also a newlywed whose husband works a totally different schedule than I do. I'm an office manager (10-4pm M-F), and he's a Bartender (literally whenever, moslty nights).

We met in Austin and he and I both decided to move to Chicago after we got married, but he's doing a lot better in the friend department than I am. His friends aren't really people I (or he) want to hang out with. He's just not as picky with friends and would rather have shitty friends than wait for real ones (something he has admitted to me in the past). 

His friends are kind of racist, not goal oriented, and get high or wasted every night. 

Drinking on the daily used to be a past time of mine but it just isn't anymore. Now, I care more about getting to know people and making a real connection. Having good conversation and trusting someone. I don't want party friends who are only there for the good times. I want real friends that I can talk to (and have nights where we drink and chill and feel comfortable with each other.)

I have some work acquaintances. They're nice, but they all have their own friends and plans most of the time. 

I just want to find a few really good friends that I can call when I'm having a night like this. (Which happens more than I'd like to admit.)

Tonight is just another lonely night. My husband is working till 2am and I am cleaning my apartment, drinking wine, not wanting to go out, just wishing I had someone to chill with and talk to while I clean my apartment and feel totally comfortable with.

Am I asking for too much?

I just don't know how to navigate being an adult and making friends. 

I love my husband and our marriage is solid at the moment. I just feel like we both need really good friends and we're both struggling in that department in different ways. 

I've tried bumble and Meetup, but it feels so forced. 

Over the years I've kind of gone from a social butterfly to an introvert.

I always go to self checkout when I can because I don't want to bother anyone or actually have contact with someone who may not want to have contact with me. 

I used to love talking to people. I'm in customer service now, but I hate people now. 

I just feel lost. The one thing I feel like I have is my marriage, and now pretty much everything else (including friendships) is up in the air.

TLDR: I want a friend or two that I can feel comfortable inviting to my house for a chill night, and at the same time have deep emotional talks with, but I don't know how to do that as a 26 year old, newlywed, non student. 

Any advice would be much appreciated.",01May2018,1

35,"I'm going to try and make this as vague as possible but still understandable. 

So, about a few months ago, my friend Beverly was dating this guy named Mike. They met through our friend who plays online games with Mike. The relationship was long distance, which means Beverly and Mike never met one another. 

Fast forward a few weeks later, and Mike breaks up with Beverly. Claiming that he had feelings for someone else. Turns out that someone else was our other friend Marie. Who was flirting with Mike behind Beverly's back. The two started dating in secret, and Beverly (and the rest of the friend group which is 3 of us) didn't find out until the friend who plays online games with Mike confronted him. 

We are all deeply disappointed and mad at Marie for what she did to Beverly. We've all been friends for a while (We're in our 20s and most of us have known each other since middle/high school). So we can't grasp why she would do such a thing to someone she once considered her best friend. Beverly cut both Mike and Marie out completely. And the rest of us are no longer speaking to her

The thing is, before all of this happened, I had invited everyone to come to my graduation this upcoming summer. Beverly and the rest of the friend group are adamant about coming. And Marie said she was coming before the situation happened. 

Now, I'm conflicted on whether or not I should tell Marie she's not invited anymore. Reddit, I'm an empathetic person, so it's hard for me to put my foot down or giving not so good news. Like, I don't have a burning passionate hate for Marie. I'm just mad at what she did to our friend. And I don't want her coming because this is supposed to be a happy event. Not one where it's filled with boy drama.

I'm just wondering how I can word it because I've never had to do something like this before. I apologize if I sound like I'm all over the place, I'm just worried about the end results. When Beverly confronted Marie, Marie apologized and said she was going through a lot emotionally and didn't know how to tell Beverly. I feel like if I tell her she's not invited anymore she'll get more emotional and do something drastic. 

I apologize again, I have anxiety and this situation has been making me more anxious the closer we get to my graduation date. At first, I was hoping Marie would get the hint and not show up. But she recently liked a post of mine on facebook (I forgot I haven't un-friended her) where I mention graduation.

36,"A year ago, I voluntarily suspended my place at university on mental health grounds. My GP referred me to an early stage psychosis intervention meeting, and although they concluded I wasn’t psychotic, it was still recommended that I get the hell out of there to recuperate.

For whatever reason, I didn’t pay any of my rent at the student accommodation. I don’t know how it happened. It’s the worst mistake of my life and I hate myself for it. I buried my head in the sand and let it all wash over me. My life was a total mess at the time and I basically stopped functioning completely, lying in bed all day and sleeping to stave off feelings of terror about whatever was playing on my mind at the time. No budgeting, just living day by day in a hell of my own making. Somehow I wasn’t evicted.

I received one email notification about my outstanding balance a year ago, and since then, nothing. I decided for personal reasons to start all over again at a new university this September, after taking a year out to recover and get my life in order, and I have secured my unconditional offer there.

My question is when I can expect uni #1 to come for me about this debt, if they do at all. They can’t tell a third party about my information, so they can’t sabotage my new university place, but I’m wondering what the turn of events will be. When will they come for me? Will they do payment plans? Is it even possible for me to juggle this debt and the costs of living when I start at the new university? I want to get a part time job at my new uni to keep my mind occupied and immerse myself in a routine, but I have no idea how much of a strain having to pay this off will be.

39,"I’m 24 and never had a boyfriend. I graduated from college, have a car, a full time job, yet I can’t hold a guys interest for more than a few weeks.

Every time things seems to be alright until we have sex, then the distance starts. The games start.

I worry I’m too nice or annoying or something because the abandonment happens after an argument and it usually dealt with being stood up and me getting mad. It would turn into how it was my fault and he guy would just end up leaving.

It’s why I’m afraid of arguments. It’s sad when I talk about so freely but after it happening so many times and seeing friends with four kids and not so much as a high school diploma have men always over her.

I’m not a goody too shoes. I smoke, I drink, and I have sex. I’m not a prude or don’t judge others because they don’t have education or anything like that.

I’m sick of being used and dropped. I wanted just one person to stick around. Nobody will though. 

Yet I’m cynical because I’ve accepted that theirs something wrong with me as a female that makes nobody want me. I’ve had guys tell me to kill myself and call me the devil. Make fun of my skin condition, been called lame over a thousand times.

I’m writing this now in a movie theatere, here by myself of course watching a movie. 

At this point I’ve given up all hope of ever finding someone for me, I plan on having kids by a sperm donor before I’m 35 so I can have a family and am working on building myself to a point I can go through life alone.

I spend a lot of time by myself all my friends have kids....no one can afford to come with me to a movie, so I’m stuck doing fun things alone a lot. Most men just wanna hang out at a house rather than be outdoors and the one guy who did come to movies with me never took me on a date, we had to pay for ourselves.

41,"Hey Reddit, first time poster here so my apologies if im approaching this the wrong way. But I guess ill just give a background. 

Me and my fiance (both 21) have been together for a year now, moved in together at 2 months into my family home which is completely paid off, property too, and we arent charged rent. Im sure I could even talk it through with my father and get more paper ownership of the property. We got engaged at 6 months and she has made and given me some of the happiest moments of my life. 

We have our problems as most relationships do, her issue with me more or less is the fact that when I get defensive or am wrapped up in an argument I start to yell and eventually take my aggression out on the walls/doors. This leads to her yelling back, just as load and it constantly escalates. Ive never put my hands on her or made a move too even though in the past shes antagonized me to see if I would. She on multiple occasions has called me stupid, retarded, ugly, etc. Thats her way of getting defensive. After we talk and everything calms down ive expressed my thoughts and feelings about being called that by my partner, but the best answer ive gotten is that im the one who started yelling first. I understand yelling is a problem and Im working my hardest to control my anger. Ultimately when it comes to everything else in our lives she is the more aggressive one, like driving and dealing with other people. 

The house we live in is an old mobile and im well aware that its falling apart, parts of the floor has holes, same with the ceiling, and the electrical is messed up. While being together we havent had the best jobs so we havent had the money to make repairs. Weve attempted a gofundme but to no avail. She recently just got hired at a new job and I have an interview tomorrow close to where she works, but both jobs would only be paying around $16 an hour. She wants to move closer to work which is coincidentally also where shes from and would be closer to her mom and friends. I dont see an immediate need to move into a situation where were paying 4x in bills and would have less property and less freedom for what we want to do with it. 

She just got done telling me after a yelling match that by the end of the year she would like to move since she believes we'll be making enough money to do so, im apposed because if were making that amount of money, i see more potential in fixing or rebuilding the current house to make it livable once more. In the future weve even had talks about building a tiny/shipping container home on the property, which is why im hesitant to let it go, it would leave us with potentially nothing to fall back on if we were to lose a job or struggled with rent. (P.S. Shes grown up moving across multiple states frequently, ive lived here and went to university at which i stayed in a dorm so shes more willing to up and move in an instant i feel).
Point being, she told me even after i explained my side, that by the end of the year, shes moving out with or without me.

I dont know what to do, or if my relationship where im called retarded and told that shes tired of me on a regular basis, is worth saving or fighting for. Ive never once insulted her and boost her up when she insults herself. Is my yelling really a good enough reason for me to be insulted and made to feel like im expendable by my partner? 

Again, im sorry I ramble, its hard to fit a year of good and bad times into an advice post. But still, any help is useful. Ive made mistakes in the past with her that I've attoned for and we work through, im just not sure at what point I should stop fighting.

44,"First post (to this sub with any account), throwaway account, on mobile , gosh I’m annoying. 

So basically, I have to choose a college by tomorrow (May 1, 2018). I have options and I have no freaking clue what to do. 

I’m pretty much choosing between two places to put a deposit down on tomorrow and I can’t decide and all the people in my life are useless thus I need the internet and reddit to tell me what to do. 

I’ve put them below (with non-identifying names) with 5 pros and 5 cons each to try and be objective. Both for Chemical Engineering. 

Private Engineering University (PEU)-

Pros:

1. Have a really high job placement rate immediately after graduating and a high starting salary. 

2. They have these SPEED teams, which are super cool and seem like something that I would have a lot of opportunities to get involved with, and would open up a bunch of chances for me to do really cool 
things and get really good experience for later. 

3. They say that while it is difficult, with planning and hard work, it is possible to do both a co-op and study abroad AND graduate in 4 years where as SPU indicates that no matter what if you do a co-op graduation is pushed back by a full year. 

4. It kinda felt more like home than SPU because it was small and self contained and well homogeneous (but that’s kinda a con because the world is not homogeneous, but for me not a super big deal because I’m coming from a tiny all girls school so...) and it’s really safe (like absurdly safe, they escort kids home from skunks not creepy people...). I liked the way I felt when I was there, but the day I visited SPU was also senior prom, so take that for what you will cause I was a little distracted. 


Cons:

1. Engineering school so all the stuff that comes with that - heavily male (I’m female), if I decide engineering isn’t for me I’ll have to transfer...

2. It’s in the middle of flippin’ nowhere, it’s a hundred miles through the forest and backwoods AFTER you get off the highway. It’s in a village, not even a town, a village. The closest city is two hours away. 

3. I’m not in the honors program. There is a strong possibility of getting into their honors program sophomore year, but not guaranteed. 

4. It’s like $6,000 or so more a year than SPU (I’m getting some pretty big merit aid from both places) but there is a much higher chance of me getting an RA position because it is predominantly male and there are all female floors, which would bring the total cost down to nearly nothing once room and board are taken care of (again though, that’s not guaranteed). 


State Public University (SPU)- 

Pros: 
1. I’m in the honors college, which gives awesome housing, the ability to pick my classes early, and greater opportunity for research earlier in my college career. 

2. They are giving me a really compelling financial aid package, it’s gonna cost like $14,000, most of which is housing. There is also a really good offer included which is 4 grand to go study abroad for a semester or to do research during the summer with a professor. 

3. There’s a lot more opportunity within SPU if I find out that Engineering isn’t really for me, whereas if I go to PEU, if I don’t like Engineering I’m going to have to transfer colleges entirely. 

4. Likely that (if I don’t do a co-op or study abroad) I could manage a way to graduate in either 3 or 3.5 years because of the requirements I will AP out of and another cool option which would be to participate in a program this summer which would give me 6 engineering credits before I even get to my freshman year (completely free). 


Cons:
1. If PEU felt like a bubble, SPU felt like a puddle that everyone was stepping in and muddying up. There were a ton of people going around who weren’t SPU students. It felt grimy, like literally dirty, and it felt unsafe to be walking around alone (there weren’t even any blue assistance lights smh)

2. It’s dumb, but at my hotty -totty prestigious private high school, people look down on the SPU system. I am pretty close to top of the class, I just screwed up the whole college application process just cause I didn’t feel like applying after a huge, almost traumatic life event really early on (who wrote their common app essay over Christmas break? Oh right that’s me!) and I don’t want to be that kid who is stuck and a dead end and a disappointment in the SPU system. 

3. There are a lot more fluff requirements, I have to take multiple English classes and a few history courses, and, as part of the honors program I would have to take one extra class a semester that doesn’t pertain at all to my major (like the history of the university, or cooking etc.) whereas at PEU there is just the one required seminar first semester freshman year that is an English course. I’m lightly dyslexic so not only do these course not really interest me all that much, I also have had to work my butt off all the way though high school on the reading comprehension-heavy classes. 

4. Because it is a much larger school, it is entirely possible to become just another number and not have a many chances to become involved in as many things as I could be involved in at PEU. Because I would be one of a limited number of women at PEU, they are what to toss money and opportunities at me. SPU, not so much. The kids I have met from there indicate that it is very difficult to get super involved in more than one thing because if you don’t fully commit to something, there’s always at least 5 other people chomping at the bit to take it from you. At SPU it seems like you just kinda have to decide on one thing.

46,"So I ordered a new phone through eBay. Everything went smoothly, but when it went for delivery, I wasn't home. No biggy, I can just go pick it up at the post office. I go to the post office, sign for it. Immediately, right after I pick it up, I realize its way too light. I look to find that the package had already been opened, and hastly resealed with one piece of tape. I showed this to the post office supervisor, and she said she couldn't do anything other than giving me an insurance form. I took some pictures as proof, as well as the supervisors contact. 

When I got home, I immediately contacted eBay. The suggested I contact the seller to work something else, and if no resolution occurs in 3 business days, I can have eBay step in. I let the seller know, and he basically said he packed it well, and he is sorry to hear that and for me to go the post office for help. At this point, I don't know what to do. I'm not entirely sure if eBay will be able to step in and do anything.

What are my options? Are there things I should look out for. I looked for a place to file a claim, but USPS only has mail theft, and not package tampering as far as I can tell. Does anyone know what eBay will do in this situation?

52,"Hi guys. So, when I was in secondary school, I got the highest grades in my year at a failing school that was in special measures - 8A*s, 6As, I was highly motivated, my teachers often said that I was the brightest student they had ever come across. Many of them thought I was going to achieve some amazing things and make some great discoveries. They thought I could go to oxford. And so did I. And although I was motivated, I often got high marks without having to work hard at it. It did come naturally to me but also I wanted to do well so I think it helped. 

I went to college for two years before university and this is where it all started to go downhill. I stopped trying. I don’t know where my motivation went but I just stopped. I discovered what it meant to have a social life. I also got a bit depressed and in a bad childish relationship with a guy and it really held me back. I had an interview at Oxford but I wasn’t the same person I was in school. I didn’t believe in myself  before I even had the interview. I didn’t get in. Which is fine because there are lots of other great universities. I fell in love with a great university in a wonderful city (Bristol) and thought I was gonna go there. I messed up my a level grades and got BBC (I know I could’ve got As/A*s had I tried harder - BBC was what I got without really trying). 

Id always planned a gap year, I was so excited to travel the world. I thought this would help me get back on track. Have some time out to think and gather my thoughts and approach university fresh and ready to work hard and achieve what I know I really can.  I got into a good university in an okay city through clearing which meant I decided not to take the gap year.

Suddenly out of nowhere it was September and there I was in halls in this city I had no intention of every living in. It’s not bad and some people really love it, but it’s just not for me. It has never felt like home. I like my degree subject, I find it extremely interesting but I have felt very dissatisfied with the teaching. I’d ask questions at the end of lectures sometimes of why certain things happen - “I don’t know. You don’t need to know that for the exams”.  In some ways it felt like it was a downgrade from my college education where the teachers were more encouraging of these questions. 

My motivation dropped more. I tried even less and didn’t get the best first year grade. I’m about a month away from my second year exams and this year actually counts towards my degree. I am finally starting to work hard at it but i don’t know I just feel so lost. 

I feel like the whole two years I’ve been at this university and this place I’ve been in a bubble and avoiding being/where I’m really supposed to be. There’s nothing here for me. I’ve met some great people by being engaged in the social life sure but it’s just never felt right. 

I feel like a good idea would be to transfer maybe, to the places I really want to be, and ask some of the universities if I can do that? I really would love to live in Bristol or london. 
The problem is I’m worried I’ve left it too late with my revision this year and won’t get a good 2nd year grade so these Unis may not want me.

There is still time though and it is possible I can do well this year if I start working hard now. Maybe I can transfer and have a year out to travel first?

I don’t know but I just feel like for 2 years now I’ve been living a life that isn’t mine. Dissatisfied and lost. I’ve distracted myself with going out/partying but I feel like I need to confront that I’m not satisfied. I just feel like my high school self would be so annoyed to see who I had become ",01May2018,2

I took German in highschool. It was an easy A. I literally 100%'ed my final exam.

I currently work a job where, maybe, 90% of my co workers speak spanish. In high school people told me I'd regret not taking spanish. This is where I feel some actual regret.

What's the best way to learn? I remember a post on reddit a while back that said ""watch childrens TV shows"" to learn basic espanol. Obviously that isn't going to teach me spanish. 

What's the best way I can learn spanish? I have nothing but free time.. I work 9 hours a day, sleep 7-8. The rest of my time, I am willing to dedicate wholly to learning spanish.

Where are the resources? What are the best places to actually learn spanish that aren't some quick cash grab with cheesy educational lessons?",01May2018,1

59,"So as of yesterday I got hired for a second job in the same mall that I currently work at. I have been bringing up the fact that if hours stay where they are I will need to find a second job. My manager had no problem with this and actively encouraged me to look as I would never get more than 25 hours a week at my current job. 

So fast foreword to yesterday and I get hired at a second job. My first jobs schedule is not done in advance and I know by Thursday if I am working the following Sunday. My second job usually has their schedule done at least a month in advance. I went in today to check with my current job and let them know that I had found a second job and would be starting next week. Now next weeks schedule is not done yet so I said that they would probably write me in and I would let her know for the next three weeks what they needed me for and that after that they could pick whatever days they needed and would be given first priority. She had no problem said they could work around it and wrote down what days she would need me after the three weeks. 

However she wrote down four different days that she ""can't guarantee"" but I need to keep my schedule open for her just in case. I never work more than three days a week which I thought was strange but whatever. 

So I do my first day at my new job and it's great. The manager is super accommodating and all of my new coworkers are lovely and the vibe is much different. I could see myself being much happier and the hours are the same and the pay is nicer than at my first job. I get three weeks worth of scheduling and after my shift I head back to my first job to let her know what my schedule looks like. 

She gets really mad and starts saying how much she needs me those days and out of seven shifts she vetos four of them. I'm honestly confused at this point and say that she agreed that she could work around these first few weeks and that after these I would exclusively work at my first job on the days she wanted. She told me that she was no longer going to and to let her know if she needed to hire someone to replace me. 

I have no idea what to do from this point on. I picked up a second job because I'm going to school in September in a different province and really need to save money. I don't want to leave the second job because I'll be making more money and honestly at least so far everyone seems more open than at my first job but I've worked at my first job for over six months now and have never been faced with any situation like this before. Help?

64,"I made probably the biggest mistake I’ve ever made today when I decided to cheat on a university final. I’m enrolled in the engineering program at a smallish east coast public university. The final was for a math based class, and the night before I stupidly wrote some problem steps/equations in my calculator to use during the final. 

I didn’t even notice when my professor approached me and looked at my calculator and saw what I had put in it. He confiscated the final, I sat for a few minutes unsure what to do, and I ended up just getting up and leaving because I was obviously extremely embarrassed and honestly thought I was going to vomit as the reality hit me.

At the time it never even crossed my mind how stupid and unfair what I was doing was. I just saw it as using my calculator to help myself.
Obviously this is no excuse, and I’m extremely ashamed of this and would take it back if I could. 

I am aware that I deserve disciplinary action for this and I accept that. I’m just trying to get a sense of what I can do/what will happen going forward. I’ve been unable to eat or sleep from a combination of fear and guilt since this morning. One utterly idiotic mistake and I may have seriously screwed up my life, not to mention how poorly this reflects on my character and how terrible I’ll feel when I tell my parents about this.

I’ve looked up my university’s policy on academic misconduct, and it’s divided into tiers of severity, but this being a first offense, I’m unsure how it will be classified. 
It seems that best case scenario I fail the class and and placed on misconduct probation, worst case scenario I’m suspended from school, lose my scholarships and have to drop out because I cannot afford to be here without that money. 

Again I’m not trying to defend myself or my actions, just get some idea of how to proceed.",01May2018,1

It was amazing. Our school went to see wonder and she had me sit by here. I would consider us freinds. I even got her out of a relationship with a kid who vapes and got kicked off the football team.That’s all I ever wanted. I have depression and was on a pretty hard faze and didn’t really talk to her and we talked less and less. When I was over with my faze we talked but not at the extent at which we used too but we still talked. This is probly MY major fuck up with the whole thing. A girl at our school commuted sucide no one knew her accept the girl I liked. I didn’t even ask if she was ok. She just stared at me all day. I still feel guilty. After that SHIT GOT WEIRD. First she lied to me about dating my old freind. When I confronted her she got super mad saying she didn’t want to see me ugly face anymore and other stuff I didn’t hear. There was a play at my school and my freind was in it. I watched the in school dress rehearsal and she sat next to me. Every time I said something she would say shut the hell up and tell me how annoying I was. I asked her why she didn’t like me and she said I like u as a freind. Okay that’s great. Well while all this happens she’s very touchy with me and stared at me a lot witch I thought was just a freind thing. NEXT big event happened last Friday when she kept poking me and turning around when the annoying kid no one likes said Jill (not her name) I told bob (not my name) I didn’t hear the rest and he wouldn’t tell me. She then told me her thong was stuck in her ass weird yes (The final event happened today and I’m fucking devastated. We didn’t talk till gym and this passed week I was mad at myself for having her talk to me and not me talk to her. So I saw her in the corner and she was sitting and I said what are u doing playing with yourself. (This is my personality I’m always like this). She said uhh u looking up my shorts (witch I wasn’t) She then called me baby carrot dick. Okay a joke right. This next part fucks me up. She went into super great detail how when she looks at my dick she can’t even see it through my pants and how if it was any big she should be able to see it I said why u even looking there she basicly said because I can. She kept talking shit saying that I never send dick picks to girls and show them my dick because it’s so small the final thing she is said every time I go shopping I’ll think of your baby carrot dick. Ok I thought it was all a weird joke. I told my freind and he always called her weird and a slut. I never knew why. I guess last year she asked my other freind to fuck her.

I'm not really sure how to get it back from her because communication is difficult and the only place I can see her is in school.

72,"My last post was in r/vegas, since that's where I'm located.

tl;dr: Had a friend that moved in with me 6 weeks ago (26/F). She was down on her luck and I was trying to help her.

Fast forward: Shortly after the post, the goal was to get her to move out by the end of April (today). It's not happening. It's been about 6 weeks. Since that time, I've learned a few things:

1. This girl (26) has a number of lawsuits. From what I understand, they are both DUI related and potentially one drug related. I don't remember exactly, but the point is, she's in legal trouble. I know I should have asked more questions before having this person moving in...lesson learned...moving on.

2. Since she makes about $25K per year, no place in Las Vegas will offer her a place to live (or even Section 8 housing, rent assistance) since her income is too high. Why isn't she living somewhere else if her income is too high? She's paying a substantial amount to her lawyer every month ($1K) and just paid off her school debt ($800). Although I told her that she can't afford to pay him at the moment, because she needs to live elsewhere, she wouldn't budge because she ""has to pay her lawyer"" due to her litigation. She did it anyway and I was too weakhanded to make her do otherwise.

3. Outside of maintaining her full-time job, she is doing nothing to make progress. During these 6 weeks, she's went out many, many times with friends for drinks/fun, etc but she's not being proactive at ALL to help her situation. She had a single friend that she was planning on moving in with in two weeks, but that fell through since she just got in a fight with him. On top of all this? I spoke to her today and she's as high as a kite.

Personally, I'm disappointed in myself for letting this happen. I tried to help but this person isn't making the progress the promised they would when I spoke to them 6 weeks ago. I'm planning on doing a formal eviction with the police, with adequate notice and let her figure it out from there.

I feel like a terrible person for considering this, since I know she's been tossed out of other houses and has been subject to domestic abuse and has issues but I need to move on with life and I don't see this situation getting any better.

If there are other options (or at least thoughts about my situation), please let me know.",01May2018,1
73,"I know this sounds generic but I am a college student and I can't go over my constant feelings of loneliness and sadness.  
Back in high school, I used to have a lot of friends. I wasn't 'popular' exactly but it was rare for me to spend a weekend night alone. I wasn't always the best student in high school (kept decent grades, but didn't really try as much as I should have) and I decided that with college I was going to focus my life entirely around my career.  
Now, the school I go to is weird and operates on Trimesters, so don't be confused when I say 'quarter' instead of 'semester'.  
The first quarter seemed to go fairly well for me. I got myself involved in a minor role in a student project in my field, made friends, got a girlfriend, and was at the top of my classes.  
Second quarter, I was able to get more focused in my work. In addition to class, I took on an internship (which I frankly was not qualified for, but now looks great on my resume), which filled all of the rest of weekdays. Weekends were spent on a large new project, which I had a leadership role in, and teaching myself skills for my internship so that I could operate on the same level as the other interns. During this time, I continually alienated the friends I had made for my work, broke up with my girlfriend, and stopped doing any activities outside of the internship, project, or school in order to save time + money to work on those.  
Third quarter, I finished with the internship and now am leading two projects in addition to my schoolwork. As I finish these projects, I find myself scrambling to try to find something new to work on, because frankly, I don't have a life outside of them anymore. I don't have any friends which I regularly see besides my roommates, and they never want to go out and do anything. In two weeks I'll be 100% finished with my two projects (without time to start another one this quarter) and I dread the remaining 3 weeks where I have nothing to do.  
Is it possible to make new friends this close to the end of the year? How/where could I go to try to make friends without appearing desperate (I don't drink, so that takes out a lot of the social climate)? Should I just wait until next year and hope things get better when school starts up again?",01May2018,1

That's when she says she ""thought it was just casual"", and i respond with ""ok let's just leave it at that then"".  Her response was ""lmao ok"".

I'm guessing she has no intentions of seeing me again?  I'm graduating, but i'm going to stay in the area for like a year. Does it sound like she's open to being more or has completely no intentions?  I'm asking this because I'm not very experienced with women. I've noticed that when we first met, she would send a lot of messages, that has dwindled to nothing basically. Just only to hook up once.

I was just driving home from a quick trip to the store when I realized I passed my house on my road

I've only lived here for a few weeks now but I've driven to it a bunch during these few weeks

I turned around drove back towards it, but I passed it again

I turned around again and I could not find my house

I was confused and nothing made sense

I then saw two shadowy small animals cross the road in front of me and I know no real animal could look transparent like that. I had to have hallucinated them. 

I put my address in my GPS and it took me to my house, which was somehow 20 minutes from where I was. On the way, parts of the road had rectangular shadows on them, and it felt like my eyes just wouldn't register those sections

The road it was on looked the same as the one I swore I was just at, same exact landmarks and restaurant and everything

I am confused and scared and I feel half asleep even though I'm fully awake and I feel like my brain has lost touch with reality. I feel hazy

This isn't fake, this wasn't paranormal, I am genuinely confused and scared and don't know what to do.

80,"For years, I always felt like I have loved people way too deep and too much. Maybe to the point of smothering them and causing them to cut me off.

About 10 years ago, I lost my best friend to a car accident. It was in the middle of the night and it was raining, she was on her way home from her boyfriend’s house. 

Ever since then, when it rains I always check on my friends. If they’re at work, I ask if they’re okay. I try to text them every few hours just to check up on them and make sure they’re safe.
We had a bad storm, a huge hail storm, a few weeks ago. I asked one of my friends if he was okay and he said “yeah I’m good.” I texted about 2-3 hours later asking again if he was okay, I knew he had just gotten off work and was probably at home. He got angry and snapped at me saying “Why do you keep asking me that? I said I’m fine.”

I felt really embarrassed and small. I kind of just backed off and didn’t reply. I felt sorry for asking and felt like a burden. 

I’ve distanced myself from a lot of people since then and I feel like maybe it’s for the best. I feel like maybe I love and care about people too much and it smothers them. I know how to be alone and I am independent. I just like to know that my loved ones are okay too.


I don’t know if I can go talk to a therapist and maybe find a way to not love people as much. Or if I should accept who I am and just forgive myself. 

But, right now, I feel embarrassed and I hate who I am. ",01May2018,1
81,"I'll be concise: I've been dating my girlfriend (just finished her bachelor's degree) for the last 4 years. Her brother has been a drug dealer for the past few years. Recently, he got caught selling fentanyl. In order to hopefully get out of a prison sentencing, he decided to enroll into a trade program.

My girlfriend's mom (with whom my girlfriend lives and I live 50/50 with too) said that, despite having kicked him out of the house multiple times, that he can stay while he attends his trade schooling.

At times it works fine, but most days than not, he is pushing limits.  He always brings friends over to hang out in the shed (crack head type friends), and he's always smoking pot. He's basically an awful person to live with and he's always pushing the boundaries we've placed.


So I am in an awkward position. I live here sometimes, but I don't actually live here; I live with my parents. I am just the ""boyfriend,"" but most of all, I am scared that if I try to lay down the law, I will be bad mouthed to his friends who are, for lack of better word, gangsters.

Theres nothing id rsther do but make her happy. I'm absolutely in love with her, and enjoy every second I'm with her. Nearly two years ago I told her how I felt in the middle of her shit relationship with someone else, stupid move on my part. It just happened and I had been suppressing my feelings for so long I couldnt handle it. She revealed she had shared those feelings in the past, but those feelings were in the past, she was now committed to someone. That was pretty bittersweet, but I was happy that she was happy in her relationship, and that was enough for me. A few months pass, and it becomes obvious how unhappy she actually was. This guy was emotionally abusive and manipulative, total asshole. The horrible things that happen in her life started to multiply and grow, and she started to crumble under all of it. It was awful to watch, but I did everything I could, talking to her for hours, no matter hownlainful it was to hear all of this lain she was in because of this guy and other terrible shit in her life. One morning I get a text from her, she's on her way to a mental hospital after an attempting to take her own life. My heart stopped and my stomach was immediately sick. I worried and missed her more than anything in the three weeks that followed. She comes back, breaks up with the shithead, and readjusts to normal life. A month later, we're in her car, I end up talking about my feelings and lean forward and kiss her. Long story short, she and I plan a date for the following Friday. Date goes through, it's amazing and I get to be with her the way I've wanted to for years, we're both incredibly excited for the coming relationship. The next morning she reveals that she woke up, thought about it, and just didn't feel right being in a relationship again, the last one tore her to pieces and she wasn't ready. 5 months pass, were two months from graduation. One day after spending the day with friends, I tell her I can't graduate without her, I love her, and she's  the most important part of my life. She immediately hugs me, I kiss her, and we both share an ""I love you."" A few days after this, it's apparent that the stress of college, graduation, and the continuing bullshit in her life is stressing her out. She reveals, again, that she can't be in dedicate herself to a relationship, she loves me, but she just can't do it with everything going on. And now, finally, here's what I need advice with: I love her, Reddit! can't graduate and potentially lose her.

85,"I feel like my heart is breaking and there’s nothing I can do about it because I don’t know how I can help my little brother. My brother has always been in and out of trouble. He’s never been good at communicating and interacting with other children while growing up. And other kids realized that and would mock or avoid him. He would give them his toys or our stuff so they would become his friend and that still hurts me everyday. My brother can’t live on his own and he never will be able to. He has an intellectual disability but my parents haven never been able to accept it so they never got him diagnosed properly.

He was 18 and still in high school when he met a girl who went to school with him and claimed she liked him. She was 16. He had a job working at Fedex and he spent all his money on her. She would sneak into my dads place while he was at work and they would talk and hangout. He has never touched her or had any kind of sexual contact with her and she admitted to that in court as well that he has never harmed her or touched her. 

One day she sent him nudes. And he showed one of his “friends”. She found out and told her parents. The police came and arrested him and the court wanted to put him away in prison for 25 years. 25 fucking years. My dad took the last of his money in his 401 K to pay for my brothers lawyer fees which came out to over 25 K. The lawyer got the sentence down to 2 1/2 years but my brother has to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life for sharing nude photos of someone two years younger than him. 

I’m not saying what he did was right because it was wrong and stupid but to send him to prison and label him as a sex offender kills me. My brother is never going to get a good job or go to school. He’ll never be able to take his own kids to school or watch them play in the park. He’s 19 now but from now on he’ll only just be seen as a black man who is a federal convict and sex offender. I found out today and I hurt so much. I fear for his safety, I fear that he won’t be the same when he gets out, I fear for his heart because he has a big and loving heart. He told my mom not to tell me so I wouldn’t cry and he in his own way tried to cheer me up over the phone by saying he’ll be a wolf while in there. I cried harder because I don’t want him to fight anyone and I don’t want anyone to hurt him. He’s a big guy and I’m afraid people are going to try to test him but he can’t fight and he’s just a child underneath all of that 6 2’ and 290 lb exterior. 

I haven’t seen him in a couple of years because I live halfway across the country and I don’t have the money or opportunity to visit. My work doesn’t allow me to and the money I have goes towards support myself, my mom, and my other brother. 

My dad told me I have to be strong for the family because I’m the oldest and that I need to get my future on track because one day dad or mom are not going to be here and I’ll need to take care of my brother for the rest of his life and be there for my youngest one. I’m only 21 but I feel so old most days. I don’t find anything I used to enjoy interesting anymore and I can barely get out of bed most days. I hurt and I just hurt.  I’ve been working on my depression for years now but I think I might just break and I know that it’s selfish and it would destroy my family if I did that.

87,"Good evening guys this is my first Reddit post don't dig into me too much haha. Got sick of lurking and I'm kind of in an emotional pinch that I don't want to go ask my friends advice for. Long detailed paragraph below. tl;dr at bottom. Hook me up please. 

So I've been in love with this girl since high school and we've gone our separate ways now, but I still always think about her. She used to reciprocate those feelings, but I turned her down because I thought she'd be happier with a different person and I went on to go date other people with her at the back of my mind. I haven't really been into other relationships because of it. We're still good friends and share the same friend group and continue to communicate. She's dating someone else I dislike now, but I've said nothing about it and continue to support it. He's kind of a deadbeat/shitbag, but he makes her happy so I just drive on. Yet I still love her. To the point where she's financially unstable and I hook her up with money to help her out at my expense. \(I'm doing okay financially don't worry\). Her birthday is at the end of May and I've been thinking about getting a ticket to fly out and surprise her. Should I just go as a friend even if it hurts? Would it do me good to see that she doesn't care about me that way? Is she taking advantage of me? I don't know anymore. I'm a pretty strong person, but she's my weak point. It's starting to have effects on my mental health and I don't know if I should go at all. I'll probably make my own decision, but you guys could offer thoughts and advice maybe to push me in a certain direction. I'll probably update  on what I end up doing and the aftermath next month. Also I don't know if it matters, but someone else wants me to visit them and is actually totally into me so should I just go see her instead? This will be a four day trip either way. The bros all tell me I'm an idiot and not to bother/that it is a waste of money. Would it be better for her if I didn't visit? Sorry if I've been wordy. This just hurts me so much and I'm at my wit's end. 

tl;dr I want to go visit a long ongoing love interest for her birthday. She is dating someone. Go to as just a friend/to confirm that is all I will ever be to her or go to visit someone who is actually interested in me and just try to move on without that. Go face the pain or let sleeping dogs lie?

Then she went to apologize to my mom saying that her daughter's boyfriend who lives there too, claimed the kids stole money from his car. He said that my mom saw them doing it and told him. My mom or anyone in my family had no idea he existed. I'm very upset that he did that we don't want to get involved with there problems.

She ended up paying his girlfriend 700$ and had screaming match with her daughter back at home. The sons from then on have continued to glare at my mother then the following day all of my father's tools had been stolen.

What we know they've done before

* Thrown there trash to our yard.

* Thrown motor oil to our newly painted exterior walls


What we think they've done

* Scratched our vehicles with keys. 

* Enter our yard when we aren't there. My dad has found lighters that don't belong to anyone in the house, and other random stuff. 

* Stolen my dad's tools

* Thrown rocks at our dogs

I think they are going to want to rob us again. We are too poor to buy security cameras, we are trying though. What should we do? One of the kids a drug dealer too. I'm worried about doing something then my family being repeatedly targeted. What should we do?",01May2018,1
89,"This will be long, but I'd appreciate you reading the whole thing. Currently 21 years old. I am a classical musician studying at one of the best music schools in the world. It's great I love what I do, but I have this feeling of wanting to do something else. It's not that this feeling came out of nowhere, it's something I've thought about seriously in the past. I've been through a lot in life, and have experienced a lot. I would love to be able to focus and commit to two things, but in reality you can't, you have to focus on one thing and put your all into it in order to make something of it \- thats the way I see it. I'm graduating in the winter and I'm thinking of pursuing this other ""thing"" while still maintaining my music career as I need to make money and I want to continue to grow and use this to connect with different people and to gain experience and opportunities. Now youre probably wondering what this other passion of mine is. It is rapping. This is not a joke, 100&amp;#37; serious. I've been freestyling for a year and not to mention, I've been listening to rap my whole life. I love it and I think I have some talent for it. I'm just sick and tired of the rap industry or just the music industry in general, where these young rappers are looked up to but they are complete shit \(Lil Pump...etc..you get the picture\). You can disagree with me or say I'm wrong or that I don't know what I'm saying, but they literally talk about stupid shit but people like it. I have ideas that I feel can bring a new sound that no one else has heard. With my music background, I have a lot of knowledge of how to compose stuff than most people. But at the same time, I don't know. I don't know what to do. I'm pretty lost right now. I want to do something that is exciting and not just the same thing everyday. I want to make money because you need money to be happy in this world \(I dont want to be dirty rich, but you need money to be happy because society revolves around money now and you need it\). I know this is a big rant and I'm just rambling on but its late and I'm just typing what comes to mind. ",01May2018,1

91,"I don't know where to ask this question so I guess I will do it here.

I have 2386 followers on my blog about cinema/movies and I mostly reblog stuff but I posted stills/screenshots and movie list etc as well (I am planning to do more tho).

Even if the number of followers is decent, I get really little activity on posts.

The posts that gets attentions for the most are gifs/stills or lists that I reblogged or made myself but text posts get really few notes (like for example when I ask if they want to see x thing or y thing).

They never send me asks or interact so much, only a few replies in posts or a few messages like 'I love your blog!'.

What can I do about this? Do you think many of those followers are spam bots/porn blogs?

Or the problem is that I don't post so much my own stuff and I reblog things made by other for the most?

92,"Ok so can someone read whats happening and tell me if I should be worried/weirded out? \(pls keep reading until end\) Ok so I need to give a little background information for it to fully make sense, I've been seeing this therapist for a little over a year now and when I originally first went to him I only went for 3 weeks and stopped seeing him for 2\-3 months because I told my family I didn't like him and it just wasn't helping me \(I was 17 at the time\) then a few months later I kind of was going through a hard time and was thinking a therapist would help but I didn't want to go back but my family really thought this guy was good and would really understands me and would help me the best \(I really Never knew why they liked him so much\) so, a couple months ago \(starting oct 2017\) I started seeing him once a week  it stayed that was for a while, fast forward to about two months ago I told him I only needed to see him once every two\-three weeks because I honestly thought I was feeling better about it.  he ended up telling once every two weeks was better for me.. so every time I see this guy he talks a lot about himself and I always thought this was a psychiatrist tactic \(things like I used to be in a band and his hobbies and his family life, honestly some of it got personal he told me about his relationship with parents\) , he also tells me things like I can text whenever I need advice or something goes wrong, again, I just thought this was a normal psychologist thing that they sometimes offer. So about a little over a month ago he asked me what School I went to and what classes I was taking \(AGAIN, NORMAL\) . Then this is when some weird stuff started happening.. The next appointment he asked me the question so you have class today? but the thing is ive never told him what day I have class ,So I didn't think anything of it at first I was just like huh thats weird but didn't look into it.. 3 days ago I was in a grocery store thats never really packed and not popular \(I like going there for that reason its right by my house anyways\) and I saw my psychologist there.. but the thing is, he lives 45 minutes away from where I live. so he ended up walking out with me and he was parked right by me he has this weird blue square car its so easy to spot and thats when it hit me.. every day when I go to my car after school the same blue square car is two spots away from mine. When I put the pieces together I started realizing just how strange this guy really is and so I just asked my mom why did they like him so much bc I was curious and she said he contacted them when I stopped showing up that I was really troubled and that ""I really opened up to him and he thinks he can help me"" .

96,"Long story short.

His gf and he have been together for 3 years. She has 4 kids from a prior relationship and claims to love them. All she does is yell at them and belittle them. Regardless they have turned out to be good children now in their tweens. My brother has bonded with them and loves them. He is not a perfect person, he had problems with the law but he got back on his feet. More importantly he takes care of them all. The problem herein lies with his gf. She has constant drug addictions to meth. She is unhappy with herself, she cant keep a job any longer than 3 months, she gets off the bandwagon does meth everytime. My brother starts arguing because shes on drugs, she starts arguing back about their relationship. He leaves. She begs him to come back when shes SICK off the drugs, and only says sorry come back because the bills do not get paid.   

Shes an ok person when shes not on drugs, i mean shes still loudmouthed and immature but i guess shes ""ok"" to a standard. Im sick of my brother constantly rescuing her. Shes just manipulative and i believe the only reason my brother comes back is because of the kids (1 child is biologically his). He says shes okay when shes not on drugs but i dont see her stopping anytime. Her whole family has problems. She doesnt really know her dad. She only talks to her mom. Her brother is in prison, one of her brothers is gay with aids, she has like 4 or siblings, the list goes on. She is not a stable person. Shes unhappy with herself, and drugs are her way of coping. She doesnt deserve him, but i dont know how to tell him its a lost cause. That hes never going to build anything with her. That its a waste of time. That no matter how much he loves those kids or no matter how much of a tragedy it is that theyre not his biological children and he has no rights to them. Its his choice for who he wants to be with and i have no right to butt into his relationship but this just gets me angry and gives me anxiety. Im tired of seeing my brother building his family, trying to get a foot up and her just dragging everything to the ground. He just lost a good paying job that he was happy having. All because of HER.

99,"My ex and I broke up back in March and it wasn't nasty per se but his subsequent behavior was just crappy and getting worse and over the weeks I came to realize he utilized gaslighting and manipulation to get me to stay until he decided to call the shots and break up with me. His ego is through the clouds and I feel sick and anxious just thinking about having to speak to him.

It's been a week since we last spoke over a call, he moved back internationally to his parent's place after 3 years of our relationship, just wanted to toss it all out. We also used to work together and lately I realized we couldn't even keep that going because of his toxic bossy behavior, he thinks shitting on people when they don't quite do exactly what he wants is a way to lead; he made me cry after I barely learned a new software in 4 days and couldn't quite deliver (I thought I did a good job for my experience level), threatening with firing me (""don't think it's not on the table just cuz i've known you this whole time""), it was just plain abusive, so I just quit. Best to salvage our relationship. I told him I would just want to utilize the Adobe programs though (it's subscription based) when he wasn't, and he agreed it was ok, that I should keep working on it. I cannot afford the monthly sub and it's literally my livelihood.

This last call (on the 18th) ended poorly. He pulled his typical puppy dog voice and pet-names to butter me up and all the bs he did when we were together (I was disgusted, because I then realized it was all false, manipulation that he was using this whole time I knew him), he pressed me to tell him what was bothering me and I told him I couldn't tell him (I knew it would trigger his anger), but he insisted. So I told him what was up: I was still very bitter, pained and traumatized from the shit he did, various things in the past he would repeatedly do, SOMETIMES apologize then do them again (yelling, insulting, explosive shit, I would have to be extremely passive when asking him for anything) and the worst bit of it all: just dropping our years-long relationship in seconds and bailing, never even hinting that he wanted to leave.

And he quickly changed moods, angrily told me ""I feel no remorse for it, I don't need to keep apologizing, get over it"". I blocked him from several social media but he beat me to another app and messaged that he didn't care if I blocked him, that he didn't need me to make him feel guilty or tell him how to ""lead"". Having to hear that from the person I worked so hard to open up to and trust, was more difficult than I could imagine. He ended the call with a grumbling ""I'll talk to you later"".

And he hasn't contacted me since, which I must say is odd. His ego does not make him comfortable with cutting any exes off ""burning bridges"" (he still has one on facebook who he never fought with, he never posts or contacts anyone on FB so she's just there doing her own thing). He claims I'm his most serious partner and that he ""loved me"", but at this point I'm not sure what's real anymore. At this point I don't care, he never really cared about others, I know he coerced me into shit including guilting me into stuff (like sex), and I am only concerned about one thing... that is still having access to the programs he claimed he had no issues with me using, and if possible maintain a civil acquaintanceship with this person.

This sounds stupid and probably really like a strange request, but what would you guys do in this situation? Would you reach out first and just make small talk to ease the storm or wait for him first? ",01May2018,1

102,"After 5 years, I (M,24) have recently gotten into a relationship. Prior to a few nights ago, I had never experienced going to a bar or club with a significant other. It didn't really go well and this was moderated by the fact that I was fairly drunk at the time. I had witnessed some other guy buy my partner a drink while we were both waiting in line at the bar, she had managed to get ahead of me and I was stuck watching the whole thing and shoved my way up to the front to order. On a rational level I have no problem with that and am totally not possessive and all for getting free shit and am generally a really chill person. Being as inebriated as I was, however, I got really insecure and pissed off both as a general mood and at my partner. It didn't really escalate beyond that besides me telling her that I was upset and mad at her and subsequently leaving her at the bar with our other friends. I don't remember doing any of this and ""browned out."" When I came to, I was wandering the streets still pissed and thinking that I was abandoned. I called a few dozen times trying to figure out what was going on and sent some shitty texts. I learned the next morning that I was the one that wandered off and that my partner had came looking for me but wasn't able to find me, which put both myself and her at risk since we were kind of wandering the streets at night. Luckily she had been picked up by our other friends and I remained MIA doing my own thing. 

I've been fairly bothered by this because prior to this I've never had a night drinking where I've gotten pissed off at someone (I do wander off frequently). It's made worse by how I handled it (shitty texts, too many phone calls), and I really want to come at this from a point of self-improvement. Is this a one-off event that gets better with time and exposure or should I be taking proactive steps to manage any deep-rooted insecurities I might have? I'd really love to hear feedback from anyone whose gone through similar situations and how they've handled it as well as what they think I ought to do. I think it's at least a decent step forward in recognizing how much of an issue this is, and the last thing I want is to either a.) lose a really great girlfriend because of my own immaturity or b.) not be able to go-out and drink because of my own immaturity. 

Also, yeah, I was totally an asshole. ",01May2018,2

107,"Every time me and this one specific friend get into just some back and forth that’s not even serious he instantly takes it serious and starts telling me i can’t talk shit because “I can’t talk to girls” even when it’s all a joke. He then proceeds to make shit up on how I get super red and stutter. Which is completely false. I’ve never had a class with him until this year so he has never really seen me talk with anyone because we were always in different classes. He also probably just thinks this because one of the only interactions he has seen with me and a girl was 2 years ago with my crush and I wasn’t expecting it. It was awkward and I was a sophomore in high school, clearly I’ve grown up a bit.  I have friends that are girls but none of them are super close to me. I can’t do much about that because most of them are in completely different social circles than me so we never carried much conversation outside of class. What am i supposed to do about this? Lately he’s been coming off as a dick that thinks he’s better than everyone in the group and I don’t know how to respond to any of it because I feel like if I try to confront him about it he’s gonna go back to the same thing saying I can’t talk shit because None of my close friends are girls.

109,"Back in like June of 2014, I met a girl online and we started talking over KIK or something. I was like 13, and she was 14. She told me she liked me one day and I said it back since I felt the same way. We became more attached over time, despite it being a long distance relationship. I liked her so much that I was about to buy her a plane ticket and take her to prom once. She told me how much she loved me, and how much I meant to her, and how she wished she was with me, suddenly no communication. During late 2015, we got caught up in our own lives. She got a job and I was playing sports so we disconnected for a while. One of the last times when we talked was when she said happy birthday to me, and she didn't really break up with me, we just suddenly stopped talking. She left me hanging, and I never got a chance to move on.

It's been 2 years since we talked and I still think about her. I miss the times we had together and how happy she made me. Every now and then, I'll think about texting her back to get some closure. I stop myself though because it might open some old wounds and I feel like shes already moved on so she'll just ghost me again. She's 18 now and going to graduate high school soon, and I’m going to be a senior next year. Its been a rough 2 years, and Ive almost moved on, but something is holding me back.

111,"Background: My first husband had a past that included mental illness and drug abuse but he'd cleaned up by the time I met him and I went into the relationship with no idea about his past. Shortly after our daughter was born, he relapsed (cocaine and booze) and gradually became violent and abusive to the point that I packed up and left him when she was 3, because he threw her down the stairs for trying to talk to him while he was watching sports. He'd hit me, shoved me around, and threatened me on many occasions but that was the final straw and I wish I'd been smart enough to leave sooner. Luckily she wasn't seriously injured (a few bruises but otherwise fine) and we got out of there before anything worse could happen. He then stalked me for YEARS after the divorce. He would move as close to wherever I was as he could get and show up unexpectedly, starting all kinds of drama and generally making our lives a living hell as much as he possibly could. He always excused it by saying he wanted to see our daughter but he would spend the whole time harassing me for leaving rather than paying attention to her. He only finally left us alone when after several years, I took the chance and started dating a new guy, who wound up being absolutely wonderful, and I think ExH was scared of him so he disappeared. He never even called to talk to our child or anything -- it's been about 8 years now. 

So of course he keeps trying to friend me on social media and just today I see he's made an Instagram account and tried to follow me, and out of curiosity I looked at the photos and it's clear he's seeing a very young girl who looks to be in her late teens/early 20's. He's in his late 40's now and was ten years older than me when we were together, I was 19, and I think he likes young girls because they don't know what kind of red flags to look for and such. I am SO TEMPTED TO WARN THIS GIRL. I know that as of now, of course, it doesn't appear there's any children involved or anything but I wish someone had warned me about him before I married his ass back in the day.

114,"The rundown:
I’ve been depressed ever since I can remember. It’s basically part of my personality. I grew up numb and depressed always feeling like an outsider. But it’s only gotten worse and it’s affecting my life. I’m sick and tired of watching the days pass by as I lay in bed. I need change and I need it now. I can’t bring myself to get up. I can’t bring myself to LIVE. I need help. 

The problems:
I keep neglecting my responsibilities. Skipping class. Not visiting family for months on end. Not cleaning my room or taking care of myself. I never eat until I’m practically dying from hunger. I’m terribly self conscious. I can’t ever enjoy myself with people and even sometimes alone. I’m constantly numb or in a deeply melancholy state. I feel dull around everyone. Everyone and everything sucks the life out of me. 

When I’m alone my mind goes wild and I’m happy. I want to be my upbeat intelligent charismatic self with people. That all disappears as soon as I open my mouth. I forget everything and become blank minded. What’s wrong with me? I just want to be normal. Simple. Why am I complicated? 

What needs to change:
My social life gives me a headache. I’m basically a prime example of an introvert who’s lacking in social skills due to the isolation I experienced as a child. I also endured lots of mental and physical abuse that left me a broken self conscious mess of a person. Simultaneously I’m proud of myself because of the hardships I overcame and experience I have gained in my &gt;20 years on this planet. I’m a confusing being. I don’t understand myself. I should be proud. No one knows what I’ve overcame but I DO. For some reason I can’t ever bring myself to feel proud and put aside my self doubt. 

Everyone else celebrates themselves all the time over simple accomplishments. Everyone else seems cocky over nothing. Everything I do is never enough for me. I’m not good enough for myself. I’m not living up to my potential and I know it and it kills me everyday. 

All I ever do is focus on the bad. No matter the subject/situation I’m always ruminating on the problem. I wouldn’t say I’m a negative person though because I see a good way to solve everything but I’m constantly in problem solving mode so I’m constantly figuring out stressful things when I should be being happy and living in the moment. 

Then I miss all those once in a lifetime moments and ruminate over that too, causing me to miss more.

I also think too much about my past. I’d like to say I’ve let go. I’d like to say I’ve forgiven them. But I haven’t. Not fully. Not yet. There’s something deep down in me that’s broken and I don’t know if it’ll ever be fixed. I feel as though my soul has been lashed with a whip over and over again. That deep aching sting in my chest visits me everyday no matter how hard I try to avoid it.

TLDR:
I’m in a perpetual state of overthinking. I’m a chronic over thinker who will one day think myself to death. It keeps me in bed all day away from my responsibilities which makes the overthinking worse. I can’t get out. I can’t LIVE. Send help. I’m drowning and I can’t make it much longer. 

How do I get out of that mindset? ",01May2018,1
115,"Hey Reddit. Recently (or.. for the past few years) my younger sister (age 14) has been coming home every day traumatized by the amount of bullying she faces at her school. For example, today, My sister walked into her math classroom slightly late as she had been at a meeting with the deputy principal about bullying. The usual two lovely girls she sits with (and give her no grief) had gone and sat at another table with one of the bullies. My sister walks into class, sits in her seats and signals to her two friends to come on over back to her table. The friends were about to pack their things and move, but the socially more popular bribed the two friends with some boring popular stuff in return that they don't go sit with her because ""She is a stupid fat bitch, and deserves to be left alone 24/7"". This is just one of many reasons my beautiful 14y/o sister who gives no others grief, listens in class, doesn't do stupid shit and doesn't act cool to try and gain attention, comes home balling her eyes out with tears. It is not fair and no one should be receiving such hate. I have recently just found the name of the primary bully. I'm not implying if I should go get physical or verbal with her, but if there are any other things I should do to support the situation. It has been going on too long and myself (a 18y/o older brother) should not have to feel distressed about the state of her mental well being at such a young age.

127,"So I'm 17 and heading off to college soon and have a problem that many my age do. Here's a little backstory of me as a kid:

So I was always interested in science and wanted to be a scientist. I took apart electronics and asked a lot of questions . I had built a crappy fan. I also liked art and put a lot of time practicing it and imagined being better at it in the future. I also made dumb videos and created anything I thought was cool or funny like forts or games to play  with my siblings. I love\(d\) shock humor and dark / dirty jokes and also love deep questions and thinking about life. So, when I was 10 I learned Scratch and Alice and made games and animations. I just tried a bunch of things that was creative and cool until I was 13 and tried to stick to something.

At 13 I made a fake virus and trolled my dad using microsoft Batch scripting. I thought it was cool and funny and ended up looking into making games. It was very difficult and I tried grinding learning and spent tons of time working on it. I eventually made a game within that year and nobody really cared about it. I never really worked long and hard on one thing like that before. It was several days though only if I remember correctly. I liked tech so continued and tried to create ideas but programming things takes fucking time. These days I'd spend 5\+ hours a day on something like a job. The problem is, I'm not sure I enjoy it anymore. I'm getting no personal reward and am imagining how games aren't appreciated much for being deep \(I follow Jonathan Blow's work\). I don't even like most games and it's a hassle to even try them out. So it's like, maybe this isn't my thing. But I look around at people who did good at what they pursued and when I compare it to myself, I started young with programming and games but it feels like I didn't get into the right thing. Or I didn't figure out how it's the right thing. 

A few weeks ago I got pretty depressed with the lack of progress and reward from starting another game project \(I don't really have friends besides some people i talk to online in discord\). I tried making music and liked it, but got the frustration of making something that wasn't of the quality I wanted like in games and started stopping it. I noticed I got a personal reward when I shared it to some online friends and they kinda liked it. A game would take me months and anybody who would play it wouldn't think much of it. But looking at other artists, they were inspired and touched by music at younger ages. I've found artists recently that most my age listened to years ago. I feel quite out of the loop and like I haven't tried things. I thought I was getting ahead working hard on the public idea of success but lost sense of self.

So I've been considering animation and film making since It seems like a better medium to express my thoughts, ideas, and imagination. Movies and T.V shows always were things that inspired and/or touched me. But I'm getting a lot of doubt thinking about how others seem to have a feeling for what they are meant to do. I just want to know and pursue it as hard as possible so I can do well but also have people see something I really believe is quality and interesting / touching / inspiring. Any thoughts or ideas? I seem to take 1 step forward and 2 backwards when trying to understand myself.",01May2018,4

130,"I fucked up.

I have a long distance friend with benefits and we hung out once and it was lots of fun. About two weeks ago, I asked her if she wanted to hang out again and in the middle of us making plans, she stopped responding to my texts. I took this as a sign that she was being flaky or not interested.

Today, I texted her again (not inviting her) and she responded by letting me know that she didn't have to work all week. I was busy with an art show, so I had to decline.

But moments later I sent another text: ""I didn't enjoy being ignored last time we tried to make plans, so maybe hanging out again is not a great idea.""

She immediately responded by telling me that she's been spending much of the last few weeks in the hospital with her grandpa who was dying and passed away.

I apologized immediately and told her that when I didn't hear back from her, I assumed she didn't want to hang out again. And she responded by telling me that wasn't the case at all, but that she was in a bad place mentally and wanted to wait a while before reaching out again.

I feel terrible. I immediately tried to send a funny photo of a shirt I bought, but that obviously was ill advised and not well received.

I want to give her space. But I would be torn to pieces if I ended up ruining this relationship over a single stupid text message. I'm planning on a sending a second, more elaborate apology in a few days, but I'm not sure if that's the right move.

133,"Later last year I was hospitalized for what I'll blanket under ""suicidal tendencies"". It resulted in a bit of a fiasco and a heated argument in the ER but I ended up staying in a facility for a week regardless.
Stuff like this isn't uncommon, especially now. Me and my brother (5 years older than me) are getting along OK, but we both work and don't see each other much, and we used to fight a lot about me going to school but that's not an issue anymore. For a while, a few years ago we talked about our issues together and whatnot, but I'm not sure much came out of it. A fight and a few months of me living with my dad and now we don't talk except for chitchat anymore really. But at least we don't fight. He was drunk a while ago and scared the shit out of me but I don't really hold that against him. It did shake me up a bit though and I do get nervous around him.
My mom works from pretty much 9am to 8pm, and we don't talk much mainly due to language barrier. My parents divorced when I was young and was never taught her language. She usually just yells at me about my messy room and laundry but I can handle that. Recently, and I mean VERY recently she got a boyfriend and he's already planning on moving in to our very small apartment, and I'm very uncomfortable about it. A few months ago when they first started dating, she'd be out of the house for days at a time and not come back. Were all older kids, I'm the oldest at just barely 18, but it still bothered me. Me and my brother work part-time mid-wage jobs and there was a period of time we went almost a week without food in the house, because she was always gone. It was annoying having to very suddenly shift over into pretty much living/spending/eating for myself. I know I'm giving my mom a rough time but she's only been dating this man for a few months and I don't like that they're moving so quickly (my dad got engaged to my stepmother TWO MONTHS after MEETING her) and I almost know she's only doing it because she wants to move into a house one day. Regardless, I've stopped getting angry about it, but she still says very few words to me these days. The other day I said hello to her multiple times and she only responded to me after I began to appear annoyed. It hurt me quite a bit. Also, during said ER visit I mentioned earlier, she was complaining a lot about how tired she was and how much she wanted to leave, which I understand, but she was never like that during hospital visits I used to have when I was physically ill.
My sister that I live with is actually my half-sister. She's 28 and autistic. I didn't grow up with her but I dont remember us fighting or anything as young children. I didn't even see he much when I used to live with my father and came up to visit my mother over the summer, I'm sure she used to live with some church staff members. The last two years or so she's been living here, and I would not mind so much if she wasn't so rude to me. She sleeps right outside my room and I can hear everything she does, and what she mainly does is watch videos either on the TV or her phone. Sometimes I ask her to turn it down for one reason or another but she just complains about it and then doesn't let it go for the rest of the day. If she knocks on the bathroom door and I say ""one minute"" she'll sigh loudly and stand on the other side of the door until i get out. Sometimes she'll get so annoyed at something I'm doing she'll call my mom. if not my father that lives 3000 miles away. I usually don't talk about it because I'm scared I'll get called ""ableist"" or something along the line, but she really isn't nice to me unless someone is around to notice it.
I'm sorry if this isn't the best worded post I could write out, but I think it gets the point across. Maybe I'm just a bitch, but I just think my family is fairly stoic and I'm just very, very sensitive and it causes conflict. Has anyone dealt with anything remotely similar? I can't relate to any of my friends these days. Lately, I'm really letting this get to me, but I think I'm moving on from it. Any words are appreciated.",01May2018,1

I’ve done multiple educations (finished one; Aviation) and currently studying Nurse.

As you can tell, I’ve clue where I’m going.

137,"Here we go.

The job I currently have, I enjoy doing, however it isn't in the field I studied at University(marketing major) and I had just figured I'd lost my chance to move in that direction. This job I currently have is for a large well established company with all the bells and whistles that come with working for a company like that. (Fancy lunches, massages at work etc)

I wasn't thinking about leaving as there are internal career progressions that will occur if I stay with them for several years.

Recently I was contacted about a new position at a small company in the same industry as the one I currently work at for a marketing role. It essentially fell in my lap.

The role sounds very exciting since the company only started business 3 years ago and they are growing rapidly. Essentially they don't have anyone to manage their marketing and are interested in hiring me. The pay is also higher and from the talks I've had with the director of the company, getting my foot in the door while they're still very small will give me heaps of career options and my position will evolve as they grow.

While this new role sounds super exciting I'm just wondering if anyone has made a similar move from a big company(500-1000 staff) to a smaller one (10-20) and whether it was a good one.?

Any advice is appreciated

However, I have gone away to college and we have been doing the long distance thing, but i met someone here. I became friends with this girl and we became best friends immediately, and hung out almost every day for the past semester. Iv had feelings for her since the beginning but always suppressed them due to the fact I was in a relationship and I did not feel she was interested back. However, as time went on it got harder and harder to suppress these emotions. Some stuff happened where I knew I was not going to come back to school here so I decided fuck it I owe it to her to tell her because I might not see her again, And literally as I was about to tell her she told me she was in love with me. I am now obviously at a crossroads because I do not know what to do. I love my girlfriend and I feel it is unfair to her to leave her for someone else I may love, but is it fair to myself to use that as a reason?

However, I realized quite some time ago that that's crazy hard to do. I can't really get any friends to share a place with me since they're all in school, and the shitty part time job I'm working barely gives me more than 15 hours a week. Is it too much to go rural? The cheapest apartments around here are $1200 a month, who knows what that includes. Where I used to live our house was almost half of that (you can imagine how far away from civilization we were). I'm scared going rural would make getting a job harder, and I in no way have money to get a car, I'm already paying for a lot of my own things (food, mainly) right now, and as cheap as I eat I still can't save enough.

Of course she stopped coming around that same time and only shows up about once a year now. Last time I talked to her was about a year ago and I told her how I felt right before she left. She was in a relationship and shit but I really was only trying to tell her how I felt with no intention. She was really cool about it and everything and didn't seem to have an issue. But the issue I have is that I haven't talked to her in any way at all. She doesn't do social media and I tried to text what I thought was her number from 2 years before but no response.

And if I do email her, any advice on the best way to phrase my concern? I've had some icy cold professors during my time at school so I'm a little uneasy and unsure about the best way to go about it.

165,"Recently I’ve started deep cleaning my apartment to prep for my move out in August. For the past year I’ve been rooming with a girl my age, let’s call her Hope. She really nice and we have a lot in common, but since I’ve started this deep clean I’ve grown to dislike her because of her absolute disrespect for this apartment.
Hope moved in last year when my old roommate moved out and I was in need of another co-signer. We had only met once before she signed onto the lease with me and it was just to give her more details about the apartment and see if we got along well. At first I thought her untidiness was just from the chaos of moving but she just left messes everywhere and didn’t pick up after herself, throw away trash, do dishes, or keep the common area generally picked up in any way. These apartments aren’t that great and with it being the south as well, there were some roaches during the summer. My roommate was so messy though, it only made the roach problem worse and even her cleaning up and having pest control stop by didn’t help.
Hope moved out a couple months ago to live with her boyfriend but will continue to pay rent until the lease is up (even though she really wants to end it early and I’m in no position to move to my new place). She’s never here anymore but still left a huge mess and I’ve found out that some of my own items I have in the common areas are ruined.
Over the past weekend I rented a rug doctor and bought deep cleaning solution because the carpet is stained from all the times her dog had an accident on the floor and it either sat there or wasn’t cleaned enough. I also found out my nice tea and hand towels are caked in crud and haven’t been washed and I was forced to throw them all away. The couch in the living room is over 40 years old and was given to me in perfect condition but one of the cushions was flipped to hide a big tear in one of the corners (which can be fixed but upsets me it was damaged and I wasn’t told). 
I also texted Hope to let her know I was throwing away everything in the fridge and she claimed she already had. I don’t keep anything but butter in the fridge, but her entire side was filled with expired dairy products and moldy fruits and vegetables. She also left the pantry completely stocked with old snacks and half used boxes of pasta and rice. I also discovered the extent of the roach infestation from last year, and my significant other spent hours cleaning roach poop and dead roaches from the cabinets. The living room was also covered in Hope’s junk, from old receipts to dog medicine and toys, unmatched socks and a single ballet flat, wrapping paper and posters. I just stacked it all up in the corner of the room.
We’re both responsible for the apartment as a whole and I’m trying not to get charged for anything but it’s hard to want to clean all of it knowing she kind of ditched the apartment and left a huge mess. Between my SO and I, we spent close to $100 on supplies for cleaning this past weekend. How do I bring all of this up to my roommate? How do I address the cleaning, the supplies, and my damaged stuff?
I have a feeling she doesn’t want to come back here until she absolutely has to to grab the last of her stuff, but she’s still on the lease and is still responsible for this place. 
Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",01May2018,3
167,"For most of my adulthood I said I shouldn’t have kids because I’m too selfish. I’m now 47. When I was 42 I found out that I was pregnant, with much to the shock of our family and friends as my husband and never conceived in the 15 years that we’ve been together.

Now that I’m 47 with an almost four year old I still haven’t changed. I stay up way too late and am sleepy the next day. I’ve sleep walked through almost my whole daughter’s life.

That’s just one example of how I’m selfish.

i want him to know the details because i don’t want to feel sick and heavy whenever i think about how i can’t tell him i like sex to be this way or that way or don’t do this but do that. it’s things like that. or when i’m having a bad day with my trauma i want him to understand or else it’s going to end up driving us apart. it already is, due to the fact every time i shine a light of opportunity for him to ask (which might i add is a very very stressful and difficult move for me), he won’t ask any questions, ask me to elaborate, he doesn’t seem even a bit curious to know who it was, how it happened, when, or why, or anything. 

i don’t want to assume he doesn’t care, but it’s starting to feel like he just doesn’t fucking care. or he doesn’t want to know in fear it’ll change his perception of us or the sex we have.

172,"Not sure how to begin so I'll just give you the whole story.
I'm 23 years old, in my 4th year of uni and got a part time job in the music industry which I'm really passionate about. That's only partly linked to what im studying.

It turned out, I am not at all interested in my studies. I found that out about a week into starting actually, but didn't just want to give up right there. So I gave myself some time to decide, finished the first three semesters and then realised, while I could get along, it got harder and harder to get up every day. Note here that I'm living in Europe, so uni is basically free.

I'm still living with my parents (which is quite normal here) so before quitting I was naturally wanting to get their advice. The problem was, this was a really hard time for everyone, due to some serious illness in the very close family, so I really didn't want to burden anyone with my problems on top of that. So I delayed it, started not going to uni anymore despite being officially a student still, and focussing on my passion of making music instead.

Coincidentally around the same time I got the job I mentioned earlier in which I'm doing really well, they're super happy with me. It's definitely something I could see myself doing long term and I really enjoy it.

This has been going on for 2 years now, don't ask how, I don't know. No one knows I'm not really studying anymore. The family's back on track now, but telling them I lied to them for 2 years is out of the question. This has to change, it's really dragging me down every day.

I only see two options for me right now.

- Finish uni and keep my job, effectively giving up on the one thing I really love doing.
- Quit uni, focus on music and hope I get to keep my job. (It's a contract made for students, so I have no idea what would happen.)

I know no one can make this decision for me. I'm just looking for some advice and opinions on my situation. Especially on how to get out of this without losing my job or the support of my family.",01May2018,1

181,"I've just moved countries with my wife and I've had to start my life over. I'm currently learning the language so I can integrate and find some proper work (my wife already has a job because she is a native), I need to do my drivers license all over and so on. It's completely normal stuff, I guess, but for some reason I'm never excited about anything anymore. I feel like I don't really care about anything and it's a really bizarre feeling. I'm never stressing out about anything except dumb shit that isn't necessarily the most urgent thing to be worrying about (like for example, I'm incredibly anal about separating our trash, or not jaywalking or something). It's really funny because I get really animated about these things, but when it's shit that matters I'm stone cold. 

I feel really shitty on the inside because my wife's working really hard and she's basically doing everything and I'm just kinda following along and picking up whatever she's struggling to carry on her shoulders, and it isn't really fair on her. It's like I cannot take the initiative to do anything on my own, I always need her permission to do shit - even things like doing the groceries even though I KNOW that it needs to be done. 

Back in my home country, I had friends, I had family and a rather successful career as a musician. I could communicate with people on the streets, I could call the doctors myself and book myself in for an appointment, I would do whatever needed to be done as it needed to be done. Out here it's like I've got this weird social anxiety. I mean, I've always been uncomfortable in crowds, but out here it's really weird because I actually feel like my heart is jumping out of my chest and sometimes I've left an IKEA or whatever really struggling to keep my emotions under control. I have no idea what the fuck is going on with myself emotionally and I'm not sure what to do about it.

On top of it all, we're trying for a kid and I'm really conflicted about continuing down the musician path. I haven't got a degree, my highschool grades are terrible and I have no idea how universities work with credits and all of this shit. I don't even know what I want to study. I've looked it up, but just reading the course descriptions stress me out because I know that I either wouldn't qualify or enjoy something. I feel like I'm running out of time and it's just adding to it all. 

Anyway, long story short; I don't really know what's going on with me emotionally, I'm not really sure what I want to do with my life and I don't know where to begin. I mean, my wife's tried talking to me about making goals and such and I can't even think of what I want for myself. Literally all I want to achieve is to have enough money to allow us to live comfortably.

188,"Back story: I started university back in September of last year and 2 days before starting my father had a heart attack. Now my father has always taught me to be independent and follow my dreams, but when I took him to the hospital I was scared as fuck. I wasn't sure what I was scared of, a chance of him dying or that I'd truly have to be independent after that. Thankfully he was okay and I went onto university a couple days later. When I went home later that day I found a letter confirming his grave and funeral costs. I also had a girlfriend of 2+ years who was always there for me. Before we started dating I was always depressed and unhappy with my life, but she managed to change everything. She was truly the best person I had met. My girlfriend and I both went off to different universities, even though she said we should go to the same one. She had gotten a better offer at a university a couple hours from mine and I insisted that she go there because of its program.


Now once university started I kept relatively quiet, it was just who I am. Went to all my classes and went for extra help when needed it. I slowly got depressed again but didn't want to bother my gf so I kept it all to myself. In late September my girlfriend confronted​ me about this but I just told her I was busy and brushed her off. This continued on for a couple days until we had a fight and then later broke up. I broke down and didn't study at all. I somehow passed all but one class(Linear algebra). Second semester was far worse, my courses got alot harder and I was less motivated. I went to my classes maybe once a week and when I got home I just went to bed. About 2 weeks before classes ended, I realized what a mess I'd become and started to find help. I registered with BetterHelp and started talking to one of their counselors. Come exam time, I started studying for my courses and went in for some extra help as I needed alot of it. I ended up failing all but one course. I basically got a 0.5 GPA and am probably gonna get kicked out of uni. I'm meeting with an academic advisor today to see what I can do and see if they'll give me a chance, but I'm pretty sure they won't.

I haven't told anyone about this yet, not my parents or any of my friends. I don't have a job lined up for the summer, but I'm willing to go to school and fix my fuck up so I can continue in the fall term. Do you have any advice on how I should approach this?

For months and months Before I moved in a few of our mutual friends had tried telling us we would get along so well and we should hang out go on a date etc etc . Neither  one of us were ready for anything and even in March I wasn't and had just developed a friendship with him . Fast forward to April after living with him for a month and I'm like this guy appreciates the same things I do , wants the same things out of life , we would stay up late night after night just talking about anything and everything . and then go to bed in our own separate bedrooms . Well a few weeks or so ago we were painting the spare room and I broke the paint roller on accident and he walked up and painted my face and laughed . So me being a female I take a picture send it to our mutual friend and she goes okay he's trying to wife you up . Clearly not actually wife me up but y'all get it right -- he's flirting . Well I tell him we laugh . And now I'm like damn he has been flirting for a while I'm just oblivious as hell . 
Okayyyy so
Then that night he texts me from his room and tells me wifeyyy come keep me warm . 
My anxiety is on 100% so I straight up tell him that and say I think you know i want to . So the next day  we go out to dinner a few friends meet up for a birthday get together and that night my anxiety ridden ass actually kissed him . 
I slept in his bed that night and all he did was hold me . Didn't even try anything . Next night , same . Next night same . And mind you I'm not complaining I'm just damn near 30 years old so I know there's so sexual tension also I know he knows -- i think we both were just kinda mind blown at this point . So fast forward another week I haven't slept in my bed since the first night I slept in his . He kisses me bye in the morning and when he or I arrive home - We've also had sex by this point . And by all accounts we are both pretty happy with whatever this situation is . But at some point we are going to have to figure out what the hell to do he even joked I could move into his room and we could get another roommate . I think he and I are both cool with just letting it be and seeing how it progresses . But does anyone have any advice or stories that may help me navigate this because I don't want to fuck anything up . But since we are already thus far I can't stop it and I don't really want to .

I'm crushing on my barista. She's cute, We've gone from smiles to how are you, to talking about our jobs/studies. She remembers my order, she starts conversations with me if I don't say anything. She comes to see me if she's not at the register/Coffee station when I'm in the shop.

It's not the kind of situation where she's just outgoing to all her customers, at least I've never seen her talk at all to anyone else. But it could just be that she's just being friendly though. I've been seeing her 2-4 times a week and we've gone to the point where we always talk and she always smiles when I go in and she's there. I'm pretty sure one or two of the other barista girls know what's up with me always getting coffee from this one, although nothing's been said. They're friendly too but just normal, barista level friendly IMO although they definitely treat me as a regular.

Would it be weird for me to ask her out? Is this the kind of situation where I need a lead in conversation or reason for asking out? (Eg shared interest in event that happens to be coming up) Or can I just be like 'hey do you want to hang out some time'?

194,"I previously posted this to r/depression, but no one cared. I figured I'd post it here
Hey everyone. I’m 17, male, and I’ve been losing weight intentionally since October. Since then, I’ve lost 80 pounds. 270lbs to 190. I haven’t checked in about a month though, so it could be more. I had originally decided to do this because I saw lots of threads on Reddit asking formerly fat people what changed when they lost weight. 
Nearly all of them said that they’ve been treated a lot better since the weight loss. They made friends, and they were even able to date. I’ve been fat all my life. That made me realize that I had been ignored my whole life. I was always ignored and avoided by people. 
I figured that me being fat had been the reason this whole time. I’ve never had one friend, never dated any girls, so this seemed so obvious. Fast forward to now. I’m only chubby these days at around 190lbs. Losing the fat from my face didn’t make me even somewhat good-looking. I’m hideous, and looking weight didn’t change that. I kinda wished that I realized that before.
I recently came to realize that one of my only passions in life was food. I love food. I was always searching for new food to try. New variations of my favorite foods such as burgers, pizza, chicken, hot dogs, tacos, candy, etc. 
I’ve always wanted to be with someone who shared my passion. Now that I’m nearly devoid of my passion, I’m feeling so depressed about it. 
I would actually like to date someone who’s more heavyset, who shares this passion, and we can experience our love of food together. Unfortunately I haven’t found her. 
I feel depressed because I want to be accepted by society, but I don’t want to give up my ultimate passion. Is that silly? 
I don’t even know if I should tell my parents about it.

But one thing that drives me batty is her propensity for interrupting me in the middle of a sentence, even when I'm in the process of answering a question *she* asked! I have observed her doing it to other people as well. She does is especially often when she is drunk, which is every other night.

I've lived with her for a couple of months now. Maybe the time to mention it and ask her to cut it out has come and gone. And if this has been a habit of hers for a long time, like years, then would asking her to stop even be worth the effort?

It's not an emergency. I can live with it. It's just *annoying*. I can't finish a thought or a story with her, ever. And then she asks me the same questions every few weeks because either I can't finish answering them, or she's completely tuned me out and is already thinking about the next thing *she's* going to say. She just kind of sucks at talking to people, I guess. Not in the shy, introverted way. Just a shitty steam\-rolling kind of way.

What's the strategy here? Is there one?",01May2018,1

200,"My partner is in his final year of university, and had a piece of coursework due a month ago. The results came out today and his mark wouldn’t show online, and when he checked he realised that although he uploaded the coursework piece to the page, he didn’t click submit. 
It’s worth 50% of this particular module, so obviously he’s upset at himself and adamant there’s no way to fix it.
I proposed he go to the lecturer of the module or anyone higher up and try to plead his case, because the work is there on his computer, but he said there’s no point.

I’m wondering if there’s anyone on here who’s had a similar circumstance and what you did, or any lecturers who could give advice?

202,"I graduated a year ago, and since then I've been working in digital marketing. It's not a bad job, but it's a remote position, and over time it proved to be extremely isolating (though I live with my boyfriend), and now I just feel aimless and bored. I do things like learn languages and chemistry for fun and I read a lot, but I'm still lacking excitement or a concrete goal.

I applied to three masters to start in September and I got accepted to all - the two I'm considering are Animal Welfare (science, ethics and law), and the other is HCI. The problem is though that I'm not sure what I really want with them - I'm interested in UX design, but I don't know if I'd really like it if I got a job in the field, and I'm kind of afraid of wasting money on something I might not end up doing in the end. I mainly want a change of environment, and socialise more, but of course I really enjoy learning and I know that I'd be happy in an academic environment.

I also thought about getting a different job - and do the masters in 2019 or when I have a better idea about what I really want to study - maybe another remote one which would allow me to travel (current one is not too reliable and doesn't pay that well), or just move to a different city (I really dislike where I currently live).

The problem is that I'm so desperate for a change that I'm afraid that I'll make an impulsive decision that I will later regret, but I also don't want to go for a safe option which would put me in the same situation after a while. I'd appreciate any thoughts on this - I just think it could be helpful to hear different perspectives on this, and any advice you might have. Thanks :)",01May2018,0

204,"So I wrote this on a thread in /r/getmotivated and was kind of hoping for a comment or two of some beautiful redditor thoughts. 

""I met a girl in July/August 2016 and spent 3 great months with her. After a couple she told me that her and her friend were going to sail around the world. I, understanding that she was the kind of special person who would do that sort of thing, was very supportive and never once tried to make her stay. I was never able to tell her face to face how much I loved her (mainly because our time together was all so short) but I wrote her a letter to read once she had left, it basically summarised how great the past few months have been and how much I cared for her.. The response was extremely positive. We have kept in contact since but messages are getting fairly rare, mostly sent by her to me as I don't want to pester her while she's travelling. It has now been a loonngggg time. 

I always said that once I was done with my qualification I would go travelling myself, and that time is soon approaching. I have my final exam in June and could technically quit my job and go travel in 4-5 months time. She is out in Australia, getting her working visa as money is running dry. A massive part of me wants to go out there, but the thought of rejection scares me... I have a tonne of family out there so my initial reason would be to see them, but then I'd ultimately deep down be hoping to meet up with her (which I'm sure she'd be keen to do). I just don't want to make it look like I've gone all that way just for her. Sounds counter intuitive, but I have tried to play it cool for so long (without feeling 'cool' inside) that I don't want to scare her off... I don't think she felt as strongly for me as I did for her anyway, let alone after all this time when she's been having the time of her life. Whilst I've just experienced mundanity - all be it a time of progression career-wise.

205,"My younger brother was born premature (around six months) and as a result has some cognitive disabilities that are overall pretty mild but still noticeable. He's come a long way, but its taken a lot of help.

He was actually able to complete a Master's degree in post production editing (he did need family help in focusing and getting work done, which my parents did as they lived with him). 

He's fairly good at what he does (also does some photography and graphic design) and even got an internship at a respected museum after graduating and has done some freelance work, but has not been able to find solid employment. I think his issues become apparent during job interviews and this dissuades potential employers.

My parents are overwhelmed with worry about him, he himself is stressed out and angry, and I don't know how to help him or my parents. I wonder if he's too high functioning for disability assistance programs to help with job placement? I have to worry about this because once my parents are gone its up to me to take over care, and the thought is stressful as hell.

206,"Hi there,

right now i am 25, student and working student in Germany. I´m finishing my degree in February and expect to start working in March. 
The issue I need advice about is the following:

I can´t have any leisure or down time so to speak. For the last several years I was so occupied with my degree and work that I somehow forgot to spend time doing something besides work or studying. 

I dont have any real hobbies besides reddit or watching TV; my girlfriend wants to go on a vacation and i have no clue where i wanna go or what I want to do. It´s almost physically impossible for me to do nothing and deep down I have the feeling that time not spent working or studying is somehow lost time.

This makes me sad and afraid, afraid that someday I will regret this and look back at a life full of work with nothing that I did to make me happy or to pursue an interest. 
 
What shall I do?

208,"I got a second job about 3 months ago at a restaraunt I work a few nights a week as a server. I have made several acquaintances there so far most of the girls are very nice and I've been making decent money for a part time job. I enjoy it and I'm glad I started there. 

There is one girl who works mostly mornings and Monday nights so I only see her mondays. I've heard others call her all kinds of names and say she's a toxic person in general. Since I've started shes gotten in 3 fights with people one where she threw food at a manager and all 3 times she walked out without doing her side work and had no repurcussions to any of these. Apparently this isn't a problem with the owners? I've spoken to her casually about work stuff a few times but never had an actual conversation with her about anything. She was nice enough to me I was nice to her no problems. 

So that brings us to yesterday. I'm working and 4 of us are standing around talking about our kids. She's part of the conversation and I ask her if she has any kids. She glares at me and walks off. Okay...... I'm immediately regretful as I don't want to offend her. She comes back in the kitchen a minute later and I said I'm sorry if I offended you I didnt mean anything by it I don't know you and I'm genuinely sorry. She says you don't ask people that and stomps off. 

Okay......... So I'm standing there with another girl left in the kitchen and she asks me what happened. I tell her and she starts laughing like a maniac and high fives me telling me how great that is. I started to get visibly upset and she's like you're not honestly upset about this are you? I said yes I am I don't want to be mean. She's like you have no idea what you're dealing with she's insane blah blah blah..  Well the girl I offended  was standing right out side the kitchen and heard all of this. Comes back and mumbles under her breath that I'm a  garbage human as she walks by me. I said are you serious right now I didn't mean anything by it I don't know you and you don't know me.  She starts losing her mind cussing me out and telling me she hopes I'm happy that her 3 babies are dead. 

I immediately started crying and ran to the bathroom. I come out and shes right there telling one of the owners how I was tormenting her and laughing  that  her kids are dead. I walk over to them and said NO I wasn't I made a mistake and immediately apologized to you and I wasn't the one laughing. I said I've experienced loss too and I apologized AGAIN. She is still going off and said I should have defended her to the other girl. I said I told her she was being mean and wasn't the one carrying on about it. She's still going and I started crying again so i went back in the bathroom to call myself down. 

I am willing to take full responsibility for asking a question that made someone uncomfortable. However. I have no idea about anything in her life and I thought we were friendly enough to have a conversation about the topic at hand. I don't want to be uncomfortable around her at work and even though a lot of the other girls don't like her I still don't want problems at work.  

Advice on whether I should just avoid her like the plague or try to reconcile next time I see her? I feel like she was being completely irrational. It is a personal subject and if she has been through something traumatic that she doesn't feel comfortable talking about that's fine. She doesn't have to tell me anything. It's none of my business. She could have left it at that. I also think had the other girl not interjected and acted like a dick it wouldn't have gotten to the point it did. ",01May2018,4

211,"I'm in a long distance relationship. My girlfriend, let's call her Sarah, shares an office with some people, one of which has a huge crush on her. Let's call him Doug. There is another person in the story, her best friend Frank who is also Doug's roommate.

Sarah has made it clear to Doug that she's not interested in him who has been after her since before I've met her. Even telling him she has a boyfriend (her previous guy, also long distance) hasn't gotten this guy to lay off. So Frank is there to help. Frank drives her home and hangs out with her so that Doug would leave her alone. In doing so Doug shuns them both because he's jealous of her ""relationship"" with Frank. Only when he realizes that Frank and her are truly just friends does he talk with Frank again. But he still shuns her completely.

And that would be amazing if they weren't coworkers. The problem is that not only do they share on office, she has to train Doug to use equipment there. She's fine with them not being on speaking terms outside of the office but not in the office. 

Over half a year goes by and she figured he had enough time to cool off. So she tried to talk with him. She explains that she's not interested in him but the past is the past, they have to be professional, and being on friendly terms at work is important. He misunderstood that as her saying that he has a chance. So now he's asking her out for dinner repeatedly.

Sarah's avoiding him now and is always asking Frank to be around to drive her home. But Frank has a life of his own and can't always be there for her. Or be in the office with her when Doug is around. But Doug notices how much time she spends with Frank again and tells her that ""she's making him jealous"" over that. As if he's anything to her that she needs to consider his jealousy in her day to day life. So he just told her that a few days ago and i'm kind of freaking out about that wording he uses, blaming her for his feelings.

I've told Sarah that she should report him together with Frank. And though she thinks that's something she might have to do she doesn't want to be considered a drama queen by her boss and i guess is seeing if it can be resolved some other way or hoping it won't escalate. 

And i'm worried about her safety because i've never met Doug and from the sound of it, he's something worth worrying about. we talked about it over the weekend and today i'm mailing her a keychain spike thing just in case. but i don't know what i can do or what she can do aside from reporting the guy.

I also suggested she keep a log of the times the guy makes her uncomfortable. but she says that that won't matter and that what matters more is actual texts or emails the guy would send but Doug doesn't send anything inappropriate in text or email.

214,"My sister and I grew up close enough, I mean we aren't closer than most, but we do share a house together so we can get off our feet. But I noticed around a month ago that she started acting different. But the thing is, she wasn't getting new friends or a boyfriend but instead the opposite. This guy was bothering her that in my opinion she hated.

Then all of a sudden it seemed like it got worse with him trying extremely too hard to get with her. Then one week she told me she would stay at the dorm with her friend for the week  and came back, ""more different"". I know for one her and that guy started spending more time together, even getting in the house. And now this guy is extremely shady and everything with my sister feels off now.

So the present, I don't talk to her, I can't because I feel like he's living here in her room. And that's not the worst part. I've seen my sister act so differently than she used too... one day I heard a lot of commotion and peaked into her room to see if the guy was harming her, instead my sister had 2 other guys fucking her along with the guy. So a full on threesome all at the same time. And she didn't even seem like she was into it or not into it, as if she was broken or something.

Another thing is I sometimes walk on her giving him head... and no not in her room. I mean in the hallway, bathroom, living room, kitchen. I see her naked and walking around doing thing for him. Usually I try not to be seen because I want to see if she says stop or no but she never does and I just go back to my room. The one weirdest thing I've seen is, I made breakfast pancakes and etc. So I go to the bathroom and come back only to see halfway into the kitchen on him having her sit on the plate full of them, then telling her to eat them. Like what the fuck!?

And speaking of cooking, usually I don't cook. But since that guy has been living here, I feel my sister is broke because he's taking all of her money. One is the weed, my sister never smoked weed like that till now but when his friend come over or I ever go to her room, it reeks. And her outfits, if she lives with me, I don't see why she would buy these revealing outfits... I mean it's not her regular dress style either. Before I started cooking, she seemed to stop eating. She would rarely ask me for money but it was obvious that she was skipping meals. And her car basically is never home if that guy is gone. She missed work about 3 times because of it. And just looks so weak now and I'm pretty sure she isn't high. Then the refrigerator is empty now always... and it's like around night, I see her walk to the kitchen naked with whatever I cooked and bring it back to her room. I'm guessing for the guy...

This bothers me so much, it's like she's a zombie or his fucking slave or something. She is acting way too weird for this to be normal. And I feel like he has raped her so much that she just accepts it now or grew addicted to it. I mean my sister wasn't much of a hoe so I don't see why she's doing all of these things... especially multiple guys at once. And the most antagonizing thing about it all is that guy is in the center of it all. As if it all revolves around him. All of this started when he started messing with her... I really don't know what to do about this and she is worrying me greatly.

Please help, does anyone know what I should do? Should I keep minding my own business and keep it to myself or do something about it? I'm scared that if I ask her about all of this, she will freak out because I know about it. Then again she hasn't been acting the same so... I don't know. What do I do....?",01May2018,3
215,"So this girl has been stalking me online for over a year. Copying everything I do, style, captions, makeup, hashtags. That's not it though.
I know her in person and last year she ruined my life, she stole my fiancé, my friends, got me fired, sent me to a mental hospital, almost killed myself multiple times, harassing me in person and online.
She has stalked me and my partner in person aswell by following us around the shopping centre and posting photos about me. She's done that a few times but I live in a small town so I can't technically claim it as stalking to the police. 
I've blocked 18 accounts on Instagram alone, another one today, 7 on snapchat, and 3 on Facebook. Aswell as all of her friends and family. She harasses me any chance she can get, like I said before copying every hashtag I do even my blog posts. every time I use a new one or do a new blog she does the same thing. 
I know it's not ""bad"" to copy someone's tags but it's just plain annoying. She's trying to have my life again after she got the last one. 
I made a new Instagram account leaving behind my old one with 27k followers and all my work and she still found my new account. I don't know what to do to get it to stop. I posted on my Instagram a huge rant about her stalking and harassment with all of the screenshots it. Calling me a slut, telling me to die, ways to kill myself, saying everyone hates me, says I'm abusive for defending myself against my abusive ex (her now partner), saying I lied about rape, tells people I'm faking my mental illness, ect. (It's a highlighted story so anyone can see it whenever you go to my profile on my new account) But she still hasn't stopped and I don't know what to do. I've gone to the police about it but they can't do anything as it's online and to just message the creators of the apps which doesn't work. 
Also I know she's still doing all this after I blocked her as people send me screenshots of it.

I'm a college student working at Mcdonald for 14 months, everything was fine for months, I got salary increase for good performence and I'm about to be an instructor. Until last weekend. There is this new assistant-manager, a women about my age, since last november. I really liked her and she seems to like my work too, most people like her, even if she is a bit intense at work. She work full time for last 4 years I think. I got a date with her, we make out and almost get laid but I found out she was virgin and almost no life like me, but I'm worse. Anyway, thing did not worked with her and she did not wanted to see me again, she said things like its not my fault its her lifestyle, etc.... tho its forbid to have relationship for manager with employee, but everyone know its bullshit. Anyway, since 3 month its awkward between us, like cold/ignoring akward. I didnot talk to her for months. Some girls at work said to me not to worry, it,s surely not my fault, because I'm pretty much the one who is self critical, like saying I'm not good enough for her, not enough cool and fun, not enough good looking. Most people and leaders think I do very good jobs, they know I'm fast and carefull for quality. But last week end she was really rough and nitpicking on me all day long. She would place newbies and slow workers at worst position in the kitchen and the result were pathetic we had a order release of 500 second ! normally its maximum 120 even in rush. She nitpicked everything I did and would not even let me doing the most simple thing she send newbies doing it sometimes because she said I dont listen to her. It was long terrible day. At break I went to toilet to calm my self and I cried a bit, I was about to lose my mind, every sound in there was driving me crazy. I returned to the break table and one leader asked me what is wrong and I explained that this manager is driving me crazy mad. She said she saw that and this women is much more intense those time. So I asked if she was like that with everyone, she respond me ""She is pretty much always intense, but it's true she is even more with you I think. Don't worry, she is doing mananing work tonight, I will help you to close."" So yeah, I started to like this place to work, I had much confidence, but not I lose it all and sent CV to many place because I dont want to work like this all summer long. It's just not normal that most leader and manager trusted my work and now I want to quit. I feel bullied and I'm very hyper-sensitive to bully and critics, I have avoidant personnality disorder, some psychologist said me. I think she know me enouch to know that fact. Oh yeah, we have three assitant-managers, her, her best gay friend who was into me(somewhat narcissist and protective friend I think), and another cool guy. I'm afraid of those two managers, there is only one who can defend me if there is problems. I mean, I trusted them all and thought my job was secured, but now I feel bullied and ashamed. How it goes from loving them and good relation to suddently fearing them? But, I pretty paranoid too. There was a time I ignored two girl because I thoutgh she was mocking me, because at college they ask me for selfies and they sent it to someone at work I dont really like and said ""yeah! we got a pictures with him! show him! Mccrew!"" and the moment was akward. But later I found out one of them was probably into me too. It seems many girl think I'm cute at work.

He states that his dog is missing &amp; he lives down the street from me. He spoke to some neighbors &amp; they all directed him to me &amp; my house. There is only a few problems with this.

I moved to this house exactly a year ago &amp; have introduced myself to one lady who lives around the block &amp; no one from my family has spoken to anybody else on the street. In the voicemail, the number he left to call him back was actually my own phone number. He also knew my name (no mention of my last name.)  

The only thing I can think of is possibly my old house but I've been gone for a year &amp; many neighbors know this. He explains what type of dog it is &amp; honestly, it does sound a little off like a prank but I'm an adult now &amp; no one I know would do this to me randomly at 11:45 at night. He sounds like a man, middle aged.

She was only able to start this job because her mother was one of my coworkers and that gave her a bit of relief from her social anxiety. Obviously the two of us hit it off and have now been married going on seven years.

We still work together at the same place, work the same hours and are quite literally never apart more than a few hours a month. We're very happy, doing fine financially, enjoy each others company more than anyone else.

Over the past several years her depression has taken root deeper and deeper. She doesn't want to go to work, like any normal person, but she'll get so frustrated and anxious about it that she'll essentially have panic attacks, crying fits, she'll shake... And I feel horrible for her.

She currently takes such a high dosage of effexor that she has to take two pills as they don't make a single dose that high. Vallium for anxiety (5 pills per month) as an ""in case of emergency"" measure.

Yesterday she completely broke down at work. Sobbing, shaking with no discernible reason. She said she just suddenly felt incredibly scared. this is the fourth time in three months.

I just got off the phone with the local mental health board and they're taking appointments to see a counselor two weeks out and a psychiatrist no sooner than three months out. 

I'm not sure she can keep it together that long, with how things have been going.

Her primary care physician doesn't seem to be helping, but I have a feeling she's not being entirely honest with them, with her anxiety about not wanting to be a bother to people. We're going to make an appointment with them, and she wants me to come in with her to ensure that she's being honest and tell him about the things she hasn't.

What else can I do? I go out of my way to make things easier for her, I show her how much I love and need her, I do small things like buying her gifts and taking her to dinner, the movies, which I am well aware doesn't fix a chemical imbalance, but my hope is that it makes the rest of life a bit less stressful and more fun.

I'm just feeling helpless.",01May2018,2

229,"I met this incredible, wonderful, sweet man about three weeks ago. Mutual friends introduced us because they thought we'd make a great couple, and so far we seem to. About a month before we met, his father died unexpectedly. They were inseparable. They lived together, and his father still took care of him. His mother died several years ago, and his brother is married with a family of his own, so he's all alone. (He's hinted that a number of his friends have abandoned him, too.) It's heartbreaking.


A lot of the advice I've found on Google/Reddit is ""just be there for him"", and I'm trying to do exactly that. He talks about his dad a lot, and I listen without ever changing the subject - I let him do that, so he can talk as much or as little as he needs to. He seems to like physical contact - we'll cuddle a lot, I'll give him back rubs or scratch his back, hold his hand, let him fall asleep holding me or playing with my hair. I invite him over and cook for him as often as he'll let me.


How can I tell how he's really doing? When I've gently asked how he's feeling, he says he's fine and changes the subject, but he's let it slip that he's not eating or sleeping. He's forgetful and easily confused - since I only met him after his father died, I have no way of knowing if that's just how he is, or if it's grief. Since he's changed the subject each time, I tend not to ask him how he's doing/how he's feeling. I don't know if that's the right thing to do. I want to tell him he can open up and be vulnerable with me, but I have no idea how to do that or if it's the right thing to do. I know grief differs for everyone and it doesn't have a set timeline - maybe he really is fine, or maybe pretending to be is helpful to him. I welcome advice here. Do I reassure him he can be vulnerable with me/encourage him to open up to me, or do I leave it?


I also welcome any advice specific to helping someone through grief when you don't know them well. Some of the advice I've found clearly doesn't fit our situation. Things like showing up to help with practical things vs. just saying ""I'm here any time, call if you need me!"" - given that I'm not an old friend but a girlfriend he's known less than a month, I don't know if that would be helpful or too pushy/intrusive. If I offer to help him and he declines, do I insist? Or drop it? That's the sort of thing I'm uncertain about.


Thanks in advance. I care so much about him, I want to do everything I can to help him through this.",01May2018,1

231," So I'm a high school senior, I'm 18, and I've worked at this place since 16. I work as a skate instructor at the indoor skatepark inside the facility. There are things that have always annoyed me here, and I'm not sure if they're really against any laws, so I'll just list them here. 

1. We don't clock in or out. Our schedules give us hours to come in for, and those are the hours we get paid for. It's not a problem for not day shifts like watching open skate shifts, but it's become a problem for closing open skate shifts and lesson shifts. We were asked to come in 10 minutes early to every lesson shift to sign in kids, talk to parents, etc in a group chat. I replied to ask if we'd get paid for it, and was told that ""it's just 10 min"" and that ""every job wants you there early"". The thing is this 10 minutes isn't being used as a buffer for us being late, it's used as actual work time. I'm always there early anyways, I just like to sit in my car until my actual paid time starts. I know it's a short amount of time, but it adds up. Also, another problem is closing open skate. For example, say I'm working a Sunday 12 to 6 open skate shift. I'll usually get there at 12, and then when closing time comes I have to tell the manager before I leave. If she has more cleaning or trash to take out or something, she will make me stay. This is almost always the case,and I almost always end up leaving at least 15 minutes late. So in this example id be there 12 to 6:15, but only get paid 12 to 6.

2. This isn't as big a problem as number 1, but I'm still unsure about it. Everyone of my friends with a high school job gets breaks every shift. I have never once gotten an official break. There have been rare times where a lesson in the middle of a shift will be cancelled, or I'll be asked to grab some food for others real quick, but that's it. Even when I work 8 hour shifts I've never gotten a break. 

3. I don't think we have any of those labor law signs up.  (Id that's what they're called, sorry I'm asking for help on this because I'm unsure.)

4. We recently got about 1 and a half hours of online training videos and tests to go with them stuff to do unpaid at home. It's required. 

5. This is one I've just always thought was weird.  We get paid on the 3rd and 18th of every month. However if one of the dates falls on a weekend, they won't pay us until the next Monday. They will never do it the Friday before, always the Monday after. 

I'm not sure of what to do, who to report it to or anything like that. I really like having a job where I can skate, I just hate some of the seemingly sketchy stuff they do. Also, forgot to add this is in Arizona. Thanks in advance to anyone that can offer me some help!",01May2018,2

234,"First things first, I'm a 23 year old girl and the oldest of five kids. There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those who don't want the meat and potatoes. 

Some backstory, my mom had been dating an extremely abusive man (if you can call him that) for a couple years. I would rescue her when things got so bad that she needed to be hospitalized (which was multiple times, broken neck, broken skull, broken spine, 8 broken ribs, needed surgery to repair bones in her cheek, etc.) and every time she would do good for a few weeks, a month...she would get back to her life, start raising her young kids again, get a new job, but you'd always be able to know without knowing that she wasn't here for real yet. Then she would just not come home one day. You'd hear from her the next day, usually still drunk, telling you ""I'm fine, I just love him you don't understand.""

This last time he put her in the hospital, she almost missed the birth of her first grandchild. I rescued her again and she made it to the birth and left him shortly after. This time, she filed a lawsuit against him. He's since been in a rehab pending his trial. This time, she moved the kids back in with her (a 15 year old and a 17 year old who has a 2.5 month old daughter). Got a new job again, but was excited about it. Started doing crafts again, visiting family, cleaned her house. There was a light in her eyes for the first time in a long time and a confidence in her voice I hadn't heard since I was a kid. It's been months since she left him, and all of us knew it was real this time. 

Last night, she told my 17 year old sister that she was going for a walk and that she'd be back in an hour or so, and that she put the baby to bed but just to listen for her. She'd been drinking and feeling emotional all day. My sister told her she didn't think that was a good idea, but she did it anyway. Her phone has been off since midnight last night and my sister let me know that my mom's friend had just told her a couple days before that that...man...had gotten out of rehab and was back at home.

[TL;DR] My mom was in an abusive relationship she kept running back to, but after years she finally made positive reassuring steps and her life was back to normal. My two sisters (15 and 17) and my sister's 2.5 month old baby are living with her. She left last night and hasn't come home, and her phone is off. I have no proof that she's with him but the alternative scares me even more.

I know that was long-winded, but I wanted the best advice for my situation and I can't get that without an accurate story. I don't know where to go from here, I've called his phone multiple times just to ask if my mom was there and okay but he won't answer me. Do I try going there and seeing if somebody will answer the door? Do I call the cops and tell them I'm worried for my mother's safety? I don't have any proof that she's there with him but the only other option is to believe that she's just...gone. Do I wait it out and hope that she turns back up? I don't know what to do for my siblings, should I bring them in to stay at my grandmother's until my mom shows up again even though it means they'll be missing school? I'm physically sick with anxiety and I need some guidance.",01May2018,2

236,"Instead of paying rent, I can stay in rent-free. That's the agreement, I know the uncle since I was 10, he's a bit harsh but basically told me I can do whatever I can to renovate the guesthouse he had rotting at the backyard.

Problem is, it's taking most of my time, effort, energy and money. My figures are only $550.00 for ground wiring but the initial electrician is on vacation. The new one charges me $1,100.00 to do everything. It can cut my time, but also, I'm just a degree-less person working minimum wage. I can possibly put this in, but it's a lot of money and I've never spent something like this when it comes to renovation.

I can't get any help. This seems to be my one shot for rentless or at least $500 less rent and then I can start saving and possibly start school.

My experience dealing with handymen/electricians had been pretty vague though, it's almost as if they're squeezing the money out of me and all I want is power to the damn guest house so I can start to breath easier and maybe even contribute to society once I start and finish schooling.

""How's your day been?""

""Glad to hear it, I see you often, are you from [collegename]?""
(Yes)
""Nice, i think you're pretty cute, mind if I take you on a date sometime?""
(Yes please! I want to have your babies!)

Either they would say yes, in that case I'd stick around and get to know her more, or if they say no/ihaveabf or something I just say ""well it was a nice chat, have a good day!"" and leave.

239,"Hello everyone, I'm not really sure where to start. I'm currently a 19 y/o (almost 20) college student and working part time. I honestly try my best and wanting better for myself. I have a couple mental illnesses which makes life on me very hard and being to talk to people even harder. I've been diagnosed with OCD, major depression disorder, selective mutism, aspergers and severe anxiety disorder (I take medicine for it). I have a hard time socializing  and communicating with people. I had very little amount of friends when I was younger and I was bullied as well. I'm just a mess all around and have a very hard time functioning with myself without blaming myself. I also struggle in school because I have dyslexia and trying to do math for me is extremely hard. It takes me a lot longer than most people understand the lesson on that day. All of this with my mom being a very confusing person to me makes me feel so lonely and bad that I think about suicide everyday I live. Last time I told her ""I love you"" or anything along the lines of that was probably 8+ years ago I believe. I never want to give her hugs or say that to her because I don't feel any affection from her and I don't really want it from her. When I was little my parents had a very good relationship, they seem to care about one another and they seemed like they enjoyed being around me. They also helicoptered parented me too and I don't know how to do much for myself. Then just one day when my dad started to having to take medicine to treat his depression and anxiety everything just went down hill. Me and my family hung out less and less, my dad especially didn't seem to care much about me or my mother. My parents relationship went downhill as well and they argued constantly and sometimes would get into very scary physical fighting. Which now affects me today in which my relationships never last longer than a month or two because I'm scared of committing. Whenever I got in trouble with my parents no matter the case my mother would scream and shout at me until I would be crying. At times she physically abused me by punching me and trying to destroy some of my possessions. I never fought back at her unless I felt it was very necessary to do so. I didn't really get a scar or bruises when this stuff would have happened. My is a very outgoing and center of the attention of whatever might be happening, she likes talking with people all the time and seems to like put on a fake face and life when she talks with whomever. You would honestly wouldn't be able to tell that she would be the kind of person that would've done to their child. I work with her currently at my current job because if it weren't for her I wouldn't be able to get a job by myself. She tells me a lot that I'm lazy and that I would be fired if I worked at a different place because the way I act. I don't ever want to start anything with her at work but she seems to want to start it no matter what. The other day I was asking her a question and she then started to embarrass me in front of a co-worker. She told me ""You need to grow up and learn to do stuff yourself"". She always seems to want to embarrass me as much as possible, then she asked why I never talk to her or share my personal life. Recently she tried to nag me to admit that I'm gay (which I am) and wouldn't stop asking questions about pictures I don't like or things I have in my room. I honestly try my best to do stuff for myself but she always threatens me that she will kick me out if I don't take more classes in college or figure out what to major in. I'm so lost in to want to do with my life for a career, I'm honestly trying my very best to do good in college but she doesn't think so. She had always told me that I was very lucky to even get into college (I get it paid for because of my disabilities) and that I should be thankful. I am very thankful for being able to go to college but I just don't know if it's truly for me and if so what do I do with my life if I drop out? I'm failing one of my classes right now and I'm pretty if I do I can't get funding for school anymore. I don't know what to do with myself because I'm very limited with my life currently. I either have the choice to randomly guess a career I'll have to do for the rest of my life or drop out and try finding a full time job. I don't have any friends or anything that live near me or that I talk to irl, most of my friends are online. If anyone can help I'd be very thankful and if you want a deeper explanation of this stuff you can just DM me or I'll try to reply in the comments. I'm at such a lost in life right now that I don't really see any option to get better other than to hurt myself. I honestly want to die. My only escape from this is to play video games or go on Reddit, but even now I'm starting to get bored of that today. Maybe I'm just biased because my mom can't say her side but it's whatever. Anyways for reading and thank you in advance for the help.",01May2018,2

243,"What pisses me off? Well many things. What makes me sad? A few things. 

I don’t really know why, but many things have been affecting me more than they should for a while now. Maybe it has something to do with the fact the I feel alone at times. I don’t really have anything to look forward to. People who I considered to be nice and trustworthy, show me their true faces very quickly. It hurts. It hurts knowing that you aren’t of much value to many people. It hurts that no one outside of your family seems to think of you. It hurts to know that people only talk to you when they want something from you. 

I don’t necessarily blame anyone. But I feel like the trigger to all of this was a girl (let’s call her Jessica). Again, I don’t blame her for anything. It’s just that I put way too much faith in her. I thought I could ditch all my other friends and have her as my best friend. Someone who I could tell everything to. Someone special. But for some reason, things didn’t go the way I thought it would. For some reason, I didn’t expect this happening. Things were going well for a while, but now, I’m just dead to her. For some reason, I felt betrayed. It’s just my mental state at this point. I don’t blame anyone. I feel numb. I feel empty.  I guess I can say that love is like a fucking double-edged sword. Give too much to it and it takes too much from you. It is way too mentally straining. Well now, I don’t know who to talk to. I don’t surround myself with people that I necessarily trust either. I have friends. It’s not that I don’t have anyone. It’s just that I don’t have good friends. 

Quite frankly, it stings sometimes. Literally. Sometimes I think about what could have been and I feel goosebumps. Running through my spine. I can’t help but feel helpless.

Just to clear things out, I DO NOT by any means feel suicidal. I just simply lack a sense of direction. I don’t know where to go now. I sometimes think to myself that forgetting the past is the best solution. But no matter how much you try to bury something, it always rises back just to haunt you.

So, here I am. Talking to a computer. It appears that the computer is the only one I can talk to. I hope that talking it through helps me. I hope that this somehow has a therapeutic effect on me. But I guess we’ll find out soon.

My need for career/graduate school advice comes in regard to my future interests... I will be studying for and taking the GRE in August. I plan to attend graduate school and complete a masters in Audiology, Speech Pathology, or another similar subject. 

 Completing a masters degree in a speech disorder is very important to me and I would then like to work in the field for 1-2 years... THEN, I would like to finish my final educational leg of attending law school. I would like to study for and take the LSAT, go to law school and finish within 2.5-3 years, eventually begin practicing family/children/social law, and possibly one day doing activism for children and disabilities.

I have been fortunate enough to not have accumulated any debt from undergraduate and my graduate school will also be assisted by my family... I mention this detail as I do not want finances to be factored into any advice provided. 

Is this a good plan? What is a good masters degree subject to pursue before additionally attending law school? I really would like to help children, families, disabled peoples, etc. and I find it important to study mental disorders and disabilities in graduate school before going to law school!

When i told her that i met new people etc she asked why i saved the girls numbers. I did try to tell them that it was purely innocent and with no hidden motive but she didn't believe me..
Skip forward a few hours and she tells me to call her, so i did. When she picked up she declared its over between us and that i have to get all her stuff ready so she can get it.. Hearing this fractured me and made me do some crazy shit.. I have autism and that makes these things even harder than they usually are. I acted really naive by taking the my bike to go to the train and traveling nearly 100km to see her ( it was roughly 22:00 ) when i left my home. After 3 hours i was about 20km away from her home and my body started becoming cold from the wind and rain. I decided to get a ride at the side of the road which took me another half hour to get. When i finally arrived at her place it was 4 am. I ringed her and she opened the door because my sister asked her not to leave me outside since it was storming. She told me to shower and then we'd talk. I finished showering and felt really bad but i went to talk anyway.. she told me that she would consider a break so she could get her mind around it but i feel like its just saying its over and i don't want that to happen..
When we finished talking i tried to kiss her to cheer her up which always worked but this time she didn't even react to it.. that was the moment i realised it would be over if i didn't do something in the coming week.. Im currently filling a jar full of notes with reasons why i love her. People say that when you lose something or someone that means alot to u you only then begin to realise how much they actually mean to you. But by then its already to late.

Now she's in another country and she'll return saturday. I hope she is willing to forgive me for my mistake and disrespect that i have been giving her and take me back.. 

What can i do to make her forgive me.. Im lost and don't know what to do.. I've been laying on the couch for 3 days since then and haven't had a big appitete ( i normally eat around 3000 calories a day and excersise on a weekly base )


If anyone knows something i could do to take my mind of it for now so i can have a clear mind for when she's back please do tell me",01May2018,3
254,"I recently started a new job, part time, as I finish up a semester of school. I fell asleep this morning and was woken up by HR. They told me there is a zero tolerance policy for sleeping and to pack up my things and leave. 

I get that it wasn't ok, but I first didn't want to work this crazy schedule but agreed because they basically begged me. I am an otherwise model employee, working hard and learning fast. I was totally shocked. 

I left and now don't even know what to think or do. I rented a new apartment and moved cities for this job so I have a lot of expenses that need paying soon and am very overwhelmed. ",01May2018,1
255,"Hi Reddit, I've made a throwaway profile to ask this as i fear anybody who knows me may see my post.
I dont really know where to start with this. I split up with my partner nearly 3 years ago now and we also have a child together, I never wanted to break up, I just wanted to try and work at things. Towards the end of the relationship we were arguing a lot, we were both struggling with depression and took it out on each other. We both went to therapy seperately, we both finished our cbt around the same time, I came out of it and addressed all the issue I had, my responsibility in the arguments and how my negative outlook on life reflected in to the relationship. They came out of their therapy with quite a different take on things, it was ALL my fault, no share of the blame taken, all their problems that had ever been were suddenly blamed on me. I willingly accept that a lot of the issues were down to me, but not everything. I've never been able to talk about things withthem, if I even hinted at being unhappy at the way I was spoken to or how I was treated it would be like a bomb went off, if I even mentioned the word sex I was branded a pervert, or how I was mentally ill and needed help.
Due to financial difficulty we stayed under the same roof (and also in the same bed) for the first 18 months. We cuddled up at night watching television, we worked hard at being the best parents we could, trying to make sure that our son didnt lose out.
Eventually I had the money to put a deposit on an apartment, i made the decision to leave everything with them, our son was staying in the house so i figured they needed everything and i left with nothing to start again. I moved nearby so seeing m son would never be an issue.
So now we live apart, before I left I tried to see if we could work things out, we were still sleeping together regularly, having nights out, nights in, holidaying together, cuddling up most nights and generally being there for each other, even the arguments were less frequent. They said no, they loved me but weren't in love with me, so I left.
Fast forward to now, we still see each other every day, still sleeping together (at least once a month), still spending most evenings together, still cuddling up watching netflix, still holidaying together.
I am still completely in love and totally unable to walk away, I cant even look at another relationship without feeling like I'm being unfaithful. When we argue they say they hate me, that i make them physically sick, that they dont want to sleep with me anymore, that every time we've had sex they've regretted it and calls me a rapist. Obviously this hurts like hell. The act of sex is not up to me, I have no say in it, I'm not allowed to talk about it. Ever. I can't even say the word without being shouted at and made to feel like a pervert, when we do have sex its on their terms only. I am not allowed to talk to anybody about this (hence the throwaway account), we even work for the same company and they act as if they are ashamed of me while we are there, embarrassed to be seen as my friend, let alone talk to anybody about whats going on in my life. Nobody knows any of this, none of my family, not even my mum or any of my friends.
All of this is making me question everything, i had a breakdown last year and I'm starting to question what is real and what isnt, I've been referred to the mental health team and am awaiting the results of some referrals I've had. I'm so alone, I know I'm not loved and I've isolated myself away and lost touch with all my friends.
I don't know what to say, if I seem to have left anything out or something doesn't make sense then just ask and i'll try and fill in the blanks",01May2018,1
256,"Where I'm working right now I'm dealing with harassment that's totally soured myself and my wife's feelings about the company.  (We both work there and they're treating us both poorly ever since we came back from maternity leave.) We live in Oklahoma but my mother-in-law lives in Florida. Having someone to watch the baby during the day is just as appealing as living in Florida - don't expect to have no problems but it's better to cry on the beach.

The thing is, we've been applying for jobs like crazy on a number of different sites and we're hearing nothing back at all. We've taken the advice of using MIL's address so we seem local, since as soon as one of us gets a job we're out of here, but still nothing. We've used resume sites to create professional, individualized resumes, we both have marketable skills... but nothing. 

It's so stressful to be here but we're stuck. We work opposite shifts so we never have a day together, they've cut back on both our hours so it's harder to keep a moving expence savings untouched. My wife cries a lot and I feel helpless, all I can do is offer hollow promises that it will be alright. 

We're both at wits end and not sure what we're doing wrong? What should we do? Stay? Go? We need help, anything that anyone might suggest.

257,"I know I'm a good person. I've always been nice to people, I help when I can, I've never went out of my way to hurt someone, etc.

But for some reason my mind just automatically tries to look for reasons that I'm not good and insincere. 

I used to love being me, but in the past year I feel really insecure about my own opinions and thoughts. It's like I'm doubting myself constantly.  Is there any way I can stop this?",01May2018,3
258,"This is the first post I've ever made on Reddit, so my bad if I don't format it properly or whatever. I don't know where else to vent at this point and the thought of ending it is getting stronger and stronger every single day. I don't even know what kind of advice I'm searching for but everything hurts so much. 

I feel like my very existence is a sick joke. My mother, who raised me by herself until she passed away due to cancer when I was 15, was an incredibly beautiful and kind person. She had a lot of neuroses that were unfortunately passed down to me, but one of the worst things is the fact that she was so beautiful\-\-I grew up seeing how much everyone loved her as a result, and she always pushed me to eventually become a model because I looked like her. Because of her, valuing looks is inherent to me even though I think talent outweighs something as silly and fickle as appearance. Fast forward to now, post\-puberty, and I look like a deformed version of her thanks to my dad's features and the fact that my body has so many issues\-\-I just found out I have scoliosis so even though I'm thin, my waist and figure are incredibly asymmetrical, which also affects my breasts \(asymmetrical as fuck, and small but not in a cute way\), I have a ton of dark spots, scars all over my body, etc. I don't have health care anymore so I can't even fix any of this for the time being, and I haven't seen a doctor in about two years so I'm definitely not doing super well health\-wise. I do get complimented a lot so I wouldn't say I'm as ugly as I could be, but I look like a fucked up version of her. Recently I finally sucked it up and applied to a modeling agency, and they responded immediately, asking me for headshots with no makeup. Once I sent those in and they saw how I really look.....no response. I tried to suck it up but that was the final confirmation that I'll never be as beautiful as her. And in an age where so much depends on image and Instagram and stuff like that, I'm pretty screwed. 

On a less vain note\-\-I've been very successful with my writing. I've been published in many big magazines, gotten awards, and yet that's amounted to nothing. I was unable to go to college last year because I couldn't afford it and my high school advisor barely helped me, and it looks like I won't be going this year later because I fucked up my applications once again due to her absolute stupidity and my own ignorance. I want to continue writing, and to be a director as well, but I barely know anything technical/related to film production and I don't have a portfolio yet because I couldn't afford a camera and equipment until recently. I have a job right now, but I might not have it by summer, leaving me homeless and even more unable to focus on getting ahead academically career\-wise. 

My dad is still alive, but he's an absolute piece of shit. I'm one of 13 or 14 kids he had, and I have no respect for him because of how he's treated women, the fact that so much of what I hate about myself was inherited from him, the fact that he's sick and so he thinks that absolves his sins, etc. etc. He doesn't even call me, I have to call him. I heard from him yesterday, just because he wanted to tell me that I need to pay for phone service \(how can I do that when I can barely pay rent?\) and wanted to complain to me about me never calling him. My family \(on his side, because my mom's family doesn't live here\) agrees that I'm the one who needs to call him because he's the adult, even though they also have no respect for him.

Lastly\-\-I have no self confidence \(unless I'm drunk, but the last thing I need to tack onto all of this is alcoholism\). I've been treated like shit my entire life and I have a plethora of I'm too meek, and when I'm not, I'm an asshole. There's way more horrible shit I haven't included in here because it would be so long. Barely anything has changed since I was a kid\-\-I'm still incredibly poor, I'm still anxious and depressed, I still hate seeing myself except it's gotten to the point where I cry every time I look in the mirror and I never take pictures of myself. I can't take it anymore. I should never have existed and I know I have a lot to offer the world in terms of my creativity, and I have friends and family who'd miss me if I killed myself, but I can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do. It feels like the world is telling me to give up every day.

If you read this, thank you. I'm so embarrassed to even say all of this on a public forum but I don't know what else to do. ",01May2018,1

It feels like an incredible waste of time and it’s pretty much a useless course to me regarding what I would genuinely like to do with my life.

For some unknown reason my anxiety was kind of strong for a bit.  Eventually I had a panic attack while going home from class one day and from then on I couldn’t bring myself to attend the classes (or go out in general) in fear of having another one.  I’m probably able to go back again now but at this point I’ve missed so much coursework on something I’m not familiar with anyway so it’ll be very hard to catch up and truthfully, I don’t want to.

270,"I suppose I'm posting on here because I can't talk to any friends or family about this right now. I'm a final year undergraduate, and I have exams coming up next week. Unfortunately, last Tuesday I found out I'm pregnant - I have a termination booked this Friday. It's just horrible because I never expected this to happen, I'm on birth control... My boyfriend's really supportive about it but it hurts us both to think about what we're going to have to do. He's only just started his career, I've still got to do my Masters so a baby isn't even possible right now.

I thought I was okay, but a week later and I've been shut in at home, not spoken to anyone apart from my partner, not studied, not really even moved from bed... I just have no motivation for anything, and it's at the worst possible time with final exams. Every time I try to study I can barely manage ten minutes before my mind starts wondering to all that's happened recently and I freeze up, can't concentrate on anything and end up passing hours watching movies or sleeping, just anything where I don't have to think. Obviously this is cutting into my study time hugely and I'm nowhere near as prepared as I should be. I know that in the long term I really should think about counselling, but can you offer me any advice for now? To help me focus, or sideline all the crap that's happened.

Meeting friends for happy hour, going out on weekends, going on weekend trips with the BFFs, going on Tinder dates, seeing family, etc, etc. I went through a bad breakup in November and decided to break out of my shell and be a happy, busy, single social butterfly, and tbh, it felt AMAZING! I loved living my life and always having plans to look forward to. 

But. I am starting my last semester of undergrad on May 7th, to graduate August 1st. and I'm taking 6 classes to do so. That's an insane amount of work, and I still have my full time job which is fine, because this job allows me to do my homework on the clock once in a while. But all spring, I've had a bit of anxiety because I was going out soooo often I neglected the mundane projects I've wanted to do, like selling my desk thats taking up too much floorspace in my room, like spring cleaning, cooking at home, etc. With school, work, and being social this Spring I also never got 8 hours of sleep on any given night. I got really sick with a respiratory infection two weeks ago and resolved to myself that for the next three months, I will kiss my social life that I enjoy so much goodbye to make way for my heavy courseload, ample sleep, housework, exercising, eating right and ""getting to know myself"". 

I've been slowly weening off of hanging out, haven't been on a date in over a month, in preparation for this incoming semester. I'm kind of worried that I'm going to be extremely miserable without enough human contact for three whole months, but I know this is the only way. Graduation is so close I can taste it, and I don't want to screw it up in any way; I know I'd rather shut out my social life than risk not passing a class; It just sucks to think about what I'm going to be missing out on by not dating/hanging out/having fun.

(The apartment is still registered in both are names but right now I’m paying the bills)

After a while he stopped being secretive about it. I came back to my house a few times to find him in it doing normal things like watching TV or sleeping. 

Yesterday he took it too far. I was having a shower when he entered my house so I didn’t notice him but I heard the TV turn on. (I hadn’t seen him since a threatened to go to the police a while ago so I didn’t know it was him)

I stepped out but left the shower running so that what I thought was a burglar didn’t know I was out of the shower. 

I put on a towel and grabbed a toilet brush as a weapon (sounded like a good idea at the time)

We argued it the living room and I ended up losing my temper and throwing the brush at him leaving a bruise.

Sorry about the word vomit, I'm a little rattled and want to get this down while its still fresh.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/8f4egj/i_just_got_done_filling_out_a_statement_regarding/) is a previous post I made, gives a bit more detail to the beginning.

Timeline until today:

* Thursday last week, had a Chem test (Aced it!) and hit the bathroom after class.

* Noticed graffiti written in pencil on the sink ""I'm going to shoot up the school on finals week, I have a p90 and 2 1911's. Youve been warned"" Also said something nonsensical about the big bang. 

* [**Mistake #1**] I erased it. It was dumb, but I was just sitting their on the can and thought ""that might freak some students out"" so I grabbed a paper towel and wiped it away.

* Saw more on the wall, wasnt going to bother removing it so I went to go find a Janitor.

* As I left two security guards came in, someone had reported it before I got in. I stopped them and said ""hey, you here about the graffiti?"" they were, but [**Mistake #2**] I said I'd rather not get involved *in case you think it was me or something* (So, so, so dumb of me but at the time I was operating on the thought line of they *knew* I didn't do it and I just made their job harder)

* I filled out a statement of what it said and apologized for not taking it seriously, I mean, it was bathroom graffiti. It held about as much weight as ""Alex is loose, call xxx-xxx-xxxx"" in my mind. I explained my reasoning for not taking it seriously, but they were still peeved about me erasing it. 

* Shot the shit with them about motorcycles and the history of this kind of stuff happening. 

* Got a call about 15 minutes later asking to come up and talk with them. I agreed since I had two hours before my next class. NCIS and the local cops were their, I answered their questions (basically repeated what it said a few times) and filled out another statement.

* Got a text on Sunday alerting students to increased security due to 'non-credible shooting threat'.

Today:

Looking disheveled from 48 hours of studying, operating on four hours of sleep and a crushed will due to (probably) failing my trig final I was making my way out to my bike when I man with a badge came up to me. I joking said ""Oh no, what am I in trouble for"" he asked me if I should be in trouble for something. I pointed to the fact I was illegally parked. He identified himself as FBI and wanted to ask me about what happened on Thursday. Made a joke about ""how'd security describe me, the bike or the beard?"". He didn't appreciate my humor so I nipped that in the butt real fast. He said the security chief said I was acting strange on Thursday about the graffiti. 

I repeated to him what was said on the wall. He explained that it was a dumb idea to erase it. I told him hindsight is 20/20 but he knew *why* I did it, I didn't think it was credible at the time. I told him I didn't want to be involved anymore since it was the next week and I didn't appreciate being ambushed in a parking lot. He asked me why I didn't want to talk [**Mistake #3**], I told him *I didn't do anything and didn't want to be bothered* he made a big deal about how ""I never said you did anything, why do you think you did something"" (repeated over and over every time I told him I didn't want to be involved) he persisted on why I didn't want to talk so I basically said ""look man, I'm from Philly. I don't like talking to cops, it rattles me"". He told me I can leave any time I want. I decided it would be mad sketchy for me to jump on my bike and peace so I asked him if their was anything else he wanted to know.

He asked a couple more questions about the graffiti and then started getting confrontational. He talked about how stupid it was to erase it, I asked him if it made a difference since I gave them a verbatim write up of what it said. He said they like to do fingerprinting and pictures, I told him it was a bathroom wall, he wouldn't have got anything from it and apologized for erasing it again. He said it was weird I wasn't taking it seriously and I wouldn't go find security when I saw it. I repeated why I didn't think it was credible and told him nothing was going to come of it. He asked why I was so sure, I told him it's finals week, theirs a million cops on campus and *nothing* had happened. He said the date on the wall hadn't come yet, I told him the only thing I saw is ""finals week"" on the graffiti. I told him I wanted to leave so he went away. I have to admit here that I didn't keep my cool at all, the guy kept pushing and I lack a filter sometimes so their was some cursing. Nothing at the cop himself, but I may have used terms like ""bullshit""  and ""fucking"" a few times. I was visibly nervous during this whole exchange, which he kept pointing out, but in my defense ""Hey I'm from the FBI we need to talk"" is like liquid nitrogen when it comes to breaking the ice. 

After he left I called up campus security in an attempt to remove myself from all this. They asked me to come down so I did. I met with the security chief and told him I was as cooperative as possible on Thursday, it was finals week and I didn't need all this shit stressing me out. Security chief said he was just doing his job and said [**Neon Red Flag With Blinking Lights**] ""I won't lie to you, its extremely suspicious that you'd erase something so serious"". Ignoring the fact that the security officer let slip on Thursday that their is a history of this type of graffiti and nothing ever came of it I told him I understand, but I don't want to be involved. He thanked me for being cooperative. The FBI guy came in (with a noticeably less abrasive demeanor now that he was in front of his peers) and explained that ""During big investigations we can call people in dozens of times"" in response to me getting annoyed at being hassled. 

At that point it dawned on me I wasn't doing myself any favors talking to campus security, so I basically put on a ""whatever you say, man"" act and left. I know this could have been handled more tact on my end but I was, and still am, pretty shaken up about all this. 

What do you guys think? Am I overthinking all this? ",01May2018,1
283,"I have friends with this women and I find her extremely attractive and a genuinely great human being. We have a very close relationship and we often treat each other as therapists.

I have also fantasized having sex with her.

I will be meeting her at her place in a few days and want to bump up our physical intimacy. How do I go about it? How do I know if she is up for it? I want to respect her choices as well. I am wary of asking her straight to her face as the conversation could get pretty awkward. I know she has had sex before and I have not.

284,"Hello there. 

I'm a mechanical engineering student in a French speaking third world country ""top school"" (at least considered as such here). I'm currently in my third year, the starting point of the electromechanical engineering curriculum but there's a lack of computer science and control modules in the courses. 

Why does it bother me? Because I thought for a while we'll be taught mechatronics. I was giving up all my dreams when our Matlab/electronic professor introduced us to Arduino. He really wants to turn our degree into a mechatronics one.

Anyway, thanks to him, my robotics dreams came back to life leading me to this moment. I'm actually teaching myself Arduino and programming but I want some proper education in robotics and in English too... Like a specialisation after my ""diplôme d'ingénieur"". As I don't think I'm an academia person (and I don't really enjoy, a master's degree (a non-thesis one) in robotics (or some mechatronics degree I found) seems to be the appropriate choice in any English program (except in the US), even in sweden.

287,"Hi all,

So basically I work in a hospital setting where we currently work eight hour shifts- 07:00-15:00 (Early) and 13:00-21:00 (Late). There are also night shifts that I don't participate in due to my mental health. 

The hospital is now under new management and there has been a push towards eight hour shifts being abolished, to be replaced by long days 07:00-19:30. I'm not sure how to feel about this so wanted to post here- I hope I have the right place. I'm part time whilst studying for a degree in nursing, and I will be working at the hospital on a full time basis as a qualified nurse next year. I quite like the current system- it gives me flexibility and also means that I get a lie in once in a while when I'm working the late shifts. That said, I'm not a huge fan of finishing at 21:00hrs and dragging myself home to eat and get to bed. Also, the late-early shift means we leave at about 9.30pm and have to be in for 7am the next day- its a nightmare. The theory is that we will work 3 long days a week, as opposed to 5 eight hour shifts per week. 

On the plus side I can see that long days, whilst punishing, will mean I have more free time during the week to see my children, participate in childcare, go to the gym and so on. But I'm worried about just how punishing these long days are going to be. I like the eight hour system because the shifts are manageable, and I can't really imagine being on the ward for a straight 12 hours- sounds like it may be really stressful. 

I guess my question is- do any of you work these kind of shifts? Would you say you prefer long days as opposed to the traditional eight hour system like most people do? What are the pros and cons? I will add that I suffer from Bipolar Disorder, which complicates matters. I can quite easily but up and on the ward for 7am, but I'm unsure as to how long days will impact on my condition. 

The new system is still in the early stages of development so I'd be interested to hear your views. Thanks in advance!",01May2018,3

291,"4 years ago I graduated from high school. My social life completely disappeared and I sunk into a horribly deep depression. I had no idea what to study and my family doesn’t exactly have much money so I went to a local community college to get an associates degree in liberal arts while I figure out what I want to do. In the first year I got a job, bought a car, finally started to have a social life, things got alright for a bit. I became a lot happier. Once I was about 2 years into my degree, only a few classes away from finishing, shit hit the fan for me. In the course of one week I had falling outs with several of my closest friends (which i’ve since begun talking to again, although it wasn’t until months later), a relationship fell apart and I was pressured by my parents to stay and live with them as I had been planning since I got my car to move out within the next year (my family is very dysfunctional and I knew being around them was going to damage my mental health). After all this happened I fell into yet another depression. I failed a class twice in a row, began drinking much more and getting high at least once a week. I fell into a much deeper depression that I’ve still never gotten completely out of, even after trying a therapist and several medications. I fought through it, finished my associates moved out with some friends, left my retail job for a my current job (working in food service at a hospital), all while trying to take a break on school to work on myself and my mental health. Ever since moving out and getting this new job, nothing has changed. I’m going back to school this fall and I’m excited to finally pursue what I know Im passionate about, which is Biology/Zoology. Despite this, despite that my life really isn’t all that bad lately, I’ve continued to sink deeper and deeper into depression. Im not actively sad, just sick of everything. My dysfunctional family, my friends (even though most of them have done nothing wrong), my job… everything in my life. For the last year I’ve been going back and forth on leaving my hometown and starting a new life. I truly do believe it is what I need, however, I need to go to school, I have very little money and I don’t know anyone out of my town I’d be able to live with. No matter what I try to shake up my routine, find new hobbies, make new goals, ultimately, everything is just a blend of “meh”. I feel like there is no growth left for me in this town. My creativity and passion are gone. I need to figure out some way to get out of this town soon, but, i simply cannot afford it. I’d need to go to school full time and work full time just to cut even living alone. Does anyone have any advice for what I can do to accomplish this?",01May2018,3
293,"I have a job, but I desperately need $300 more this month. I’ve been writing for a while and even published a book on amazon kindle. (It is awaiting being uploaded into their servers) But I don’t expect it to make any money. I’m expecting to write maybe 15 more short books, sold for either $1-$3. I mention this because this is my long term plan. Work my job, write books on amazon until I’m making about $300 from those books a month. Thats what I need to get started on my life goals.

But I do not expect to make any money from the books I write. It’s more about going through the process and learning and making myself better. Giving myself experience as well as having a foundation of writing, where if any of it is any good, I can use it for my future career in writing whatever that may be.

But unfortunately it turns out I need that $300 sooner than expected. I fear my life may fall apart over $300. Maybe not become homeless but I won’t be able to work on my goals for a long time if I have to spend all of my free time working low paying jobs. Which is why I started doing this! All of my money for this month is tied up. 

Does anyone have any ideas of a way for me to make $300 in a one month period, on the internet, without investing any money? I live purely off cash, and have zero extra money. I’m willing to put the work in, but as far as I know, most online money making ‘schemes’ are hit or miss. Or require some sort of buy in. Or want you to build a base of users and subscribers or who knows what, which doesn’t seem to me like a decent path to make a few hundred bucks. I’m not trying to get rich quick. Just make a little extra.

I don’t have any sort of qualifications. I have no reason why a person would want to hire me for anything other than cleaning dishes and flipping burgers. (That’s a lie, I used to work on electronics in the military, however after 8 years of trying and failing to get any job related to that, I have totally given up. Besides I have no transportation and I have no way of working a real job that is anything but minimum wage retail. I do not live in an area with good opportunity, at least not without a car that I know of.

So yea. Any ideas? Can I make $300 online in a month? I might even be able to extend it to 6 weeks.",01May2018,1
294,"As someone who is always interested in self-development and putting work out there, I have been wondering if I should get into photography. I have been into the idea of having a side hustle for a long time, and passive income interests me. To clarify, I don’t see it as easy income, but something I can invest time in and get dividends later, such as by selling stock photos. I like photographing people, and I always had a fascination with faces and their anatomy. This may sound cliche but I think that I get closest to people when I’m taking a picture for them. Now, I’m aware that there is more to it than that in terms of technicalities and such, and I’m willing to teach myself more through Udemy courses and such.

My question is, do you think I should invest in a camera? I have some money on the side, and I’m wondering if his is a good move. Some people told me a smartphone with a good camera can do the job, but I’m not sold on that idea. I am thinking that if I’m ever to make any money off photography and do work that satisfies me, I will need a decent camera. Do you have any thoughts on this? Do you think this is just a phase, or a possible good move? What goes into monetizing such type of creative work?

I have clinical depression but they have taken me off medication as I am actually getting better. 


So basically, I have a very pessimistic mindset and to rationalise that I use a procrastinor mindset. ""I'm going to fail these tests"" and to rationalise that I think ""They only matter in two years so I can relax for two years"".

And it gets worse when I get into university and the work actuslly challenges me and I have to work to get anywhere but I can't work.

While we were in his car a terrible feeling of horror washed over me. It got so bad that my face started to feel numb and I was having an actual panic attack. I felt like my life was in danger with this guy and I need to get away from him - even though he didn't do or say anything bad. We went to get coffee and he seemed to get annoyed over the smallest things the waitresses did but he didn't say anything to them. He also tried to look at my phone but I thought maybe he's just socially clueless and doesn't realize that you can't do that. That night ended up normally as well, he dropped me off at my house and everything was fine. 

I'm confused about this horrible anxious feeling I have. From the moment I met him I felt like there's something wrong with him but couldn't quite figure it out. He seems like a perfectly normal, hard-working guy. I've **never** been afraid of anyone - and I've seen some fucked up people in my life - but something about him makes all my senses scream *RUN!!!*

I have a way of just *knowing* things. For example: on the day my dad died I woke up much earlier than usual and felt really sad and overwhelmed for no reason. I ""knew"" that I was going to lose something soon. Later I got a phone call from my mom: my dad had died just then. 

But I also tend to worry for nothing. (I have an anxiety disorder.) Sometimes I can't tell whether I'm just being anxious or if I'm sensing a true danger. I don't know what to make of this Tinder-guy. Like I said, I'm not afraid of anyone. My fears consist of serious illnesses and other misfortune like that, but I'm never been afraid that someone might hurt me even though I've met some pretty awful people. But this guy... something about him makes me want to get as far away as possible, but the other side of me says *""What if you turn down a man who could turn out really great if you just gave him a chance?""*

We haven't met after that coffee date night but he has asked me to meet him again. I've been kind of avoiding him but haven't ignored him completely because I kinda wanna give him a chance. I don't want my anxiety to get the best of me.

But is it just anxiety, or something else? Should I see him again? What do you guys think about this situation?",01May2018,3

By 2021 I should be graduating, and then I'm off into the real world. In all honesty, I don't want to keep much contact with my parents. I feel they talk a lot of shit about me behind my back, especially about how stupid I fucking am. Because of this, I've just grown to become so fuckung uncomfortable being myself around them. I've made some very little attempts at vulnerability, but I feel they just pass it off as nothing. But to me, it took my whole fucking being to actually show some personality of mine towards you that isn't fake. It's not like they're bad people. They aren't, but I am so uncomfortable being around them that it's hard for me to even think straight, because I don't want to sound like an idiot. I just feel like I'm a piece of shit, because what kind of son would want to abandon their parents because of their fear towards them? I am an adult, yes? It is my decision to do this, but I personally feel this isn't healthy for me. If I am to be vulnerable, my mom would most likely talk about it with my step-father, leaving me embarrassed and hateful at the fact I even considered trying to open up to you.

I never really brushed regularly enough growing up, and my teef are all crooked anyways, so I'm doing what I can to undo the cosmetic damage (funnily enough, the last time I was at the dentist, he commented that my chompers were in pristine condition, besides not being terribly white). While I'm still *considering* the idea of braces, I want to do what I can with what I have.

322,"I have anxiety/depression and have zero education. I was raised in pretty unique circumstances you could say, so I've not had much experience with socialization and such. Most of my time was spent on video games, eating, and surfing the web. I pretty much learned everything I know from some form of media and the internet. Today this day I still struggle with some basic stuff, but I don't blame on my intelligence, I blame it on the fact I never had the opportunities others had. I'm not spiteful or jealous or anything, just sad I missed out on tons of life so far really. 

It doesn't help that I've started to go visibly bald very early, which has pretty much made me a social hermit for the past year or so, I've always had image issues and this seriously isn't helping things. It's not that I'm extremely unattractive or anything, It's just that a few years ago I finally got my weight to a good place and finally felt happy about the way I looked.

329,"I am 21 and I make friends just fine when I get to know them for a while. However, circumstances in my life has made me quite shy and most of the time lost with how to act towards strangers. Strangely I find it even harder to interact online. This is a huge problem because I draw and want to meet/talk to people who also draw but most of the time I get too nervous to even message people. The few times I did it was actually very positive and I made new friends. So I don’t even know what I’m worried about.

Though this also happens in real life too. I find it really awkward to interact with people. Most of the time I avoid eye contact when I see acquaintances just to not have to greet them. I also have been called out on acting inappropriately(in my culture) by forgetting to greet elder acquaintances when I’m out with my friends/family.

I get that most people have awkward moments but in my group of friends(5-6 people) almost all of my friends have friends from other major or are close to seniors. Seniors/friends from other major wouldn’t even approach me. When I’m with my friends and someone I also know approach my friend, I would also greet them (smile, say hi, try to act friendly) but most of the time they wouldn’t even acknowledge me. And this happens to almost everyone!

Also, in large groups of strangers I find it hard to speak up and subconsciously stay really quiet. I only talked when spoken to and end up saying ,in my mind, really awkward things.

Does anyone have similar problems? Do you know why strangers don’t approach you? How do you get over it? Anything to help?

My vacation this summer is scheduled for the entirety of my last full week of highschool (there will be two days the next week where I will be there, but I’m sure all of the seniors will be pretty transient by then, haha) and so I would have to miss my last full week. I would be able to get it excused, so I’m not concerned about that. I’m just worried that I’ll miss out on the sentimentality of the last week of my highschool career with my senior class.

Graduation is May 8th and my school has not issued out any information for me about it.  Earlier in the semester, I paid $20 to receive my diploma (I opted out of going to the ceremony).

I should add that my dog usually ignores it and only ocassionally barks back (but not in an aggressive way) while the other dog jumps on the house door growling.
It also bites their guests out of nowhere..one second he's minding his own business and in the next second he attacks the guest leaving a bloody mess.

I've tried to talk to the owners of the dog(cousin and aunt) about it but they completely ignore me. My family suggested castrating him but they don't want to do that and they won't come up with another solution.Whenever we confront them about it their argument is that he wouldn't have been here if our dog didn't mate with their dog and it's our fault.

I've posted here to ask for advice on what i should do at this point since they ignore our suggestions.We cannot live with fear of the dog in our own house.",01May2018,2

352,"I'm currently sitting in the library trying to figure myself out for the 5th month this year. My brain isn't getting any rest with urgency to figure out what in the hell I'm going to do with myself.

I switched my major 4 times and I'm getting embarrassed to see a counselor to change my major AGAIN. I've done the bare minimum to pass my math and computers classes. I've retaken this math class 3 times. I understand the material, but no matter what I do I end up failing all my exams. I receive financial aid, and this is my 3rd year at community college, with only 3 years of the Pell Grant to go. At this rate, I don't see myself even being able to get an associates degree.

I can't afford school if I don't get financial aid. My family was asked to leave an apartment complex that was lost by our landowner in an auction in December. We'd been there for a while and rent was low, we live in a high\-rent area, and the cheapest place we could find was a house in a horrible industrial area for $2,300 a month. I'm part of a family of 7: 2 children under 15 who I am practically raising, a narcissistic, depressed, and abusive mother, an abusive, drunk father who works way too \[physically\] hard for his age, an older schizophrenic brother with an expensive cigarette addiction who refuses help, a depressed younger brother who also suffers from PTSD and is recovering from drug/alcohol dependency, and then there's me. 

I work a part\-time job across the street that pays fairly well. That and my wonderful long\-distance boyfriend who I plan to move in with next year are probably the only two good things going on for me. Other than that, I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety, depression, PTSD and ADHD. I am seeing a therapist weekly, she's on vacation now for a couple more weeks, but I am not seeing any results. I'd much rather be on medication for faster results, but nobody seems to think it's a good idea. Every therapy session since February has been a venting session for the 1\-hour limit. 

I've experienced a variety of traumatic experiences in my life that have tore me down till I'm where I am now. Occasionally suicidal, and if it wasn't for my boyfriend snapping me back I probably would've jumped in front of that car in January. My ability to pay attention is quickly wasting away as I see myself perform worse and worse at work and most importantly at school. I can't seem to decide what I love, who I am, accept what I'm skilled at. I don't see myself in the workforce and being appreciated for my work. My entire future seems cloudy and I've contemplated breaking up with my boyfriend because of how despicable I feel. He deserves more.

I obviously need help, but from where? I feel like time is passing me by. I feel numb and I observe how people who started in worse positions than me have gotten up on their feet and been successful, why can't I? Where do I start?

\*\*TL;DR: Part\-time student, part\-time worker, living with a dysfunctional family and diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and mild ADHD. Feel useless and tired of my mind racing with thoughts every minute of the day. Where do I start?\*\*",01May2018,1

I didnt get laid before for multiple reasons, the main reason is because i was focused on improving myself, gym, studies, work and personal work. in the past, i didn't care much since i was young and thought i had time, but now i am starting to become mad.

now before you judge me, just know that i am a highly disciplined individual. i listen and i learn. patience is one of my highest abilities. i am a computer science major. i was usually an extremely boring but nice person with nothing interesting to talk about especially with girls, unless its a common college topic and thats all.

because i am getting older each day, years are passing by, i am dynamically changing, college studies are getting me frustrated, this is getting me frustrated too and because of this i am becoming more ""violent"". violent in a sense that, i am deleting away the personality of me when i was nice to everyone. i am no longer taking shit from anybody, if something bothers me i say it. if a girl starts drama i stop it. if someone talks about something and i believe thats wasting my time, i just cut him/her off and go straight to the point. i am becoming more aggressive each day. you may call me a douche or an asshole, and that's okay too, because i no longer give a fuck about other peoples opinions.

i appreciate the truth no matter how hard it is and i do not forgive lies. advice is not an opinion and i am here for your advice. i need an honest advice. if am i doing something wrong, tell me so i can fix it.

354,"My grandma used to be a very very active person. She went to work until she was 72, and would've continued if it wasn't because of several health issues regarding chronic pain in her back, waist and fingers. Because of this she cannot walk long distances either or stand for long periods of time.

Another important issue is that she is almost completely deaf, this is the only reason her drivers licence was revoked, because her mind is perfectly sharp and she was very capable of driving, even when she could not listen much. So this is a problem, because if she could still drive, she would be able to visit her sisters or go to the supermarket to kill time by herself, but now she can't.

I've taught her how to use Netflix on the smart tv in my living room, also how to use Facebook and WhatsApp on her phone or tablet so she could communicate with people by writing, but she is so deeply sad. She is tired of those things already, she has nothing to do and spends the day alone at home because the rest of the family works all day.

I hate seeing her like this. She doesn't like to go out anywhere because she can't hear people talk or be part of any conversation. I just want some ideas of things she could do during the day at home besides what I've mentioned before and crossword puzzles.

362,"Hi, r/advice.

# Tell me, what’s going on?

My girlfriend (15 y.o.), who left home in the summer of 2017,
is facing tremendous problems with her future at the moment and no one knows what to do.

It all started with her stepdad.
She and he got along quite well until he started sexually  and physically abusing her (no rape, fortunately, but still horrifying) and after 4-5 years, she had had enough and left home.

## What about going to the police?

She also started an investigation which is ending at the moment with the conclusion that since it’s her word against his, there’s no way to prove the stuff actually happened and the court gave her stepdad an ultimatum that either he pays 320$~ or the investigation will continue.
Now, her mother doesn’t want the investigation to continue and live with sweet ignorance that everything is okay.
So she’s paying the 300$ and that’s gonna be the end of it.

### Where did she go and where is she now?


After that she went to live with her now ex-boyfriend and continued to live there the whole summer until they broke up due to the relationship just not working.
Anyway, after that she moved to the city to live with her biological father’s (who she doesn’t know quite well) friend and is living there at the moment, but they had a verbal agreement that she will stay there only until the end of 9th grade and that agreement stands.
Her grandmother won’t give her the empty apartment she owns because she wants to start renting it out because apparently she needs the money.

#### What about her mother? Does she care at all?

She can’t go back home since the stepdad doesn’t let her back anymore and he threatens to move out anytime the subject comes up.
Hell, her mother and she wanted to go on a 3-day cruise and he said that if the mother doesn’t cancel the reservation, he will move out.
They can’t even meet up without it being a secret.

It appears she (her mother) will so anything to keep him in the house with their 6~ kids.

Her mother doesn’t even let her speak to his stepdad anymore because she’s scared my gf will fuck something up and he will leave.

##### Okay, how’s the financial situation? Does she have a job? Can she rent an apartment or something?

The financial support my girlfriend is getting from her mother is quite small as well, she isn’t even getting the child support that should be going to her now because she doesn’t live there and is meant for her needs.

She gets money from time to time when she asks for it, but in small amounts.
She also has to purchase her food herself.

After graduating 9th grade, she plans to go to work but almost no one hires minors full-time.

Hence the problem - what should she do to secure a normal life with a future for her?

I have run out of advice and she has almost given up after the investigation ending.

Any questions are welcome.

Please give me some advice to pass on to her, r/advice. I’ll tell her you guys helped tremendously and show her the thread.

She’s in dire need of assistance and advice.
Thank you, Reddit.

TL;DR
15 year old girlfriend left home due to abusive stepdad, can’t go back.
Doesn’t have a place to live after graduating 9th grade and having problems with finding a job.

363,"I currently have a 2.5 cumulative gpa and I’m in my junior year. I don’t do any extra circulars or volunteer work. I feel like I have no chance of getting into any serviceable worthwhile non-community college even if I did get a 3.8+ gpa throughout my senior year and did a lot of volunteer work. My cumulative gpa would not rise at all to meet the minimum requirements of many colleges, and all that hard work would’ve been for nothing..   

My freshman year was the problem, I had a 1.6 cumulative then. Sophomore and Junior I have maintained around a 2.9 average. I have struggled with depression and carpal tunnel and it severely affected my ability to perform well. My family was very strained freshman year as a result of my depression, I was lonely, had not a single friend, everyone laughed at me, I constantly cried myself to sleep at nights and would forget to do homework because of it. Since then I have gotten much better but I still fall into bouts of hopelessness, and my situation doesn’t make me feel much better about it.    

I want to get out of Illinois and move to California to go to college but I don’t even feel like it’s possible at this point, and that I’ll have to do years of community college first here. I looked up schools in California that accept low gpas and nothing said a 2.5.

366,"So there have been nothing but trouble with my (F22) latest roommate (M27). This might get long, he's really managed to do a lot in those few months, and I probably forgot to write down a lot because it's been so much. I just skipped the minor things (like not helping to clean) because if I did I'd probably write an entire novel.
(I'm sorry this got so long, but he's been doing so much stuff that I feel is important to mention)



Some backstory and facts frist;
He moved in the first week of February, and work shifts where he is gone for 12 days before he's home for 9. «Amazing» I thought, I prefer having the apartment to myself, but couldn't move before my lease is up the 1st of July. I was desperate for someone to take over the room because I wasn't able to cover the entire rent for the apartment on my own.


So he moves in, and signs a contract with me for renting one of the rooms in the apartment (a two bedroom, decently sized and SUPER CHEAP) Literally the first day he and his buddies who are moving in his bed and stuff they fuck up the wall in the hallway. Fine, whatever, that can be fixed. (I were furious but my stepfather is a carpenter and volunteered to fix it, so ok, I’ll still get my security deposit)


Second; I noticed that some of my hair care stuff were not standing how I left them in our shared bathroom. I didn’t think too much of it at first, I just thought I were being paranoid. When I got back after Easter break one of my hair brushes were covered in what I believe were beard balm. I kind of freak out because what the hell? Who uses other people’s hairbrushes without permission? That’s disgusting.


I confronted him about this and about how utensils, bowls and plates were disappearing from my kitchen (everything in the kitchen belongs to me, I gave him permission to BORROW stuff)
And holy hell he got defensive. Everything were my fault and if someone had used my stuff then someone else must have access to the apartment. All lies, since there only exist two sets of keys, where we both have one each. I doubt my female friends who have been in the apartment use beard balm, and more importantly; he were the only person who had been in the apartment during the prior few weeks. 



So the last time he were away for work I decided to hunt down the missing kitchenware, because it had to be in his bedroom, shit doesn’t just disappear into thin air, right? I did find almost everything after shifting through his room for over an hour, it looked like something straight out from Hoarders: Buried Alive, I felt nauseous afterwards… Everything were covered in old food (the bowls had been missing for over two weeks and were covered in dried yoghurt, for example) and the worst of it all? I found it all in the trash bags he had all over the room.
I don’t have cheap IKEA-utensils and stuff. I have collected stuff over several years for when I move out and everything is rather expensive. The utensils for example cost more than his fucking rent, so I were pretty livid. And now one of my wine glasses have disappeared, I cannot for the life of me find it in his room.


And did I mention how the landlord called me the other day to inform me that my roommate hadn’t gotten paid from work and were two months behind on rent? Yeah, that happened. It’s not my problem since he pays directly to the landlord, but jesus christ, he didn’t even have the decency to tell me about it. Getting the money for the electrical bill that we also splitt is a nightmare and a half.
He also out of the blue in mid April told me he were moving out in the end of April (this was when I confronted him about stuff missing) but he would find someone to take over his lease first (…good luck with getting anyone to take over the last two months of a lease when it’s waaaay out of season)


Sunday afternoon three weeks ago when he’s supposed to leave for work I was minding my own business, waiting for him to leave so my FF could come over. (I was trying to be considerate and not exile him so I could bang like the nice roommate I am.) Then I get a message from him about how there is someone coming over in like an hour and staying in his room for the next two weeks. I panic. Long story short; I have anxiety and this set of the worst anxiety attack I’ve had, ever.
He really thought that I’d agree to let a complete stranger live in my apartment for two weeks, without giving me more than an hour heads up, and without even giving me a NAME so I could check out who this person even is??? 


Honestly I don’t even know how to formulate my question; what the hell do I do? How do I deal with this without angering him even more and getting my stuff back?
I’m so lost atm, he’s fucking awful to live with and I cannot have weekly anxiety attacks until mid June, I have to concentrate on my finals.
I really want to kick him out, but I can’t cover the rent on my own, and I get the keys to my new place on the 12th of June, which is so close… 
Do I hide all my utensils under my bed and only use it myself or? 
I’d talk properly with him if he actually ever left the bedroom, but he doesn’t at all when I’m at home (seriously, he hasn’t left his room in over 30 hours at the time of writing this post) And he just gets defensive and refuse to listen to what I try to say.",01May2018,1
367,"hello, so i'm not sure how this works, but here goes. two days ago, i found out i failed the entrance exam for my dream school. this is depressing because i worked so hard for that exam, and i did well in all of my mock tests. everyone expected me to pass. but i had a fight with my mom the night before the exam that put me in a really bad condition. i was out of focus, sleepy, extremely anxious, and i started panicking from all the pressure. naturally, i failed. this a big deal not only because, well, it's my dream school, but it was my last shot at a college. it was the only school i could afford for the program i wanted. i only applied to two schools. i got accepted in the other one in a program i loved, but i had to let it go since it was expensive. deadlines for enrollment passed two weeks ago.  so basically my problem is that i don't have a college at the moment. i have several plans, but they're all a bit sketchy:
a) apply for reconsideration for my dream school. they do accept a number of students, and this is a common suggestion as many people get in this school this way. but the earliest they allow for this process is on May 9. i'm gonna try, but i highly doubt i'll get accepted either because their basis are the entrance exam scores and grades (junior yr grades are great. senior yr, not so much)
b) appeal for the second school. they might be expensive, but they're known to be considerate with lesser privileged families and generous with fin aid. only problem is i missed the deadline. but accdg to some people they accepted cases like this before.
c) study in a public school. although most school are not accepting anymore, some of them are not so strict. earn units then transfer to either of my dream schools.
d) if all else fails, take a gap year. apply after. i can accept this. but i know i will be facing a lot of shame for it.
i don't know what to do at the moment. i should also add that i can't act on anything until my mom is here, and she won't be in at least a week. what should i do? i am incredibly depressed and anxious. i've been locked in my room for two days straight. i would alternate between ignoring everything and pretending everything is ok, and breaking down crying. friends have tried to reach out but i just can't talk to them right now. i can't just do nothing but at the same time i can't do anything. i feel like i should continue with my routine - working out and reading - but that's just so hard to do right now. i want sleep for one month. i can't focus. so much of my future is unknown, and there's nothing i can do atm. i need help. what should i do?",01May2018,1

So I'm 15 and for the past 4 years in my school everyone has been making jokes about me going out with this girl from school since we are the two smartest in our class and the think it would be 'cute'. As a result we have formed sort of a hate for each other and we try to keep away, scared someone will make a joke if we sit on the same table etc. However after a year or two I realised that on the few occasions we have talked we have had interesting discussions and that she is kinda hot. For the last two years I have had a secret crush on her, and only my cousin knows. Everyone thinks we don't actually like each other but still make jokes. Over the past year we have started to talk a little more and sometimes have a discussion at break. Also during sports we often play badminton together, and I try to help her get better. In the last month a sort of 'nerd' table has formed at break including me, a couple of my friends, her and her friends. We have started to talk quite often as a group and carried on our conversations in a group chat too. I would like to tell her about my crush before summer. I'm thinking of writing a confession of sorts and sending it to her through WhatsApp in a private chat, explaining the whole situation and asking if we could be friends next year.

373,"Cross post from my r/relationships post. I had some great advice from over there but it’s always nice to hear from more people. 

He is a pathological liar, I knew this and I gave him way too many chances. 

Over spring break we were not dating. On a break I guess, due to his lying. I knew he was flirting with another girl but I didn’t know the extent of it. 

When he got back from spring break I asked him how much he liked her. I said I wanted to date him and go to prom with him, and he could go to therapy for his issues and maybe things would work out. He said he loved me, he agreed, and he realized the other girl meant nothing to him. He told me they never had sex. I wrote him this incredibly long note about how much our relationship meant to me, how badly the lying hurt, and how much I wanted him to get better and we could work things out. I poured my heart out in that note. I spent a week perfecting it. He read the note and said it made him realize just how much I meant to him.

Well apparently it didn’t really mean that much to him, because he slept with another girl merely days later. That Saturday was prom. He arrived at my house, shook hands with my father and said he would be a gentleman. I just now found out that barely half an hour beforehand, he had been in that girl’s car going for round two. While I was off buying shoes to match my dress, getting my hair done, and picking up his boutonniere, he was in her car. According to her, they were sitting in her car when he said “shit, I gotta go.” He almost forgot to pick me up for prom. Because he was with her. 

All night he told me how much he loved me.
All night he told me he was so glad we were back together. I can’t even fathom this. 

I was so dumb for giving him another chance. I should have known he would never change. He was a liar when we broke up and he’s a liar now. I can’t change him. 

He dated her and I simultaneously for over a week. We had sex because I thought he was serious about dating me. And the very next day, the day of prom, he couldn’t keep his pants on around this other girl. He took me to prom, told me he loved me and he wanted things to get better, he was done with the lying and the manipulation.

I’ve been talking to the other girl. She had no idea this was going on, either. Apparently he lied to both of us about each other. She’s been so sweet through all of this and I don’t blame her at all. She showed me all the texts he sent her while I was off buying him gifts for prom. He used all the same lines on her that he used on me. I can’t even begin to describe how much it hurt to read. 

God, I feel like such an idiot. All my friends warned me this would happen and I didn’t listen. I was head over heels for him, I ignored the warning signs and gave him another chance that he didn’t deserve. 

How do I cope with this? I’ve never been hurt this badly before. I’m afraid that I will have trust issues in future relationships now. I don’t know what to do.

381,"My cousin is in his senior year of high school and he doesn't seem like he has any will to want to do anything or talk to anyone. Little bit of a backstory, we used to be super close and played League all the time until I moved out for college around September. We haven't talked much since because I got too busy with my own things in college, but I knew at the time he didn't have any real friends and he would spend all his free time playing video games. Recently, I heard from my aunt and his siblings that he had been isolating himself from others. 

At the moment, he doesn't have any motivation to apply for college \(his parents are forcing him to at this point\). He's got a few months before he graduates and leave the house, but the main concern is that he doesn't know how to function without his family constantly taking care of him. He's never applied or had a job before, his family does most of the cooking and he never goes outside or have made friends. In his spare time when he's not doing homework, he just only sleeps and play video games and this cycle just repeats every day. The biggest problem I have with it is that according to his family members, they been trying to converse with him and help out, but he would just glare at them, giving vague answers and would just isolate himself in his room for the rest of the day. 

At this point, I believe that he's suffering under depression. All of us have tried talking to him, but he doesn't want to talk about it and my family has recommended him to go to a therapist, but he refuses to see one. I understand it is most logical to let him to go through his own failures, but we everyone in my family thinks that if we let him try surviving on his own, he'll just end up homeless. I'm not too sure what to do!?!",01May2018,1
383,"So, a brief overview of my life:

I was born in 1999 in the States but moved to South Korea and grew up there pretty much, and graduated high school 2-3 years earlier than my peers. I was also the student council president, and even graduated as the valedictorian. And I am now currently a junior in college in the U.S., and will be a senior next semester. But am I happy at the moment? idk..

So I know the problem I have: lack of social activity and connections. I'm more of an introvert than an extrovert, but I have no problem talking to new people around me and even taking the initiative. It's just that..whenever I talk with my so-called ""friends"" I'm not enjoying myself. I just laugh and go along with what they say, when in reality I'm not interested at all. So they're more like associates than friends to me.
Yet, it's not as if I had no friends at all. When I was in high school, I played with my friends all day, had fun hanging out with them, spent the night at their house, went to various places together, spent most of my weekends with them, etc. You get what I'm saying.
But ever since I entered college, everything changed. I have no real friends, don't have fun hanging out with people, and have been pretty much shutting myself in my dorm. I have ZERO social life now. And I'm still only 18 years old despite being a junior in college, so I try to avoid college parties.

Am I just experiencing a cultural difference in the States and therefore don't feel connected when talking with the people here? But the thing is, I attended an international church in South Korea while I was there, and I never really had a problem connecting with people from Africa, Europe, Russia, Bangladesh, India, Kazakhstan, and more.
Idk what I'm doing with my life.. ",01May2018,2

387,"My parents staunchly conservative, mainly my dad. My dad is a farmer, and over the weekend he wanted me to help him work all through the night since it’s “planting season”. He always picks on me with these types of jobs, I have an older brother, but because he’s going to play college football he’s of course the favorite child, so they let him do whatever he wants. 
As for me, I’m not into sports, and instead want to be a graphic designer some day. My parents being conservative, of course, have an irrational hatred towards video games, and keep telling me that it’s a worthless major, and I’ll never be able to be able to contribute to society. (Sorry for the slight off course rant)


Anyways, my dad needed help a couple nights ago, and wanted me to go to his field where he was planting to help him fix something, I don’t know what it was. I told him over the phone that it’s 11 at night, and I have a trip I’m going on with my friends the next morning. He told me he didn’t care, he wanted me to go help him. I finally stood up for myself and told him no, and he got furious with me. I went back to sleep. 

Maybe 15 minutes later he storms into the house and bursts into my room, and pulls me out of bed. He made me get my “work clothes” on, and he started screaming at me for being an insubordinate. He blamed my video games for “melting my brain”, and then he went into the living room and unplugged my Xbox and carried it off somewhere, the Xbox I bought with my money. I told him to give me back my Xbox and he kept screaming “fuck you!” 

He made me get in the pick up, and when I did against my will, he got in the driver seat and kept screaming at me “if you miss that trip with your friends that’s tough shit, I own your ass! It’s time to grow up and put this video game shit to rest! It’s all you fucking do!” I didn’t catch the last part, but he was expecting me to help him the next day, since I was off of work that day. He also told me I’m never seeing my Xbox again. 

I play video games, yes, but I also have a job at Menard’s (we don’t have many jobs available in our area) I make good money for a part time high schooler. I only play video games for like an hour on average. 

Although I’m older than my brother. my parents still want me to look up to him, and they prop him up all the time, if I ever ask why he can’t help Dad out, they always claim that he “can’t afford an injury”. His workout only takes the morning, and nothing more. If I work, it’s from morning to well into the evening. Yet I’m seen as the POS of family. I don’t know why, maybe for not being a gifted athlete, I guess. 

I don’t know what to do. I hate this family so much, and I’m absolutely done with them. I just wish I could drive my car west, and settle in the town it breaks down in. I don’t know what to do with my life, I don’t get any positive support from my family. I can’t handle their over the top punishments any longer.

388,"So this is hard for me to type because I know I'm in the wrong in almost everything I'm going to say, but please hear me out.

I had a difficult upbringing, I won't go into specifics but I had ADHD, I had a really bad temper and I was violent. I threw the biggest tantrums when I was a kid and I feel so so bad for my single mother for what she had to go through. I would hit her, and I would sometimes hit my sister when things didn't go my way. The times when I wasn't like this, life would be pretty normal and I would get along with both my mother and my sister.

When I was 12/13 I would sometimes hump or grind on my sister (who is 2 years younger than me), however I would never touch her. It began with playfighting then I would end up doing that. I'm not making excuses for this behaviour because although I didn't feel guilt back then when I would do it, I knew it wasn't right. This went on for a year or two, I would do it when my mother wasn't home. She would never say anything to me when I did it. My sister didn't tell anyone about this until when she was 13 or 14 she tried overdosing on pills and subsequently saw a shrink who she then told about what I had been doing. The police got involved as a formality but we were both still children and I just told them it was always just play fighting. I lied, but I had no other option. Nothing else came of it but I knew it completely shocked my parents.

Basically throughout my childhood, I was a hyper violent, abusive devil-child and the guilt I feel after having the time to reflect on it all is huge.

My sister and I are in our mid-20s now and we get on pretty much great. However, the other day I found a USB. On it was her IM chats to her friends when she was a teenager and some diaries. Yes, I looked through it all. I should have known better, but I now know the extend to which my actions have had a toll on her.

I discovered that she used to self-harm, she's now on anti-depressants. She wrote that I sexually and physically abused her when I was growing up, which I did, and that its the reason why she's so mentally fucked now. She would tell her friends how much she hates my guts and despises me. She hasn't forgotten anything, in fact the last thing she wrote about me was last year.

The thing is, we get on great these days, but I don't know what to do now that I know how she feels about me still. We've never actually spoken about any of it. Should I just talk to her straight out about what I did to her? I don't want her to get suspicious that I've seen that USB flash drive.

I know what you all must think of me and I don't blame you for thinking it, I just want my sister to at least be able to think of me as someone who cares deeply for her, which I do.",01May2018,1

391,"Sorry for my english I am not a native speaker-
Yesterday I attented a college party with some of my friends and a girl I've been flirting now for a while. I knew beforehand that I will probably have sex with her afterwards, because I could feel the sexual tension that build up in the last weeks.

So the thing is on this party there was also my ex-girlfriend. I broke up with my ex about 1 year ago, because although I really like her, I never really caught feelings for her. I told her exactly that and even it made her pretty sad, we seperated on pretty good terms. We´ve been together for 6 months.

At the party I chatted a bit with my ex and everything was fine. When the party was over me and new girl decided to go to her place and smoke some weed. When my friends heard the word weed they thought it would be great to join us and so they did. One of my friends who joined us talked for a while with my ex and so it happened the way it had to she also went with us to new girls apartment.

We continued drinking and having fun altogether until only my ex, new girl, my male roommate and me were left over. My ex asked new girl if it was ok for her if she would sleep on the couch and new girl wasn't amazed by this, but she said yes.

Fast forward 30 minutes. New girl and I are kissing beside my shitfaced roommate in her bed, while my ex is ""sleeping"" on the couch. She could hear us kissing packed her things and left the apartment.

Today ex sent me a text on how unrespectful I treated her. I for now don't want to share my personal opinion on this, because I feel very conflicted. Feel free to hate on me and insult me.


TL;DR: Kissed new girl in the same room as my ex. Ex left. Fucked afterwards. ",01May2018,0
392,"Hi everyone,

I really am stuck and I don't know where to begin. Me and my partner have been together almost 10 years, we have two children 4 and almost 2. And recently, we've been hurting each other so much...

We don't want to lose each other, we love each other. But we've become mother and father and we're no longer best friends. We both just feel drained, and scared that we've drifted apart to much.

I honestly don't want another woman, she truly is everything to me yet I feel us drifting further apart and it's killing me. I'm willing to fight for her every day for the rest of my life, but I just don't know where to begin to rekindle those deep feelings again. We do truly love each other, but we're just tired of hurting each other... and it's all seems to be down to the fact that I've lost my best friend.

394,"Idk what it is but whenever I suggest something to someone (usually where i see inefficiency or where i think there is a better choice or metvod) they snap at me and will say ""im Ron (me), im superior"" when really im just suggesting something that would improve their life or other people involved.

For example, when my friend washes the dishes he leaves the water running the whole time. This bothers me both bc im an environmental major and bc i pay for the water too. But when i suggest turning it off in between dishes or using a large pot of water instead i get taunted with the ""im ron, im superior"" or he says ""that makes me want to change less"" and its getting to me.

I dont mean to hurt anyone or make it seem like im superior and i certainly dont want to cayse problems. Imo i think these people are just insecure or defensive about their way of life/resistant to change/lazy. I would love if someone pointed out an inefficiency in my life and offered a suggestion, so why when i do it do i get this response?

Other instances include me looking something up online when i think theyre wrong and explaining to them their error but that is also poorly received. For example when debating whether pluto is a planet, ill google it and show them and ill get the same ""oh you know everything dont you?"" Response and its eating me up. 

The truth and being efficient is really important to me and i would hate to change just to avoid these negative reactions, but its getting really bothersome.

To conclude with a last example, my friend was arguing about opinions and how i shouldnt try to force mine on someone but i dont get how suggestions or truth seeking is seen as forcing my opinion. If someone thinks the earth is flat that really isnt an opinion, theyre just blatantly wrong and i try to explain for their sake, not to sound superior bc i could care less, but ill still get the same response.

396,"I don’t really know where to begin...

Growing up I was always lauded as being one of those really smart kids. I was in the gifted program and a straight A student. College humbled me tremendously, I started as a premed/bio major but had to switch to English my junior year due to non-competitive grades. This is where I feel a lot of my problems stem from.
 
Now, I’ve been out of college since last May and am currently working as a “marketing coordinator” at a job that leaves me feeling incredibly unfulfilled. All I do all day is look for leads for the sales team, and I’m given no direction by my boss. To top it off, I’m only making $18.50 an hour. 

My social life isn’t doing much better... I recently moved back to my home city and have been having a hard time connecting with other people. My romantic life is even worse, I am 23 years old and have never even come close to having a boyfriend. At this point I feel like it’s something that just is never going to happen. 

Last but not least, my whole worldview has shifted towards a nihilistic/pessimistic perspective... so lately I’ve been feeling like giving up and blowing my brains out.  I feel like an absolute failure in all facets of my life. I’m not very pretty, not very smart, and not very witty.

398,"Ok, I am very keen to get involved in activism against discrimination and I would love to eventually get involved with a group like the Southern Poverty Law Centre.

However, I am concerned with a couple of things. One I don't like the purity test type thing, everyone has failings and it seems like a lot of these groups are willing to self doxx members if they make one mistake.

Two, I like taking a sociological approach to it and thinking about wider processes and ways of rehabilitation (those who once held hateful views changing their ways and making amends).

I don't like the approach groups like Antifa seem to take which is that if 'someone is a homophobe they are destined to be homophobic forever and they deserve to die etc. etc.'

It seems to me that a lot of people who hold reactionary views sometimes do this because something has gone wrong somewhere in their life. The way to change this is to encourage in my opinion a compassion (not a weakness to be taken advantage of though).

I once held very reactionary views to drug users. I basically thought they were scum of the earth if I am honest. I am still highly anti-drug and straight edge but now I see that help should be part of the equation (in some instances, still don't much care for 'Weed Culture' and the Nihilism that seems to go with it).

401,"Short explanation: I think a lot of people have dealt with someone like this. In my situation it is a close friend. Friends since high school, but they constantly question the friendship and get jealous of other friends I have. I am not perfect, but this person has made mistakes and when I call them out they turn things on me when I have done nothing wrong.

Long explanation: Both 21 year old female college students. Friends since 15. I will refer to her as Rocket. We lived in the same city until about 2 years ago when I left my hometown for university, but only live 1.5hrs from each other. I visit hometown frequently and she has visited me 3-4 times. 
A month ago I was in a car accident where it was the other persons fault. No injuries, but it was slightly traumatic. Insurance was handling it, but my car was “totaled” (still drivable, but severe body damage) and not worth much. I wouldn’t have received enough money to get a decent car and my car was great before the accident. I drove the car to my hometown to get it (hopefully) fixed by a different friend for a good price. They weren’t sure they could fix it until I got there and I was really on edge. I could not afford to lose my car. 
I called Rocket to see if she wanted to hang out while I was in town and explained the car situation to her. She was overly optimistic and telling me everything would be fine even if I had to get a new car. I explained to her I couldn’t afford it, and word for word: “I’m hoping for the best but gotta be prepared for the worst.” Rocket’s family is wealthy and I guess she took this the wrong way and exploded saying “well maybe if you are that worried you should’ve been more attentive and prevented the accident...I know it was their fault legally, but you could’ve drove out of the way(etc.)”.  
Of course I had a lot on my mind and said “ok I’ll talk to you later” and hung up. After I got in town I texted Rocket saying what she said wasn’t cool, the convo escalated to her calling me a “know it all” although I said nothing rude back. We didn’t talk for a few days and she eventually (awkwardly) apologized.
Her birthday goes by about two weeks later and I call/text her at midnight and we text throughout the day. She forgot my birthday a few months ago, no big deal, but I feel this is hypocritical when you hear what comes next.
She calls upset a few days later saying I didn’t even ask if she wanted to celebrate and that it’s “pathetic” she has to ask me to do something for her birthday. Her birthday is on a school day and 2 weeks before finals. I figured we would celebrate after finals when we both have breaks.
She then mentions I shouldn’t hold what she said about my car accident against her (I’m not) and she also began trash talking another friend of mine saying “she’s done so much worse than me, how are you her friend?” etc.
How would you deal with this? I want so badly to remain close friends, but I will not apologize for things I haven’t done and I will not let her continue to talk down on my friends or me. We have been best friends for a while and this whole thing sucks, but is so exhausting.",01May2018,1

That was my final straw and I immediately stopped talking to her.

408,"I'm 17, and I really want to be an actress, but I keep doubting that I can do that, or just be successful and happy. I struggle with depression and anxiety, but I always listen to the negatives. Where do I start from here? Is it too late for me?",01May2018,1
410,"Two of my friends ( 18M) invited an unpopular sophomore (16F) She's bullied a lot and doesn't have many friends They got her very drunk everything after that is very blurry. 

She said yes but was clearly intoxicated then told her to take off her clothes. She did. They took her to another house and told her to start doing sexual things and she did. When they penetrated her she was squirming a lot and said it hurt and i think she started to bleed and have a tear in her vagina now. 

The next day they called her ugly, fat, gross, slt and disgusting. She had a crush on one of my friends but they this was her fault and she wanted. Are they bad people I don't know this girl but shes very quiet and nice. She wants to see one of the guys again because she said shes lonley. Are they bad? 

TL;DR:Friends invited unpopular girl to party and did stuff to her",01May2018,1
411,"I’ve been looking for challenging things that can keep my mind busy and interested like the only thing really is making music that makes me wanna develop my future skills and techniques but that’s more of a hobby than it ever being a goal. 

I just don’t know what to start to do with my life at the moment university has come to an end and I’m stuck with wether to carry on or just walk away and focus on something else at the end of the day a career would be nice but I’m not getting any chances in jobs even though I have a lot of experience in different roles.

I’m just loosing my mind slowly and starting to really give up motivating myself to have a future when I really have nothing going for me. 

Is saving up and travelling the best next step? ",01May2018,1
412,"Sorry if this isnt the right place to ask this.

Ok so a few hours ago I heard my neighbor shouting very agressivly and heard a few loud thumps, like heavy shit getting thrown into the floor. Half an hour or so after that he left and screeched his tires down the street from the speed he pulled off at. He then returned and started shouting again but this time it was worse so me and my housemate decided to go have a look. He was in a state, like really freaking out. He then told us he went to the shops and while he was there someone entered his house and assaulted his wife (but didn't steal anything). He then called for an ambulance. We noticed his knuckles were really red... we live in a town house/ complex (don't know if it's called something else overseas) and we havnt had a single break in in 17 years. When the ambulance arrived the driver came up to me and asked what happened and I told him straight that I think he beat up his wife and that I think his story is complete bullshit... His wife was in very bad shape. Bleeding from at least 3 wounds on her head. Looked kind of concussed. Couldn't walk by herself and had to be carried out.

This was 5 hours ago and I feel a little fucked up. Was it my place to tell the paramedic that... what if my assumptions are all wrong?
