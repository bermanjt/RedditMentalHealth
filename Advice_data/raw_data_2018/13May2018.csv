0,"Bit of backstory:
So I recently got together with a guy (which my friends supported me on) and I've honestly never been happier and it's also my first serious relationship. We spend the same amount of time as we did as friends, just the extra night over. But out of nowhere, one of my closest friends texted me, accusing me of not texting her and another friend anymore and that I'm too involved and moving too quick in the relationship, also stating that other people have noticed that we 'sneak off'. Firstly, I'm not a good 'text-ee' and I'm very introverted and bad at conversations and secondly, she lives a few cities away and the 'people' she's on about in fact, don't mind or care about us doing our own thing, in fact we tell our friends if we're leaving for lunch and invite them. I'm honestly hurt. Truth be told this text was sent a while back but it still reels around in my mind. I don't feel guilty nor do I feel in the wrong, but I can't help but feel paranoid and awkward around my friends now after this whole thing. So I'd like some outsider unbiased opinion and advice, am I in the wrong and should I cut ties with my friend or keep going on?",13May2018,1
1,"Long story short, living with my parents sucks. I get complete privacy when my boys are over, but when I have a girl over my mom tends to be very eavesdropping and annoying. She‚Äôll sneak up next to my door to try to hear what‚Äôs going on and whatnot, and being 21 it‚Äôs not fun at all and creeps the girls I‚Äôm with out. The only time I can actually have sex is when my parents are at work and me and a girl are both free.

My mom has pretty bad bipolar disorder and tends to kick my door in randomly when I‚Äôm alone, as if to catch me shooting up heroin or something. She‚Äôll kick my door and scream ‚ÄúWHAT ARE YOU DOING?‚Äù, and even after sitting down with both parents to talk she won‚Äôt listen. She‚Äôs pretty whacked out and has a lot of breakdowns where she‚Äôll snap and go into a rage screaming about how me and my dad make her so miserable, though we do everything around the house and she just sits on the couch all day after work watching TV and eating junk food. I also can‚Äôt install a lock on my door since my dad won‚Äôt allow it.

I have a pretty decent job set up for the summer which will leave me with about $7000. 

I‚Äôm going to be a junior at a college 30 minutes away, and was thinking about getting an apartment around there. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôll probably be $3500 down or so, and I just don‚Äôt know if I should save the money and live with my parents another whole year (it‚Äôs that bad) and sacrifice my mental health, or get an apartment where I can have friends over, throw some parties here and there, and just have better mental health but spending $3500.

I‚Äôll still have my job during the school year where I‚Äôll be racking in $550 per week.

3,"My boyfriend and I have a pretty strong relationship, and go out to dinner every week at least once. His parents are currently in the process of moving and it's been very hard on them, especially his dad. We decided to invite his dad to come to dinner with us, just to be nice and try and get his mind of everything. Dinner was going well, and during a pause in conversation I started to talk to my boyfriend about something. I was looking at him, and out of the corner of my eye I saw his dad do the ""talking to much"" hand gesture. This struck me as very insulting. I ignored it until I was in private with my boyfriend, and asked him if I was being made fun of. He said his dad was just ""making a joke"" and told me to let it go. I know I should, and I don't want to confront his dad or anything like that, I just want to know if I have the right to be hurt by this? ",13May2018,2

My family only consists of myself, my mom, dad and my uncle. My parents have lived with my uncle for years and he has supported them. 

My parents are also heroin addicts, and have already asked for some of the life insurance when the time comes but I don't want to give them any without knowing where it will go.

My uncles home is in a reverse mortgage so we are 99% sure we will sell it back to the bank because I don't want them extra payments or hassle. My parents will not have a place to live.

I have thought about trying to find them a cheap one bedroom and help them out with a few bills but only for a couple of months. Like a sink or swim situation to make sure they can at least TRY to take care of themselves.

10,"Hello all. Recently I‚Äôve been into trying my attempt at reselling streetwear. Every Thursday I wake up at 9 and set up for the supreme drop at 10. I‚Äôll only go for what is limited or ‚Äúhyped up‚Äù I don‚Äôt do this manually. I use a bot, basically a program that checks out fast. There‚Äôs no guarantee it‚Äôll work, I haven‚Äôt been successful in about 3 weeks. This transferred me to  the sneaker market. I became interested and I know all the upcoming sneaker releases. Some are hyped up and limited. Some are very wide. And some are in the middle as in I can still go in to footlocker and pick them up. 

Anyway I haven‚Äôt made any money reselling supreme and haven‚Äôt gotten lucky on buying any shoes. Until last week. 

A pair of Air Jordan ones released and there was a local store that was having an event. I brought my dad along because it was a women‚Äôs size and it also increased my odds. I went there not expecting to win but to enjoy the scenery. We never talked about what we would do if we won. But I did know that if we did win I‚Äôd sell them. We had to play cornhole for each size. He ended up winning. 
We didn‚Äôt have to wear them so I knew they were getting sold. And I did. I sold them to a middle mad company for a lot after fees I‚Äôll profit 400$. As long as they don‚Äôt find defects or some bs. They also gave out raffle tickets for everyone. They raffled a couple of upcoming releases. Nothing crazy on the horizon. Then they raffled for a pair of Off whites. And they chose my number. I went up they took my info and basically we left because there was no reason to stay. 

(Off white is a brand that‚Äôs collabs with Nike to remake shoes, very low stock, very high resale.) 

The next off white release was o the 12. They were Converse. I told everyone I was getting them and was so excited. They were selling for around 850+ in my size. I was down to sell them day 1. But then they dropped to 750 and after all the fees it would only be 500$ profit. Ik only 500 I understand that is a lot of money. But at that point with all the hype I decided I‚Äôd was going to keep them. And wear them. I don‚Äôt wear converse or vans or anything small. Like them. These had less stock than other Off white shoes from previous drops. But because of this the store isn‚Äôt getting them. The raffle was for the next In store drop. 

The next shoe, is the Nike Prestos. They came out in 2017 and are re releasing in black and white colors in 2018. . For a size 10 there reselling for 1700$ in the old pair which had less stock. 

My question is should I keep them to wear or sell them. Sneakers have never been a big deal for me, this is the first time I‚Äôve ever owned two pairs (not counting these upcoming ones) I bought a pair of shoes that are old and are ‚Äúdad shoes‚Äù I‚Äôve gotten a comment from someone while walking in the hall. And at the event a photographer even took a photo of them. I never had this attention from shoes lol. But I loved it. Because they weren‚Äôt hyped shoes but still got love. 

I‚Äôm done ranting. The shoes will be 150$ and I would say I like them. I was down to keep and wear the converse simply for the rareness of the shoe and  I‚Äôm not going to lie the extra attention. I do work but is only part time. Last week I was happy after cashing in my checks with the balance. Also there is a new shoe coming out same month in June, that I do plan to buy for retail no matter if it can resell or not. If it can I‚Äôll buy more than one. There was one in July aswell but I‚Äôll skip out on it if I wear the off whites. Then another shoe in August for retail that will probably have good resell. That‚Äôs about it when it comes to shoes that I want. There are upcoming off whites but none as hyped as these and The rest are ugly imo. 
My options are. Keep and wear.  Keep and resell same day. Keep and hold. Or keep and sell to buy more programs to increase chances but I don‚Äôt want to do this and I can get scammed. 

I‚Äôm 19 aswell and I am into men‚Äôs fashion however it is Polos, button ups and khaki shorts. I just finished my first year and wanted to treat myself. I lack ‚Äúnice‚Äù shoes lol. I also only wear Nike. And 90% in a t shirt and athletic shorts. There‚Äôs something about wearing shoes that I think look good and also I know no one else will have even if going to a sneaker event of sorts. I‚Äôve always been picky on shoes and always wanted something different since we had uniforms in high school and shoes was the only thing different. 

Maybe I like them because they are expensive, I‚Äôm into sneakers and I don‚Äôt know it. I do know that if the price hits a certain point there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll keep them. Thanks for the long read. Sorry for the length. Opinions are welcome. Even though most would say to sell them. Thanks. ",13May2018,1

15,"Apologies for the wall of txt below. I‚Äôll add a tldr at the bottom.

Evening everyone. So as my title states, I sometimes feel a little lacking in the workplace. I‚Äôm 23 and I‚Äôve been at my job for the past 5 and a bit years. I started from the bottom and have worked up to a supervisor position. I really enjoy my job and feel that I perform well most of the time. But to be honest, I‚Äôm not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed. 

To give some background, I work for our local governments operations department as a crew lead. I really enjoy the job, and the people that I work with as I have been given so many awesome opportunities and work with great people. 

Now I‚Äôm somewhat new to this lead role, and I feel that I am performing well, but sometimes I feel like my superiors get annoyed with me at times. I don‚Äôt make big mistakes hardly ever, but I tend to make a decent amount of small ones. For example, forgetting tools and having to run back and forth to our shop which costs time. Or mis interpreting instruction and doing jobs slightly incorrectly. I tend to get a bit of animosity from my superiors or co workers at times. Nothing crazy, just sighs when they realize what I did or a small snarky comment. I always apologize and try my best to fix the problems, but it makes me feel terrible and I always fret when I‚Äôm home, worrying about the next day. They‚Äôve never stayed angry, or written me up for nothing, but still.

I am 23 years old. Most of my co workers and all my supervisors are atleast double my age and with decades of experience. I also help run a summer crew comprised of 20ish people around my age. They all love me and I have no problems with any of them. Probably since I‚Äôm basically their age and we enjoy each other more. Anyways, I think my supervisors forget that I don‚Äôt know things that they do. I‚Äôm always eager to learn from my mistakes and from them, but every now again, I do something wrong and they get slightly frustrated with me and I hate the feeling of underperforming or inconveniencing them. I also find it hard to earn my co workers respect being so young and being the boss at times. They sometimes give me attitude. I try to straighten them out when they act like that, but a couple just don‚Äôt listen.

I just feel terrible because I always expressed that I wanted to take on a leadership type role and move up the ladder, but I feel as though I underperform at times because of the dumbest things. My supervisors are very busy guys and I really don‚Äôt like to pester them with my questions or issues but I also want to do things right.

When I ask, they always say that I am doing just fine and that I‚Äôm the least of their worries. I do agree with them, but I also feel like I could still be doing better. I‚Äôve tried to mentally sharpen myself a little more and think things through before starting a job, but I still find myself forgetting and overlooking thing. 

Does anyone feel the same way that I do? Any tips or tricks you guys have? Just looking for some reassurances. If you‚Äôd like me elaborate on anything please ask away

TLDR: I‚Äôm dumb at times at work and make small mistakes. Supervisors get annoyed with me sometimes and I‚Äôm looking to sharpen myself a little bit and be a better employee/ supervisor.",13May2018,1

18,"I‚Äôm a 17 year old girl, but I‚Äôm nearly 18, and hopefully all being well I‚Äôll be going to university in September. However, I‚Äôm planning to live at home. 
I do get on very well with my dad but, I‚Äôm just worried, because my dad is very over protective and treats me like a child. Today I mentioned how I‚Äôd probably be going to freshers and he was immediately defensive and started acting hostile and angry at me. Telling me if I‚Äôm going to have a life he will too. Which I have no problem with at all, but I often get a sense he would resent me for having my own life. In the past if we have had an argument  he‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs not had a life because he‚Äôs had to look after me alone, and hasn‚Äôt been able to go out and not have an ‚Äúadult‚Äù life. Which makes me feel guity and I don‚Äôt want Him to be alone. But I know he resents me for it. 
I‚Äôve never had a real boyfriend. I‚Äôve been on dates but I‚Äôve always been to worried I‚Äôll disappoint my dad, or worried how he may react. 
I know a lot of people my age in my classes who go out, where as I spend the majority of my spare time revising (which I have to do but perhaps not as much as I do) . I have been to a handful of house parties in my life, all of which my dad hasn‚Äôt dropped me off and picked me up from and I‚Äôve never been allowed out past midnight - which is understandable and not completely unreasonable I do understand he‚Äôs my dad and he obviously always going to be worried about me. 
I particularly find it hard because my dad is a single parent and has been since my mum left 9 years ago when I was 8, he‚Äôs never had another relationship or gone out much since then, and I have no siblings from my dad, so it‚Äôs always been the two of us. 
 How do I get my dad to treat me like I‚Äôm no longer a child? I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôm still relatively ‚Äúyoung‚Äù but the majority of my friends are leaving home and going to uni in a few months and I‚Äôm not going to get that independence.

21,"I‚Äôm 27 and been with my husband (28) for 10 years (married almost 6), we have a very loving and caring marriage. My husband is my absolute rock and best friend (I know that‚Äôs cliche, buts it‚Äôs true), we share our beautiful son together and all in all our life is great.

My husband is everything I‚Äôve ever possibly wanted in a man, he‚Äôs caring, thoughtful, compassionate, hard worker.....But there‚Äôs one trait I‚Äôve always overlooked (at least when we were teens and our early 20s)......He‚Äôs a coward/pushover. 

When we were young I‚Äôd find it easy to over look this trait and just pass it off as he‚Äôs just a ‚Äúsensitive person‚Äù

PLEASE DON‚ÄôT THINK I‚ÄôM RANTING OR BEING THE BITCH WIFE, I‚ÄôM ONLY TALKING ABOUT THIS ONE ASPECT OF MY HUSBAND.

The first time I really got seriously annoyed with my husband over this, was when we got engaged at 22 and we planned a trip to Mexico to celebrate. Before we got to the airport we went to get some breakfast at this cafe, while in line this woman just walked in and literally cut right ahead of us. Naturally I felt completely annoyed and disrespected, so decided to obviously ask her to get at the back of the line.
This woman just started yelling about how it doesn‚Äôt really hatter that she cut the line and I‚Äôm stood there arguing that‚Äôs it‚Äôs the principle of it. You don‚Äôt just walk in somewhere and cut the line and disregard of people‚Äôs time. 
As this is going on my husband is just stood there with this ‚Äúplease just let her cut in‚Äù

In the end I just let it go, but when we got to the airport we got in a big argument about how he never does anything and always just submits.
Until that Point I‚Äôd always just ignore his pushover ways, but that day I just couldn‚Äôt.

When it comes to his family he‚Äôs a complete pushover, if his brother says something mean to him he‚Äôll just stand there silently and looking at the floor, or if his dad calls him a name he‚Äôll just blank it out. His whole family treats him like a doormat and the annoying thing is he lets them.

My husband runs he‚Äôs own business and he employs workers. I‚Äôve seen with my own eyes one of his own employees insult him and he again just stands there looking like a sad puppy.

I‚Äôve seen him with his close friends were they take turns throwing insults at him and he doesn‚Äôt even retaliate...EVER!

But the worst way in which he‚Äôs cowardly and submissive is when someone argues with me or disrespects me, he never does anything about it. 

The worst story I have is when we were at a bar together and he needed to go to the bathroom, as he was gone a guy walked up to me and started hitting on me heavily. I‚Äôm not sure if any of you ladies have been in a situation like that, but it can be a little terrifying when a guy won‚Äôt take a ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm married‚Äù for an answer. 
When my husband got back and could clearly see this guy hitting on me (the guy wasn‚Äôt huge or anything and I‚Äôm not expecting my husband to fight him) and he just stands there for a couple of seconds (felt like forever) looking at the situation. He finally comes up and says to the guy ‚Äúexcuse me can I help you‚Äù ....(YES he literally said EXCUSE ME CAN I HELP YOUü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)...and the guy (knowing he‚Äôs my husband) says something like do you mind me talking with her, like he was literally asking my husband is it okay if he keeps hitting on me, my husband is there with this stupid look on his face like ‚Äúplease leave us alone‚Äù .....it felt like I could‚Äôve left with the guy and he wouldn‚Äôt even react. 

That was a couple of years ago and the worst thing that‚Äôs ever happened to us. 

So what I‚Äôm asking is, what do I do? 

Do I just do what I‚Äôm currently doing and accept my husbands cowardice?? I fear I might start seriously becoming bitter towards my husband or something if I do.

I‚Äôd love some honest and helpful advice.
Please don‚Äôt insult me or my family. Thanks.

24,"I recently just finished college and received a Law &amp; Criminology Diploma. I want to be a police officer. I was deferred from the application process so that‚Äôs why I went to school. I was transferring to a university to continue the third and fourth year. I was conditionally accepted in February and met all academic requirements. I actually surpassed the 72% average and got 86% average for my entire diploma when I finished in April. Today for no reason I received an email stating how there is not enough interest in the program and it‚Äôs being canceled for September. 

I‚Äôm heartbroken since they must have known earlier and it‚Äôs screwed up so many things. I was so excited to move out of my parent's house. The program was supposed to help my career in so many ways and give me working experience at the same time. I even said for the last month to family and friends of how happy I was. I‚Äôm healthy, my family is here, I have food in my belly and shelter, but I feel so lost right now.

I‚Äôve lost a $5000 transfer scholarship. I can‚Äôt receive this even if I were to switch schools because the original papers don‚Äôt match. 

Although I‚Äôm phoning and hopefully trying to apply at schools in the same city on Monday, most application deadlines have passed in March. To make it worse I‚Äôve actually declined other school‚Äôs offers in the same and different cities because I was accepted to this program. I had to make a choice. I‚Äôve never heard of large university canceling a program like this before. 

I‚Äôm a wildland firefighter and I‚Äôm usually gone between June-August. In order to not worry at the end of the fire season, my roommate and I planned ahead and leased a great house in the city for two years. Plus, I‚Äôm getting calls and I really want to work, but I can‚Äôt leave and work with no place at the end of the season.

It makes things worse since my roommate is new to Canada and I‚Äôve helped him so much. He is in Korea on vacation until August. He isn‚Äôt prepared to live alone or with another roommate since I bought so much stuff like the couch, cooking utensils, plates, etc. I help him with English so much. Regardless of how I feel, he doesn‚Äôt have enough time to get his stuff together and buy the basics. This city is also facing a huge housing crisis and rent is impossible for a single occupant.

30,"Okay, so stepdad and mom have been dating ever since my real dad walked out on me. This was in the 3rd grade. I'm now in the 12th grade, and a month away from graduation. The stress with their relationship isn't helping with that. The issue I have with my stepdad is that he doesn't treat my mom right. Hasn't since I was 8, ten years ago. They haven't gotten married, they take frequent breaks from each other, and he has an issue with alcohol and his OCD. Whenever he drinks a lot, \(and i mean he drinks a lot, he knows a guy who drives beer apparently and gets 48 can boxes for dirt cheap.\) Anyways, my mom is telling me he's changed, she says he isn't controlling anymore, doesn't argue, etc, etc. He got drunk tonight because his friends came over, and so did my mom. It's really showing, he's rushing around the house currently, and flipping out over stuff taking control of everything. My mom wanted to go into our pool tomorrow, to which he quickly replied, ""No, you won't be swimming tomorrow."" She started arguing and so did he. Being a month away from graduation, even less from my final exams, and I have to deal with their faux\-disney romance bullshit. I constantly stress out over this, and I've had panic attack after panic attack ever since we got here two days ago.

I've always tried to tell my mom that he'll never change, he hasn't. She always argues with me and tells me to shut up whenever I bring up any fact whatsoever. He bought her a ring a couple years ago believe it or not, and he told her that it wasn't an engagement ring, what? We've moved here three times, including this time. The first time we left? He put his hands on my mom. The second time? He said he didn't love my mom. Anyone wanna place bets on what the third time will bring?

I feel like she doesn't consider how much she's actually hurting me with this, I've been so depressed that I can't go a day without smoking so much weed to the point where I can't feel a thing. What the hell kind of a life is this?",13May2018,1
31,"Although the obvious answer here would be to ditch her, just keep in mind that would be a last resort for me.

Hey r/advice, I have a bit of a dilemma. I have a friend that I‚Äôve known since the very start of high school. I was shy, terrified, and new, and she was the first person to talk to me. We quickly became best friends and she‚Äôs the entire reason I know everyone I now know, including my boyfriend. 

But we‚Äôre having some problems. She has this habit of honing in on people‚Äôs insecurities (ex. I have a crippling hatred of my skin and she likes to count my pimples in front of our whole friend group). She pleads me to break up with my boyfriend because he isn‚Äôt afraid to call her out on her behavior, and she has tantrums every time any of us makes a joke at her expense (which isn‚Äôt often). She‚Äôs incapable of hearing any form of constructive criticism and she‚Äôs legitimately been killing my view of my self worth lately. She‚Äôs pretty mean to her boyfriend, she won‚Äôt even kiss him on the lips anymore. She says things to my boyfriend to try to make him jealous and believe I‚Äôm cheating on him, although he doesn‚Äôt actually believe her.

So far, we‚Äôve discussed cutting her off entirely because she never listens to any of our pleads for her to stop. I really don‚Äôt want to cut her off because she‚Äôs very important to me and I‚Äôd rather not lose her. What are some ways we might be able to get through to her?

33,"My little sister is 10 and it hit me recently that she is going to start puberty soon. When I was her age no one talked to me about it or gave me any advice and I didn‚Äôt know what a period was until I learned at school... and I didn‚Äôt really understand until I woke up in a pool of blood with no one home. 

I know my parents aren‚Äôt going to have this conversation with her, so I feel obligated to do it at least before she gets it next year at the end of fifth grade. I have no idea what to say or how to say it, so I need advice. First some background and questions:

Background:
-I‚Äôm 20, she‚Äôs 10
-we have a good relationship and talk about a lot of things, but nothing too serious because of the age gap
-she is adopted, so I have no idea how old to expect her to be when she gets her period - I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôll be a bit older than I was because she‚Äôs petite and kind of a late bloomer, physically

Questions:
-is there a good way to talk about periods without talking about sex yet (she‚Äôs so innocent!)
-is there a good time/place
-I plan on explaining the anatomy of it... should I use pictures?
-how do I make this an open, comfortable conversation
-other advice??",13May2018,0
34,"Hi! I realize this isn‚Äôt nearly as bad as some of y‚Äôall are dealing with, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd like help with none-the-less. 

About a year ago there was damage to the walkways at my apartment that resulted in a portion being blocked off. As a result, there was one stair up and down to my apartment.  My neighbors two doors down took advantage of this (and I don‚Äôt blame them!) and created their own private balcony complete with a the exit from their stairs blocked so they could let their dog wander in and out with their front door open. Again, no problem, it‚Äôs was blocked as an exit due to damage anyways. 

Now the landing is completely open and remodeled, and it‚Äôs quite nice! The issue is the neighbors still have the portion blocked off to where no one can use it, and it‚Äôs frustrating. While I can continue to use the stairs near my doo, when I get the mail, do laundry, go to the pool, or office, I‚Äôd like to use those stairs. Right now the apartment near me is empty so I‚Äôm really the only one who would use it. 

Yesterday when I did laundry I pretend to be absorbed in my mail and didn‚Äôt look up until I got to the top of their side of the stairs at which point I acted surprised that it was blocked and made small talk about how nice it was to have it remodeled, while she moved the wooded piece blocking the walkway out of the way. 

The thing is, this is a walkway not a front porch, and my social anxiety is making me stress over this. I understand that they should be able to have a few chairs out there if they‚Äôd like, even though it blocks things, if they are actively being used, but to block it off completely is not only unfair but I‚Äôm fairly sure against Texas fire code. 

I want to approach them about it rather than go straight to the office (which isn‚Äôt the way to go, and I don‚Äôt hunk they would do anything about it on their own without it being brought up) 

I‚Äôm not sure how to handle this or if I‚Äôm being unreasonable here. Perhaps I am, in which case please tell me so I can stop being so anxious  about it! I just feel that it‚Äôs nice to have it fixed and I should be able to use any exit I choose within reason. Any advice would be appreciated!

35,"TLDR ; My parents continually punish me for not going in the direction they want me to go (with good intention) and at this point I can't continue living at home without ""making the wrong choice"".

Here's some background info to be honest so yall can be as objective as possible:

&gt; I am working full time bottling water and making $15/hr with no college degree 2 years out of HS.

&gt; I am late almost everyday but my boss just doesn't care as long as we get the work done. (Never more than an hour late and sometimes I work a few hours late to make up) (over all I would rather be on time)

&gt; I still live with my parents but plan to move out in a maximum period of 2 yrs (I am 20).

&gt; I have the ability to move out whenever I want.

&gt; My desires and passion/direction I want to go in life is to produce music for a living and in my mind, I will do anything to make sure it happens. I get that it may not ever, but as long as I can live and be making music for fun then I am happy in life. I come home almost everyday and work on music. 

&gt; I do stay up late into the AM to work on music and this is what causes me to wake up late. I want to change but it is extremely hard for me being a night owl and seemingly have all the energy in the world by the time 8pm hits.

Recently I had received a letter in the mail for an interview opportunity (a year later) for a plumbing and pipefitting union and as soon as I said I would think about it my parents lashed out at me for not instantly wanting to take the opportunity. Currently, I am now being forced to take the opportunity and also be out of the house by 7am every morning (I don't have to be at work till 9am) or I will be kicked out for good or they will take my phone away and my pc (I paid for the entire pc that I built working a landscaping job during a summer). This kind of punishment has been dealt to me within the past year or so now in order to make me more responsible with my money, etc. 

I currently pay for my gas, most of my food, car insurance, clothes, and my wants. 

Their intentions are good and they just want me to be able to support my self easily in the future and my desire for music which they support the idea of. However, I am content where I am at and don't see it necessary to move up in my overall income as long as I can get out of the house (which I can) and be able to support myself and make music. I don't care if I am living paycheck to paycheck as long as at the end of the day I can do what I wanna do. 

Am I justified for thinking this is absurd and controlling of them? Or am I just being a selfish, disobedient and entitled? At this point there is no reasoning with them. Everything I say to them comes across as ""the wrong idea"".",13May2018,5

Any advice on repairing friendships with roommates? I am living together with two friends (a couple) but after growing frustrations with eachother in a shared home we have decided to ""break up"". they are a couple and will continue to live here while i will be finding a new place.

my main reason of wanting to leave has been feeling like a guest in my own home. Meaning they make plans together, arrange stuff around the house and keep to themselves a lot. All without involving me as a friend or roommate and making me essentialy feeling like a third wheel all the time. I voiced these concerns with them they told me they felt like i took no initiative around the house and should allow them their private time as a couple. it excelated into an intense argument. This was right before we went out to watch the eurovision songcontest at a bar. but soon after arriving my friend told me he needed ""time apart"" and they went home to watch it there, leaving me all alone. 

I am planning on giving them their space for the next few days and hoping on repairing our friendship when i am living on my own again. Is there anything else i should do? am i overreacting?

40,"I feel destined to be alone forever. I don't mean that in some sort of way that implies fate, just that I can't imagine a way out out of the situation I'm in. I get on well with people who are too young for me, and I just don't relate to people my age (at least in my town, which is one of those blue-collar get-married-at-twenty cities).

I'm a bachelor at age 39, and I don't have any close friends anymore, at least not locally. I generally get along well with people, and love being around them, and most people seem to like me. I'm not bragging, but that's just how it seems, and I'm trying not to let my feelings of unhappiness cause me to write misrepresentations.

My mother died when I was just a teenager, and my family sort of fell apart. We didn't turn against each other, but none of us really knew what to do, so I sort of wandered away. I just felt like everything - my house, my neighborhood, my city - were reminders of my mother. I loved her, but being reminded of her had the effect of reminding me she was gone. I had to get away. I don't know what would have happened if I didn't leave. I dropped out of school, and traveled around the country. I had a lot of good experiences, but I was lost and depressed. Luckily, I found some supportive people in a town I settled into for a few years, and they helped me get over the worst parts of that period. Still, I was going to community college, dropping out, going, dropping out, and on and on. I spent years just scraping by, moving from apartment to apartment, dead end job after dead end job.

Eventually, I got my stuff together enough to get an associate's degree, then a bachelor's, then a master's, and some full time employment. I was motivated by my friends, and also by a sense of hope that things could get better. All that's kept me going the past 20 or so years has been a hope that I could find a way for things to be better. Perhaps what's prompting this is a sense that I'm not really sure that just pushing forward will make anything better, and that I need to just sort of settle for being alone.

Over the course of my 20s and 30s, I had people I was close to and who I could hang out with. They were always younger than me, and the age gap grew as I got older. The older ones were doing things like getting married or starting real careers, while I was busy being broke, trying to dig myself out of the financial disaster that my previous years had brought. I'm still many thousands of dollars below zero.

I moved back to my hometown, hoping to sort of re-establish some kind of community, to feel at home somewhere. That's not happened. I am still alone. I know many people, and whenever I go out, I run into people I know, maybe chat with them, have a coffee or tea or something, but there's no real closeness. It's like we're just in different worlds. I'm single, trying to figure out my live (I'm a student again, trying to figure out some sort of skills to get a job), while they're dealing with things like being married, raising kids, paying mortgages, fixing up the houses that they own, and things like that. I just can't relate. They think I can, because I talk to them about their houses, their kids, their lawns, and all that stuff, to be polite, but I can't relate at all. I wish that I'd gone on some sort of path when I was younger that would have led me to some sort of relationship and stability now. I've had many, many girlfriends over the years, but only recently have I kind of realized why the relationships all went badly. I was immature. I didn't cheat or anything like that, but I just wasn't very responsible.

Now I'm middle aged and alone, wishing I could go back and change things. I fill up my time with any sort of social activities I can, but most of the time, peole are with their families. I'm in a small town, so there really aren't that many social options. There are some colleges, and I get along well with younger people, but I don't want to be the creepy old guy. I've volunteered lots of times at organizations working with teens. I keep in touch with them, and they all like me, and I'm always happy around them, because they have a sort of...I'm not sure how to say it, a sense of life about them, a sense of hope. Also, I'm generally happy because I can feel like I help them out by relating to them, and giving them advice based on the bad choices I've made. I think I've actually positively affected a lot of kids, which is one bright spot. But you can't go around hanging out with teenagers; people assume immaturity at best, or some sort of sex/perversion at worst. Probably they'd be right about the immaturity, but not the latter (just to be clear).

I did end up in a sort of ""relationship"" with someone who was, to be honest, appallingly young. She was a bit dishonest, and let me think she was 26 (she never actually told me that she was, but she didn't correct me until much later). She turned out to be 21. We bonded over our own terrible pasts (hers was worse than mine: she was raised in a religious cult, abused). Looking back on it, the dynamics were that of a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, though we never said that and there was nothing even remotely sexual. She left, saying she feared getting to close to anyone, and I was really sad about that for a month or so, but then moved on. I reconnected with another friend of mine, just about my age, who, like me, is sort of an independent thinker; a dreamer, I guess, is the best to describe it. We spent a couple months talking each night, supporting each other, exploring different types of art, movies, laughing all the time, etc. For complex reasons, she had to move away. Things were going well, but, for long drawn out reasons, things became complex and she had to move far, far away. I was really sad. These two relationshps were about a year apart, but the common thing is that during each of them, I was extremely happy, because each one fixed two types of being alone: that of not having a partner, and that of not having a really close friend.

Everyone thinks I'm great, it seems. The ""community"" people like my contributions, my friends from years ago and the new ones enjoy talking to me, teens love me. I don't think they're wrong; I think I'm a decent person and that I do contribute, so it's not a self esteem issue that's troubling me. And I do appreciate people when they're around. I don't resent people most of the time for their happiness, though I sometimes feel bitter.

To be succinct, I had a great childhood and high school experience. But my mother died when I was young, and I drifted through years, lost touch with many people and wasted time, so that now I'm at a life stage a 21-year-old would normally be at, even though I'm middle aged. The people I can relate to are all very young, and that's weird, and my fellow Gen-Xers (at least in my little city of maybe 150,000) are busy doing their day-to-day family stuff. I spend my nights and time when other people are working (I'm trying to find a job that's not just freelancing here and there) alone. My sister lives across the country, my father passed away years ago, and the family members who are local really became more like acquaintences after my mom passed.

So I'm alone and I have no idea what to do. Sorry for the rambling.

 Yesterday, I received no texts from them and also they hadn‚Äôt seen any of the snapchats I sent to them (which is slightly unusual because they always check their phone and are on reddit and Snapchat and maybe texting). 

Now, the reason it really concerns me is because I‚Äôm the past, I haven‚Äôt been the best partner.

47,"Background: 
Currently a 36yr old general manager of a niche contracting company in the NY Metro area and at the top of my possible advancement (unless I start my own company). Married with a 9mo old child and own a home on Long Island (where everything is expensive).

My wife and I have been talking about relocating to Palm Beach County FL in the next 2 years. Mostly the reason for that is cost of living and climate change. She is in health care so finding a job after relocation is not a huge issue however my niche market does not exist in that market. I am a volunteer firefighter &amp; EMT and have always been interested in nursing so I was contemplating returning to school for that degree.

Recent Opportunity (Monkey Wrench):
I was contacted on Wednesday by a headhunter looking to hire for a technical position within one of the largest manufacturers and suppliers of products used in my niche market. They are an international trade company offering an amazing package including a 6-figure salary with bonuses, 401k with match, full health benefits and a company vehicle. The interview went extremely well and I think I have an 80-90% chance of being offered the position.

The position would be a technical field rep serving continental US and would travel 70% of the time (average of 3 weeks per month and of those 3 weeks home for 2-3 of those days (approx 15 days per month)). I've asked follow-up questions about notice and for the ""off days"" if I'd still be required to be available and am awaiting answers on that.

The Dilemma:
If I was single or married without children this would be a no brainer. My wife is on board with the traveling thing however she's already trying to figure out how we will juggle child care if I am away. In speaking with a few of my close friends the feedback is split. Most know if I'm offered this position I would be happy with the work and excel. Others ask me how I could spend so much time away from my child. Both are legitimate thoughts for me as well.

Even going back to school and relocating would cause strains for 3-5 years. The only difference would be I would have a ""skill"" now and many different avenues for advancement. The other attractive item with nursing is 3 12-hour shifts per week allowing more time at home.

Opinions:
I would really love to hear from people who have families and are nurses or travel for their job. What are the pros and cons of what you do? Maybe even someone who's parents are employed in either that can provide prospective on their family life.



Thanks for reading all that, your opinions are appreciated. ",13May2018,2
48,"I have had the pleasure of getting to know someone over the past 2 weeks who is in my program at university. Her and I never really talked before, however I always admired her from afar and kept my distance otherwise.

It wasn't until about a week before our final exam when I asked her if she wanted to study together. She said yes, we met up, and of course we ended up talking about everything other than what we were supposed to be studying for. I have a special bond with her because her and I have a similar disease, her's is still in the early stages so she has asked me for plenty of advice on how to deal with it. She seems very thankful to have me around to talk about things relating to our illness. 

We decided that after our final exam we should get pizza with a few other friends. I left her to ask around and see who wanted to come, however it ended up just being me and her because everyone else was ""unavailable."" I think she might have done it on purpose. I'm so glad she did though because we had an amazing time and I really enjoy talking to her. 

We have met a couple more times together to study for other exams and she is just so smart. Easily the top of our class. It's really funny because she thinks I am just as smart, if not smarter. I found it very flattering because she knows she's intelligent and overall so humble. We made more plans to get together for dinner and watch a movie in my dorm. Over the course of the week we texted all the time and she even sent me good morning texts. When we got together, again, we had a great time. We had a few drinks in my dorm, and ended up ignoring the movie and talking the entire time. 

In the end, I told her I liked her a lot and promised it wasn't the alcohol talking. She laughed and told me she really liked me too. We held hands and cuddled and I was just so happy to be in her presence. She's a great breath of fresh air. I was physically and emotionally abused in my last relationship and it was just so refreshing to be treated nicely like that. After it all though, she told me she was upset because ""I was making her like me so much and there's only 4 days of the semester left."" I promised that we would talk a lot and things would be the same when we got back.

When I walked her back to her apartment, she kissed me. I literally ran back to my dorm because I was so excited. When I looked back at my phone, she sent me a goodnight text, and that was it. :\) We have planned to see each other a few more times before I leave.

49," I‚Äôm from Georgia and I thought a cruise was going to to absolutely suck. Then I met the girl in the title, she‚Äôs from Australia and has all the same interests. We both fell in love with each other and cried the entire way home... and when we got home. But now we don‚Äôt talk but once or twice a day.
 
 Yeah I know that 9280 miles sounds insane for a long distance relationship but we thought this was instantaneous long-term love, but I guess not. We Skyped once or twice after texting for a few days, she told me she loved me and would fly me out to see her multiple times. I don‚Äôt if that‚Äôs relevant but I thought it would might help. 

 Now 2 weeks after the cruise and the talking we barely talk and I‚Äôve been drifting towards my ex. My ex said she still had feelings, and I did too but I don‚Äôt wanna be with her, I want to be with the Australian girl.

51,"Hey yall, so I‚Äôm hurting a lot right now. My girlfriend of 6 years, the woman who intended on marrying, left 3 nights ago out of nowhere‚Äôs and I gotta say I‚Äôm a bit confused as to how I should feel.

 We sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with our other friend. She had often complained about her life and how she was stressed from working and I couldn‚Äôt really be there for her because I had just started a new school a ways a way and had also been working so I‚Äôve been just generally tired and it was hard for me to pay attention to her. This is all happened in just the last month or so.

Anyway she just picked up and left Thursday night. I came upstairs to go to bed and she had all her things packed, she was crying and she just left. She said she‚Äôs not happy anymore that she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way about me she used to feel and left out of nowhere to sleep at her friends house.

The next day she came over to take some things and basically told me that she was just not happy, that she didn‚Äôt feel a spark and she wants to focus on her cause all she knows is me. 

Anyway I‚Äôve been pretty upset because I don‚Äôt feel the same way, but she came over last night to drop some stuff I had in her car off and she said ‚Äúthis is just for now, we gotta take a break and just work on ourselves. Just be my friend for now and we‚Äôll get back together in a while. Just take it slow‚Äù

Then this morning she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me at all and wants to forget about me. She won‚Äôt come visit me anymore, so I left some flowers on her car which she thanked me for and now we‚Äôre talking a little and she‚Äôs gonna visit me soon.

Should I be doing this? Is this just a bump in the road? I really feel that we could fix things and get back together but am I being to clingy? 

Should I just move on? ",13May2018,3
52,"Hi Reddit,
I'm 16 years old and was offered a job making minimum wage. I accepted it and my orientation will be in a few days. Once I got home however, I checked my email and I got an interview with another company that offers more money than the other job. Since I already accepted the minimum wage job and have met with some of the staff, I'm unsure of what my next step should be. If I get the job that makes more money then I'd definitely accept it, but I'm unsure of what to say to my managers at the job I just got into. Any thoughts? ",13May2018,2
53,"I am in the process of deleting every image of myself I can find from the Internet. The only service that has remaining photos of me is Google+. There are three public Google+accounts I created in middle school five or more years ago. Each account has a different photo of me as its profile photo. 

I do not remember what the emails associated with any of these accounts are. No recovery phone number is attached to any of them, and the recovery emails I provided for all of these accounts have been deleted permanently due to inactivity. If I knew the usernames/emails for any of these accounts, I'd be able to guess the passwords, but I can't find that information anywhere. I would also obviously be able to answer any security questions set for these accounts. 

Is it impossible for me to have these photos removed? I have sent multiple requests for help to Google, all of which have gone unanswered. The Google+ help forum is pretty much empty...Probably because no one uses Google+ anymore. 

I'm so frustrated with this. If anyone can provide any insight I would be so grateful. Thank you so much.

 Yesterday, I received no texts from them and also they hadn‚Äôt seen any of the snapchats I sent to them (which is slightly unusual because they always check their phone and are on reddit and Snapchat and maybe texting). 

Now, the reason it really concerns me is because I‚Äôm the past, I haven‚Äôt been the best partner. This is my first kind of real serious relationships, I was new to learning how to properly care and such for your partner and I have been immature, emotional, self-depricating, I haven‚Äôt been the strongest person.

I‚Äôve told them I will change when the other issues were brought up before this, but as you all know, change takes time and there hasn‚Äôt been a clear path for that yet, so I‚Äôve improved a tiny bit, but really need to deep clean some of the bad habits I have developed. I‚Äôm planning to see a doctor because I feel something is wrong with my mental health, but I feel like I can‚Äôt explain that to them. I am ready to change and it is going to happen but by bit, but I am worried about the implications with this lack of communication?

I looked at my texts and saw maybe I texted too much useless things to them, so I told them I would not text them to give them space to relax on their vacation and that I was worry about the way I have been acting recently because of something I took so personally (it was trivial), but I would respond if they texted me, but they haven‚Äôt. 


Was it a bad idea to stop my side of communication to try and give them space?  It has only been one day since they communicated, am I overthinking this?

Due to this circumstance, the financial responsibility has shifted to me.. but I'm not sure if I **REALLY** want to do this.

My mother's husband was recently convicted of a crime and sent to prison for 15 years and she's trying to take over the business he left behind but it's not working.

I retired from the military in 2013 due to a combat related injury and am currently living off disability/compensation. I don't receive much but it's enough to put a roof over our head. All of my other siblings are active military and they've chosen to ignore the pleas for help from my mother and aunt. Am I making a mistake by allowing this to happen? I'm not a pushover but I hate to see my mother suffer, she endured a lot in her childhood and sacrificed so much to raise me and my brother. Now that I'm able to return the favor, I feel I should.

I did everything right, studying days, even weeks before a test, getting shit done on time or days before so I can either take a break or study more. I want to discount the fact that I went through a terrible and extremely complicated relationship all throughout my college career. Since I'm not getting anything out of this and am feeling constantly angry, I feel like I have to change things even though I hate the idea of it.

What I'm thinking is this: after graduation, I move my ass to NYC and try to become a bike messenger, since biking is my favorite thing, and I can hold my own when going the distance.  I earn money, try to create some kind of fund while simultaneously trying to pay back my student loans, which are fairly low. During that time, I'll try to tackle programming and delve into computer eng and infosec via online classes while spending as little as possible. At some point, I want to go back to school and get my degree and go for my masters.

That, or I can finish my degree and do the post bac program here for math and try to boost my grades as best I can, and try to go for my masters. All I want to do is work in industry really, working on problems that will one day benefit the world. I don't care if my name is on it or not.

Anyways, when his dad is at work, Clifford has to watch the dogs. The dog that this story is about is an older guy, and only about 15 pounds.

Today while hanging out, one of the dogs went potty in the den (hardwood floors; easy to pick up). Clifford proceeded to pick up the dog, rub it's face in the potty, scream in his ears and face, and then drop kicked him. After that he picked him back up and threw him outside.

I love dogs and now know this must be how he treats him all the time. He was bragging about it and thought it was funny. Yes convinced the dog did it on purpose to spite him and is a lot smarter than people thing.

61,"I had to cute ties with my older brother today. Everyone else in my family has already done it and I had faith in him but he only ever bothered 5 minutes of poorly structured texts for me if I messaged him a few times first. He was horrible at returning calls and always had a BS excuse. 

He was never as present in my life as the rest of that side of the family (granted there was sort of a ‚Äúsplit‚Äù because of another event much earlier on in my life, but everyone was on good terms and communicated quite well.) But my other brother kept very good contact with me and always made sure I was okay, we also never physically spent much time together throughout my life (same reason,) but at least he reached out and we shared as much of our lives with each other as we could. 

I cut ties with him because he seemed not only absent for many events but also seemed to really not care that he was absent because he was caught up so much with his own life. He doesn‚Äôt know my favorite color, how I‚Äôm doing in school, he hardly remembers my birthday without Facebook reminding him, and he can‚Äôt even spell my name right after all these years. Many other family members have already cut ties because (as I‚Äôve heard from them,) he‚Äôs been known to drink, do drugs, mooch, commit crime, and steal things from us. 

I don‚Äôt know their entire story but up until now I‚Äôve felt it wasn‚Äôt enough to give up faith on him.

62,"I just got back from a pretty emotionally-charged event. It was the last show for the seniors of my high school's drama club, so everybody around me was crying and stuff. 

I graduated last year, so I went just to support some of my friends who are seniors or juniors. I've never been good at the whole emotions thing, so every year since my sophomore year of high school during the last drama club show, I'd always feel a little bad for not bawling my eyes out like all my friends were. I didn't cry my senior year either.

But today, even as I saw all my friends crying and hugging me again, I still couldn't feel the urge to cry. When I got home and thought about it, I just felt frustrated with myself. It's not like I wasn't sad or didn't get why everybody was crying. I definitely understand. I just don't understand why I can't feel what they're feeling as strongly as they do. No matter how much I think about it, I can't get why. It's like there's some kind of lid on my emotions. And not having the answer makes me feel like some empty husk of a human being.

72,"So every few years (about every 2.5), me, my parents, and my dad‚Äôs side of the family go on some type of week long vacation, which is paid for by my generous grandmother. For the past couple times she‚Äôs rented a nice beach house for us on a beach in NC, which we‚Äôre doing again this year. The house looks awesome, and this time there will be a total of 15 of us, all of which are couples except for my grandma. I‚Äôve been pretty excited about it (as I usually am), but I feel like I‚Äôm just going to be in a bad mood.

My parents refuse to let me and my girlfriend share a room. This seems like something silly to be upset about, but we are both over 18, and she‚Äôll be 19 by the time of the trip. She‚Äôs already asked her parents and they said that they are fine with it if we have to share a room. Not my parents though. They seem to think that if we share a room together we‚Äôd most definitely have sex, which of course isn‚Äôt gonna happen as we‚Äôre not about to fuck in a house with 14 other relatives. We just think it‚Äôs stupid that every other couple will get to sleep in the same bed at the end of the day, and even though we are only a couple years younger than some of the other couples, we cannot. They expect us to take on adult responsibilities but still treat us like we are children. I‚Äôve gotten a job like they wanted me to, I pay for my own stuff, and I‚Äôm attending college in the fall. What else do I have to do to be an adult in their eyes?
I understand that I still live under their roof so I have to follow their rules and all, but we‚Äôll be going on vacation and there aren‚Äôt even enough beds for us to have separate rooms. They actually said that they wanted me to share a bed with my dad and have my girlfriend share a bed with my mom, or have one of us sleep on a couch. My grandmother, who is paying for the entire trip, doesn‚Äôt care at all, but my parents said that it‚Äôs not up to her.
I also can‚Äôt seem to understand why my parents care so much if we do end up having sex anyways. We‚Äôve been together for two years and we‚Äôre not breaking up anytime soon, and they seem to like her a lot. Do they really not trust us enough to use protection? We both are tired of not being able to have a sexual relationship along with a romantic relationship after being together for two years. 
But even then, we don‚Äôt want to share a room just so we can have sex, we just want to sleep together. I‚Äôm not sure what I can say to change their minds. I‚Äôm looking to hear from someone who‚Äôs had a similar situation with their parents.
I guess I‚Äôm still looking forward to the trip and all, but I‚Äôll just be upset and annoyed the entire time.

My baby is enjoying her playtime, laughing with me when all of a sudden MIL bursts out with ""Take that toy away from her it's getting on my nerves and we can't even hear the conversation"". MIL wasn't even part of the convo and was just sitting there on her phone. Wife catches an attitude and exchanges words basically telling her that no one was even talking to her so why is it even bothering her in the first place. She says it's loud and people can't hear. Which was ridiculous to me because of the fact that there was noise everywhere. Kids were running around playing, a soccer game playing on TV, people talking, point is there was noise everywhere but she decides to pick on my kid. Wife takes the toy for my baby and it made me really upset so I responded with ""No you're just salty"" and that's where it all went downhill. We start exchanging words and mostly from her end I hear ""You need to respect me"" and all I would reply was ""Whatever"" but her ego just needed to have the last word and me being upset I just kept going and that's when the SIL jumps in, telling me to shut up because I'm disrespecting her mom. I keep going, still with ""Whatevers"". So grandpa comes in and tells me I need to shut up. I ignore him and basically the whole family starts ganging up on me not realizing that I wasn't the only one in the wrong, only focusing on defending MIL. I stood my ground and told them all how I didn't think I was being wrong for defending my baby. MIL starts trying to attack me personally saying ""You don't even respect your own wife"" and threatening to kick me out of her house and MIL sister threatening to ""Physically take me out"".

I see him once a week, and at least 1\-2 times a month over the years we have to reschedule because he's 'sick' or his 'dog ran out of the house' or he's getting 'repairs on his car'. It's been consistent and a constant. I think the longest he went without an excuse was 2 months. I get it, shit happens, but it's always an inconvenience for me especially since he usually \(if not always\) cancels about 2 hours before the appointment and I have to re\-schedule for a later time in the week or completely miss a session. I know other people who see him too and he pulls the same cards with them. One time he told my friend that he was in an accident and his excuse for me for the same day was that he was sick. This month alone he's cancelled on me twice and has to reschedule two other times. I think you get the picture.

Also, there have been a few times where I notice that his eyes kind of do this 'nodding' thing, and as an ex\-opiate user it looks like he's either on a low dose of opiates or benzos.

Point being\- all this shit is active addict\-like behavior: not showing up, lying, and possibly looking high \(albeit, I might be paranoid with this one\).

I want to confront him about it. Should I? I already feel paranoid posting on reddit. He could lose his license for shit like this! This is just crushing to me as I feel betrayed by another person. The overall feeling though is that I'm more so worried about him as I understand the disease. Even though he's my therapist, I look at him as a friend and someone I care about. I don't know what to do.",13May2018,3
82,"Hey Reddit,

So presently I'm a High School Senior who happens to be in the process of polishing off a long four years in secondary school. I've still got AP tests to take, after that I've got a bunch of nonsense capstone work to take care of, but I can smile knowing that it's all worth it. I'm going to a very distinguished Uni in September where I'll be out of the constraining doldrums of the town I've lived in for the past 18 years.

The only issue is that between now and then, there are four months of hang time where I expect to be very bored. Whereas I held my breath bated for Summer break for the past decade or so, I'm dreading it at this point for a couple of reasons. For one, I'm not going to be able to ""go back two million years in evolution"" playing video games, as an undergrad that attends the Uni I'm going to described it, because my parents expect me to do something adult with my summer \(I am an adult, now, after all\). Even then, I anticipate that I'd get pretty bored of playing video games all day, and so I'm not all against it. For the past four months my mother has been imploring me to get a job, and while I've been receptive to the idea and as eager as her to find work that will build up my resume, I've basically blown all the chances to find that type of work. Just two days ago I got an email saying that a summer theater that I really wanted to work for couldn't find me a job, and I'm sort of in a ""too little too late"" position at this point. It looks like if I want to land a job at this point, it'll be doing entry level paid\-alienation. However, I do have the options of taking some summer classes at a different university as a failsafe, but I'm not looking forward to that either because I really want to take a break from school and I'm not even sure about how productive taking classes could be when I'm already pushing max transfer credits for my University. Furthermore, my mom expressed concern that a couple of Uni classes a week aren't going to cut it for ""keeping me occupied"".

So, my question comes a little bit from the despair and disappointment from getting denied from a job, which I'm doing my best to put into perspective, but mostly from my sheer inability to come up with a use of my time at this point. Starting from Summer, I've got 13 weeks before I'm going to do anything interesting with myself and I'm very scared that I'm not going to find a satisfying way to spend that time. Worst case scenario is that nothing happens, I get in the bad faith of my parents for failing to find work, and overall watch helplessly as 13 weeks of my youth go down the drain. Minimum wage isn't an option that I'm looking forward to either \(you've just completed high school. Here's more work!\), but I'm willing to learn the perspective that doing jobs that you don't like are a part of adult life if it's necessary.

My goal, though, is to find a win\-win: a way to spend my time that I'm both excited about and that my mom gives the thumbs up on. Telling my mom that I'm an adult and can play video games all I want is a complete non\-starter, though. It will score me a strongly worded scolding at best or a collection of broken hardware that was valued at 1k dollars at one point. What do you think, Reddit? Volunteerwork? Long walks on the beach? Hanging out with friends?

If you'd need context on the exact expectations of my mother and my expectations, I'll say that my mother mostly wants me to be productive in a structured environment and to not degenerate into NEET\-tier levels of inactivity beyond playing video games, and I mostly just want to enjoy myself and relax, taking a bit of a break from all the stuff I've been doing for the past 4 years and taking a victory lap around my childhood. I enjoy video games, some tabletop, fantasy in general and being creative at times. 

TL;DR\- Mom wants me to not be a sloth over the summer and I don't know what to do with myself.",13May2018,1
83,"I would like some advice. It‚Äôs been a few years since I graduated college. That was the height of my social life. After that, it slowly started dwindling down until I got here alone and lonely. 

Part of it was my doing. After college, I deleted all my social media accounts. I highly value my privacy and didn‚Äôt particularly agree with how my data was being distributed (I‚Äôm one of those who reads terms of agreements). I also wasn‚Äôt making a lot of money. I struggled a lot to pay my bills so I always passed on social events instead I used the money to pay my bills and  contribute whatever was left to a high yield savings in addition to my 401k (particularly due to high debt from student loans). 

At first I enjoyed the solitude but for the past few days I‚Äôve been feeling very lonely. Particularly because my ex and I started talking again. At first it was great and I loved it but I found myself quickly getting attached to her. I would check my phone a billion times a day to see if she texted me. I would get frantic and worried when she didn‚Äôt respond. This made her feel like we were dating again and she said she wanted to be friends and nothing more. I wanted more so we decided to end things. That heartbreak feeling resurged and it really hit me that I have no friends there to support me. 


When you have no one around, you can‚Äôt escape the mind. No matter what it is I‚Äôm doing I can‚Äôt seem to distract myself long enough to stop thinking about her and that spirals into loop where I get more depressed about not having friends. I tried really hard not to but I just reached out to my ex and ask her if we can talk. She hasn‚Äôt replied yet but she‚Äôs not the solution. The solution is to have friends and I don‚Äôt know how to do that anymore. I don‚Äôt have any social media accounts. If you were in my shoes what would you do? 

I don‚Äôt really have hobbies because I don‚Äôt like going anywhere alone. It feels so awkward to be alone at events and it‚Äôs become so intimidating to where I might have social anxiety. Some thing I never had in college. I was at every party and either throwing one myself or convincing others to throw one. Now I just lounge and listen to lounge music. That‚Äôs about it and that felt right until these past few days and it‚Äôs been bothering me. How do I make friends?

86,"Hi, I'm 19 and male, part time student and part time cook. Essentially, what I'm going to ask is should I move in 3 months or stay in a complete but brief social situation for a year. I'm currently on a pseudo gap year to work on my self and practice life skills before going full tilt into college. I'll cut to the chase though, I initiated contact with a cute girl in a class. I was a little surprised at how friendly she was, even though in this class everyone seemed friendly, but my experience has been that cute girls are usually a bit cold. We chat occasionally during class, but lately I've been getting the sense that she likes me, like more than a friend. I find her super cute and interesting. I really enjoy talking with her and has all the desirable physical traits, which is a bit rare. I feel like I'm super lucky that she likes me (even though I'm aware of thing I do or have that might be attractive). Basically, I'm interested in starting a romantic relationship. 

So here is the problem, in 3 months I am set to move out of state to go to college full time. But, I don't want to move anymore, because I have been able to make good new friends at my community college and with the addition of a loving girlfriend (which I haven't had before) that's about as complete a social situation that I can think of. However, if I stay and she stops liking me or vice versa, then I'm going to wish I had moved. But, if it works out, in a year she and my friends will graduate and transfer to a new school, so my situation is not very sustainable anyway. I could follow her to the new school, but the opportunities to indulge my educational interests and potential career mobility would be limited. That might be worth it though.

98,"It was a while ago but the issue still has not been resolved to this day. We had a family member staying over in a rented studio near us.

The interesting part is that when the bf had found out that something was up. He immediately texted the guy ""what did you tell them"". That to me is already admitting that something between them had happened that shouldnt have happened wether it was consentual or not. 

 Years later they now have a child who i absolutely love as if he was my own. My sister now lives with my mom with her child and she still sees him to this day. The bf has been shunned by the whole family and never goes to family gatherings or even visits the house. She always goes out to visit him. My mother the other day was crying to me saying that hes not even a good father because he doesnt provide financially or emotionally for the child.  My mom hopes my sister doesnt think this is how a father should be bc of what she went through (our father was absent most of our lives). This whole thing has really messed me up as a brother.

99,"So.  The title is basically the gist, i'll write a long story here.

So I work in a grocery store, and there's this one co\-worker who hasn't left me alone since I started there \(3 months ago\)

about 3 weeks after I got a job there, he had asked me if I had a boyfriend \(I was not 18 at the time, I was 17 and about to be 18\). I didn't lie, I told him the truth,  that I did not.  He replied and said ""Oh \(another co\-worker\) told me that you did have a boyfriend."", To which I responded ""Nah. I don't know where she got that from, but I don't.""

I thought that was the end of it.  However, after that happened, every time we worked together after that he started hugging me everytime he saw me.  \(I'm fine with hugs, I don't care. However, he doesn't hug anyone else that we work with.  And these are just really incredibly awkward hugs\).

A few days later, I was talking to another co\-worker of mine that is good friends with the co\-worker he claimed to have told him I had a boyfriend.  I told her the story and she said ""Oh.  Yeah.  He talks about you a lot and you know, he's 22\-23, and i told him how old you were \(17 at the time\) and he just told me, 'Yeah but she's gonna be 18 soon'""

For starters, he was already making me uncomfortable and when I found out that he had said that I was even more uncomfortable.  However, I am not one to file complaints, or firmly speak to someone telling them that they are making me uncomfortable.  

Fast forward to about 2 weeks ago, he asked me for my number.  To which I didn't know how to respond to, because 1\(I don't want him to have my number.  2\( I'm shit at saying no to people. 3\(I wanted so bad to just leave but he was nagging me.  So I gave him my number, and i regret it so much.  \(To this day, I have yet to receive a text message or phone call from him. THANKFULLY.  I have a feeling I accidentally typed the wrong number bc I had to double check it like 3 times\)

This guy is constant and still giving me hugs.  Tonight when he gave me a hug I pushed him off.   \(My main reason for this was because I was dealing with customers \(i'm a cashier\) and I was doing 100 things at once and even if i wanted a hug from him, then was not the time.\) 

He just genuinely isn't my type, and i just feel like he's such a shitty person to everyone he's around, but he really just bothers me so much and makes me uncomfortable.  I'm also involved with someone else, currently \(a potential boyfriend. so i can't really say i have a boyfriend until we make it official i guess\) 

I really just wanna know how to get him to back off.  I want nothing but a professional relationship with this guy and I'm honestly disgusted he said ""But she's gonna be 18 soon"" about me.  I haven't let that go. 

I wanna know how to get him to back off in a professional way.  Firm, however, not rude.  But i just want him to take a fucking hint, really. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",13May2018,3

At this point in time we have 9 people in the house since they moved in. Mom,dad,brother,sister and her 2 children and her husband,and myself. For three years I've shared a room with my sisters kids. I'm 25 and I'm sure you can guess that I hate it. The only relief I have is during school semesters,when I live closer to my school. 

Recently my mom told my sister she and her husband need to vacate the second bedroom and let me have it.

But when I get home I feel more stressed than any final could ever make e feel because I share a room with two kids who didn't come out of my own womb.

(This was my first year in cross country.)

Pros: XC is what broke me out of my shell and allowed me to make a lot of new friends.

Despite being a bad runner, meets were actually fun

Spaghetti dinners 

Just the feeling of being part of a team 

It's a pretty non-competitive sport (at the JV level at least)

Doing something outside my comfort zone and benefiting from it

I love being in shape


Cons: I hate going to practice. It's early in the morning, they're always long, and it feels like I'm always at practice

It's very time-consuming, and next year I'll need all the time I can get

Summer practice starts in June this year

I'm not a good runner and I don't take XC as seriously as a lot of people on the team (it's not super high on my list of priorities)

I think the head coach expects almost too much of a lot of us. Not everyone on the team is able to run at varsity level, and it shouldn't be  such a huge deal that not everyone is super competitive

..................................................................................

So basically I've learned that I really like my friends and being in shape, and the meets are kind of fun, but practices are long and give me anxiety, and it takes a lot of time. I think my problem is I don't want to leave the friends I've made, or lose that feeling of being a part of team, which is something I've never had, but I also don't want to go to practice or see the coach. I'm really conflicted, so any input is appreciated!

P.S: I may be influenced by one of my friends who is dropping XC and told me to consider it, but then again I've only done it for 1 year, she's been in it since middle school. But I still don't know!

117,"So my girlfriend of 6 years and I broke up on Wednesday and that has completely changed my life. Three years ago I moved from the US to Canada to be with her. She was my world for those three years as well. Things happened and we grew apart and now I‚Äôm stuck on what I should do. 

1. Stay in Canada: So I have this option in my mind about staying here and enjoying the life that I have created. My whole personality has changed since I moved here and I‚Äôve grown so much. The problem with staying is my work visa is up in Nov, it‚Äôs a small town so I would run into her, and I don‚Äôt have many friends here. When I first moved here we were obsessed with each other. So I didn‚Äôt really make friends because all I wanted to do was be with her. I did end up making friends but they have moved all moved on so I would be left alone and making friends is difficult for me.

2. Move home: I haven‚Äôt been home in over a year and I really miss my family and my friends, but the more I think of living in a big city again the more I don‚Äôt want to. Where I live I Canada there is so many more opportunities for things I enjoy such as fishing, camping, and hiking. Back home it‚Äôs all big city things and not much of that is around. I feel disconnected from my friends as well, it‚Äôs been three years and my best friend has a girlfriend that I don‚Äôt really like so that will make things tough as well.

3. Move somewhere completely new: I‚Äôve thought about moving to a place like Washington, Colorado, and New Mexico because they have the lifestyles that I have become accustom to up here. The downsides are still being in a place where I have no family or friends but there is no ex girlfriend around town so I‚Äôll get a complete restart on life.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm procrastinating doing anything at this point just thought I could get someone outside opinions

120,"Ok hear me out guys and I really need ALL the advice I can get. I‚Äôm 16 and currently going to get homeschool next year because I have no other options for high schools. All my dream high schools and high schools I would like to be a part of can‚Äôt accept me because I don‚Äôt live in that school district , and the ones I do qualify for are literal trash.

My question is, is it possible to pose as a student in a high school your not enrolled? Like my plan was arriving to school 1 hour earlier or 30 minutes earlier, and then hiding in the bathrooms. During passing period, change bathrooms and socialize during lunch and meet new people, and get out during outdoor activities or something. 

I literally mean no harm at all. All I want is to make friends, (currently have a few but are fake friends, plus they ignore me sometimes) 

I feel like I‚Äôll get along with people good. I mean I‚Äôm not ugly, have an alright figure, and I would say I‚Äôm really social to new people. 

All I want is a normal methodical high school experience, like is that too much too ask for.

124,"First things first, this all comes from what my friend told me, so I don't know if this is all true or not. She also told me to not speak a word about this to anyone, but goddammit I just can't not do that anymore. Around two and a half years ago, we had our Grade 9 prom. It was a decent affair, though I was really sick at the time and had to go home a bit early. As the prom was held in some fancy hotel, some of the students stayed there for the night. One of my friends, let's call her F, stayed with her family in a room. For some reason, her mother allowed another unrelated boy, K, to sleep in the same bed as F. Keep in mind that F was not in a relationship with K, nor was she even interested. During the night, K apparently made sexual advances on her, even going so far as to start touching her inappropriately. F got up and told her mother, who only told K to sleep on the couch for the night instead of the bed.

Now, I didn't know this happened at the time as F only told me this after nearly a year. When she did tell me, it wasn't because of something K did with her, but rather what K did with her mother. After the prom, he had been apparently sending dick pics to F's mother. F only saw them when her mother accidentally left her Facebook open when K sent the picture. I'm pretty sure that this also constitutes as child pornography as he was 16 when he sent them. When F confronted her mother, she claimed that it was because of medical purposes, as she was a nurse. This continued on till today.

Now, there's a lot of things that I am leaving out due to personal reasons, but let's fast forward to today. F messaged me earlier, telling me that her sister had seen the messages between K and their mother, and I don't know what to do anymore. Like I said before, I don't know if this is real or not, but if she kept it up for nearly 3 years, then at least some of it must be true.

That said, I need advice on what to do. Should I go tell someone IRL, or do I just leave it to her to figure things out?",13May2018,1
125,"So, me being adopted of the same family to this house that has been my family since I was 9 years old, I am 28 years old now, my adopted family has been foster parents for many years. My two brothers and I being my adopted mother‚Äôs very first foster children back in 1999. My adopted mother hasn‚Äôt adopted anyone else since and have just been a regular foster mom where foster kids comes and goes. About 2 years ago, my adopted mom had adopted a 9 year old girl. She has been a foster child for the last one and a half years until my mom decided to adopt her. My little adopted sister does not feel like she is a part of the family, however she does see me as an older brother because she knows that I was exactly in her situation many many years ago and we stay up late at night talking about various things. About how she used to live with her grandma in a trailer home and got taken away from CPS. Anyways, I went to her room to turn her TV off because she falls asleep with it on and found her crying in her bed. My heart just sank. I knew immediately why she was crying. She constantly tells me that she misses her grandma so much. But I never saw her cry before. She doesn‚Äôt feel like a part of the family because my mom is kinda old now and I have noticed that my mom isn‚Äôt the same loving and caring mom she used to be when I first arrived. Anyways, when I saw her cry, I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I felt completely helpless. I hate to see her cry because she‚Äôs such a sweetheart and a 10 year old girl shouldn‚Äôt be going through this. She obviously can‚Äôt speak up to my mom or her social worker because the foster care system is honestly f*cked up and I know first hand how it is.

131,"Early 20s, female, working in tech for about half a year now (first job after graduation) It's been really hard for me ever since the beginning but I kept thinking it would get better. And technically, it has, since I'm better at the coding part now. But the tasks are still really stressful, and on top of that, all the accumulated stress over the past few months is really draining me. I can't eat well, I can't sleep well, I had several nervous breakdowns this week (outside of work) that would have never happened if I wasn't stressed.

My workplace tries its best to be supportive and constructive and provide a good working environment. The work itself just really stresses me out. And it makes me feel like I can't connect to anyone else since I feel like no one could relate to my struggle. There's also the issue of feeling like I come from a different background than most everyone else, and that makes it even harder, and then I feel so alone.

Part of me wants to keep telling myself to just stick it out and hold it together like I've been trying my very best to do for many months now. But at the same time I want to value my mental health because I feel like work should not leave you shaking every day and you only get one life and I don't want to watch myself crumble.

137,"So I'm gonna try to explain this as concisely and accurately as possible but it is difficult for obvious reasons. Basically I have a friend where I am and we're both far away from home, she and I (A guy) became best friends when we got here because (I thought) we enjoyed each other's company and also for the emotional support when we're in this new situation. She always comes to me with her problems and she'll come find me if we're not already hanging out to hug me and bury her face in my chest/shoulder. She'll rant to me and cry to me and tell me her feelings or ask me to show her affection and stuff like that. As an extra layer I developed feelings for her at some point that I wouldn't share for her, but when I was intoxicated one night she got the truth out of me so she knows.

Obviously as friends, I expected we would treat each other equally. I don't have problems often but sometimes when I do I voice them to her, and she'll respond with ""are you okay"" ""what can I do for you"" and stuff like that but... It just feels like a practiced process to me. I don't feel like she actually cares all that much. Most of the time when I try to hug her or show affection to her like putting my arm around her randomly (Usually as emotional support but also just because) she'll usually shrug it off or physically avoid me. I know I can't really prove this or show evidence of it but the feelings I get for this are strong. I've brought this up to her several times but she tries to convince me that she does care about me and that ""she doesn't like being touched sometimes"" (A lot of the time she'll be hugging or putting her arm around other friends mere minutes before or after I try to. She's forgotten about me a couple times in important situations, or sometimes she'll happen to not see my messages when I need emotional support from her (Whether saying so directly or indirectly). She claims to have cried because she thinks I have an eating disorder (I don't) and she claims to care about me in other situations, but when I need her it just comes down to the same process she always says, are you okay, did I do something, how can I help, while never actually going out of her way to help me.

What really hurt me is I brought up the fact that she gives other guys more affection than she gives me when we're supposedly best friends, and she just said her mood changes a lot like... Okay, you literally were all over that other guy friend of yours 10 minutes ago and a different one less than 2 minutes ago but you didn't want to help me when I wanted a hug between the time of those two guys or afterwards. So yeah, I brought that up via text afterwards, and she started her whole ""mood"" thing so I stopped responding because I got sick of it, so she showed up at my place not too long afterwards and knocked on the door and when I opened it she had the saddest face ever and I couldn't help it, she went in for a hug and I let her... She looked so sad.

Ugh, I really don't know. I'm sorry for the rant. I just don't really know what to do here. I know it's poorly written and stuff but I'm on an emotional roller coaster right now and I really need some advice. Thanks to anyone who actually went out of their way to help me",13May2018,1

141,"Hey guys!




I've been job searching for months now. I try to score something in my town so I can cash in all the money instead of having to waste it all on food and housing. Anyway, I really hate interviews. I have always hated oral exams and excelled at written ones. Every time an interview comes around, I can't sleep days before and have that anxious feeling in the stomach all the time. It is annoying. I know that there is a low chance of getting the job, and that's not even my biggest fear- not getting it. It's embarassing myself. Because I live in a small town, word travels fast, and everyone will be like ""hey, you know x's kid, yea, he bombed so hard on the interview toda,y I think he might be retarded"". 




Probably not. But that's what I'm afraid of. Also, coupled with the feeling of wasting time, doing something you hate (public speaking), and it all being in vain because you won't get it, all of it is a heavy burden on me, One I try to alleviate by ""rewarding"" myself from the funds I got at my last job. I already spent like 2 paychecks worth of money on video games, and my steam library is as full as I want it. I could buy something else, but at this point, it would be literally wasting money. 




I'm at my wits end on how to motivate myself to go through the hell of employee selection week after week, knowing it is all for nothing, and most of the positions being ones I would hate anyway (working with customers). And it's my money that I am wasting to reward myself. It's not like 100$ dropped out of the sky ex nihilo, and rewarded me. That would actually be a far superior motivation because I would have an external reason for embarassing myself, and dispersion of responsibility. I can actually function normally when doing something in someone elses name, but when it's just me, then it's like hell and all the anxiety just weighs down on me for days and I can't get rid of it. Exposure helps for some time, but whne you get isolated in unemployment once again, then you revert back, and having to talk to people sucks.",13May2018,1

145,"We met in June of 2017, and started officially dating in September of that same year. It was a long distance relationship, but everything was good. When we initially met, we spent so much time together\-almost every day. He met my family, my family‚Äôs friends, and my friends from back home \(as I just graduated from undergrad and still lived in the college town and he had an internship there\). He went back to his home country in Asia in July but we kept in contact and were basically in a relationship but just did not have the title. After it was ‚Äúfacebook official‚Äù he came to visit me for some time before he started his new job. 

For New Year‚Äôs I went to visit him, and I met his family and friends. Eventually we talked about marriage and kids, and it was something we both wanted. He told me he wanted to marry me as soon as possible. He told his extended family this as well. He even wanted to talk to his mom about marrying me. I deeply loved him, and I thought he felt the same way. He told me he loved me more than any of his ex\-girlfriends. If we had a problem, we would always try to solve it and when we did fight it would always be resolved quickly. Our relationship was really amazing. I loved him dearly. I flew over the pacific to see him, and I have an insane fear of flying. In February, he bought me tickets to go to see him for my spring break in March.  

In late February, I had a friend rape me and I told my boyfriend about it, but he was mad at me. I did not go to the cops, I told my boyfriend that I did not want to ruin this guys life\-because he did not ruin mine. There were other reasons too\-but he never tried to understand. He could not understand. He told me it broke his heart and our relationship. He barely talked to me and would hardly ever reply. He broke up with me soon after. He said we are too different, and that there are too many obstacles. There was not. I put in so much effort to because he had more traditional values and I did not, but I was willing to change my behaviors for him. Sometimes I did not know what he did not like and what was okay, and he would get mad instead of explaining\-but we always made up soon after. He told me not to come and that he could not bear to face me. We causally talked but he did not seem to care about me much at all. Around April he stopped replying to me all together. 

I had moved the tickets to May first, so I decided to go and talk to him in person. I went to the town he lived in and told him repeatedly that I was there and I wanted to see him. I thought he could at least do that but no response\-and then he blocked me. The next day I went to his apartment to try to talk \(which is know is crazy but I do not care\-he never explained anything\). I waited for hours, eventually gave up, and left one of his belongings with a note. He messaged me back saying that he has a new girlfriend and a new life. I spend the next few days crying and could not eat. I think he started dating her in April, which is a month after we broke up. How can someone move on fast? 

How can you tell your family, others, and me that you want to marry me? How can you tell me that I make your life complete? I cannot comprehend how this happened. He never explained anything; he just got mad and stopped talking to me. Maybe if he explained, I would have changed my mind and I would have done something about the situation. I really feel betrayed by the person I loved the most. I am honestly so depressed and hurt right now.  

Any ideas on what could have been going through his head? Or why he did this? ",13May2018,0
146,"I recently found myself in a situation where I am more into someone else than they are into me. I have been told that I am clingy &amp; that he needs space because I hang around him and his group way too much. 
The thing is, I am going though a really tough time and I decided to end a lot of relationships. When I met him and his friends, I found a change and I really enjoy their company. I just happen to also be sleeping with one of them. That one of them is completely creeped out by my being there. So obviously, I will not continue to hang out with them as much. 
This post is not about him.
This is to gain some insight into why this feeling happens after you are seen as the needy one for simply showing your feelings and wanting to hang around that person a lot. The feeling I am referring to is embarrassment. 
Why do we feel this embarrassment after not having our feelings reciprocated? I am wondering how I can stop these feelings of utter embarrassment? How can I stop viewing myself as pathetic after coming off as a creep or needy girl? I can't even look myself in the mirror. I feel so embarrassed with how I came off as a weirdo for being really into this guy and hanging out with his friends.

148,"So a bit background story: I know this guy since I was 6 and now im 18 so a good 12 years and for like the time from 6 to 16 he was my only ""friend"" since he was the only person i really knew (I was kinda shy even tho im very extrovert in general). Since than we were always in a competitious-friendship we tried to beat each other in everything (grades in school, video games, basic skills and literally everything) and we developed into 2 different people. While im the smarter person who likes to learn and develop in every subject - he is a more airhead (even tho he is very good in physics and maths) in terms of social interaction in my opinion. I can't stand how he interacts with other people coz all he does is insulting them and talking shit (im a very liberal turkish guy, he is a conservative, proud, homophobe turk(I'm straight but i can't stand people being intolerant and living in the middleage))  but the people find it funny because he is dumbish and don't take it too seriously. Since im 17 i got into a group of 4 friends and 3 of them are really closr and important to me and i can get along with them really well. But later on this one guy joined this group and since than I'm kinda anxious and jealous everytime my other friends and him spent time together because i suspect them to let me down like he did (in these 10 years of ""friendship"" i was basically alone, at home, playing video games). So i know it's a very complex subject but my question is: What should i do to cope with this friend or how should i cut him off from my life ?

You can ask for more details but i wanted to make it as short and understandable as possible.

150,"Hi,

So I‚Äôve just been in one of those situations where the girl you‚Äôre crazy for is ‚Äúafraid I don‚Äôt feel the same way about you‚Äù.

I drunkenly opened up to this person, as she‚Äôs genuinely on my mind all he damn time. I know messaging drunk is never a good idea,  but bad ideas are great ideas when you‚Äôre drunk, let‚Äôs be honest.

The last person who I felt his crazy for said the same thing, I‚Äôm just a friend to her. Honestly this amount of rejection is killing me off. I have friends, I hang out with them, sometimes in person, mostly online though and I have fun with those, but whilst I‚Äôm having fun with those I‚Äôm just thinking about how I don‚Äôt want to be with them right now, I want to be with that one other person, just spending time with them... you know?

I hate how I get myself into these situations, I hate it. I just don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs wrong with me... 

I‚Äôm down. Demotivated. Exhausted and honestly depressed.

It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm flying abroad for 2 weeks in a month and a half. 

I just need advice. Women, what sort of things is it that you find make you push your male friends into that friend zone.

Guys, do any of you recover from this?

What should I do about our relationship? I‚Äôm happy to just be friends but I‚Äôm going to need to meet somebody else to help take my mind off this person... or just continue trying with this person.

Is it wrong to ask why?

Thanks...",13May2018,5

153,"i can‚Äôt do anything anymore and i don‚Äôt even know what good it is to be posting here because i probably know the answers to my questions but i just feel like i can‚Äôt get out of this rut i‚Äôm in 

i‚Äôm a 17 year old female i stopped going to school in year 9 but i managed to complete year 10 half because the school felt bad for me and half because i managed to stay sort of a float 

i don‚Äôt have my license, i‚Äôve had three jobs, one i had to leave because i moved homes, one i had to leave because they closed down and the other i left because i became way too stressed and anxious every day.

since i left my job i haven‚Äôt done anything, i left TAFE (australian education system i think it‚Äôs similar to community college in america) during my cert 4 in game design because i never went and i just fell too far behind.
i‚Äôve completed a business cert 2 and a multimedia and web design cert 3. 
neither of which really help me at all and all of which i passed by doing the bare minimum and being constantly anxious because i never went and was so close to falling too far behind.

i have no drive for anything at all. my rooms a fucking pig sty so i don‚Äôt really spend my time in there unless i‚Äôm sleeping.
i just scroll reddit or play video games all day every day until the weekend comes around and i go and see my friends, rinse and repeat. 

to be fair to myself my life has been fucked, my dad is extremely depressed and would blame me for it. i‚Äôve seen things no kid should have had to see.
my mother has a had a rough life too but partied through all my childhood leaving me in a constantly anxious environment, many traumatic things happened.
my step dad, whom i looked up to and considered a father figure and someone i went to for all my problems recently became my worst nightmare as he admitted to having sexual feelings for me, i didn‚Äôt tell anyone as it would break my family apart and it‚Äôs never been this secure before.
i know you‚Äôll say i should tell someone, but he hasn‚Äôt acted on it apart from offering me money for favours and being generally creepy.
but i can‚Äôt, i can‚Äôt because he‚Äôs had a kid with my mother and because they‚Äôre married and our lives has never ever been so normal and functional.
everything we‚Äôve worked for would go down the drain, i just can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs not an option.

i‚Äôm constantly anxious and depressed, sometimes borderline psychotic.
i need to go back and see a psychologist but i can‚Äôt for the life of me get my shit together to do it, i need to find a new job but i can‚Äôt fucking do it.
i feel like i‚Äôm broken, i feel like i can‚Äôt be fixed. i have no support in my life and i‚Äôm left to fend for myself yet i can‚Äôt, i don‚Äôt feel like i have it in me nor am i strong enough.
i‚Äôll have one of these mental break downs maybe once a week but the rest of the time i‚Äôm just nothing, no emotions what so over just lying there wishing i didn‚Äôt exist.
but killing myself isn‚Äôt an option because of my sister, because i want to be better but i just don‚Äôt know how.

i guess what i‚Äôm asking is how the fuck so i ‚Äújust‚Äù do it like everyone tells me?

i think about it so much, i‚Äôve been fucking thinking about doing stuff for the last 3 years but i never do it. 

i just have no energy, motivation or life left in me. 
sometimes i have a good few days where i manage to get a few things done but i crash really fast and it all feels like too much and i go back to my hiding place. i feel like i‚Äôm doomed.

i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore 

has anyone felt like this and if you have, how did you get out of it

There's this girl who I'd say I'm acquaintances with, we were in a class together for a bit and spoke to each other a couple of times.

I was sort of just planning to ask her over Facebook and say I had a bit of a crush on her and ask if she'd want to go out to eat or do something else anytime soon. 

I don't know if that comes across as not confident enough or maybe a bit weird or whatever...the thing I'm mainly worried about is her laughing in my face and it getting around.

162,"Hello. Thanks in advance for your time and advice!

Background story: I‚Äôm a junior in high school right now. I develop a lot of ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù (usually for a week or two and more of a physical attraction)  for girls and my friends tease me about it a lot, saying things like ‚ÄúOh, just another one of Chris‚Äôs girls.‚Äù However, there was a girl I met my freshman year through sports and we will call her Jade. 

I think I‚Äôve been head over heels for Jade for three years. It was kind of on and off, but more on than off. Freshman year we met and talked briefly to each other. During this point in time, I thought she was very cute but didn‚Äôt know her well enough to say it was more than just a physical attraction. She writes in my yearbook, I hope we get a lot closer next year since you‚Äôre pretty cool and fun to be around. 

Sophomore years starts. We do cross country together and get a lot closer. I like her a lot right now and it‚Äôs more than just her looks that captivate me; she has a bubbly and amazing personality and is always fun to be around. Over the course of the year, she dates two of my best friends, and after the breakups I‚Äôm there for her. It stung that she dated my best buds but I was good at ignoring it. 

Junior year is here! A transfer students comes along and his name will be Eric. Jade, Eric and I become a tight knit trio ready to take on junior year. Unfortunately, things unravel quickly after Eric confessed to Jade, got shot down and kind of blew up the entire situation and I was in the middle of it all. I chose not to pick a side to make sure I didn‚Äôt hurt either of them as they were both my best friends, but I think that hurt my friendship with them both. Over time, things slowly gets better between Jade and I and Eric and I, but not between Jade and Eric. Then, Eric and I were talking one day and he mentioned that Jade liked me but I was too short (lol ;-;) ; the next day, I asked Jade about it and she said the short part was a joke (I think this is what happened. In the moment, I was kinda like woah she liked me and it was a blur)

Then April comes and so does prom season and this is when my feelings begin to tangle more and more.

Prom. Jade and I were looking for dates and I made the clique suggestion of going together. However, I end up finding another date, who will be called Sammy, and she helps make the poster for and everything. Flash forward two weeks to Prom. Sammy is very quiet, shy and reserved. Sammy and I do prom photos, photo booth, grab food and all that and then I take her to the dance floor. She looks uncomfortable in the crowd and she asks me to help her find her friends. Afterwards, I go back to the dance floor and dance with Jade and we‚Äôre having a blast. The most fun I had all night and I feel my feelings for her swell up and grow like they never had before. 

Post-Prom. I‚Äôm head over heels for Jade once again. The feelings only grow. She has a polaroid of us in her phone case. That polaroid is also her lockscreen. She got my professional prom pictures (I took two) and switches them out whenever she‚Äôs bored in class. She stays after school to study and she asks me to stay with her and I do sometimes. She invited me to go see movies with her and her friends. We‚Äôre #1 best friends on snapchat. 

I know she‚Äôll never like me so I feel like I‚Äôm being lead on and it‚Äôs my fault for sticking around. Worst of all, last night she texted me saying that was talking to someone. It kinda broke my heart. I know these feelings aren‚Äôt going to stop anytime soon and the time I spend with her is just going to hurt more and more. So I‚Äôm asking advice for what I should do now. I don‚Äôt want to hurt her but I don‚Äôt want to keep putting myself through this either

TL;DR: Met a girl and has been head over heels for her for 3 years now. We‚Äôre best friends but my feelings have grown a lot recently. She makes me feels like we had something m, but she recently told me she was talking to someone else. It crushed me and idk if I should cut ties or bear with it",13May2018,0

164,"I'm a really religious woman and I have never had any dating experience before. Recently, I have developed feelings for a friend of mine and I care for him a great deal. We get along really well and hang out all the time. He compliments me a lot and is always really caring and considerate towards me, always paying attention to the little details. I think he likes me back but so far neither of us has said anything. The issue is that he is an atheist. That shouldn't really be an issue at all because I would never want to impose my beliefs on someone else. But, it's an issue because he is someone who has had a lot of dating experience and will undoubtedly have expectations from a relationship that I wouldn't be able to fulfil because of my religious beliefs. I don't want to tie him down to a relationship where he would feel unhappy or like I'm not giving him everything that he needs. What should I do? I have asked advice from friends and some have suggested just being honest with him and laying my cards on the table. But this is my first time feeling this way and I just don't think that I am ready for that kind of brutal honesty. I struggle with those sorts of difficult conversations and usually shy away from them, so, I don't think that I am ready to do that. My other friends think that I should just enjoy my time with him and not think too hard about it. That sounds good but I feel like the more I spend time with him, the deeper I am falling for him. I don't think that I can do that for much longer. This is actually really embarassing because I am not young so I shouldn't really be having this sort of crisis at my age but I am.

Will summarize into points for it to be clearer. Because in hindsight I couldnt see why it has to turn out this way.

-Kid A (we live in the same house) asked if he could borrow my sports earphones (Plantronics FitBit) 
-I let him borrow it for a few days
-Mom knew about this, she got furious and paranoid. Thinking he‚Äôll never return it or will lose it, anything that it isnt positive. She asked me every day if he returned it.  
-I was like WTF ? It is not that earphones is made of diamond ?? 
-Now, she asked Kid B (friend of kid A, also in the same house) to look for the earphones. But not making it obvious

May 12 ‚Äò18 
- I pm‚Äôed Kid A on fb if i could have it back since I need to use it. (He replied but I wasnt able to read it) 
-mom and I were in the kitchen. Kid B enters. 
-Mom to Kid B: did u find the earphones ?
 Kid B: No
  Me: i dont whats with my mom but it seems she doesnt like kid A to borrow my earphones. 
Mom: asdjfkflrlgof!! Jakdlflxrkel!!! (Holy balls, she went ballistic!) 

Kid A returned my earphones hours after I messaged him. So I think, everything‚Äôs ok. Nope. 

She went to the room and yelled ¬´you betrayed me¬ª while crying!! She called me a traitor. 
She cried until night time.

169,"Warning.. this is pretty messy. And a lot of words. I really just want to get it out there and talk about it. I've been seeing a therapist and I've been reaching out to my mom (we live together), my best friend has been very supportive, and still I feel like I'm in hell. 

Near the beginning of February I started getting close to a girl I work with, we'll call her C. At the time she was living away from her home in another state (here), with a boyfriend that was abusive. Her and I start hanging out after work, and became friends. I would drive us around the city and show her things (she hardly ever left the house, mostly from working 2 jobs and her bf was a controlling shut-in) and talk her through her troubles. We started seeing eachother even more, and talking every day. There was a mutual attraction, and eventually she told her boyfriend that she was done with him. We started going on dates, having sex, all that good stuff. She still lived with her (now) ex, and they shared a bed (studio apartment, separate blankets..). He tried to keep her with him, and at one point found out that she was seeing me through another girl we work with who he knew. They had a huge fight obviously, but C had already made her mind up. 

The lease for their apartment would expire April 30th. At the beginning of April, she and I were looking at places, with the intention of moving in together. However... I didn't want anything serious at the time, and I told her this. Last October I broke off a relationship I started across the country during the year I spent over there, due to declining mental health issues (severe anxiety sprinkled with depression). I had moved back home to be comfortable and work on myself, and I wasn't sure I was ready for something serious again. I thought moving in together was way too much too fast, and told her I couldn't do it (even though I regret this I'm sure it was the right thing to do). I insisted she focus on *her*, not on *us*. We continued to see eachother with that narrative, that we were friends with benefits. But she wanted to stay in the state, at this job, and find her own place. 

As time went on, I became more enamored with her. I came to trust her. That was huge, enormous, colossal, titanic, for me. I have been backstabbed and emotionally abused by all but one romantic partner I've ever had, and trust does not come easily, and is the source of a lot of anxiety. C and I were very transparent with eachother. I remember when it hit me that I really did trust her. Everything was so wonderful. 

It also became apparent that she could not afford to have a place by herself. And I really wish at that point I had stepped in. It drives me crazy to think how differently things would be now if I had. The only other alternative was moving in with her ex again, but 2 bedrooms this time. They had been together for over a year, and he was her only other friend in the area. She maintained they would never date again, and I believed (and still believe) her. 

The day they signed the lease, the trust vanished. I was an anxious wreck again. Constantly bombarded with what-ifs. Constantly questioning things she said. Reading into every little phrase and habit. Torturing myself. I desperately tried to cling to what I felt before. A few days after they signed the lease, we had another talk. She was getting promoted to asst. manager at our work, and was going to have to train and fly out a few states away for more training for a week (happening in 2 weeks from writing this). She told me she wanted to step back from what we were doing, and just be friends. No more sex, no more dates. She said it would be too much for her to handle with work and moving and training, and that it wasn't permanent. Of course I was devastated, but I hung onto that ""not permanent"". She implored me that she still cared about me and loved me as a person, but couldn't give herself to someone else at the moment. In the same conversation, I told her I was in love with her and that I wanted to share a life with her (however long.. i can't believe in forever anymore). 

She pulled back at the same time I was ready to let her in. I have never felt so.. abandoned. This whole time she had wanted something serious with me, and on the same day I felt like I was ready to give that to her, she went the opposite direction. Hello depression. 

The next day we ran some errands together before I had to work. I was still trying to process ""what we were"" at that point. I went to work. Next door there is a sandwich shop. There's a guy that works there that comes in all the time and flirts with C. She thinks he's attractive, but insisted she was extremely uninterested in doing anything about that. My anxiety raged but I fought it as hard as I could. I went in for a sandwich, and he asked about her. ""Is she straight, is she single, is she down to fuck?"". Terrified and disgusted, I responded out of pride: ""well, her and I have kind of had a thing for the past 2 months"". He said sorry and that he'd back off. I ate my sandwich and went on a delivery (I'm a delivery driver). On the way back to the store, I started having a panic attack. A really bad one. Not vomiting-bad (had that today) but hyperventilating and shaking bad. I called C. I told her I was freaking out, didn't know why. She tried to calm me down, told me if I needed to go home just tell K (our boss who loves us) and I could. 

At the time I didn't know why I was panicking. In hindsight it was just timing. C wanting to separate, the guy questioning our relationship... my trust was gone and I had no idea what was going to happen. It overwhelmed me. Not sure how much it's directly related, but I had also just adjusted to new meds. I had been taking Lexapro since november, and swapped off to Buspirone because Lexapro made me feel emotionally constricted (which might be better now that I'm thinking about it). The Buspirone seemed to do nothing for me. 

45 minutes after I called C, I'm lying in bed trying to calm down. She texts me, ""I just heard you told (sandwich guy) that we were together? What? Why would you say that?"". I fucking imploded. How did she know that? Why would she question that? That's not what I said.. How did she know that? Did we not have a thing for 2 months? Does she not think we did? Immediately and explosively overwhelmed. I tried to call her. She was angry at me, and wouldn't pick up. She was at Home Depot, and had stopped by the store to talk to K about training on her way. Who told her what I said? sandwich guy? Why was she talking to him? Anxiety and questions and confusion. She wouldn't tell me who told her. I learned later it was a friend of sandwich guy that we worked with. Our conversation ended with her saying ""we need time and space. focus on yourself"". And then we didn't speak for a week. 

That was a hard week. We still worked together. K and I talked a lot, she encouraged me that it wasn't the end of everything, I just needed to give it time. So I did, and we started talking again. But things were different. She was moving in, and didn't have much time to talk. She rarely replied to anything I sent her. She was busy after work. Anxiety in heaps. I felt weak and abandoned and confused and angry. I've always had a hard time letting go of things, especially relationships... It has only ever hurt me. 

Last week she went back to her home state for a night to get a bed and see her little brother for his birthday. The night before we had hung out and had a really good talk, and I was feeling confident and comfortable with our relationship and the state of things. The day she left I had a therapy session. I brought up to my therapist these fears I was having about C lying to me, seeing people behind my back, pretending to be my friend, hiding what she was doing and how she was feeling just to keep me from being hurt. And my therapist told me that those weren't irrational things to fear, and that basically C was giving me plenty of reasons not to trust her. I broke again. I came out of therapy at the bottom of a pit I had just escaped not 12 hours ago. I texted C that we needed to talk. She was with her brother and couldn't, but told me to text her. So i did. A lot. I brought back up everything I was afraid of, everything that we had talked about the day before and settled. She got mad, obviously. She stepped outside and called me, told me I need to stop focusing on her so much and that these are things I *shouldn't* even be worried about because we weren't dating. She told me again to focus on myself and be strong, and we could talk when she was back in town. Then she hung up. She said we maybe could text later, so I did. She didn't reply. We worked together the next night, so the morning before I texted her and asked if we could talk after work. She didn't reply. 

I feel crazy. I don't want to be so attached to her. I don't want to feel any of this, but I don't know how to stop the thoughts and I don't know how to stop the feelings. 

The next day I got to work and she pulled me outside to talk. She had done her makeup really nice. She gave me a long hug and said it was all okay, she just wants me to be okay. She knows this isn't how I am or how I want to be. She told me to focus on myself. 

We went back inside and it was alright. A few hours later I asked if she was busy after work, and she said she was. The anxiety came back. I got an attitude. I said ""yea i could have guessed that"". She said I had no right to be mad and it's her life. I asked what she was doing and she said ""that's none of your concern"". Hello bottom of the pit, I missed you so much. Around closing time, I snapped. We work at a cookie shop. She had made 3 white mac cookies, sandwich guy's favorite cookie, and boxed them up. She had driven herself to work (which meant her roommate/ex wasn't picking her up). She had her makeup done very nice. In my mind, which was screaming at me, she was busy after work because she was going to go ride sandwich guy's dick and swallow his cum. After having told *me* that she didn't want to be physical with anyone. And telling me that she didn't have time to give to anyone. So I snapped at her. I confronted her. I asked how he was doing, told her I hoped they had a nice time, some uglier things that I also wish I hadn't said. She snapped back, told me to stop acting like a child, that her life was none of my business, that she had been given every reason to stop talking to me altogether but she didn't. She said the cookies were for her, which I don't believe. She doesn't like coconut and they have coconut in them. She always gets the peanut butter. Either way I didn't trust her anymore. She said she never hid anything from me. I don't know. The last thing she said was she was truly going to miss being my friend, and I said me too. 

I walked to the parking lot and called K, I knew she was going to hear about it anyway. I broke down crying and apologizing and begging not to fire me and begging to let me work. She told me the same things as C. We aren't dating. It's none of my business. I can't obsess over her like I have been. I needed to focus on me. I went home and cried a lot. I woke my mom up (I work night shifts) and explained it all and she comforted me. Lots of crying. First I lost a lover, then I lost a friend. And it was all my fault. If I handled the situation better, the situation would be better. I'm constantly fighting to not spiral down into myself, and losing most of the time. 

The next day (yesterday) we worked together again. K pulled me outside when I got there, laid some ground rules. Last chance. No contacting C unless it's work related. No talking to C at work unless it's work related. Respect C as the shift lead and communicate with her as a driver. Be professional. Get over it. Okay. 

C had her makeup done again. She had changed clothes before work, which meant she didn't come from home. might have stayed the night with someone else. Panic attack, again. Went to the bathroom and threw up bile (hadn't eaten anything in a while). Told K, went home. Slept. Woke up, typed this.


I need help. I don't know why this is so hard. I can't afford to lose this job. I have to work with C again, alone, tonight. How the fuck do I get over this? How can I come to terms with this situation, and separate myself from how I feel about her? How do I focus on myself? Everything is so loud and I feel so small. It hurts to look at her, to see her at work seemingly unaffected by it all. I feel like a nuisance. I feel stupid and wrong. I don't know how to stop.

Thank you if you made it to the bottom. I'm 22. I know I'm young I know I have way more in front of me I know I will be fine eventually I know it will all be okay in the end. I'm asking for help with how to cope with these feelings because I don't know how. I exercise, I run, I play music, I reach out to loved ones, and still I find myself at the bottom of this pit I've dug for myself and it all seems so worthless. 

In typing this I honestly think I might just have to quit my job. Or not be scheduled with C. K would do that for me, I've been there 3 years (the longest of anyone there) and I'm a wonderful employee when I'm not emotionally devastated. I got approved to start delivering groceries with a local company, but due to all this haven't found the mental space to start doing that. If the money from that is enough, maybe I can do that and work my old job 1 or 2 days a week instead of 5.

I hope this is the right place for this. I don't know. I love the people here. I hope y'all can help me.

But I had a really stressful event, there's a lot of pressure from my parents(abroad, working) yelling at me/us and my older brother who doesn't understand I need to study. And so, today we had a breakdown, taking the theory exam in driving classes, the deadline's approaching, my brother who's quite older doesn't have the licence, but I'm trying to get it. His movie is apparently more important than that exam.(laptop) and I gave him space, went to my cousin's and asked to prepare there. Parents found out, yelled at both of us. 
I'm trying to balance college and those lessions(parents insisted). I'm sick of it, i dont need the pressure and stress now. I want to cry but I can't!  And there's more stuff....

171,"I'm not posting on here asking ""oooo does she like me?""... that's more than clear but a bit complicated.

The other day I just started feeling really low, and realised that my friend and I won't be spending as much time together anymore.  We spend way too much time together.  But I also realise that I should spend less time with her so that I can move on.  I just feel a bit down because she has really helped me grow as a person...really, I am far from the same person I was over a year ago.

What gets me all the time is that she treats me so special.  I was at a function with a bunch of people from out friend group, and instead of coming over and saying hi to everyone, she ran her hand down my back and said hi Jiiiimm.  We've known each other a while,  but the way she does things just get me going.  The only women who have ever done things like that have been intimate with me.  She never asks me things directly and always in a round about way, its just frustrating me.

Then there's no place I feel quite as comfortable as when I'm with her.  We might still spend a lot of time together because she keeps saying were gonna spend more time together.

Then the other day when I went to her party everyone was so happy to see me, I had no idea.  I also didn't realise that she talks to her partners (she's poly) about me all the time.  They know things about me I only told her.  I though I was just another friend but apparently not.  Things like this leave me happy but confused.

TL;DR:I don't even know what questions  I should ask really.  Should I have DTR talk with her because I'm just confused?  I like her and I think she has some sort of feeling for me.  I just feel like we hit a wall because we never talk directly.",13May2018,9
172,"So this is the first time I'm posting here, but I have quite the conundrum that I don't really know how to approach. One of my friends worked at a store and didn't have the best opinion of their boss. Recent events, like this one, have made me reconsider what kind of person they are, as their true colors seemed to have shinned through. I just learned, that before they left their job, they stole some product that is worth quite a bit, possibly a few thousand dollars...which carries felony charges.

I know they stole because they bragged about it to two mutual friends, as a sort of ""F the man"" kind of thing. One of them made a promise not to tell anyone, and they take promises like that very seriously. The other friend told me over dinner and I was quite appalled by the thief's actions. I don't have the highest opinion of the boss too, but stealing stuff in the way they did is a blatant breach of trust, morally disgusting, and theft like this effects smaller shops much more than bigger chains.

I'm considering different actions to take against the thief, because I feel obligated to speak up and say something about this. There are quite a few ways I could do something like this and many more ways the thief can react to this. The best case scenario is they apologize and turn in the stolen goods...the worst case is getting the police involved. Hell, the boss might want to get the police involved regardless. I'd rather not have to go through that pain in the ass because I already have enough to worry about, so drama and dealing with possible criminal chargers is something that I really don't need to add onto the dumpster fire that is my mental health.

I talked about this with a close friend of mine, who is mutual friends with everyone mentioned and they said they'd support me 100%. I know the right thing to do is to get involved and say something; there's no question in my mind about that. I'm just struggling with pulling the trigger and how to approach this to yield the best results for all parties. Despite my new disdain for the thief, I don't want to see them go to jail and possibly lose some of his rights and potential future, but I definitely don't want to let the thief get away with screwing over his former boss. 

The plan I keep coming back to is to contact the thief first and lay out all the cards on the table, telling them to return the goods they stole or I'd go to the police and his former boss. If they say they returned the product, I'd check with their boss, as well as the friend who told me, to make sure they returned everything. The thief really isn't one for confrontation, but I can see so many ways that this could go wrong, so I came here asking for help. What would you do if you were in my shoes?

TLDR: My friend stole something from their former boss. What is the best approach to dealing with this situation?",13May2018,1

I'm just not 100% sure what this is worth? What can I offer the owner to give me access to the group and all the members?

178,"So I have this really amazing female friend that I've been talking with for like a 1.5 years. We're from the same village, we go to schools that are like 10mins from eachother and we are both going to the same school next school year (it was very hard to get in, still suprised we both were accepted), we have very simular hobbies etc.


We never really had big problems with each other, always on the same page, I thought this would finally work out as a great friendship.


Fast forward to a couple weeks ago I started just hating everything she does, I don't even know why. I'm really not generally liked or even mildly understood. I'm a young trans dude (she really helped me with getting used to my new name) and i'm really asexual and sex-repulsed (i literally never want to have sex, just google it). She is a very much straight cis girl (that is very sexual).


Now you may see how that might have some problems. She often rolls her eyes when I try to talk to her about some problem I have (usually lgbtq+ related) and it really hurts. And I have a lot of trouble understanding any of her sex jokes and references and problems.

Lately I'm just repulsed by her whole existence,  I hate her style (sexy art hoe basically), I hate how she speaks (zero thought, no seriousness ever, everything is apparently just ironic and it feels like she doesn't have a brain)...


I can't just calmly talk with her anymore, anytime I try to resolve this with her and explain anything she just replies immediately with: ""What? Am I suppossed to go and kill myself?"".

I just want to talk with her, but she never listens to me.


Everytime she feels like shit I spend hours just trying to make her feel better and writing paragraphs after paragraphs and when I write her anything about how shitty I feel she's just like: ""uhhh okay? It sucks that you feel like that? I don't really know how to help you?""

So I just get 0 support from her, it suckss.


She also feels pretty different about smoking and alcohol than I do. When we started talking we both haven't gotten drunk even once, never smoked cigs nor weed. Now she drinks (at least beer and wine, usually also sth harder) 3 times a week with some friends, smokes a lil bit and sometimes smokes weed (she has bad hallucinations from it though, so usually doesn't but likes doing it anyway).

I on the other hand try to not drink (sometimes have a lil bit like every 2-8 weeks). I'm trying not to smoke weed at all (sometimes helped with my dysphoria, but I realised I can't use it to hide my problems). And I have a cigarette like once every 1-2weeks.


So my general thoughts about drugs are ""it's okay in moderation as long as you're not using them to hide some problems you might have"".
And her thoughts are ""it's totally okay as long as i'm not vomitting and feeling like too much shit, like whatever"".


I don't even recognise her anymore, I didn't think she was like this, but I guess she always was and I just thought she was a different person?


This is literally the only friend I have, I don't want to lose her. I always have trouble finding new friends and it would really suck((.",13May2018,2

None of them would be disappointing, the thing is I'm just curious to find statistics on % of the demand of Computer Scientists, as for the rest. I have some overall knowledge of what each of those could turn into as a job in the future and I know studying Business Management gives a lot of opportunities as it's appliable in many different fields.

183,"Last July, I finally joined the Tinder game and within a few days I met a guy that lives really close to me. We went on a few dates and got super close and I easily considered him my best friend since we just hit it off so well. Fast forward to the end of August, and he makes the relationship official. He was hesitant to ask me out because I was about to leave for my first year of college to a school a little over an hour away. I said yeah because I was so into him. But, two days before I had to leave, he got a little aggressive in bed and wanted to do more than I was comfortable with. I said no and he stopped. That night he dumped me because he said he felt like he ‚Äúwronged me‚Äù and most likely because I didnt want to have sex yet. My first semester of school was miserable because I was still so upset over him. He decided to block me on all forms of social media except snapchat and he was usually the first person to see my story, so I obnoxiously lived it up and made it look like I was having so much fun at college. Eventually, he snaps me an inside joke we had awhile ago and we start a streak. We were only talking on snapchat, and it was innocent and short and stupid. About a month later I realize I still had feelings for him so I cut it off and blocked him because a girl needs to move on. Its been months now without talking to or seeing him. I‚Äôm home from school now and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. I could drive 5 minutes down the road and see him. The worst part is his lifes a mess and he really is not the best person. But for whatever reason I still constantly think about him and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 
Just to make it more fun, I do have OCD. So I do know that‚Äôs partially why I‚Äôm so hooked, but I still shouldn‚Äôt want him to text me out of nowhere and get back with me considering how rude he was sometimes.",13May2018,1

190,"My mother seems to believe that I am not proud of my heritage. I definitely am, I am not ashamed to tell people that I'm half Jamaican/Nigerian, however I don't relate to other people of my race at all. I've been to Nigeria once, to stay with my maternal family for about a year, I had such a terrible time there that I was  extremely depressed and mentally unstable for next 4 years after that. Because of this experience, I now have no extended family that I wish to see or who want to see me again. Since I have no close family there I don't see myself travelling there again. I'm tired of being the black foreign girl with a weird accent. I come across as ""soft"" to other Nigerians as I tend to be quite sensitive sometimes. 

I want to embrace my heritage, but I've yet to find an aspect of the culture that interests me. Of the Nigerian dishes that I've tried, I only like a few, most of which are snacks and sweets. I've come across three songs that I like but everything else I've heard hasn't really resonated with me. The clothing seems cool and nice to wear, but with no family and hence no birthdays/weddings/special events to go to, I can't see where I would wear it. Another problem is the language, I am not Yoruba, as most all of my Nigerian friends are, but I am from another ethnic group which is much smaller and so the language of that tribe is not commonly spoken in places outside of certain parts of the country. My mother wants me to learn it but I don't see why I should especially since I have no reason to travel there again. She gets even more upset at the fact that I am learning other languages from other parts of the world. Should I learn it? What's the point?

My paternal family is from Jamaica, however I've never met any of them, and they probably don't know I exist. I don't intend to connect with them as it means talking to my father, who is a deadbeat and the most despicable human being I've ever come across. One of my favourite dishes is Jamaican, and I like maybe 3 other dishes + patties, though my knowledge about the culture is very small. I don't understand patwa, which apparently I should and I don't even know where to start when it comes to finding music/clothing that I like. Because of my non existent relationship with my father, finding out where I cam from in Jamaica is out of the question.

Where I live there is a large carribean/african population. I have friends who are African who I hang with from time to time, I have only one Caribbean friend. I could never really relate to the other girls, as much as I tried. None of my closest friends are black which has worried me more and more as I approach adulthood. Hopefully I'll be going to a university with a notoriously low number of black students and I want to befriend as many of them as I can.

I feel ashamed of myself for having to admit that I don't understand my heritage at all. I'm not embarrassed about where I come from, but the culture surrounds big family units and loving communities which I don't have. The only family I have is my mother and aunt.

So My wifes friend passed away when she was a child. She was her best friend and meant the world to her. She has visited her grave every year on the same date every year for 18 years.

193,"Sorry for the wall of text in advance.

So a little while ago I matched with this girl on tinder and we got talking. I got her number and she agreed to a date, but she was very busy so we had to wait a few weeks. We keep texting and we seemed to click really well in my opinion.

Fast forward to yesterday, we finally met up at a local caf√©. We talked quite a bit, but at times silence fell. It didn't seem awkward to me though, and seeing as we'd been texting for weeks we had already talked about a lot before meeting. 

We stayed for about two hours, till about 22:30. I was on my bike, so I offered her a ride to her car (she lives quite far from the city center, I live very close). She accepted, and said our goodbyes at the entrance of the parking garage. I looked her in the eyes and I really felt a spark, I think she felt the same way but I'm not 100% sure. I had the urge to lean in, but it was quite crowded and I didn't feel like kissing like that in public, especially a first kiss. I think she felt the same way, so we hugged and went our seperate ways. She did ask me to text her when I got home before I left.

When I got home I asked her if she got home safely, she texted me (translated); ""Yeah I just walked in :)"". I said ""Good to hear :)"" and told her I had a really good time. 

I didn't get a reply, so I went to bed and assumed she would reply in the morning. It's almost 5 pm now and still nothing. There are no blue checkmarks yet and I can't see when she was last online. I'm starting to get worried she's ghosting me... It just feels like she wouldn't ask me to text her, and text me the way she did if she didn't like the date. I just hope if she doesn't want to go on a second date she tells me instead of ghosting, even though it would hurt me a lot.

Am I irrationally worried here? I'm really anxious about it all, I like her a lot and would love to get to know her better. Any advice would be very welcome :)",13May2018,1
194,"Tl;dr my ex best friend ignores me after getting a bf and although she‚Äôs free to choose her friends, it makes me annoyed how disrespectful she‚Äôs being in the friendship. Am I being clingy/entitled, or should I confront her?

Posting here because last time the community gave amazing advice

I have a massive love hate relationship with my close friend and idk if it‚Äôs me going crazy (I‚Äôve been googling borderline personality disorder because I‚Äôm wondering if I have it) or my friend is treating me like shit. So I‚Äôd really really appreciate hearing other people‚Äôs advice before I confront her, incase I‚Äôm doing the wrong thing.

I‚Äôll try to give both the bad and good so this isn‚Äôt biased

My ex best friend and I used to be super close, she loved hanging out with me, we used to go out heaps together. Then she got a boyfriend. They‚Äôve been dating for 6 months which is long enough to not still be in the honeymoon/ignore all your friends stage. I also have a boyfriend and i still spend time equally between friends, fam, bf

1. She meets up with him all the time but is too busy to meet up with me
Since she got her bf, she‚Äôs been spending nearly all of her spare time with him and ignoring me. She meets him nearly every day and because of this she doesn‚Äôt have time to hang out with her old friends, like me.

2. Always texts him but takes 3 days to send one word replies to me
and when they‚Äôre not together, she‚Äôs constantly texting him. She texts him when she‚Äôs with me, during class, late in the night. I can barely even get a text out of her. Once she took 10 days to say ‚Äúyeah it was good‚Äù and usually takes 2-3 days to reply with one line answers. More recently, the only texts she‚Äôs sent have been asking me for help with her homework. I think she‚Äôs using one of our mutual friends for homework help and I don‚Äôt like what she‚Äôs doing

3. But when we‚Äôre together, she‚Äôs super nice and we get along amazingly well.
But because I feel so much anger/betrayal/resentment, it‚Äôs hard for me to act like I don‚Äôt have any harsh feelings towards her. She‚Äôs also helped me out with small things, so she‚Äôs not entirely selfish. But if it conflicts with her and her boyfriend, she won‚Äôt help

4. She always complains about her boyfriend to me, but she loves him more than anyone else. I don‚Äôt know why she has to lie about not liking him to me

5. Sometimes I‚Äôm a pretty bad texted and only reply the next day. But I do that for everyone. She selectively replies to her bf and ignores almost everyone else.

So what should I do? I‚Äôve been feeling annoyed with her for over a month and the feelings just get worse when I see her abandoning her old friends for her boyfriend‚Äôs group. I feel like the mature thing to do is text her and ask her why she took so long to reply, instead of sulking.

But at the same time, people are allowed to choose their friends and if she wants other people, she can ditch me. I just don‚Äôt like how she pretends to be super close but then treats me disrespectfully. Please any advice xx

206,"My boyfriend  35 and I 26 met each other last year. We were next door neighbours.  We hung out and moved extremely fast. We both have kids the same age. I enjoy family and relationships. I was happy to have someone else in my home. 

Now Im starting to wonder if he is an ass or I'm just sensitive. He is constantly criticizing me. I can clean the entire house and he will still vacuum and say it looks crappy. If I don't do the dishes on my day off he calls me lazy and a slob.  He does all the laundry.  I forgot his pop at McDonald's yesterday and he threw a fit asking how I could remember my food and not his. I was tired! 
I am more relaxed on house work than him but my house is not dirty.  He is very uptight.  When I want him to just relax and drink a beer he ALWAYS says no. I often times find myself drinking by myself outside.  He Never says please. Frequently cusses and complains. One time I want to go mushroom hunting in the woods and as soon as we got there he cussed and said this is the stupidest fucking idea ever. I just want to have a fun time.  His daughter who is 9 is an attention seeker. She has issues from her mom being neglectful. And her dad also isn't emotionally available. I told him that he should get his daughter into therapy because she said she wanted to die and not be alive.  Also if I ask him for $5 for food he gets upset.

.   
Also it's mother's day... Once again he slept in his daughter's bed and did say a word to me when I woke up. I asked him if he was going to hug me this morning and he sighed and hugged me and smiled. Can someone explain to me if this is normal relationship fighting .. I just feel confused.  I've never had a healing relationship rolemode so I don't know how this really are.

207,"About a week ago I had a paper due for one of my classes critiquing a book we had to read. My ‚Äúfriend‚Äù needed advice on how to start, so I explained to him how I gave a simple, closed thesis, made 3 points, and gave a couple more sentences to the introduction so it would be long enough, tips like that for a simple format. 

Well, the day the paper was due, he decided he didn‚Äôt want to come to class and asked me to print it. I did it for him and before I turned ours in, I skimmed over his introduction out of curiosity and noticed he basically copied all of the points I made, same terminology, same sentences structure, completely set aside any advice I gave him and copied my paper instead. 

It made me mad as hell knowing he didn‚Äôt try, but then again he never tries, but when it comes to plagiarism, like most schools, they won‚Äôt hesitate to throw you out. I emailed my professor explaining I needed to meet with him the next time his office hours are open and talk about my paper because I was worried I would get into trouble. at the same time, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm over reacting or just being paranoid about the whole thing. 

Once he came into another class we shared the next day, he seemed to brag to a mutual friend about the whole thing and thought it was funny that I printed it out for him and just copied everything I said. 

I feel like he doesn‚Äôt deserve the grade, and as someone who spent hours on the essay and the book, it doesn‚Äôt feel fair to me that he could succeed without doing the same. After getting separate opinions on the papers, everyone said they were too similar, so my professor will definitely be able to catch on.

Did I do the right thing by emailing my professor or should I have just left it alone and not help that‚Äúfriend‚Äù anymore? ",13May2018,2
208,"So the only time my dad was ever physically abusive (I mean aside from spanking w/ a belt) was around 4 years ago. He‚Äôs always been emotionally abusive (gas lighting, taking out his own issues on me, ect), but he never actually hit me or anything. My junior year of high school, on the way to my grand mothers house he got mad at me and started arguing about something, I don‚Äôt really remember about what. When we got there I don‚Äôt remember exactly what happened but it ended up with me saying something that pissed him off and he suddenly had his hand around my neck. Like 2 seconds in he realized what he was doing was really fucked up and stopped. I never talked about with anyone until I got to college, and even now I‚Äôve only ever told one person.

My dad has really grown as a person in the past two years. He‚Äôs started to actually adress his own mental health issues and actually accepts that he was abusive and wants to do better with my brother who is ten. He listens to me when I tell him not to do the shit he pulled when I was little to my brother. By all means he‚Äôs far from perfect but he‚Äôs much better than he was. Also my enabler mom has stepped up to the plate after all these years after I started my own journey with mental health last year and she realized that the way they raised me probably fucked me up a little. All this to say, my relationship with my parents is a lot better than it was. I still view my dad as an adult friend with a bunch of demons he‚Äôs working through rather than a father, but I care about him.

I wanna 1: talk to my therapist about all that, but my brother is still a minor and I don‚Äôt want my therapist to have to call CPS or anything. 
And 2: get closure by talking to my dad about this. I want to understand what happened. I want to stop feeling guilty. I want him to apologize. I want him to be more mature than he is capable of and actually own up to this. And I don‚Äôt know how to stop longing for him to actually be a father, rather than someone who just isn‚Äôt capable of anything but narcissistic pity parties. No matter how much he‚Äôs improved in the past two years I don‚Äôt think he can get over himself enough to stop dwelling on his own disappointment with himself to be a proper caring parent.

There's this Asian girl at work that I'm pretty sure flirts with me(lots of close proximity standing, touching, etc.). It doesn't matter that she's Asian but it kinda does. She's an immigrant and I'm kinda weary of reciprocating partly because of that, I don't want people to think I'm taking advantage of her, partly because it's a school job and I don't want to lose my only source of income, and partly because...

212,"Hopefully just writing everything out will help me, but if anyone can help me sort through my thoughts that would be great!
(This was my first year in cross country.)

Pros: XC is what broke me out of my shell and allowed me to make a lot of new friends.

Despite being a bad runner, meets were actually fun

Spaghetti dinners 

Just the feeling of being part of a team 

It's a pretty non-competitive sport (at the JV level at least)

Doing something outside my comfort zone and benefiting from it

I love being in shape

I'm proud of myself for doing this, and participating in one of the hardest sports there is (in my opinion)

Cons: I hate going to practice. It's early in the morning, they're always long, and it feels like I'm never away from it

It's very time-consuming, and next year I'll need all the time I can get

Summer practice starts in June this year. June!

I'm not a good runner and I don't take XC as seriously as a lot of people on the team (it's not super high on my list of priorities)

I think the head coach expects almost too much of a lot of us. Not everyone on the team is able to run at varsity level, and it shouldn't be a huge deal that not everyone wants to get on varsity 

..................................................................................

So basically I've learned that I really like my friends and being in shape, and the meets are kind of fun, but practices are long and give me anxiety, and it takes a lot of time. I think my problem is I don't want to leave the friends I've made, or lose that feeling of being a part of team, which is something I've never had, but I also don't want to go to practice or see the coach. I'm really conflicted, so any input is appreciated!

P.S: I may be influenced by one of my friends who is dropping XC and told me to consider it, but then again I've only done it for 1 year, she's been in it since middle school. But she brought up a lot of points I agreed with...But I still don't know! I don't want to make a decision I'll regret the rest if the year, but I'm running out of time to change my schedule for next year.

213,"Hallo everyone,

I am socially awkward and a bit oversensitive, so whenever I sense that other people try to hurt me, verbally degrade me and or/make me feel insecure about myself, I get really hurt for days, wondering what went wrong, if it's me, something that I did or said, my gestures and so on.

This week I have been in my hometown and hanging out with most of my closest friends, which made me feel loved and healed me completely. But in a couple of days I will come back to university for exams I will have to face people who have hurt me to the core and others who don't want any good for me but, in some sense, force me to interact with them anyway.

I don't feel secure around them, and going away is not an option. This can be from people I live with to others who study in my same hall or uni association. I have already tried to tell them that I don't have time for talking and/or busy with other stuff, but they get more defensive and ask people around if I have something against them.

I fear telling them to just stop talking to me because I don't want them to annoy or hurt my friends. I also have to deal with them in a daily or at least weekly basis, so I really don't want to deal with the anxiety thoughts of ""Are they going to be aggressive again? Are they going to tell me if I did something wrong?""

Any advice would be appreciated &lt;3

TL;DR: I don't feel comfortable around some people that come and talk to me, but afraid of telling them to stop because they get defensive and annoy people around.",13May2018,3
214," Hey all. I'm 29 years old and live in a small town. About 2000 people. Ive been working the same dead end maintenance job at a hotel now for the past 5 years. It's a seasonal job 6 months on and 6 months of EI benefits during the winter between off and on construction labor when there's work. Like I said it's a small town and almost entirely dependent on tourism season in the summer and the lobster fishery.  

Back in October my girlfriend of 3 years who I couldn't conceive not having in my life left me. All our plans and our future disappeared in an instant. So a long story short \- I moved back in with my parents for the winter and now it's May.

I'm severely depressed. Lacking any sense of purpose or meaning and I don't know what direction to go. I 100&amp;#37; believe that if it wasn't for Brazilian jiu Jitstu training that I would have offed myself by now. It's the only thing I have and I cling to it like a life raft.

I don't know how to make it better. But I feel like I need to leave or go very far away. Most people would probably love to me in my situation. Young, single, no ties and infinite possibilities. I also have a good chunk of savings at around 14K. I want to feel that way but I can't. Instead I feel dead inside.

I lack direction so badly. I know that one day i'll look back and hate myself for the things I didnt't do when I could.  Should I travel? Get a work visa? Go back to school? \(for what I don't know because I have zero passion\) Spend all my money til its gone then go out like a burning flame?

I hate life and the way its been since she left. I'm not going to do dead end work until im 65 and then retire. I'll end it today if someone showed me a crystal ball with that in my future. 

My mind is in the darkest place it's ever been. I never understood before how people who weren't  bad off on the outside could be so troubled and now I understand that the mind is the reality.

We're in college and this last semester she's become a HUGE know it all without the grades or academic record to back her up. I'm not really sure what made her this bad, but it's gotten to the point that every conversation that's happening she has to say something and almost prove her intelligence on every topic under the sun. 
Ex: my other friend and I are medically focused (I'm premed hopefully, the other girl pre-vet) and we were talking about our renal physiology Exam. The problem roommate is a art and communication major and she butts into our conversation to explain to us about how we pre a lot because there's too many proteins in our urine. First off, no. Absolutely not. But as we try to explain to her that that's not correct she keeps trying to say ""that's what my text book said"" and still pushing it. She doesn't handle conflict well and resorts to demeaning who ever questions her, yelling, and petty acts.
This is an innocent enough mistake to make, but it's like this on every topic and she has to answer everything by essentially citing her knowledge back to her school knowledge (again supersenior with a 2.9 GPA. Number don't make a person, just wanting to give all the into I can). 
Is there any way for me to hint that perhaps no one enjoys it when she behaves like that? Has anyone had this happen before?

219,"For the last two years, my mom has been operating under the assumption that our house is poisoned. She's absolutely convinced that my dad, my sister and I are all slowly dying as a result of being exposed to both diatomaceous earth (which we have explained to her on numerous occasions to be safe) and some kind of concrete sealant powder that we've had stored in our basement for ten years. She also has a whole medley of other convictions, including but not limited to:

* We ourselves are tracking this stuff out of the house, which has now resulted in the death of two of our neighbors and my mother's doctor (who did actually die, but obviously weren't killed by us)
* Our house being filled with recording devices
* Our phones and computers being compromised
* Law enforcement being somehow aware of this whole situation (but for some reason not acting on it? I don't entirely understand what's going on here)
* There's some conspiracy to take all of our money being orchestrated by one of our neighbors
* She is convinced, in addition to whatever damage has already been done by the poison, both she and I have some kind of autoimmune disorder

I could go on and on and on - it changes every time I talk to her. She's also attempted to kill herself three times in the last year or so, and while she will go to the psychiatric ward at the hospital for a short period of time, they don't have any reason to keep her beyond that, and she'll just revert to her old self shortly after coming home. The heart of the issue, though, is that she obviously refuses to admit that anything she's said could be inaccurate and refuses any sort of psychiatric help. She believes the *rest* of the family are the ones that are wrong and spends her entire day online reading about new ailments that we could have succumbed to. She regularly comes to my dad or I with tests she thinks can determine whether or not their house is dangerous or whether we're sick, but when the results come back negative, she always finds an excuse to explain why the tests weren't valid. It's sort of an endless money pit, and I've stopped doing them because it's a waste of both my time and money. Every test she finds is ""the test that we've been looking for all this time"" that is the be all/end all, and every time we do it and the results come back, she claims it was the wrong test or that the results were sullied by some outside force.

It's worth noting that I live on the other side of the country, so I'm not actually there to help at all, and both my dad and my sister are pretty thoroughly exhausted at this point. We're pretty much out of ideas, since most things involve her taking some initiative or admitting that something she said could possibly be wrong, which she refuses to do.

We're pretty much at our wits end - has anyone got any ideas as to what we could possibly do?

221,"As a SAHM , it‚Äôs been hard finding sincere, good mama friends. I thought I had finally found one, we share many similar interests, kids the same age, and we seemed to bond quickly over some personal things we both were going through with extended family. 
At the same time, this friend was part of another ‚Äúfriend group‚Äù who are just not my style (nor am I theirs- I‚Äôve tried connecting with them before I met my friend, and it was just mutually not working, no biggie).
Anyway, I planned a big event with several of our mutual friends and our families. I did this several months ahead of time , and my friend rsvp‚Äôd and said she was free and would be there. 
Literally, a few days before the event , she lets me know, she made an error and confused dates with my event and a baby shower ( of one of the ladies in her other friend group). This really hurt because I know she didn‚Äôt confuse dates, the baby shower was recently planned, and clearly she just decided to ditch my event. 
I‚Äôm not just speculating, I know through mutual friends my event was planned before this baby shower, so it double hurt that she not only essentially chose this other friend group over me, but that she lied to me. I thought we were better friends then that.
Since then, my friend has been clearly feeling guilty , and trying to overcompensate for dissing me.. I appreciate the gesture in a way, as I feel it shows that she does value our friendship. However, I feel disenchanted with her as this situation has caused me to see her ‚Äútrue side‚Äù, and looking back on past times she‚Äôs flaked our on plans with me, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because she decided to do something instead with her ‚Äúother group‚Äù
I honestly am not a poessive friend and was fine with her having other friends ( I do as well), but I‚Äôm not ok with realizing I‚Äôm second best. I realize I mistakenly thought we had a closer friendship then we really did.
My problem now is, she‚Äôs really acting odd. Like one minute she‚Äôs literally ditching me, next minute she‚Äôs like telling me I‚Äôm her closest friend. 
After all this, I‚Äôm pretty disenchanted with this friendship, because as an adult and a mom , I truly only have time to have good, loyal and honest friends in my life. 
 I feel like I‚Äôve accepted that she and I will just be casual friends from now on, and don‚Äôt want to emotionally invest in this relationship any further. 
But she keeps pursing me, then running hot and cold. I feel like she kind of ruined things and don‚Äôt want to put in the same effort wth her.
Am I being unfair ? I can‚Äôt really understand why she‚Äôs trying so hard, whether it‚Äôs just guilt on her part or if she genuinely wants to be close friends..

up until freshman year, my life was quite normal. i had only one friend named peterkin, but he was usually made fun of for being overweight. couldn't do anything about it, really. in freshman year, i started to make friends with the more well-known/""popular"" (not in cliche high school movies type popular, but you get it) group, and peterkin was quite upset about that considering they bully him quite often. now that i think about it, i shouldn't even be near those fuckers. anyway, i have bulimia and i've lost twenty pounds over the last few months. i don't look like a human skeleton, but skinny enough for people to ask. i've gotten caught vomiting in school before by a guy in his junior year, who gives me the creeps. most people in this school who are older than the freshmen aren't particularly fond of the freshmen, and always ask of this person is a freshman or not before dismissing them if they are. they usually find us immature. i don't blame them, haha. so, when this junior, lets call him douglas, asked me if i was a freshman, i just responded with 'i'm a ralph.' (which is my name, if you haven't noticed my username.) he apparently liked my answer, and basically kept me and his fucking pet for the rest of the year. well in reality, we dated, but it felt like i was his pet. some people told me he seemed abusive, by the way one time in a party he lit a lighter and burned my arm slightly and tried to light, what i think is a cigarette with it. it was incredibly painful. he'd beat me up sometimes, but i guess i deserve it. anyway, back to the point the i was friends with the more well known crowd. the alpha male of this large group, lets call him jack, always seemed to be quite rude to everyone except me. i figured out why he did this, it was because he wanted me to stay  the group just because i had attractive hair. he knew i would leave if he treated me badly. we once fought when he beat up some kid named daniel, and i told him that he was lucky that none of the people he was hurt physically or verbally have committed suicide. who knew, a month after the same kid, daniel, kills himself. jack blames it on himself, and is still popular but yet alot more quiet than usual. i also blamed it on jack until i found out from douglas that doug actually was texting daniel for a while, actually sending him texts such as ""you should die."" ""if you want to die, just do it already."" and shit like that. he did this because he wanted me out of jack's clique, hoping i would think it's jack. he spilled the beans when he saw me crying on the ground. oh, and, forgot to mention about doug, he probably sexually assualts me on the daily, by the way he fucking touches me when i go to his house or when he go to the forest together. he always has to tell me, 'oh come on, i'm not gonna kill ya' just to keep me still. the only time sexual assault/rape/date rape has really affected me was at prom, when a sophomore girl i didnt even know that well date raped me. it was traumatic. my freshman year is close to being over, and im just scared sophomore year is just gonna get worse. is this normal? advice?

229,"So I (22f) am just about to graduate college with a BA in English and Sociology, and I've never really had a job. This is mostly due to having really bad social anxiety until about 2 years ago and living in a country where college is free and living at home so there wasn't too much pressure. That being said, over the last 2 years, I've probably applied to a 100 or so part time/ summer jobs and never got an interview (though I did get a paid internship last summer). I know I fucked myself when I was 17 by choosing this useless degree, and I'm not expecting a great job or anything, but I'd like to work somewhere. Not really sure where to start, but I thought I'd write to some temp agencies and try to get some receptionist or call center work. The problem is, there's basically nothing on my resume to talk about and I feel like I have no skills whatsoever. It really stresses me out. Even if I got an interview, what would I talk about? Does anyone have advice for padding out a resume? Or any other tips and tricks? I feel so useless and barely adult, right now. ",13May2018,3
231,"Hey all. 

So this is what I am currently going through and I appreciate any advice/criticism.

I have a degree in production and have been working in my field for the past four years. In these past few years I‚Äôve gotten work experience inside and outside of my job. I did a lot of freelance for a time. (Weddings, commercials, photo shoots) 

My job was so close to my parents house that after college I moved back home to save money as I worked. My family is great and I have no complaints.

Here is where I‚Äôve become unhappy. 

After four years, I‚Äôve completely fallen out of love with my career. I took a year off to see if it was just burnout from my freelance work but even after a year I just don‚Äôt want to do it anymore. At my job, I feel unfulfilled at times. It‚Äôs not the hardest job. Pays $12 an hour for 40 hours with benefits. So I can‚Äôt say I haven‚Äôt been blessed for that much.

I feel like there is no room for promotion and even if I did get promoted I probably still wouldn‚Äôt be happy. Maybe I could go elsewhere and try to eat paid more but I just feel like this isn‚Äôt for me. Maybe it was when I was young but now I just want something that will make me happy.

I don‚Äôt want to be inside a cubicle all day. I fell in love with film as a kid but making it my career as soured it. I don‚Äôt want to make enteric car commercials and deal with clients anymore. It‚Äôs not fun like it used to be.

I put myself out there a couple times romantically in my current area and being in this area hurts me now. I can‚Äôt stop being reminded constantly that I am alone. I would really like to try a new area.

Lastly, I‚Äôve been wanting to go back to school for a masters degree. I was considering something in social work or higher education with college students as a counselor. I did some work in college as a resident assistant and I enjoyed working on a team and helping people.

Here is where I ask for advice. Sorry for the rant but I want you to understand the backstory first.

1) Should I apply for a job in my current career for more money in a new location while searching for a graduate program? 

2) Should I apply for a graduate program first then find a job in that area in any career while I go to school?

3) Find a higher paying job in my current career and see if I feel more fulfilled based on my higher pay and new location?

Like I said, I appreciate any advice and criticism. I just need someone to talk and I‚Äôve been almost stuck frozen with indecision and I just need to get moving. 

Sorry if formatting or grammar was an issue. I am on mobile and did the best I can. 

Hope you all have a nice day. üòá",13May2018,3

233,"Hello reddit. 

I am someone who is unfortunately very unsure of myself, always second guessing myself, and a pushover. However, I recently noticed something at my library I felt was alarming and brought it to the attention of the supervisor at the library. I'm going to copy and paste my email here \(with identifying information redacted obviously\), and I just wanted to get your views. Did I make the right choice in bringing this behavior to the supervisor? 

Subject: Extreme concern about an \[sic, yes I made that typo lol\] student employee's repeated behavior at the library

Dear \[supervisor name\]:

¬† ¬† ¬†Hello, my name is \[redacted\], and I am a \[my affiliation with my university\]. I am writing to you now because I was referred to you by a student at the circulation desk at the library so that I may relay a serious¬†concern I have to you about¬†someone I believe is¬†an employee at the circulation desk, because I have seen him work there.¬† 

¬† ¬† ¬†This individual is constantly arguing with someone on the \[area of the\] library near the front desk, and this has occurred at least a few dozen times. It is extremely disturbing to me and to other students and several peers of mine have taken notice and are concerned. He often expresses extreme rage and anger, yelling on the phone, complete with an entire bevy of swear words. After every one of his arguments, he begins hitting himself on the head really angrily. Not only is his behavior alarming, but the content of his recent conversations are also cause for concern. The first time I noted his behavior was in November 2016, and I was so alarmed that I alerted a security guard about it. It is somehow still going on. Some snippets from his arguments I have heard recently include:

""I'm going to do something drastic.""¬†

""I'm going to take incredibly drastic action.""¬†

""Fuck you fuck you fuck you.""¬†

""I'm going to go to his office and put it into his head."" \(I did not catch what ""it"" was referring to, but he was extremely angry and animated as he said this so I am frightened to find out\).¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†The content of his arguments are frequently very vulgar and have recently become violent in nature. It is extremely disruptive to my and other students' studies, and I believe any reasonable person who after seeing this consistently disturbing behavior would be concerned. He frequently yells on the phone as well as with another female student, who is¬†potentially his girlfriend. This individual appears \[I give a very detailed description of the individual, would be impossible not to identify him with all this information\]. 

¬† ¬† ¬†I also wish to remain anonymous if possible. This is not an individual I would want knowing my identity or knowing¬†that I have brought these issues to your attention. Based on the consistent pattern of angry outbursts and violent content of his conversations, I strongly believe that this individual may need intensive counseling before it becomes too late. If not, I fear the worst.¬†

Please let me know if there is anything else I may do.

Sincerely,

\[my name\]",13May2018,3

236,"Hey guys, I don‚Äôt know what to do or even how I should feel about the situation I‚Äôm in right now with the person I considered to be my ride-or-die best friend. So, for background, this guy has been my best friend since senior year of high school and I met him at a difficult time (my first heartbreak) and what drew me to him at a time that I really did not want to interact with people was that he was perceptive of my emotions and succeeded in making me smile and, after a period of time, be overall happy again. Fast forward a year and a half, we‚Äôve now left high school and are working for the same company. The transition out of high school was rough for me as I didn‚Äôt want to work, I just really wanted to be able to go to college. This led to me developing anxiety and depression (diagnosed) and he was the first person I told. Ever since then, I‚Äôve needed him a lot more and this relationship has turned unhealthy. I get angry at him for things that I would have laughed off a year ago and I‚Äôve realized that I don‚Äôt make him laugh anymore and he looks like he‚Äôs miserable whenever he‚Äôs hanging out with me. On top of that, I feel like I‚Äôve been becoming less and less receptive to him. For example, whenever he talks about something he‚Äôs really excited about, I space out and just bob my head passively. I used to call him occasionally while having anxiety attacks and he‚Äôs (respectfully) asked me to find another friend to deal with that as he didn‚Äôt want our friendship to be so negative. As well, I have frequent full blown panic attacks at work and he‚Äôs come to straight up pretend like they aren‚Äôt happening. He‚Äôs indirectly advised me to quit my job because it‚Äôs negatively impacting on him (he‚Äôs a manager and he feels he‚Äôs been put in a trying position with me as his employee) which hurt my feelings a lot as I‚Äôve always seen him as my best friend over my ‚Äúboss‚Äù and he‚Äôs made it clear that he doesn‚Äôt. But the thing that made me seek advice is that yesterday, I realized he had blocked me from seeing his stories on instagram and have been posting about radiating positivity, not having time for others‚Äô problems, one sided friendships, etc. Right now I‚Äôm just extremely hurt but also really mad at myself because I know I‚Äôm not the victim here. But I don‚Äôt know what I should do the next time I see him. A part of me wants to be angry with him and cry and try to get him to understand that he‚Äôs hurt me in a time that I really needed him and reiterate that it‚Äôs hard for me to be positive and not have problems because of my mental health but a more logical part wants to show him the positivity he wants to see, even if I‚Äôm faking it because I‚Äôm tired of trying to get him to understand and be there for me when he clearly either: doesn‚Äôt want to or doesn‚Äôt know how to. This would also mean giving up on him being my best friend which would break my heart. We‚Äôre both going back to school next year and I was so excited for us and we‚Äôve planned our classes together and are in the same major so I‚Äôll probably see a lot of him down the road. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I apologize that this was so long. I‚Äôd talk to people in my personal life about this but I‚Äôve slowly shut out the remainder of my inner circle through my journey with depression and anxiety and currently have nobody but him. Should I try to be the friend he wants to be and keep my feelings to myself? Am I a really bad person/friend? ",13May2018,1

241,"Hello reddit peeps.

I need some advice.  I'm a 36M and have been living with my partner (38F) for 11 years.  Throughout the time we've lived together, my partner has suffered from a series of physical and mental health issues.  I've always been able to support her, but for the past year or so, it has become really very hard for me to keep going with it.

The complicated bit is that I have recently found myself to be completely in love with my partner's Niece (18F).  I don't have any sexual feelings towards her, but we just get on really well and she's like a breath of fresh air.  I feel like I've got my spirit back and I'm feeling great about myself.  We're in touch very frequently and I get a real buzz whenever I hear from her, but I also get extremely depressed whenever I don't hear from her for a while.

Complicating factors further, my partner and I are helping her Niece through some really challenging life stuff at the moment, so we see her pretty much every other weekend.  Each time I see her, it's fantastic - we constantly laugh and joke and we share many common interests.  Naturally, the feelings get magnified, but my subsequent depression also gets more intense.

My partner and I are very open and honest with each other.  She knows everything that I've written here.

I'm stuck to know what to do, though.  I think I would find it easiest to massively reduce contact with the Niece, but it might cause her a lot of distress and I don't want to be unavailable to her during this challenging time in her life.  On the other hand, I am finding it increasingly difficult to deal with the emotions and the associated sadness  - it's making me feel very distressed and I have had some thoughts of running away or worse.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance!

TL;DR:  I'm in love with close family member of my long-term partner.  I can't tell her and I can't cut her out of my life.  Struggling to cope with the emotions.",13May2018,1

My 18th birthday is in a few weeks and in partial substitiutes to gifts my parents are thankfully offering to give me ¬£1000 ($1350) to ""commemorate"" this coming of age. Whilst it is tempting to splash out on clothes and nights out, I was more hoping to use this money to possibly invest and generate further earnings. However I'm still aware there sadly is no such thing as a get rich quick scheme, I do have a long summer before university coming up so time consuming tasks are thankfully not an issue.

I am not looking for any significantly long term investments as it can be difficult to do so with just ¬£1000 although I'm open to suggestions. How should I go about spending this money to perhaps multiply my bucks?

247,"Yo guys, 21 M here 

Over the past year I had a nicely going relationship, however in november a friend of mine admitted that my gf was cheating on me. She felt like she had to tell me since I was such a nice guy and didn't deserve it. I broke up with my gf. When I told her that I had known it, she just freaked out about me complaining and insulted me, trying to justify her cheating on me. 

Then some time passed and in April I got close to a girl I had known for some time. We never came to have a relationship but we were certainly really close to each other, kissed, made out etc. She always told me that she liked me a lot, so I was figuring out that it was just a matter of time to make it official since I was really into her too and we were spending so much time together.

Everything was just fine. She then however went to Spain for a week and came back with a damn boyfriend. That hurt a lot since I was still revocering from my ex cheating on me. 

So there I am. According to many people, a handsome guy, always a smile on his face, very funny, very nice and a guy everyone would like to basically hang out with. But I gotta be honest with you. I lost my smile due to these incidents. I just keep asking me why I should keep on trying to do this, if it's just gonna backfire on me again.

I am not suicidal or anything like that, don't worry. I definitely want to change my life and not end it. That won't help me a bit.

I don't know if I should tell him how worried I am about his personality or if I should just send him a good link so he becomes interested.

So my question is: How directly should I express my thoughts and why I want him to read about development? I'm afraid that he will push it away and doesn't wanna hear about it, though with the correct words he is definitely capable of becoming interested.

We were slowly getting closer and closer (she didn't know anything explicit about me liking her) and it culminated in a night where we were both drunk at a little party at her place; she started to overtly hit on me, trying to cuddle with me and generally acting like someone who wants to fuck. I'm 100% sure I could've fucked her this night if I played my cards right, but I'm a little bitch so I didn't really make an attempt to escalate. Mistake #1.

It was on this night my suspicion was confirmed that she was dtf, and obviously attracted to my personality.

Out of excitement, I made the mistake of telling this news to my friend, who told the girl. Mistake #2. I'm a rookie, I know. 

The next time I saw her she acted weird and distant. 

She was also displaying some of the same behavior that made me know she wanted it to this other guy in our group, but not all of it; the flirty physical contact was there, and the special attention, but not the genuine laughter real engagement in their conversation. I know her well enough and have seen her with enough guys she doesn't actually like to know she wasn't really into it.

Anyway, I asked her what was up, she told me she knew I liked her and didn't wanna give off the wrong impression, and I said alright that's fine, let's be friends (I meant it), and she agreed. 

The next time I saw her she acted the same way as before to me, always engaged in whatever I was saying, sideways glances at me, giving me special attention, asking small favors, etc. The other guy was now getting the cold shoulder, more or less.

What should I make of this?",13May2018,3
255,"I don't have a problem with people cursing around me. My issue is that I can't curse in regular conversation. I can think of a variety of words to describe things, so I don't see the need to curse. Even typing curse words seens hard for me to do. People who know me seem to have this perception that I'm super innocent because I don't engage in raunchy dialogue. I feel that if I spot out one curse word, people would look at me in a funny. Personally, I like the way I speak, however I want to allow myself to curse. Times where I've almost cursed are when I hurt myself by accident, or when I forget an important item at home.

257,"So maybe this is a partial excuse for everything I am about to say, or maybe not, but-- I did not win the genetic lottery. I'm in my 30's now and have the disposable income to spend on hair, clothes, makeup, and the occasional minor cosmetic procedure, but I spent most of my life being teased, stared at, fielding snarky/backhanded comments, and generally being treated like a lesser human due to my looks. 

I also used to be significantly more overweight than I am now, and when I was at my heaviest I was also deeply involved with the theater arts in the city I went to college in. I can't tell you how many variations I heard of ""you're really talented, but you're not going to get any good parts due to your looks/weight."" I was basically ostracized by the theater community, was subjected to a LOT of mean-girl bullshit, more attractive/less talented girls getting parts I wanted, etc. Eventually I moved away, lost the weight, and I rarely did theater again after that-- it just brought up too many painful memories.

What's fucked up is that the girl this post is about was NOT one of the mean ones. To be honest, I didn't really know her that well, but my interactions with her were always positive and she seemed like a nice person. She was also smoking hot and enjoyed all the popularity and privilege that goes along with that. 

Fast forward ten years, and I started noticed posts on social media about how she was battling some type of cancer. I looked at her page, and sure enough-- she'd lost all her hair, had put on a significant amount of weight, and her face/body was covered in sores and burns from the treatment. In short, she was totally unrecognizable. 

And did I feel sympathy for her? Nope. Not one bit. All I could think was ""good, now you know how it feels to be ugly."" Ever since then I've been following her page just so I can amuse myself by seeing how horrible she looks now. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. I know it's fucked up. But I can't change how I feel. Am I a total piece of shit or what? ",13May2018,0

259,"She has complained to me that he wants to have sex with her and has a crush on her, so last night I asked if he had tried anything recently. She told me no, but that they casually make out sometimes, and that he asks ""You really don't feel anything?"" and she just says no, she doesn't. Really makes you wonder why he feels things for her, or wants to take things a step further.   

I think it's really shitty to tell a person that has expressed their feelings towards you what she told me, but perhaps I am being dramatic. I just think she is looking for attention, or is completely oblivious and selfish when it comes to others' emotions. I'm not sure which. I just feel really sad about the whole ordeal - not jealous, but it makes me feel small, and sad that one of my close friends has such disregard for both my and her other friend's feelings towards her.

260,"TL;DR: Pretty much the title.  I need some advice on how to broach this with him and voice my concerns ASAP because I'm becoming very concerned for his safety.  Details below.

My dad (66 years old) was in a nasty car accident when he was younger which, according to my mother, impacted the way he drives.  I have always known him to be a cautious driver, slower than most others on the road, and when I was younger I can remember a few times where he's either been honked at aggressively, flipped off, or a combination of both.  As I grew older and began driving myself, I naturally became more attentive of his habits when he's driving, which are useful details because he lives in NJ where this kinda stuff doesn't fly - he goes significantly lower than the speed limit in the middle or passing lanes of highways, doesn't always use his signal when he's changing lanes or turning, accelerates and merges with no sense of urgency, and stops for yellow lights.  I suspect that he is not always aware of his surroundings or as attentive as required when he's behind the wheel, or that he assumes that everybody else on the road drives like he does.  A few years ago, he slammed on his brakes for a yellow light which caused a tractor trailer behind him to do the same and we were almost rear-ended.  As you can imagine, the driver was not happy and as he passed the car, he let my dad know that in no uncertain terms.

He did not even know that he almost caused this accident. This led to a very difficult conversation with my father where I told him that his driving style is not conducive to safety and basically said that he's expected keep up with the flow of traffic and behave the same as the drivers around him - and if he can't, then to stay as far right as humanly possible.  Seems he heeded my advice (some time passed before I rode in the car with him again) as he stays to the right on highways, but there have been at least two other incidents that I am aware of.  Once he was verbally accosted in a CVS when he arrived there by another motorist (who he apparently didn't notice on the road) who suggested he ""reconsider the way he drives before he gets someone killed"" and more recently on the road he had an encounter with a driver who was speeding, pulled around him then slammed on his brakes.  I suspect my dad cut this guy off, because as he put it, ""he came out of nowhere"".

These kind of things don't happen to everyone, and the fact that his driving is bringing out this behavior in other motorists is concerning as I'm really starting to worry that it's only a matter of time before there is an accident or a physical encounter with another driver.  The timing of this is bad too, as he is preparing to  receive treatment for prostate cancer.  I tried going through my mom on this a few days ago after he told me the more recent story, but since it's mother's day weekend I didn't want to push it.  She also said something even more concerning, in that his mind is probably elsewhere due to everything he has going on.  In my opinion, he shouldn't be on the road AT ALL if he's not going to mentally be in his car.

I am going to be getting him a dash cam for protection just in case anything happens, but obviously this won't stop something else from happening.  How do I tell my dad that I feel his driving is deteriorating and could be putting him in danger?

Thank you.",13May2018,2

I had told him that if he would get help I would be with him forever and he said he didn't want that and seems so happy with this new girl.

I have three really close friends we'll call them Jeff, Margo and Tom.

Jeff graduated college and has done nothing towards using his degree for anything. He spends time making Let's Plays.

Margo has never been to college and spends all of her money and free time on video games (I play games too but not all the time).

Tom dropped out of college and washes dishes. He thinks the only thing that matters in life is working and doesn't see any point in moving around/doing something you enjoy. Those are his words, not mine.

I don't hate them, I still care about them but I'm having a hard time relating to them anymore. I don't think it's invalid for them to feel the way the way they feel; there isn't a right way to live your life and I don't look down on them for their choices.

274,"So we've been together for over 5 years now, on and off a couple times. Met my boyfriend when he was barely making it by (living at his parents house making a couple hundred a week). I'm not materialistic and the fact that he barely had anything to his name never fazed me. Never gave it a second thought. He's gotten promotions at his job to where now we are living comfortably. Although he is miserable at his job working about 60 hours a week. I've tried to help him find another job, work on his resume, and I'm currently looking for second job to secure a career in my field and help make up for income so he can step down. 

We got into an argument about the lifestyles we want. Again I'm not materialistic and hardly ever buy things for myself. Havent stepped into a mall or payed full price for clothes in years. Any clothes or things for myself have either been passed down from family or bought from good will. As any human being, one would be worried with having to change budget and simplify lifestyle. Im all for it. 

I simply stated I want to be able to not have to live paycheck to paycheck. As we are currently doing. I want to be able to not have to feel guilty for buying myself something if I want, once in a blue moon (I've been wanting to buy a $40 blender for months now off Let Go or Offer Up, nothing major). This blew up into an argument about how I'm ""trying to keep up with the joneses"" and everyone lives paycheck to paycheck and what I want is unrealistic. I disagreed and said it is attainable. He replied with ""well if thats what you want you dont have to be with me"". 

Im so hurt over this. It makes me feel as if to him im just disposable. How is it so easy for you to say something like that. As if take it or leave it and if you dont like it go move on with your life. I just moved in a couple weeks ago to the dismay of my family. And I feel so hurt by his comment. 

Mind you I was cooking a nice meal for us while this was being discussed and I was so taken aback by his comment I just up and left to go to the park to calm down and sort my feelings.

280,"This year, my class and I have been preparing for our AP Language exam with the help of one of the greatest teachers we've ever had. He has, in fact, been nominated for our state's teacher of the year and made it down to the top 10 nominees, and it's understandable in why he has.

He's had a deep impact on all of us- he puts his hard work and time into teaching us; not just for the exam, but for critical thinking skills, analysis, creativity, and so much more. Sometimes it feels like he's more of a mentor, an older brother, or even a father. He looks after each and every single one of us, he's able to banter with us, he knows how to interact and change his attitude with different students (he's the teacher sponsor for the fishing club and the literary magazine). 
He's even shared a very personal story with us about his years as a teenager and his family to help us understand that certain decisions could have a dire consequences (I'd prefer to not post his story online. Even with the anonymity, it was truly meaningful and I'm not ashamed to say the I and several others did shed some tears..) 

Some friends and I have been dwelling on what to give him as a present (more sentimental than expensive), and we have decided to give index cards to his students in each period, write down a note to him, and put it in a photo album. We were going to get him a mug, but a ""#1 Teacher"" mug seems kind of cheesy and meaningless. I don't know if he would appreciate the thought, and I'm actually just curious as to what most teachers would appreciate receiving as a present from his students.

I've got a partial list of things I was considering here:

* Make sure the apartment is completely clean (as clean as any place with a cat can be, anyway).
* Stock the fridge and pantry with some homemade easy-to-microwave nutritious foods and basics that I know he likes so he doesn't have to worry about groceries for a few days.
* Be there at the airport to help him get his luggage.
* Add fresh coffee beans from his favorite supplier to his coffee stock (packaged separately, naturally) so he can power through the jet lag.

295,"Hey all, rising-junior in college here. I need advice for a problem I feel I can't approach anyone else with.

So, there's this girl I'm dating. Let's call her Ridhi. This is our third time trying to date. The first time lasted three weeks, the second two months, and the third one is two weeks and going. 

She's a really excellent human being. She is the closest I've ever been to someone who's not my brother. I think I've been at my most vulnerable around her, and no one else has ever seen this side of me. The only person who has ever seen me cry in four years has been her. She knows nearly everything about me, and I know most everything about her, strengths and weaknesses and all. When she's not around, I feel a small feeling at the back of my head saying ""man, I wish Ridhi were here right now."" Our friendship is deep, and built on a lot of investment. 

My big issue though is I don't know if I'm actually in love, or even romantically attracted to her. What I feel toward her is difficult to articulate. On one hand, I've never trusted anyone as much as I trust her. I recognize in her the qualities that I find attractive in a girl. And those seem to be the requisite ideas that contribute to our traditional definition of ""love."" But much of my love for her in the romantic, ideal-wife sense is a little ""detached"" from how I actually feel. I mean that in the sense that those thoughts don't connect to produce a fiery love for her. 

An instance of this that pains me to even type out is that I can't see myself having sex with her. For reference, I am a Catholic who (hopes) to save myself for marriage. She's Hindu, and she has the same views on sex as I do. But I'm troubled though that I don't even have the desire to have sex with her. Don't get me wrong, I find her physically attractive and very pretty. But I don't feel that recognition of her prettiness ""translating"" with a desire for her physically. 

To put it another way, during the two months we were together, we never kissed. Not for lack of trying. I tried once during a movie at the beginning of our relationship, and she told me (gently) that she wanted her first kiss to be with the man who she knows she would marry. This didn't bother me at all because I knew she is a very socially conservative person. In fact, the thought of kissing her actually vanished in the remaining two months we were together. Most of what we did physically was hold hands or hug. This didn't bother me at all at the time. But that bothers me now because what if we are just best friends who hold hands? I don't know if that's something I should be worried about. 

To top it off, there's a second girl (let's call her Elly) I dated shortly after breaking up with Ridhi after our second go at it. And Elly's someone who I feel a passion for that extends beyond lust. She has roughly the same effect on me as Ridhi. By same effect, I'm referring to vulnerability and level of comfort. Elly is kind, loving, beautiful, and an all-around empathetic and understanding person. I broke it off with Elly when Ridhi and I had a stars-aligning talk in which we both discovered a whole new realm of vulnerability we've never experienced with each other. This experience led to us thinking that maybe the third time will be different since we're now much more vulnerable with each other. So I sat Elly down and told her I couldn't continue our proto-relationship because it wouldn't be fair to her for me to have feelings for another while dating her. She was crest-fallen, but understanding. We're still very good friends after the fact. 

I am extremely close with Ridhi. I consider her, at the bare minimum, one of my best friends. But I don't know if the feelings I feel for her come more from a romantic sense or a friend sense. The trouble here also is that the big difference is that I feel a passion for Elly I don't feel exactly with Ridhi. It almost feels like my thoughts of attraction toward Elly and how I actually feel are connected; while with Ridhi, those thoughts are disconnected with how I actually feel toward her. 

I hate that I feel this way because Ridhi is a wonderful person. I hate how I don't feel as strongly toward her as she feels toward me. And I hate how gray this whole situation is and this feeling that I'm being a terrible person. Because this sort of behavior is something members of my family -- who are all divorced and have engaged in infidelity -- would do. I don't want to break anyone's heart or take part in behavior that will hurt others. 

To conclude, the fundamental question I'd like your input on is whether or not the feelings I feel toward Ridhi are in fact love, or just a very deep emotional connection with a close friend. For two weeks, my head has been wracked by guilt. I've prayed about the matter, but haven't consulted anyone about this matter. What should I do? 

**tl;dr - currently dating a girl who I have no idea if my strong feelings for her derive either from being extremely close friends with her or being romantically attracted to her. My thoughts about her being attractive don't ""translate"" to actually feeling a gut attraction to her. I don't even have a desire to have sex with her. But, regardless, I have a great fondness for her and wish to remain extremely close friends with her regardless of what happens. There's another girl who I briefly dated who I don't have this problem with. I feel a passion for her that is not chiefly motivated by lust. She is a lovely, caring, and kind person who I can talk to for hours. I feel horrible about this situation and that I'm a terrible person. Please help.**

296,"I've always been someone who gets attached to people very quickly and cares about them more than I probably should. For a while I always thought of this as a positive quality, but I don't know anymore. I find that loving people with all my heart, platonically and not, just leads to me getting hurt. I find a part of myself still even caring for people who have hurt me long ago or friends I haven't been close to in years. I don't want to stop caring for people completely, but I'd like to learn how to not get so attached to people and love them so intensely. It's hard always feeling like you're  the one who cares about and loves someone more. ",13May2018,5
297,"When I was in highschool i used to be a very laid back student. I mostly got mediocre scores but occasionally I would do well in some of my classes. 

When I was accepted into a university, I got so motivated to change my ways and get better grades. I did very well during the first two years of college. I earned high recognitions in all of my semesters. I thought I was doing well.

I am now on my third year in college and everything just went shitty. I couldn't understand anything. Most of the time, I'd study really really hard only to barely pass an exam. It's really disappointing. And it really gets to me. All of my efforts go to waste and I don't know how to deal with it. Now I've no more motivation to study. Studying used to be relaxation for me, but now it's just another chore. Now i just want to stay at home with the rest of my family. How do i get back on my feet? How do i get motivated again?

300,"So, I have thick thighs. Even when I was skinny, I still carried weight in my thighs and ass, and I alllllways get the notorious chub rub. For that reason, I often wear leggings and yoga pants for the sake of comfort and ease.

However, my pairs never last me more than a couple of months. The material wears through between my thighs and I end up with holes in them along the seams on the inner thigh. This happens with jeans too although it takes a lot longer with the denim than with fabric of leggings and yoga pants.

I'd love any suggestions for any brands\-\-or even better materials vs others\-\-of yoga pants and leggings that will last me a little longer.

Obviously that's shite and I want to be able to cry, but that mental block always stops me when I'm on the edge of crying. I've been to 4 family members funerals and not once did I cry. I felt the urge to but that mental block was stopping me, movies that were really beautiful and/or really hit home for me, again, gave me the urge to cry, but I just couldn't. I think the most I managed to get was a single tear at the end of watching A Silent Voice, and that was when I was really trying to. I guess what I'm saying is does anyone else have this issue?

303,"Ok, holy fuck. THE weirdest shit ever happened to me today while at a casino.

Im at a casino playing virtual baccarat (5 seats around a large screen) and a ~50 year old Japanese man was absolutely killing the game. He was at 2k while betting, at most, $25-$50/hand. 

I have no clue wtf happened with his calculations but he all of a sudden started hitting a terrible losing streak and ended up back down at 1k. 

*THIS IS WHERE SHIT GOT WEIRD AF*

Buddy was clearly upset during gameplay when he was losing bets, but by the time he was down to 1k he seemed oddly calm as his wife approached. HE PRESSES 'COLLECT' TO CASH THE TICKET OUT, IT PRINTS IN FRONT OF HIM, HE TURNS AROUND WITH HIS WIFE AND STRAIGHT UP STARTS WALKING AWAY.

Im still focused on the game but out of my periphery wondering why he hasnt taken his ticket yet. After 10 seconds, i finally raise my head to look around for why the fuck he hasnt taken his ticket for *ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS* and see that him and his wife have straight up taken off and are walking the fuck away. HOW DO YOU SEE YOU HAVE 1000, PRINT IT, AND WALK THE FUCK AWAY?

I instantly grab the ticket and start calling them back and they keep walking. I finally hit a light sprint to catch up and give it back. 


Did I do the right thing or am I a total fucking idiot? In the moment, it without hesitation seemed like the right thing to do...but now that Im home its all fucking hitting me like bricks. What if he left it for me? What if he just didnt care for the money? Should I have taken it? Literally, no one wouldve known if I had...i am now wondering if that was the universe dropping me a lifeline and i just fucking squandered it...

The wife was happy? and I *think* she said thank you, but buddy seemed almost totally unphased as he looked at the ticket. 

I mean, what the actual fuck. Beyond possible scenario fell into my hands and I think I may have totally dropped the ball...

TL;DR: some guy outright left $1000 on the table and almost left the casino and i ran him down to return it.",13May2018,1

So, to counter act the fact that I would literally chew my cheeks until they bled and swelled up, I started chewing gum. 

It worked amazingly. 

Until my jaw started hurting from chew gum up to 10 hours a day. Every day. 

So, I need an option to replace the gum with. Food isn't really an option because I work IT so I can't be pulling out sunflower seeds next to the machines. So they would have to be something like hard candies (but I also don't think I can carry an entire pocket full of 30 mints.)

308,"Back story:
So I graduated college last night and a bunch of my friends and I went out to the bars to celebrate. One friend is someone I happened to have a crush on since the beginning of college (I went after her a little when I first met her, but she didn‚Äôt seem interested so I accepted that we would just be friends and moved on). Every one has had a few drinks at this point and she drags me to the dance floor, shortly after we separate from the group to get another drink. I buy both of us drink, we talk a little bit and all of the sudden she leans in and we kiss. A lot. She says she want to go back to my place, so we do. 

Here‚Äôs where things go wrong:
The whole time I feel a little weird because we‚Äôve been good friends for four years and I feel like this could ruin our friendship if we both don‚Äôt want the same thing. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs looking for a one night stand or if she has feelings for me and wants something more. She climbs on top of me and I obliged, but she eventually caught on that I didn‚Äôt feel right and she grabbed her things and started to leave. I could tell she was upset, so I walked her home and said goodnight. When I got home I texted her to try to clear things up, but I didn‚Äôt get much out of her except for her telling me to figure out what I want. 

Here‚Äôs where I am stuck. I don‚Äôt really know what I want and I have a million ideas running of how to handle this situation but I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Even though he‚Äôs only a year older I always looked up to him a lot. He has a magnetic personality and is unafraid of looking like a total goon on stage; I give him a lot of credit for bringing me out of my shell and making me the outgoing person I am today.

313,"Background: I'm a middle class kid going to an expensive private school in DC. I'm here because of scholarships and loans. I live in a shitty apartment with 3 other kids-- all from rich families from the Northeast. 

I've been living with them for about a year, but lately, I've noticed that my mental health has been really poor and I think this is due to the strain I'm under while living with them. I work two jobs to support myself, I pay my own rent, and cover my own expenses. They, meanwhile, don't pay a dime for school, nor do they pay for rent or anything else. Two of them are given stipends from their parents ($10,000 twice a year), and the third has a platinum AmEx card in her dad's name for all of her expenses.

It's been really rough on me having to live in such close quarters to exorbitant wealth-- they are frequently not understanding of my inability to contribute to frivolous purchases (unnecessary furniture, eating out when I don't need to, etc), and the difference in my lifestyle seems to cause them either bitterness or anger. I'm not really sure why, since I'm the one that has to stand by and watch them spend more money than I'll likely ever be able to. 

So, my question is pretty simple. How do you all just deal with this shit? It's so tiring every day to listen to their conversations and hear them make small microaggressions toward me, their much poorer roommate. I feel like I'm living on a different planet than them, and it's getting really hard for me to handle the stress it causes, since it's happening in my home environment. 

I've tried branching out, but I feel like a Lone Ranger because everyone in my school comes from a very wealthy background. There is a big culture of shame regarding poor kids here, so it's hard to find people like me. ",13May2018,3

After him I met another guy (call him MT) was with him for almost a year, didn‚Äôt really keep up how long I was with him. But MT &amp; I got married and that lasted for about 6 months because found out he knocked up another girl along with me, I had MT‚Äôs baby as well (2nd kid is 1 now). I met my now ex-bf (call him WD) 8 months after my last ex, he was amazing the entire relationship and due to my insecurities I didn‚Äôt think he was being faithful because he looked like the kind of white guy out of a magazine, but 6 years older than I am. Salt and peppered hair, just dreamy looking. Any ways, I fucked up by still talking to the guys I met on tinder before I met him, after he already asked me to be his girlfriend and I agreeing. I don‚Äôt know what it was that had me keep around said tinder guys because I never felt like I was ever wanted physically wise growing up, I was always the 90-95lb skinny toothpick looking girl. After having my 2nd kid I went right back to being under 100lbs. But started gaining weight three months after having her because I worked two jobs, and ate nothing but fast food. So I got weight in all the right areas. I was more confident in myself than I ever had been in my entire life. I guess I didn‚Äôt want to stop talking to the said tinder guys because I liked the attention I was getting, being told how beautiful and pretty I was. Knowing I was wanted by other people and not just my ex.

And he blew up again about it, but still always took me back. I did eventually stop talking to them but he was already at his point to where he couldn‚Äôt be with me anymore so he finally ended things, I moved out of our apartment and back into my mom‚Äôs place. With my kids and I‚Äôm in the middle of still getting out of all my stuff from his place and for the past week or almost two weeks we‚Äôve been hooking up every other day and finally got into an argument Saturday or Friday night because he asked me to go over and I complied, but he kept saying how it was a mistake and every time I kept trying to show him affection he‚Äôd tell me to stop and push me away, I was at the point to already being teary-eyed and wanting to leave because of his facial expression even seemed to be regretting that I was there. And him denying my affection. So I tried again right before leaving to hug him and he still pushed me off and it just sucks. I haven‚Äôt been alone since 2009 until now. I always had someone to be with. And now living at my moms makes me not want to be here at all. I just want to sleep all day but I stay out of her house all day because I feel like if I don‚Äôt then I‚Äôd go crazy being there alone. I tried making things right with him but I fucked up his trust and it just can‚Äôt be fixed.

325,"Good evening, just may just be a rant just to get all these thoughts our of my head, but read on if you wish. 


It has definitely been one of those months maybe years - Firstly I have finally received my MA Photography classification of a Merit (yay!) this month. I am currently a secondary school teaching assistant and work 1:1 with a child with CP (Cerebral Palsy.) I enjoy my job but I'm not really utilising my degree nor MA. It also doesn't pay amazing but I don't have that much expenditure going out so swings and roundabouts. 


My first question really is - what should I do? I don't know whether I want to be a teach because I do a lot in the evenings (I'm a scout leader twice a week.) and I am aware of the extra work hours needed to be put into teaching, along with the overall stress of the job. I enjoy my current work hours (8:30am-3:15pm) and the amount of holiday time I get, just know I cant stay in this job for my whole life, is there anyone whom could offer any ideas job wise? 


Secondly I don't have many friends I can talk to about life. You know you get all these close knit friendships group where everyone knows who ate what for breakfast and you can talk to about anything. Well, I don't have this. (Hence my ramblings here.) I've got a small handful of friends (all male) who are great but sometimes you just need a girly chat. I've tried talking to work colleagues and I do see a lot of people in the evening during volunteering but it is all so superficial. I have old friends from my foundation degree days but they've all got boyfriends or I'm too afraid contact them in fear of pestering them or being rejected I guess. I'm just feeling very lonely and lost - any suggestions? I have a boyfriend who I live with but sometimes you just need someone else to vent to. 


TLDR: Need some job and friendship advice.

Firstly this friend, she broke up with her ex about 2 years and about 7 months ago from him being unfaithful and because of that when she‚Äôs talks about relationships she‚Äôs always mentioned how she‚Äôs not ready for one at the moment. Now in the last two year two we have got closer then we have ever been before. I‚Äôve gotten close with her family her mother treats me like family and at this point now she knows I like my friend because she told me literally a week again she‚Äôs known all this time. And with friend friend she has a 7 year old daughter and sometimes she comes to my house when my friend needs her looking after and I pick her up from school and drop her at time.

Now with my friend I told her about 8 months ago that I liked her but when I told her because I know previously she‚Äôs always said how she didn‚Äôt think she was ready for a relationship so when I told her I just told her I like her but I just wanted to let her know I was forcing her to give me an answer for a relationship and when I told her she said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and that the ‚Äúdoors open to it‚Äù

After I told her this we got more intimate in all honest we have kissed multiple times and she‚Äôs even given me a blowjob and we had always seem to have just not spoke about it and skipped past it until one time she got really intimate and basically we had sex and after she looked really down and was crying and apologised and said how she shouldn‚Äôt have done that and wasn‚Äôt considering my feelings she also thought I‚Äôd hate her after that because she‚Äôs still not ready for a relationship. I told her I don‚Äôt and and how I think she‚Äôs really special and she‚Äôs worth the wait and she responded and told me all this time she‚Äôs liked me also. After that we never had sex again but the kissing still kind of happened and even the blowjobs still happened but we never had full on sex.

(Also she even sends me nude pictures of herself and her face are in then also so clearly she must trust me a lot and she right to because I wouldn‚Äôt betray her)

Now that‚Äôs the context no the situation now is on the 25th of April she asked me if I‚Äôd get her daughter from school I said I would and she turned around and said it doesn‚Äôt matter her mums going to get her I said ok and asked her if she got the job (because she went to a ‚Äújob thing‚Äù) as she put it she never replied a week went but I sent her a message saying ‚ÄúHey (friends name, wanted to check if all is ok. Haven‚Äôt heard from you for a while). Again she never replied. 

After that me being me because I really care for her I got some flowers and got them sent to her this was yesterday when she received them after she got them she called me and just said ‚ÄúMate!?‚Äù I was like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù And she just said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and I started talking and the phone cut out because her battery died she told me that in a text still when her phone came back on I replied with ‚ÄúNo worries, hope you enjoy the flowers though.... I know you probably baffled when you seen it lol‚Äù she replied with ‚Äúsuper baffled lol‚Äù.  Then I sent her a message saying ‚ÄúThought so... I just woke up one day and just thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna send her some roses‚Äù you already know I‚Äôm the spontaneous type lol‚Äù after that she didn‚Äôt respond for the rest of the day.

The next day came now which was yesterday and by mistake I didn‚Äôt realise I ordered the flowers twice but I noticed just before she got them so I tried to play out I meant to send her another batch she text me ‚Äú(my name) another box came‚Äù ‚ÄúI replied I know üëÄ‚Äù and she said ‚ÄúLooooool I got one yesterday‚Äù and then I said ‚ÄúDouble the roses 
Double what roses imply init 
#PrincessStandardsX2 ‚Äú.
After this she never replied for the rest of the day.

(Also all this time she hasn‚Äôt really replied to me she‚Äôs still been active on her social platforms)

And here we have it to now because she‚Äôs probably not gonna reply to me now and I kind of don‚Äôt get it considering we normally speak everyday and like I don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs gone so quiet and at the same time I don‚Äôt get what I should do about this relationship that we have  

TL;DR: friends knows I like her and still gets intimate with me and she‚Äôs also gone ghost and I don‚Äôt get why

Two weeks ago, I decided that I want to work for myself, I took a loan and started my own business.

I really don't know what to say, the police is useless, can't get the money back and I'm in deep shit. I've spend the last week crying in a pillow and drinking.

I'll cut to the point, I compulsively lie about everything to my parents. I lie about grades, money, health, you name it. This has been going on for several years now and it's gotten to the point where I'm actually starting to feel sick, dreading the day when they inevitably find out what I lied about now. As a college student I've wasted their money and have broken their trust too many times, and I want to fucking stop. I hate what I've done to the people I love.

I know it won't fix itself with the snap of a finger, and that'll I'll have to seriously change my lifestyle. Even then, it'll take a few years to rebuild their trust. But I don't care, I'll do whatever it takes, because this just isn't fucking healthy.

If possible, I just need some advice for the next few months. I've offered to pay for the next few months of college tuition with the money I make in my part time job (it's time to start paying for real world consequences), I've said I'll be more transparent about every little thing that happens so that I can at least get into the rhythm of telling the truth, and that I'll send them screenshots of my grades and assignments so that it'll be impossible for me to bullshit them anymore.

i still with with my mom, and even after getting my license i'm not allowed to drive by myself. the reason being because i'd be driving \*her\* car, and she's scared that if i were to potentially get into an accident the insurance would be expensive as i am a new driver, which totally makes sense. 

i feel conflicted because although i totally understand my mom is coming from and her reasoning is completely logical, i still can't help but feel down about it. it's been difficult for me to find a job because of it. my mom has a life of her own and sometimes she complains about driving me places because she has to rearrange all her plans so it's more convenient. this makes me feel guilty for asking  her to drive me everywhere and discourages me from actually going out places with friends and stuff. every time i drive she is in the car with me, and she and i both know that i drive very safely, always around speed limit, have never gotten into an accident or bumped anything. but how am i ever going to learn to drive alone if i don't, y'know... drive alone?

overall i know my mom just wants to protect me but it still makes me feel like she doesn't trust me. it makes me feel like an entitled asshole or something. i do struggle with low self esteem, feelings of depression and anxiety already, so not being able to drive just makes me feel so stuck and like i can't do anything in life.

342,"I'm graduating from my LPN program this week. There are some cool jobs I've interviewed for. But of course, I have to consider my scheduling constraints because of me continuing school (for RN prereqs), which is a considerable inconvenience. 

I'm in the process of applying for a BSN program. They have really neat clinical placements in the ICU and schools and such. I would have to go full time and take out a bunch of loans, and probably not work more than a shift a week. Having a BSN grants me a lot more opportunities and makes me much more marketable.

But, there are plenty of LPN jobs. I've been living just fine off CNA pay, so LPN pay is going to be awesome. I could afford my student loan payments just fine. I can support myself just fine.

Everyday, I feel totally different about what I want to do. On the one hand, I am not a great student and I'm sick of school and I want to work wherever I want without regard to school constraints and save up for cars and vacations and Ikea and whatever. I feel like there's no reason I can't go back to school later, when I feel more ready and have a chunk of loans paid off. On the other hand, it's more logical financially and career-wise to get my BSN out of the way as soon as possible.

345,"Hi, r/advice, this is my first post here, and I'm sorry if it gets a little long. 
Context: I'm an 18-year-old art school student studying in Georgia, and I live in Connecticut. I need a summer job in Connecticut for when I go back to CT in two and a half weeks. 
I have spent the last 10 summers of my life at a summer camp a few minutes from my house - first as a camper, then as a CIT, and for the last two years, a paid counselor. The job is abysmal - eight hours in 90 degree weather with no breaks, in charge of a group of up to 25 children from ages 6 to 12, often with only one other person to help you, invisible and unhelpful directors with zero influence, lazy activity specialists, terrible pool lifeguards, and torturous amounts of stupid teen drama among the other counselors. The place is disastrously run, horribly understaffed and frequently has to merge huge groups because people don't show up - for which there are no consequences because they need numbers for legal reasons. For 2 weeks last year, I was also assigned to be the caretaker of a 6-year-old with severe mental and developmental disabilities, despite having no qualifications in that area at all, just because I was a pretty good regular counselor.
I have been diagnosed with serious depression.  Obviously, this causes me difficulties in my life, but my parents, while otherwise great, have absolutely refused to believe my psychologist on this point, and stopped taking me to regular visits with him as soon as they learned about this. I can't talk about my diagnosis without them accusing me of faking the symptoms for attention.
I can't drive, but will be getting my license within the first few weeks of summer, still don't have a car, but am wiling to pay for Uber out of pocket with the money I earned over the last two summers to get to and from a job.

Now, the problem. I absolutely cannot go back to the summer camp. I would come home every day drained and exhausted, physically and emotionally, and I can't discuss this with my parents beyond saying that the job was ""stressful,"" which makes me look like the asshole baby millennial art student who can't work a job. I'm perfectly willing to work any job in the world but one where I have to deal with watching children. So, since March, I've been applying to jobs online. This is difficult for a couple reasons - I'm not in Connecticut, so I can't come in for walk-in interviews until early June, and entry-level positions in retail, food service, and things like that don't often post their listings online. Couple this with the fact that for some reason, positions like working at Radio Shack or Bed Bath and Beyond, or other retailers require 2-3 years of previous cash register experience, and I've been having a tough time getting jobs to respond to me. 
My parents have been acting like I'm the lazy one here, and want me to go back to the summer camp because it's convenient for them to drive me - except the deadline for applications was TWO MONTHS AGO, at the beginning of March. I told the directors three months ago that I wouldn't be coming back, and renegging on that to beg for a job a month before the camp starts running strikes me as rude, presumptuous, and self-serving, not to mention that I baseline refuse to do that at all anyway.
This job pressure, coupled with finals work, move-out preparation, and the depression that hasn't magically gone away like my parents thought it would, is causing me a huge amount of stress to the point where it's affecting my ability to work. I've got a phone interview tomorrow for a job as a cafeteria cashier at a local aquarium, but beyond that none of the jobs I've applied to have called me or emailed me back. My parents have said there will be ""consequences"" if I don't apply to the camp by tomorrow, and if I get asked back, they won't let me work anywhere else, if anyone DOES end up contacting me. 

I'm stressed, exhausted, and tired of my parents breathing down my neck about this. I have expressed to them many times that I don't want to go back, but have just been treated condescendingly by my mom and made fun of by my dad. I don't want to bend on this and spend my whole summer depressed, but I also don't want my parents furious with me and guilt-tripping me about how hard they're working for me to go to college for however long it takes to find a job. I called my mom today for mother's day and it was all she wanted to talk about.

TL;DR Local depressed teen had shitty job, can't go back to it, parents are pressing hard to go back to shitty job. Willing to work any other job but having trouble finding one since I'm out of state at the moment. Is there a move I can make that I'm missing or is just... applying for jobs and waiting the only thing I can do? ",13May2018,1
346,"**Backstory:** My parents got divorced last year, after my dad (supposedly?) had an affair. My mom didn't, and still doesn't, handle it well. To be quite honest, my mom is immature, controlling, and unreasonable. If she even suspects I'm on the phone with my dad, she ignores me for a few days to a week. I live with her since I am still in high school, and our house is close to my school, while my dad moved an hour away to be closer to his work. If he lived closer, I probably would have lived with him. (Honestly, the distance from my dad has made us appreciate each other more and have a better relationship.)

My mom goes to a therapist for her depression and issues stemming from the divorce, and she told me that her therapist told her to take ""me time."" Obviously I believe in self care and having person time, but I think my mom has taken this a little too seriously. She thinks that this means only doing things for herself, and has left me to fend for myself. For Christmas, New Years, and Mother's Day, she has left me home alone while she hangs out with her friends. I ask her to do things every weekend (go shopping, go on a run, eat lunch, bake food...) but she always turns me down. Today, she made plans with me twice (for the day and then for just dinner), and has stood me up for both... and she doesn't think she has anything to apologize for. There is rarely food in the refrigerator, parts around the house are broken (toilets, sinks) and I personally don't have enough money or resources to get those fixed without my mom. I do as much as I can, but it's pretty overwhelming, and sometimes when I need help I just can't get it. 

**My question:** I had a bad relationship with my mom growing up (it was a lot of her choosing my dad over me), and I thought that would change after the divorce, but our relationship is just getting worse. I love her unconditionally, but it is so difficult to like her as a person. She is not responding to any of my efforts to get closer and is only pushing me further away. What can I do in the few months before I head for college? Is this a lost cause? Is it okay to not get along with my mom?!?!

355,"(Thanks if you care enough to read the whole story)

I‚Äôm a 18 year old guy that works at Cheeseburger Bobby‚Äôs and need advice because I think I screwed up.

About 2 weeks ago I decided I wanted to try smoking weed for the first time and was looking for a place to buy some. I was talking to my friend from work [18F], we‚Äôll call her A, and she said one of my other coworkers and friends [27M] had some good connections. I bought 2gs from him, I‚Äôll call him P, hoping to smoke with some friends from school but almost got caught at the last second so I bailed on that idea.

I then decided it would be easier to just smoke with someone from work since my parents don‚Äôt know they exist. I asked A if she wanted to smoke with me (as friends although I kinda have a crush on her) and she said yes. So we ended up setting up a day but it got cancelled because she was busy. This happened three more times (she canceled 4 times in total because she was busy and gave legit reasons) at this point I was extremely worried that she just didn‚Äôt want to smoke with me so I asked her and she said she promised she does but that stuff keeps happening and she‚Äôs sorry if it looks like she doesn‚Äôt. 

I was pretty unsure of if I should ask her again or just drop her and try to smoke with some other friends and I was really just wanting to smoke so I asked P if he knew anything I didn‚Äôt since he is friends with and talks with A. He said no but I would try smoking with someone else because I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs taking smoking with you very seriously and kinda has you on a back burner for when she‚Äôs bored. After that I finally decided to just drop her and not say anything about it to her. I also decided that it would be best if me and P smoked together for my first time since we were good friends and since he had experience. 

I thought all the problems had been solved and everything was good but the day I set up smoking with P, I went to hang out with friends after work and out of no where A texted me saying, ‚ÄúI feel disrespected‚Äù. I assumed P told her that we were gonna smoke together and she got mad about it for some reason. Even if P didn‚Äôt tell her she would have found out eventually and probably would have been even more pissed. I responded to her by saying something like, ‚Äúno no it‚Äôs not like that, I‚Äôve just been really wanting to smoke since it‚Äôs been 2 weeks since I bought it. Even though you said you want to smoke together, it seems like you aren‚Äôt taking it very seriously. I was just gonna smoke with P because I think the weed is getting bad and I really just want to try it for the first time.‚Äù She responded by saying, ‚ÄúDude I can literally smoke Tuesday or Wednesday this week‚Äù. (It was Saturday) I was with friends and it‚Äôs hard for me to think about two things at once so I said, ‚ÄúKk we‚Äôll figure something out‚Äù. She said, ‚ÄúUgh‚Äù and I was pretty confused. I said, ‚ÄúDo you work tomorrow?‚Äù Hoping I would be able to talk to her and P about it then. She responded, ‚Äúyea at 4‚Äù and I said, ‚Äúok we‚Äôll figure something out before I leave at 4.‚Äù She said, ‚Äúok just lmk‚Äù. (Sorry if this is getting boring, it‚Äôs almost done)

So the next day at work (today) I was hoping to talk to P during work if he was there and A as I was about to leave at 4. I didn‚Äôt know if P was working today so I asked my manager if he was. She said no why? I said it‚Äôs nothing but she kept pushing trying to figure out what stuff was going on with me and him. 

Later during the day I was on break and she came over and sat down to eat with me. I ended up telling her that me, P, and A were hanging out for some reason. She said that‚Äôs fine for you to do that but not them because apparently there is a rule in this company that managers (P and A are shift managers) aren‚Äôt supposed to hang out with people under them because they might start giving them benefits others wouldn‚Äôt get or something. She (the main manager) then said P might be leaving in 2 weeks. I knew she meant she was gonna fire him so I told her please don‚Äôt he‚Äôs my friend and a good worker. She said even without knowing this she already had stuff on him to be able to fire him. I emphasized that I really didn‚Äôt want her to fire him and then it was quiet for a little bit before my break ended. I later asked her (still today) if anything was gonna happen to P and A. She didn‚Äôt respond. I said that we didn‚Äôt even hang out yet so.

At this point she sent me home early because there were like no customers and we have to keep labor% down. This meant I didn‚Äôt get to talk to A before leaving. I only sent her a text saying, ‚ÄúShe sent me home early so we‚Äôll figure something out with P in a bit‚Äù. She said, ‚ÄúOk‚Äù. As it stands right now it will either be me and P smoking together on Monday (tomorrow) or all three of us together like on Thursday or something

This is where I am right now. P and A don‚Äôt know I told the manager that we were gonna hang out and I‚Äôm afraid that this could lead to P or even A being fired. I have no idea what I should do at this point. Thanks for reading all of that if you did.",13May2018,1
356,"My boyfriend certainly has his issues. He's a heavy drinker, he has a short temper, and he also has ""performance issues"" when it comes to being intimate. That said, I still care about him and we've been dating for over two years. But ever since the beginning of the year, his behavior has become increasingly worse. His drinking has become more excessive, he lashes out at me all of the time, and I even think that he's just using me for my car since he doesn't have one of his own. He never even gives me so much as a ""Thank you"" when I drive him anywhere and he doesn't ever want to spend time with me outside of me giving him a ride.

This past spring break, he disappeared for a whole week and nobody knew where he was. His friends and family hadn't seen him and we were all worried. It turns out that him and other friends went all the way down to Mexico for spring break and he apparently wanted the trip to remain a complete secret, but we eventually found out from pictures that were posted on Facebook. When I asked him why he wouldn't tell me that he went to Mexico, he simply said ""I'm an adult and you're not my mom."" Then just last month, he disappeared again and this time we almost got the police involved. He was gone for nearly a whole week before he turned up and to this day, nobody knows where he went.

Now my friends and family are telling me that it's best if I break up with him. They've all said that his cons vastly outweigh his pros at this point and there's no telling what's going to happen between us given how unpredictable and secretive he's become. One of my sisters has even said that there's a good chance he's cheated on me, but I refuse to believe that. There's no evidence that he's cheated on me. That said, I know he has his problems and they seem to be getting worse. Breaking up with him is the last thing I want to do. We've been together for two years and I want to make things work out, but I don't know what to do. What do you think?",13May2018,1
