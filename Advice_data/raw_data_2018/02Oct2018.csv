0,"I'm leaving this job soon anyways plus the salary would not have been very much, but I still would like to know if there's anything for me to hold against the restaurant. The pay so far is extremely poor compared to what I'm used to so the salary would help a bit.

As of the last 2 weeks I feel fairly confident about my responsibilities in the restaurant. It is a Vietnamese restaurant and I am the only American working as a part of the waiting staff. Because the others are international students, they all rely solely on the shared tip pool to get paid, including our manager. 


Prior to this job I have had zero experience working in a restaurant. I was laid off from my previous company and this restaurant job is just to help me get back on my feet a bit. I'm accustomed to getting paid via a biweekly direct deposit so I have no idea about the legalities of this restaurant or of they're just messing with me. Anyone with experience care to chime in? If more details are necessary I'll post more.",02Oct2018,1

2,"So the new uni year just started, and a society that I'm in is having its first meeting of the year tomorrow. The thing is my ex girlfriend is in this society too.

I ended things at the end of the last uni year because she sexual assaulted me. Then after I broke up with her she started to stalk me, and tried to manipulate me by saying she was going to kill herself. She also made a false claim to our university saying I blackmailed her.

I'm really scared/worried about having to see her tomorrow, but I don't want to not go because I really like this society.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you",02Oct2018,1
3,"There's a man around the age of 50 messaging a 15 y/o I know. He usually ask about events that shes attended, he has a son in her grade so he knows whats going on, but hes also has said things like ""Netflix and Chill?"", and has asked her to send photos of a sunburn she received on vacation? She also has another friend in her grade that he has been messaging. Her parents are aware of the situation, but are in the same boat I am in about the situation. I know that this should probably be reported, but he also has kids, and we don't really wanna risk ruining these kids lives by attaching a bad name to their father. Maybe he is just out of touch and really doesn't understand netflix and chill, but at the same time it is really weird, creepy, and borderline predator-ish.  Its just a really difficult situation because of the fact that he has kids. Any advice on what to do? ",02Oct2018,1
4,"So, long story short, I'm a hopeless romantic. I like hand made cards/gifts, hand holding, painting her toe nails, lots of kissing, good morning texts, romantic couple hikes, dancing badly, surprise dates, singing love songs to each other, cuddling for hours at a time, and passionate sex that is more about the emotional connection than the physical stimulation.

&amp;#x200B;

I've only had two long term relationships. The first, she was emotionally abusive towards me, and the second, well.....let's just say she didn't love me as much as she loved the idea of having a boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm concerned that future gfs will have had their fill of all of that mushy gushy crap that I am into and will want to have more nights in sitting watching TV (I hate TV unless it sports or the Simpsons), won't hold my hand in public, won't want to exchange hand made cards/gifts, and won't really want to have sex that often, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

What is everyone else's experience with dating in their late twenties or even in their thirties? Do I need to reevaluate what my wants/needs? Or is there a reasonable expectation of me finding someone who likes this stuff?",02Oct2018,1

6,"Me and my girlfriend broke up today after a previous breakup we had a while back. That previous breakup made me not have complete trust in her and she knew that and she said that she understood it would take time. Fast forward to today and she breaks up with ME because I’ve confronted her about people coming up to me saying that she is cheating on me. I have no definitive proof she is and she has no proof she isn’t so I decided to forgive her the first few times because I trusted her more then a couple of randoms. But now SHE can’t handle that these people keep coming up to me and saying that she cheated. I know my thoughts are all over the place so sorry about that but I’m just a little shaken up 

Ps: I’m 15 and we go to different school. We have been best friend for 3 years so I thought we knew each other super well and what we wanted in a relationship. On paper we seemed perfect for each other and I think in another world maybe if that first breakup didn’t happen we would still be together 

Any advice on how to cope with this or maybe does anyone know how I’m feeling. I don’t talk to many people about my personal life so losing her feels super odd . I don’t have anyone to talk to about my feelings ",02Oct2018,1
7,"Okay here's my situation, would appreciate any input. For context I have Asperger's, and have difficulty understanding shit like this. I also have negative thoughts about how I look, and this girl is very attractive, which makes things weird in my head. 

So I had known this girl for two weeks, after bonding a little about our music taste then hanging out a little one on one. We also both had a bad breakup before college and bonded over that. We end up making plans to drive pretty far to see a concert in a school break which is now two weeks away. A mutual friend was eventually added to this so we could sleep at his house during this. 

It got a little flirty, but just slightly. It could be that it was just wishful thinking. 

This weekend I did a dab for the first time, which is smoking THC oil. It's a lot of weed, and though I've smoked a lot, this really fucked me up. I never threw up, but I could barely walk, and I was just having a terrible time. We were by her dorm room, and so she just walked me there and I ended up crashing in her bed and gave the rest of the group permission to leave (that I'd be fine without them) fell asleep. 

A few hours later I wake up mostly sober to her asking if I wanted to stay and I said yeah. I was wearing jeans and she asked if I want to put on some sweatpants she owns, and I ask if I could just take my pants off and she said yeah so I did. Then she gets into bed, grabs onto my hand, drapes me over her so it's sorta spooning and I fall asleep. 

The rest of the night we were both kinda half awake listening to music and cuddling, like a couple. She kept flirtily kicking my shins and doing stuff like squeezing my hand so I would squeeze back, resting her head on my chest, kinda burrowing her head into my armpit area, that of thing. She also put her hand intentionally on my bare mid thigh but not any higher.

I tried to hint at hooking up but that didn't go anywhere, though it's certainly possible that she didn't know. 

We woke up and kinda just half slept while doing this for another few hours. 

So, what are my odds at this?",02Oct2018,1

9,"This is way too long but thank you if you actually read the whole thing. 

I have no idea why I am writing this. Nobody is (probably) ever going to read it. For the past two years, I have been dealing with a few issues that have caused me to do some very, very stupid things. The root of these issues, while a psychiatrist (were I to ever finally shut up and go see one) would likely characterize these issues as having always been there, begins with a girl. For the purposes of this (Blog post? Paper? Confession?), I will call her Abby. I met Abby at a party one night a few years ago. It was a “margarita” party that was thrown by my college fraternity with the primary objective being to, you guessed it, drink margaritas. 

I was our chapter president at the time and, although I loved getting belligerently intoxicated on a good marg, I was attempting to be a responsible leader and spent my night surveying the party. This included making sure that everyone was having a good time, nobody showed up who shouldn’t have, and that people who were drinking themselves into oblivion were being taken home in a timely fashion. As the party was winding to a close, sometime around two or three in the morning, I noticed a girl sitting on a dryer in the basement looking like she could barely function. I recognized her as the friend of one of my brothers’ girlfriends, so I went over to ask if everything was alright. 

She drunkenly responded something like, “uh, yah. Totally. Having great night. Thank you”, so I politely asked her to stay where she was while I went to find her friend. A few minutes later, I found her. Let’s call this girl Shania (like Shania Twain, the country singer). I told her that she should go and take a look at what was going on with Abby. She went to talk to her and returned a few minutes later. She said, “I think Abby has a thing for you” and I responded that I didn’t really believe that, she was just hammered, and I was nice to her. Shania insisted, so I went back down to talk to her. 

I returned to the same spot I had left Abby previously and decided to sit down on the washing machine next to her. I asked her how her night was going, made little small talk about school, and then finally got bold enough to say, “So Shania tells me you have a crush on me. What’s the deal with that?” To her credit, she was absolutely adorable from this moment on. She broke into an inebriated explanation of how cute she thought I was, how nice I always am, and a whole lot of other things that were just simply not true but were certainly welcome to hear. I was so taken by her that I asked for her number and if it would be okay if I texted her the next day. She was thrilled about this. 

Long story short, I did text her the next day. We talked fairly frequently for a few weeks, went out a few times, and ended up becoming a couple. She was fantastic. Abby was absolutely everything that a guy could ask for in a girlfriend. I began to spend time with her and her friends more frequently, and her with mine. One such friend, Shania, and I actually grew to be very close friends and confidants. I was 22, Abby was 19. While only 3 years apart, I was in a very different stage in my life at the time. I was on my way to graduating, had a rapidly developing career path underneath me, and was beginning to look towards the future. Abby loved going out and partying with her friends, riding horses (she was on the University Equestrian Team), and spending time with me. I, on the other hand, still liked to go out a fair amount, but my time to spend with her on a one-on-one basis was fairly limited relative to what she would have preferred. 

When summer came, Abby elected to return home (roughly 1500 miles away) to her hometown instead of staying and getting a summer job around our college town. I was upset by this but understood that she was very homesick. I flew out to visit her a few weeks after she went home. We had an absolutely fantastic time and I was more confident in our relationship than I had ever been. However, after I returned home, things began to go south. Not seeing each other daily, me making less and less time to talk to her as my schedule grew more hectic, and an increasing realization that we actually had very few similar interests and life goals began to take its toll. 

As I alluded to earlier, I still enjoyed going out on the weekends. Several of Abby’s friends, Shania included, had stayed in town for the summer. We began to all hang out in a large group and go to local bars together when we had time. Shania had dumped the boyfriend I mentioned in the beginning and was thrilled to be able to have fun as any newly single 20-year-old is apt to do following a breakup. I began to confide in her my doubts regarding Abby and I’s relationship. She was understanding, comforting, and a fantastic drinking buddy to say the least. Our friends began to make comments regarding how close we were on an increasingly regular basis. There was nothing malicious going on, we were just two very similar people that enjoyed spending time together. 

This was until I realized that I was in love with her. When I woke up in the mornings, I wasn’t looking forward to seeing Abby’s name pop up on my phone. I was instead concerned with when the next time I would hear from Shania would be. I would resist the temptation to message her for fear of her becoming aware of my feelings for her. When she would finally say something to me, I would talk to her for the entire rest of the day. I felt like I was 14. 

At this point, I had come to terms with the fact that I would need to end things with Abby. I had no intention of pursuing a romantic relationship with Shania, but I knew that I couldn’t continue to lead Abby on if I knew that I couldn’t commit myself fully to her. As the summer rapidly came to a close and she would soon return to campus for the fall semester, I decided that it would be best to wait it out and give her the respect of ending things with her in person. 

A week or so before Abby was due to return, I held a watch party for an event on TV at my house. My roommate at the time and I spent the afternoon and early evening getting things ready all the while drinking casually. When it came near time for the event to start, it began pouring down rain. Several people messaged me saying that they had decided to stay home, but Shania and her friend said that they were already on their way. What was supposed to be a ten to twelve-person event quickly became a four-person event. Once they arrived, we played drinking games and laughed at the people on TV for hours. By this time, my roommate and Shania’s friend had really been hitting it off. Shania and I went downstairs to get drinks around midnight and returned to find the door to his room shut and the lights turned off. Neither of us had expected them to hook up, but we thought it was a hilarious turn of events nonetheless. 

We returned to my kitchen where we sat on barstools and talked for an hour or so about I don’t know what. I just know I was having the time of my life. She began to do things like touch my hand and gradually move closer to me. I was a little drunk, so I couldn’t tell if these signals were just a bi-product of 7 shots of tequila or were in fact reality, so I didn’t actively pursue. Out of nowhere, I remember us leaning in too close to each other after laughing at something she had said. That was it. We were on each other from that moment forward. The next thing I knew, I woke up some hours later in my own bed with her next to me. 

I laid there for what felt like an eternity just piecing together the night before. I had to make some sense of what had happened. I had just cheated on a girl who had never done anything wrong to me with her BEST FRIEND. This was incomprehensible. It was, and is to this day, the single dumbest thing I have ever done in my life. When she awoke, we tried to talk things over and figure out where to go from here. We decided that if we were going to tell her what had happened, we should do it together and we should do it in person. Before we knew it, Abby had returned to campus. 

I did what I could to put the memory of the situation out of my mind until the proper moment arose for us to come clean to her. Shania and I talked about it at length almost daily. We had decided that we would tell her a few nights before school started. We had planned to sit her down in her house and just come out with it and take whatever consequences arose as they came. Hours before our planned confession, Shania called me in tears pleading for us to not go through with it. She was worried that she would lose every friend she had made while in college, be removed from her sorority, and even be removed from the equestrian team. She requested that I keep dating Abby as if nothing had happened, and then find an excuse to end things naturally. As this was a two-person ordeal, I reluctantly agreed. 

I was very obviously not the same boyfriend that I had been prior to summer’s beginning. Abby could see this. She began to be more attentive and an even better girlfriend than she had been previously. I was disgusted with myself, but still I did nothing. I began to truly have feelings for Abby once again and elected to give things a shot. I began to do my best to be someone that deserved to be in a relationship with someone as genuine and kind-hearted as Abby. For the next 9 months, everything was bliss. I spent less time with her around Shania, of course, but did so without any obvious cause for concern. In terms of outward appearance, I was a fantastic boyfriend. Her friends would regularly make comments about how well I treated her and how jealous they were of our relationship. This was, as you now know, very misplaced. I was hiding a secret that made me the biggest asshole that any of these girls had ever known. 

Abby once again returned home for the next summer, but not before we had quite possibly the biggest fight of our relationship. She had been given multiple opportunities to take well-positioned jobs that would allow her to get a jump-start on her career over the summer. These jobs were not only in our college town, but in various other states as well. Instead of taking any of them, she once again elected to stay with her parents for the summer. I have always been very career-first minded and put family ties close to last on my list of priorities, so this was something that I could simply not identify with. It upset me that she was throwing away perfectly good opportunities. We decided to put the fight on hold for a while and spend some time apart. 

The weeks wore on, and I decided that I finally did not want to waste any more time in a relationship that was clearly going nowhere. I called her to tell her that I wanted to end things. She was absolutely devastated and was very angry that I hadn’t done it in person in the weeks prior. This was a fair position for her to take, so I could do nothing but further apologize until I was finally able to get off the phone. I received a call from Shania later that afternoon. We talked, and I explained to her what had happened in Abby and I’s conversation. She said she was sorry to hear that things had ended between us and she wished me the best. 

That night, I went out with some friends to “celebrate my new life as a single man”. We went out, got highly intoxicated, and I came back to my friend Tyler’s place to crash on the couch. Shania’s apartment was only about two blocks away and we had been texting on and off throughout the night. I mentioned to her that I was now sleeping on the floor because one of my friends had taken the couch. She offered for me to come over and talk, after which I could pass out on her couch instead. I came over. We talked. I did not sleep on her couch. 

We began to repeat a version of this about once a week for the next month. I would sneak over to her place after a night out with friends once everyone was too drunk to realize where I had gone. It quickly escalated from weekly hookups to bi-weekly dates. I had never felt for anyone what I felt for this girl. I spent every waking moment thinking about her. In my mind, she was perfect for me. Being with her required no effort, outside of the secrecy. Talking with her was like breathing. Looking at her was a constant gift. I never wanted to be with anyone else. I kid you not, I was ready to spend the rest of my life with her. 

After a month or so of this, reality set in. Shania still was uncomfortable, as she should have been, with the concept of throwing away everything else that was important to her just to be with me. That is, of course, what it would likely have taken for us to fully be together. I did not attempt to convince her otherwise. We decided, in the parking lot of a local fast food restaurant, to no longer see each other. That was 18 months ago. 

Since that moment, I have been absolutely miserable. I have dated since and am even currently in a relationship. This has merely been in an attempt to normalize my mental state; to hope to find something that even remotely resembled the feelings I had. Unfortunately, I can’t. I have had mental breakdowns that have resulted in confessions to friends, many of whom have since shunned me for this admission of guilt. I still, approaching two years later, think about her almost every day. I am exhausted. Being sad all the time, feeling like you’re missing part of yourself, like you missed out on something that was somehow MEANT to be in your life; it wears on you. I don’t know what to do. 

Shania texted me a few days ago and said that she planned on coming clean to Abby soon. She didn’t want me to be a part of it, though I offered, which makes sense as we haven’t spoken in quite a long time. This is what has me in my current state. Seeing her name light up on my phone triggers something almost PTSD-like that I wish I could ignore. I’ve given up on any hope that we will ever be together. I just want to get out of this. I know I don’t deserve sympathy; I’m the asshole of this story. I just need to know what the hell I can do to stop feeling like this. ",02Oct2018,1

How did they feel about the move, before &amp; after? If your kids moved with you, were they able to establish themselves quickly? Make friends easily?  Did you struggle to make new friends? Did you have any difficulty finding employment because of your age or because you were an ""outsider""?

12,"By old definitions ‘Aspergers’ but that’s not used anymore.

I’m 21, male and currently at college starting over in Software Development which I’m really enjoying, in contrast to my 2 years studying business..

I think I might have Aspergers.
I have a cousin who has it, his is apparently bad enough that he will never hold down a job or live independently. 

I don’t think we’re alike so for years I just assumed I didn’t have it.


I’ve been to doctors for mental health in the past - anger issues, impulsivity, intense periods of interest, bad in social situations, depressed and generally not happy.
I had a psychiatric referral and he mentioned autism. 
I said ‘no I get people’ and I do...

And I do but I’ve come to realize I have to work at it a lot more than others, it’s a conscious effort, I can talk the pants off a girl with enough liquid courage but I can’t talk to a guy I’m somewhat friendly with.

I’m a very cerebral person, I am analytical and I like thinking things through, but I have shit concentration and I go off on tangents. 
I do it for everything, I say what I’ve worked out as being right and I learn from my mistakes..
But put me in a group and I’ll be silent.

The psychiatrist related a lot of my issues to intelligence, in a sense that a lot of my issues stem from me never feeling like I fit in, that I can’t relate well to others, I have different interests and hobbies, and while I’m able to compensate for all of this I’m still not happy because it’s like playing a chess game and not just having a conversation.
God forbid it be small talk.

I can deal with a disruption to routine.
But I like to have a Cappuccino or some form of foamy coffee in the morning.. 

I’ve also lost my temper/frustration to the point where I’ve pulled clumps of hair out.
As a baby apparently the way I’d fall asleep was by twirling my mother’s hair..
I also had to have a ‘fresh’ bottle/baba.. I could tell if it was made fresh or if it had been put away and then fixed up for me..

I put a lot of effort into how I dress because I’m interested in fashion, but I’m deliberate - I want to wear x, y and z, to develop a go to uniform that shows me, but is also appropriate for the situation and the weather.
I want to sell all my clothes and buy a small handful of clothes and develop a minimal Rock Owens wardrobe.
Or it’s Lanvin sneakers, jeans and a cashmere hoodie because I like to fit in but I want to look like some tech billionaire.

I’m weird, I’ve always been weird to some extent.
I don’t make friends well, I don’t know why.. I try to not invade personal space - I hate when people do that to me.
I try to keep conversations going but that doesn’t always work.
I try but it doesn’t usually work.
That coupled with anxiety isn’t nice.

I wanted to be a surgeon as a kid - I’d make a lot of money, be respected, get to save lives, could spend 90% of my time focused on a worthwhile endeavor and I would get to do something I find interesting..
Now I’m in software dev, I’ve just started but I really enjoy it, I made a rash decision to change and now I’m 4 weeks behind and catching up but I don’t mind.

I think I might have Aspergers..
I completed the aspie test, it leaned towards aspie but was more 65-45.. the highest point was Aspie Talent, while the Neurotypical talent was low by comparison.. I’ve also suspected ADD so that makes sense, but it’s still not very low.

I’ve thought maybe I’m Bipolar, maybe it’s just depression, I might even be a sociopath, or Borderline.. I just don’t engage with the world as like everyone else does, be that for better or for worse..

He has a horrible, terrible friend who I hate. And, this friend doesn’t value him but, he doesn’t seem to get it. Like, we were at a party this weekend and, my boyfriend (CJ) is basically the token black friend of his friend I hate, let’s call friend I hate Brad. 

More than half the stuff out of Brad’s mouth is terrible jokes (made a joke about my dead dog), he insults everyone about any opinions they have that disagree with his own (I said I liked a certain comic book character and he told me I sucked b/c of that), and he constantly feels the need to point out that CJ is black and or the only black one around. I’m Latina but, I’m super white-passing so, based on looks it does appear that way. 

I don’t stand for Brad’s rude mouth or his creep sister who kicks and touches everyone when she’s drunk. She wouldn’t stop touching my bf till I yelled in her face for her to quit it. My bf thanked me for it later, had he reacted anyway besides moving away from her, I’m sure he’d have been reduced to ‘angry black guy’ comments from Brad. 

CJ doesn’t see what I see. He is MUCH too forgiving of everyone and, I don’t know what to do, i know CJ’s mom hates Brad too but, I know she’d mentioned that both she and I hate him to CJ (CJ’s mom loves me, she’s amazing ^^) but, uggggh...

They seem to be really happy in each other's company that my presence no longer really matters. My individual friendships with them have kind of withered to the point where if I want to talk to them I always have to start the conversation, and even then it feels as if I have bothered them and it crushes my self-esteem.

At this point I'm just a 3rd wheel they politely put up with at school since I found out that they go on study dates and other outings without telling me. Whenever I see them in class they'll say hi to each other first and go into conversation. Whereas, if it's me and 1 of them first, they'll always ask where the other is and that hurts. Also, everytime I log into FB I see the memes they tag each other in and they always seem to be online, at the same time chatting with each other.

Next day at school her mom texts her saying there cat died from an animal attack. They are blaming themselves and thinking of all the ways they could have prevented it. Looked for the cat etc etc. What can I say to them? How can I be there for them? I know it was not there fault. But saying that did not help. Plz what do I do?,02Oct2018,1

25,"So, I have a unique situation. I had a typical 'adult' life until 33, I was given the chance to go to an amazing grad school for my preferred degree field on a full academic scholarship (sans about $15k/yr living expenses). I'm finishing that up this year, but I've accrued around 8k in revolving debt just to stay afloat.

My degree is in ministry, and I plan on devoting my life to church work (you're not changing my mind about that one, even though many redditors are opposed to that line of work)... but the job I've had on campus has the potential to turn into a full-time job (IT) with starting pay at around $10k higher than my starting salary in ministry. 

Another factor, my significant other is currently preparing to return to school to get her post-grad degree, thus, I'd be highly encouraged to stay local.... something that may not be as feasible if I jump right into church work.

Do you sacrifice a few years in your field for an otherwise good job in a different field? Or, do you jump into your degree field head-first to get the experience?",02Oct2018,1
26,"TLDR at bottom

Just to clarify, I am in high school and I do very well in my classes. I have a 4.0 and I’ve never been too worried about not passing, academic advice isn’t exactly what I’m looking for.

All of my classes are fine this year, except for science. It’s not a hard class, I usually really enjoy science. But the teacher is very rude and comes off as quite arrogant to me.

This is something that I have been working on for a very long time and it used to be a lot worse, but I am a very very sensitive person. It kinda sucks because I know I’ll never be able to completely change it, it’s just part of who I am.

Now, said science teacher likes to yell. She does not talk, she yells. Some people just have louder volumes, which is alright. But not only does she have a very loud voice, her tone of voice is very firm and pushy. It’s hard to explain but ever since the first day of school, it’s always made me really nervous.

Most of our class consists of doing labs and procedures and collecting data, and I am someone who asks a lot of questions in general. I like to double check things and I am curious. And usually I am never scared to ask for help from a teacher. But I am with my science teacher. She is very unwilling to help us and is very rude if we ask for clarification or help.
Someone might ask for a reminder or whatever, and she’ll say something like “how do you not know this?” And blah blah blah. Like, she puts us under a lot of pressure and almost humiliates us since she practically yells the whole class can hear your conversation with her.

I missed a class period during the second week of school due to an appointment and I had missed part 1/2 of a lab. The next day I had asked for a little help since I didn’t understand what I had missed or what we were doing, she DID NOT EXPLAIN ANYTHING. She simply threw me with two other classmates and I had to copy their notes from the previous day’s lab. That was the first class to make me cry due to my sensitivity.

Now today in class, we were doing some density measurements and she called on another student to calculate the density from a previous lab. The student was a bit confused but pulled out her calculator and had forgotten what the density formulae was so it took her a moment to calculate it, all the while our teacher was yelling at the student repeatedly “Come on, what is the density? What is the density?” She literally just kept shouting at the poor student to hurry up. The student was actually trying really hard and was struggling so she started crying out of frustration and pressure, the teacher did not give a fuck.

I got overwhelmed and started crying in that class as well.

TLDR:  I don’t know what to do. I am doing very well in science but keep having mental breakdowns (I’m sensitive) from my science teacher who is rude and arrogant and unwilling to help with anything. Her class gives me so much anxiety and I want to cry just thinking about the teacher.

I can’t have mental breakdowns every day because of this damn teacher.",02Oct2018,1

35,"I am actually a full-time, unionized government worker, though relatively new to my job. I quickly discovered that 2 employees are getting sort of under-the-table, preferential treatment and that apparently it's been an unspoken issue for some time. The rest of us all work Monday-Friday 8am to 4:30pm, and these two work Monday-Thursday 7am to 5:30pm. If they were just the only ones offered a 4-day workweek that'd be bothersome enough, but they're actually not even working those extra 2 hours Monday-Thursday as they're supposed to. They come in at 8am with the rest of us and just block off their schedule each day from 7am to 8am to say they're working on ""paperwork"" (they are for sure not working from home during this time). Sometimes they stay to 5:30 but that seems to be a toss-up. Basically, they're working \*at minimum\* 4 hours less per week and getting a 3 day weekend. And yes, the boss knows they're not working those extra hours they're supposed to. We're not allowed to address it or ask for the same 4-day schedule. One coworker did and got immediately shut down with ""we're not discussing this."" 

Obviously, ""going to my union"" should be the solution here but honestly I have very little experience with them and I'm nervous to do so. My boss has a certain personality that is very predisposed to favoritism, pettiness, revenge, etc. I don't really see an upside any which way for me: either they get fired (which I don't imagine would happen and don't want anyway) or, most likely, they just face whatever reprimand and it really blows up in my face and makes things very uncomfortable. We're a fairly small group and work in close quarters. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - All of us work Monday-Friday 40 hrs/week. For reasons unknown, the boss lets 2 people work Monday-Thursday 32-36 hrs/week even though we're all full-time with the same contract (boss lets them fudge their timecards and say they're still doing 40hrs). Boss quickly shut down one coworker who tried to ask if they could have a M-Th schedule as well. ",02Oct2018,1
36,"  I’m not going to deny that I am your stereotypical drug addict. I made some bad decisions in my late teens/early twenties that resulted in a crystal meth addiction. I haven’t experienced homelessness. I’ve held down a job for the last 2 years. Rent a nice big house. I still have my family with three beautiful children and a very gracious wife.  On to why I posted in advice. 

I end up using about once a week and I swear it off after every time. I’ve done this so many times that I really have lost hope. I quite often feel like my family would be better off if I wasn’t in the picture. I do try and my family loves me but I know I’m so far from the man and father I could be. 

What would you do if you were me? 

Be as frank as you want with me. I know this isn’t a game. I dread the reality that my kids will have huge scar from an addict father that died way too young. However, a big part of me has absorbed the stigma of addiction and thinks that I’m fucked for life because of my stupid decisions in my twenties, thus perpetuating me to continue using. 

Im really tired of just surviving, I want to flourish but don’t know where to start. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

When we have sex he usually finishes at least twice, sometimes 3 or 4 times if we have enough time. We take breaks in between, but  even during round 1 he sometimes pulls out because I get way too tight for him.

I'm by no means petite or too small for him, he's only about 5-6 inches taller than me and is pretty average in the pants zone. He liked it at first but now its becoming a problem and I don't know what I should do. The issue is, I'm sensitive so even without touching my clit I'll still cum multiple times before he does, and I feel bad because sex shouldn't hurt you or your partner.

We both lost our virginities to each other so we're as inexperienced as it gets and that's why I'm asking you guys.

39,"First, I'm in sophomore in high school (11th, Mexico). I always had the philosophy to work only enough for 10 (I see my classmates with upper grades often getting crazy), my final score is at 9.6's so I jump to 10 (A+) (system avarages the grades).

Starting classes I decided to take a step further and improve my grades (9.5, 9.4) and I studied and worked very hard.

I got the results from my tests last week and they were very good, the best I've gotten in high school...

50 - Exam

20 - Biweekly Tests

30 - Work and Hmwk

So I struggled with biweekly test (9 and 8) and my exam, I know the answer but idk how I screw it with stupid answers and distraction.

Please give me advice to improve it, each year I see system is bringing me down and now that I want to improve, it worsens. At least I've the opportunity to improve next 2 partials and avarage it to 10.

46,"So... I'm a girl in her early 20's and I'm leaving my home country because it's become impossible to live here, the place is almost in total poverty and if I stay I won't have a future. But I have two options to move in and I don't know which one to choose! I need some advice, help.

**My first option:** is where half of my family lives. I'll be able to stay in their house and since they're my family I won't have to pay rent. I'll only need to work part time and I'll be able to go to college and finish my career in 5 years as is the usual in this country. 

But this country is highly xenophobic against my home country. You can go out and see posters on the streets saying stuff like ""we don't hire people from ****"", ""people from **** go home"", ""**** are criminals and whores"". People abuse of us on the streets and when it comes to social media about this situation, of 200 messages, only 3 or 4 won't be xenophobic. My family gets away with this easily because they're from here and they physically look like the rest of the locals, but we're all mixed and I completelly look like the other half of my family. People of my race aren't exactly very welcome and sometimes can be harassed. I also can't inherit the cityzenship from my family, I can explain in the comments if you're curious.

**My second option:** I don't know anyone here. Once I arrive I'll have to sleep in a shelter because I can't afford an hotel reservation until I find a roommate and a good place to live. Also, I'll have to find a job asap before I run out of the little money I have. Since I'll be working full time to live I'll have to take less classes per semester and I'll probably be graduating in 8 - 9 years, probably in my 30's. My family won't support this decision because they've had personal problems with people from this country and think it's some kind of treason to move here. They're kind of classists and think that it's shameful to graduate so late.

This country has also racism and xenophobia problems but they're not that bad... for me. I look like any other person born here so it won't be such a big deal and locals use to be pretty friendly and welcome with people from my home country. Of course, it won't be perfect and I know I'll face discrimination one day but it won't be that bad, it's easy to adapt to this country. Also, I can get my citizenship in 3 - 4 years easily.

After my friend bitched her out basically, without my knowledge, said best friend snapchatted me a drunk video of her apologizing.

We’ve had a long history, and she’s a very self involved person (convo always comes back to her), which has always been a quirk of hers I always thought was funny.

We only talk about her and her problems, which I didn’t realize how bad it actually is until this.

Said best friend is also new best friends with people who used to spread constant rumors about me after they stopped being friends with me. I know it’s petty bullshit to feel annoyed about it, but I can’t help it. They have even talked bad about her as well- which she is aware of. However, I even told her that it bothers me, and she told me that i’m over reacting and that she would never chose them over me, but I feel like she already has? I realize this is probably immature it just totally fucking sucks.

Not only that, but she kept acting like nothing had happened and that everything was okay. I told her that we’re not automatically okay, and that I needed time to figure it out and how I can go about this properly so I wasn’t a terrible friend to her.

My friend recently started working at a small family owned farm. It's mostly manual labor but my friend is glad just to have any work at all. It's undocumented and under the table, but, again, my friend is so relieved to have it


Anyway one day I went to pick up my friend from there but they weren't finished with work so I had to wait. While I was waiting a young man came over and started talking to me. It turned out it was the owners adopted son. We talked about different things, typical chit chat. stuff like what movies do I like, etc. He randomly asked if I liked Star Wars. I told  him I did. He was a big fan too. Etc etc 

My friend finally showed up I told the son it was nice talking to him and we left. Anyway, I didn't think anything of it at the time but I apparently made a strong impression on him. 

Several days later I received a text message from the son. He said he got my number from my friend and just wanted to say it was nice to meet me. I said ""same""

I was furious with my friend for giving someone my number without asking for my permission but my friend explained they felt pressured to do whatever the son wanted since they just started working there and didn't want to upset someone so important. (side note: my friend is an African American transgender with a lot of issues. So they really have had a difficult time finding and keeping work). I still felt betrayed but decided to accept my friends apology. 

The next day the farmer's son texted me again and quickly started talking about Star Wars and how great it was that we were both fans and that he really ""liked"" me. 

At this point nothing he said was overly sexual but the WAY he said things made start to think he had sexual feelings for me. (I'm not exactly sure how old he is but I think he's in his early 20s. I'm a male in my 30s)


He continued texting me about Star wars. 
I tried to respectfully get him to stop texting me without upsetting him. I was worried he would take his anger out on my friend at work and/or get his father to fire them. 


This attempt to get him to stop only seemed to increase his efforts. He soon invited me to watch Star Wars with him. I had no interest in doing this but, again, didn't want to upset him so I told him that I was pretty busy for a while and didn't think I was going to be able to watch it with him

He replied that was ok and that he'd take a ""rain check"" and maybe we'd watch it later. 

The next day or maybe the day after I saw my friend and he told me that the son told them that he thought he and I were ""kindred spirits"" and that I gave him a ""rain check"" to watch Star wars with him. Another worker on the farm overhead this and told my friend that the son ""takes rain checks really seriously"" I don't even know what that means but I was troubled to hear it, to say the least. 


He texted me again and asked me about Star Wars and said how great it is that we both love it so much. He said the one thing he didn't like about it was the Ewoks. I immediately said I loved the Ewoks hoping this might turn him off.  It seemed to work because he didn't respond for awhile then said that I ""didn't seem like a guy who would love the Ewoks"" in part because he couldn't believe that about his ""kindred spirits"" He flat out accused me of lying. I responded that maybe we just weren't kindred spirits

He replied ""of course we are"" and it'd be ""crazy to think otherwise lol"" and that we were ""meant to watch Star wars together"" 

I told my friend all of this and they pleaded with me to not watch Star wars with him and that they heard the son did something similar to someone on the farm and they got the impression the son did something terrible to this guy while they were watching. I told them there was obviously no way I was going to do it but they still seemed really worried. 


So then the son sent me an email with the subject ""Hi (my name)! and when I opened the email it was just a pic of him smiling with ""To:(my name)"" written on it. 

 I couldn't believe this guy now had my email and was starting to feel seriously creeped out. I responded ""hello ____"" and that in the future he should only email me in case of an emergency or about something serious. 

That same day he texted me that he received my email but he would continue to email me whenever he felt like it whether or not it was about emergencies/serious issues. 

I told my friend and they said I just shouldn't have responded to the email and that I was screwed. 

They told me that a dog on the farm recently disappeared and there was talk it was because of something the son did to it. Now this really scared me


My friend was really worried about the situation and  put me in touch with the person on the farm who he heard the son had previously done something similar to. I asked for any advice and they basically said I should just watch Star wars with him and get it over with and that I might even enjoy it. I felt so bad for him. It seemed like he convinced hinself he liked what the son did to them just to avoid feeling like he had been taken advantage of and a victim. Basically all of these people who work there are illegals and the son seems to be taking advantage of the situation. 

I asked my friend what they think I should do and they said they honestly don't know. They talked to people in the farm and got the impression NOTHING will slow down the son when he wants something. And if he was willing to possibly do something to make some innocent dog disappear what else was he capable of?

My friend was still trying to help me and put me in touch with someone else they knew who had helped them out on the farm. I was hopeful that they could get me out of the situation but their advice was worse than the last persons. They straight up said ""I'd just do what he wants. Then he'll stop"" I was disgusted 

I told my friend about the ""advice."" They spoke with someone they trusted at work about it and they were told that the person who gave me the advice is basically the sons assistant and does whatever he thinks will help out the son. Not that I really needed it, but this sealed it for me. I wasn't going to follow that aholes advice. 

So then today the son texted me again about watching Star wars and his rain check. He told me to come over tomorrow at 5pm. I said ""I'm not coming over"" He immediately got upset and started angrily talking about the rain check I promised him and that he was cashing it in. I said ""I never said I was giving you a rain check. YOU said that"" He didn't respond and I thought it was maybe over 

But then awhile later he sent me MY ADDRESS

I wrote back ""DO NOT COME HERE""

I am really effin creeped out. I never gave him my address and im not sure how he got it. I can't imagine my friend would give him MY ADDRESS but I don't even know at this point 

A part of me is really scared what he'll do if he comes over but a part of me wants him to because then I can call the cops if he does anything really over the line and the owner will understand and not fire my friend or anything. Then a part of me just thinks the easiest thing for everybody might be just watching the movie with him. 

I'm really not sure what to do and would really appreciate any advice especially from anyone who's maybe experienced something even a little similar

54,"My best friend has some psychological problems and frequents the psychiatrist. So far so good, but it turns out that the psychiatrist asked her to do a test, and it consisted in her being an asshole to everyone and see who was still by her side in the end of it. This is when the problem started.

It seems that it ended today and has been going for 2 or three months (I only discovered today). In the first months I was still supporting her, then another best friend of her went abroad, and I was still supporting her. I stopped being with other friends to spend more time with her, I never left her side and never wanted to be away from her, even if she was being an asshole (it was not her fault). Until a few weeks ago.

2 or 3 weeks ago she basically said she didn't consider me a good friend anymore and started ignoring me completely. I was devastated. It hit me so hard that I decided giving her some space for hers and mine sake. But it was just a test, said her psychiatrist.

Now the test is over and it looks like I lost it because 'I wasn't a good friend that sacrificed his own mental health just so I could be more hurt by this fucking test'. I have to personally talk to her tomorrow and I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to say, but I have to.

63,"My parents have been married for the past 30 years and live together. They could be considered wealthy by some but I still see them as your typical upper middle class family. Im worried that they might be depressed.   


My dad is a real estate investor/developer and my mom works in investment banking. My mom recently got this job so I'm not sure how much money she makes from it but my dad has been making close to $700-$1m from his company in the last 5 years. The problem I see is that all they care about is acquiring more money and gave up on everything else.

&amp;#x200B;

They let thier friendships fall apart. They hardly talk to family apart from me and my sister. They are currently live in a fairly middle-class neighbourhood which they have been in for the last 20 years. The home is literally falling apart, they haven't renovated in 10 years, they don't clean it, their bed frame is broken and they didn't bother fixing it. and the paint on the outside is fading off. They could very easily afford to fix up the house and replace broken furniture but for some reason they have no motivation to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

I encouraged them to just sell the house and buy a much better one but they don't care enough to do so and when I brought it up they told me they cant justify paying more than $250k for a house when they were approved on a $7 million dollar house by the bank.

&amp;#x200B;

They seem to be afraid of spending any of the money they make. Once the money comes into the bank account, 98% of it goes to investments. Even when they go shopping they buy the lowest option for themselves such as Walmart, sometimes the thrift store. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im wondering if anyone can give me some insight on this behaviour. Are they depressed?

A little background, I'm a second year Master of Public Policy student at a state university. I'm a Teaching Assistant for a Research Methods and Data Analysis course for B.A. students in public policy. Most of these students are seniors keep in mind, so senioritis is a factor here.

I've always struggled with social anxiety/depression, although since first enrolling in the MPP program I've been feeling great. My first year was very successful, and TA positions are greatly sought for the tuition remission/pay so I was honored to be chosen for this position.

I absolutely hate it. I'm very goofy/awkward/clumsy and whenever I mess up all I hear is laughter. My social anxiety may be amplifying this kind of stuff but I feel like I'm a joke in front of these students. I know I shouldn't give a shit about what few students think of me because I care about doing my job to the best of my ability, but I leave my discussion sections just wanting to hide away from everybody out of embarrassment.

68,"Ok so first of all I'm an adult male in his 30s.  I'm not on any medication anymore but spent most of my time from 20 - 26 trying various meds to squelch my mood swings and anxiety issues + trying to fix a chronic pain issue, I also ended up delving into some rec drugs to kill suicidal urges (mainly because a friend killed himself which made it super real to me, I get episodes because of it every now and then) I think all of this kind of put my head on backwards a bit.

Anyway.

1. I think I creep women out, but it's weird because the routine is that the ones that seem to think I'm a creep start out like they're attracted to me and flirtatious, or at the very least very friendly, until they realize my situation and then they treat me like a creep.  What is this about?  I look sort of fit for my age, which is weird because my exercise is pretty low intensity, it's due to a still pretty fast metabolism, I'm actually pretty out of shape since I can't do a lot because of my back.  So maybe that sends a signal that makes them interested but then as soon as they scratch beneath the surface they start getting tense and I'm a creep for not living up to the expectation or something?

2. I have a really bad wandering eye and I'm trying to fix it, this kind of ties into #1 because that's what sends the signal to some women I think to ping me for information because they feel an initial mutual interest there (my guess is it's based purely on sex since the wandering eye is me looking at attractive things and them then inquiring with me for information is because they catch it and feel attraction).  I have to focus to not have wandering eye so of course when I'm busy with other things and forget to not focus on keeping my eyes in check, there it goes.  Any idea how to fix this?  It causes a lot of social problems I would rather avoid.

3. I do this thing sometimes where I air guitar, but it's because I know how to play (though I don't really play anymore due to pain).  There was a thing a while back where someone asked me about hobbies and I did a air guitar fingerpick thing which since I know how to play fingers on each hand were doing really quick dexterous movements for a couple seconds, it was an instinctual response for some reason and I am doing it all the time in public when I hear a song I know, either in the environment or in my head.  Anyway when I did this in that setting, that woman did a pelvic thrust motion and clenched her legs tight and sat uo straighter.  When we were parting ways she looked about a half-inch off from my groin and grinned before walking away.  I don't know if she did it because this was arousing somehow (which I never viewed as a possibility until this occurence), or if the whole thing was me creeping her out so the clench + thrust + straighter posture was her feeling sick from it and then the grin was her making fun of my pants as a social knock?  In the moment I was feeling realpy attracted to her after the clench + thrust + straighter posture thing like it sent out some ""scent"" (sorry I know! but it's the best way I can put it) that made me really aroused, I'm not trying to sound egotistical it was just that prior to that reaction from her she was attractive but I didn't feel anything until after she had that reaction, at which point I felt my tone get deeper and I became hugely aware of everything she was doing, at one point I could see the moistness of her tonsils like she was opening her mouth wider for some reason, I'm just looking for insight here.  She said something about having me ""come back later that night if I wanted"" which went over my head and in hindsight I've been viewing it as her trying to trick me to come back because in the interim she was going to call someone over to be there in case I showed up to beat me up?  I have a way of overthinking things and again the meds + rec drugs trying to solve my issues/prevent an impulsive suicide attempt may have screwed me up.  My instinct in the moment was ""I accidentally made her horny but she's intimidatingly attractive now"".

My dad is upset with my brother and SIL, and has confided in me the reasons why (which mostly amount to feeling disrespected and taken advantage of) and I sort of? understand his perspective. I don't agree, but we discussed that it may due to a generation/culture gap. Despite being aware of this though, he refuses to yield on his stance.

My brother (who lives on the other side of the country) is only vaguely aware that my dad is giving him the cold shoulder. He's completely in the dark as to the reason why, and I resolved early on that I wasn't going to get personally involved with the feud in order to maintain a positive relationship with both sides.

Ever since my daughter started kindergarten she’s had a change in her personality. Before she was fiercely independent and self assured, now, she follows us from room to room and gets anxious any time she is alone. She has a younger sister who is about to turn one and we noticed she was a little more demanding of our attention but for the most part she handled the new addition super well. My 5yo has almost never slept in her bed the entire night (usually sneaking in in the early morning) and the baby is currently sleeping in our room for breastfeeding convenience. We don’t mind if she comes in after we’ve gotten a few hours of sleep but currently she’s getting up before we even go to bed. 

My wife and I are torn because on the one hand, she seems to be legitimately upset/afraid even though she can’t explain why. We don’t want her to undergo any undo stress/anxiety or to feel like we don’t love her. On the other hand, we need our sleep just as much as she does and does she need to learn to self soothe and be self reliant. I’m not sure of this but part of me is worried that this is just a nightly tantrum to get her way and we need to give her some tough love and set some boundaries. 

We’ve already bought a special “nightlight time to get out of bed” alarm clock thing and several night lights to make her bedroom as “un-scary” as possible and we’ve cut out 90% of her tv time and only let her watch the most happy/upbeat shows possible. 

She usually initially goes to bed pretty easily but once she wakes up crying I either have to sit in her room until she falls back asleep (almost never works) or wait until I’m too tired to fight it anymore and let her come into our room. 

Please help. I’m so tired.

75,"Throwaway to protect identities and asking for a family member not familiar with Reddit. 

My brother just found out that his ex-wife (several years divorced) is an escort. We come from a pretty conservative family so we aren't familiar with the sex industry.  That said my brother has taken the approach that he'll support his ex as much as he can, that she's a grown person who can make her own decisions, that he doesn't have a say in what she does, and thus won't try to weight in on her choice of occupation.  But a point of concern for him is that his ex has partial custody of their 9 year old daughter.  

A little background: Part of the reason why they divorced was because of a growing lack of trust in her.  And shortly after the divorce, his ex started having problems with prescription drugs and what was once joint custody is now partial custody in my brother's favor.  It seems like she has overcome her substance abuse problem and my brother has supported her through that. My brother wishes for his ex and daughter to have a good relationship, so he's not going to use the fact that his ex is a sex worker as a way to gain full custody (prostitution is illegal in his jurisdiction).  As said above, he doesn't care what his ex does for a living, he just cares about the safety of his daughter.  

Because of our ignorance in this world, my brother and I believed that all ""transactions"" were done either in a hotel or at a client's residence, however we just learned that some of her services are ""incall"" meaning that clients come to her house.  Which in turn means that her clients know where his daughter lives. And I've been to the house, so I know that there are pictures of my niece around.

That said, what questions should my brother be asking his ex-wife to ensure the safety of his 9 year old daughter? Are there any precautions that he can take (other than requesting full custody) to ensure the safety of his daughter?",02Oct2018,1

I know all men in my major who initiate conversations with me aren't hitting on me, but how do I become less defensive?

I'd rather not be friends with someone than deal with the awkwardness or harassment that comes from being friendly to the wrong /r/niceguy.

Like with girls I'm never worried because even if, on the off-chance, they're gay and attracted to me, chicks take rejection way better and are rarely creepy.

Basically I thought about suicide all my life, but somehow I made it and graduated from university a year ago, which let me get an apartment and go away from the hell of my home.

My sister is 8 years younger (she is currently in high school) and I feel like all that abuse is affecting her a lot more because she is having problems with panic attacks and anxiety that is affecting her studies. My father is not as abusive as he was when I was younger, but he is still a shitty person so im pretty sure that he is the reason why  my sister is having this issues.

Im not making a lot of money but I decided to pay for therapy for my sister and my mom, as I feel that if i had that opportunity when I was younger everything would have being easier, Its being like 5 months of that and things are even worst now. My sister cant even go to school, my mom is really depressed, and my dad is an useless shit as always.

This weekend I visited them and talked a little bit with my sister about that, and turns out that my dad is going with them to therapy... Which might be a good thing I thought. I asked her what the therapist was saying about all the abuse of my father (he is basically a controller, my sister and mom have to show him their text and social media everyday, if they talk with someone he gets upset and insult them, if they dont do what he wants he sometimes hit them, and stuff like that) and turns out that they dont talk about that at all. They just sit there and my father controls the session and pretend to be the perfect father (he always does that with strangers).

So, I dont know if its because I cant pay for the best therapist and he cant control the sessions instead of letting my father lie about everything, or if its my sister and mother fault for not telling him the truth. I didnt realized that my father was going with them too until this weekend, probably he prohibid them to tell me that.

How can we overcome this? While im writing this I realize that it might seem that I dont care about all his abuse, but I do, Its just that I have being in this environment all my life and subconsciously this is normal for me (Im trying to change this, but its difficult). Multiple times I tried to involve the police but my mother threated to kill herself if i did something like that.

Should I continue waiting for the therapy to do something? Should I stop paying for it and save money for someone better? 

I totally know that the easiest solution will be to get my family away from my father, but thats not an option for me.

Any advice will be appreciated, and sorry for my english. I can clarify anything if needed.",02Oct2018,1
90,"Ive been sad for at least ten years now. When I was in high school my mom started doing a ton of drugs because of depression/pain related to arthritis and my dad did nothing about it. I was always a weird kid with no friends but when that happened I completly shut down and decided to stop interacting with anyone or anything until I could leave home for college. I built up college in my mind as a heavenly place where I would meet people like me and there would be no problems. Mom kept getting worse and worse and had psychotic breaks, eventually burning our house down. My dad asked a friend of mine to take me in for a year until I graduated, he then moved to a different town closer to work with my mom.   


I went to college and worked constantly get a cum laude triple major in Math, CS, and Physics. I had horrible social skills and the only friends I had were people who tried to help me for being obviously miserable and who respected my work ethic. All of them in time grew to dislike me for having no social skills and emotional problems. I got a job at Amazon in Seattle after graduating and have worked in an emotionless room writing software that takes numbers from one place and puts them into another  for three years, in a city where it rains constantly. I occasionally would try dating - it'd fall apart each time within weeks due to my lack of emotiona lawareness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few friends who I hang out with once every while. They never invite me to anything - I used to be invited to things but then I called somone an alcoholic because he drank a lot of alcohol and now I never get invited anywhere anymore. Last time my friends were over they spent the whole time talking about a movie night they were all just at that I wasnt invited to.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont want to do anything any more. Im tired of working hard only to forever be emotionally ruined. I will never catch up on emotional and social skills at this point. Im tired of missing social queues, and people learning that the best way to get by with me is to ignore me and give me byzantine kafkaesque computer problems no normal person could be bothered to do.

91,"I’m 19, a sophomore in college, and this girl from my senior year of high school continues to try to pry into my life, after two years. 

I thought I had her blocked on all accounts, but somehow she either never got blocked or is managing to get unblocked. This has happened three separate times.

1. Last year; On some “which friend is lost likely” type of app (I deleted it, forgot the name) she tried adding me

2. Earlier this year; she managed to view my public Snapchat story, though she was blocked?

3. Tonight; she accessed my art account on Instagram and liked my most recent post.

I don’t get why she keeps trying to enter my life, as we were on bad terms and in high school she tried turning all of my friends against me and drove me nuts with other bullshit. 

What should I do about this? I really don’t want to talk to her and have any conversation with her ever again, but I’m tired of her constantly popping up in my notifications when I don’t want nor need her in my life at all.

93,"I know this decision ultimately comes down to me. I'm just seeking the opinions of other men my age or older on this topic.

​

I have a girlfriend who lives in Canada. I live in the US. We're long-distance and we've been dating 2 years. We want to be together but the methods for doing so aren't particularly easy nor desirable. I cannot go to college there for financial reasons, I also don't have any ancestry there or any family currently living there -- trust me, we've analyzed this a long time and truly our only options boil down to her going to school here (which she doesn't want to go to school whatsoever), us immigrating to a third-world country to live together, or us just marrying one another.

​

Now marriage is the easiest choice of course, it would be a sure-fire way for us to be together, but it is also the one I am most fearful of.

​

I came from a divorced family, and I've seen my father's, uncle's, friend's, and many other mens' lives ruined from marriage and child support. I like the idea of a wife, and I like the idea of having children -- but I am incredibly worried about marriage. I will admit that I have done quite a bit of perusing through 'Red Pill' related forums sub-reddits for a few years now -- that too could have contributed somewhat to my fear of marriage and having children. But it'd be foolish to just outright ignore the statistics on divorce and the lopsided-family-courts.

​

So I came here to ask for some advice from some of you less biased married (or unmarried) men.

​

What are your opinions on marriage? Should a man get married today? Are you worried about getting married? Do you regret being married if you are married?

​

I really like the girl I'm in a long-distance relationship with. I would also like kids some day. However the statistic that approximately 50% of marriage's end in divorce, and that men generally are the one's who receive far more heat in the case of divorce, it really worries me to get married. I don't want to ever divorce -- I would also still like my freedom to do things and for my wife to not be up my ass all the time (I have some life goals I'd like to attend to). Also many of the married couples I see don't seem particularly happy. So it either just seems like I'm going to end up divorced or in an unhappy marriage... I don't know what to do...

​

Do you guys have any advice for me? I'd really appreciate your input.

Cheers.

94,"**tl;dr**: after a year of ghosting him, boyfriend’s ex is back in his life as soon as she finds out he’s moving on, now she’s in an emergency and I don’t want him to get involved with whatever she’s going through.

My boyfriend’s ex-“girlfriend” has an emergency and her dad texted him about it. I feel like he should no longer be involved in her life at all since they weren’t ever really in a relationship. Instead, she pretty much used him as a fuck buddy (she always rejected him when he asked for them to be official) and didn’t treat him even as a decent human being should, but he was head over heels for her. 

They lost contact for over a year, he and I ended up meeting several months ago, and now that things are really started to get serious with us, his ex magically pops back up into his life and asks him to hang out and whatnot. He’s been rejecting her even though she constantly tries to keep in contact, but I asked him to cut her out of his life completely—the same way that I’ve done my last ex-boyfriend not only because I believe no one should be so involved with their ex especially if they still have feelings and/or continue to pursue you, but because I know it would bother him if I still talked to him.

Now she’s in some kind of situation, and I still don’t think he should get involved regardless if he cares about her well-being. I understand they have history, but it’s not good history, she didn’t treat him right, and I want this relationship to be about us. I’m sorry if this sounds selfish, but I feel like she exists too much in our relationship even without ever meeting her, if that makes sense.

I think it’s fine if he expresses his sympathy, but am I wrong for suggesting that he doesn’t call and get so involved? ",02Oct2018,1
95,"Greetings fellow redditors,

A lot has happened in the past couple of weeks.

 I work at a popular fast food joint as a shift leader. My owner got a new store and about 20% of us decided to follow him as its in the same city. With this new store opening, the company brought in a plethora of trainers for the first couple of weeks. This transition from one store to another is quite large seeing as the one I worked previously was in a mall and this new one is actually a standalone store with 3x as much business. That being said, this job is stressful and I went from working 20 hours a week (because I am a 17-hour semester University Student) to working over 40 a week due to the demand provided by the store. Since the store has opened, I've been so stressed with classes and work that I've lost over 10 lbs and I get between 2-5 hours a sleep every night. 

Anyways, right as the new store opening and I started dealing with this stress, I opted to end my nearly 4 year long relationship. I ended this relationship because I felt stuck and I wanted liberty to do as a please. I lost the motivation to text her and she lives a considerable distance away (2+ hours) which makes it really hard to talk and stay close. We had many trust issues in the relationship and I just wanted to end it before I started hurting because of how little affection I'd be able to provide. Not only that, but I lost a lot of attraction and started looking toward people nearby. 

Remember how I said this company brought in a plethora of trainers? I started dating one not even a week following the break up of my long term relationship. We spent a considerable amount of time together before she had to return. I wear my heart on my sleeve and I started falling for something/someone I don't even know. Following her trip back home (which is well over 7 hours away), I invited her the following weekend to spend time with my and my family. HUGE MISTAKE. I had only hung out with this girl twice and I invited her to see my family. This ruined everything. Not because my family is bad but because I rushed things too hard and too fast. I bought her a plane ticket to see my family and on the road from the air port, everything was great and I really missed her. However, the following days were bad and on my way to take her back home (9 hours), it all fell apart. She admitted that I was moving too fast and it hurts really bad but she's right. The thing with her is that I fell for was that she seems really fun. I'm too busy all the time and I'm a total nerd. She parties, travels everywhere and I was SOOO into that. But she also provided a level of care or something that I never felt in my previous relationship. Long story short, she wanted nothing to do with me after I took her home. It hurts that I fell for this girl so easily but it just felt so right. Part of me knows I want her back but the other part tells me I'm stupid for thinking about it because its hard to ""right"" such a monumental issue so early in the relationship. We never officially ended things  but I'm fairly certain its over.

Given my circumstances. I need some advice. I more/less fell for someone immediately following my ex-girlfriend, spent all my time and effort into something that didn't work because I wear my heart on my sleeve and now I don't know what do. My ex-girlfriend was essentially my best friend because we talked all the time about everything. Shes still holding on and I'm contemplating going back to her but with a contingency to fix some of the issues we had.. but that seems wrong? After causing her pain for 2 weeks, she has no idea what I've done or anything like that and I'm thinking about getting back with her?

At this point in time, I really want to quit my job (because of the stress), drop my classes (1 year from bachelors in chemistry), sell my stuff (I live alone in a shady apartment) and move far away and start over. My friends tell me I'm having a crisis but I'm not sure what to think. ",02Oct2018,1

100,"I saw a new dentist recently for a cleaning, exam and x-ray, my three year old son also had a cleaning and exam at the same place. I don't have dentil insurance, but my health insurance plan has some preventative dental coverage. Two months before the exam, I emailed the office to make sure they accepted my insurance and this is the email I got back.


Hi [Redacted],

I was able to get your dental benefits! Your dental coverage is minimal, but it will cover your initial cleaning, exam &amp; x-rays! Please let me know if there’s anything else I can help you with!


Warmest regards,

[Redacted],
Patient Care Coordinator

So imagine my shock when I get a bill in the mail several months later for $430. They billed my insurance $850, my insurance covered a portion, and they (the dentist office) billed the rest to me. This is for both my son's visit and my own. I feel that her message was misleading, and I would think she would have included in her message what I would be responsible, the way she worded it sounded like it would be fully covered. Also, at my sons appointment,all they did was brush and floss his teeth, then the dentist took a very quick look in his mouth and explained to me that since it's his first time there, it's more about creating a positive experience for him. The entire cleaning and exam was over in about five minutes. That's fine, but I don't appreciate being charged 100s of dollars for him to have a ""positive experience"" with the dentist at the expense of a proper cleaning and exam.

How should I deal with this? Is it worth trying to get them to drop the bill, based on their miscommunication, or should I just pay it and find a more reasonably priced dentist?

This has been a common theme in my life these past few years. I put my comfort above everything else. I haven't cleaned my apartment in ages, I put off responsibilities, I avoid meeting people, I don't change bad habits, all because they would cost me some level of comfort.

Tonight it just hit me. I never used to be this way. I was cool skipping meals or sleep if I had to. I was never concerned with being comfortable. I saw the bigger picture and did what I needed to do, to get where I needed/wanted to be. Now I barely do anything. Any level of discomfort seems to really stress me out. I look at something small like a 5 hour night of sleep, something I wouldve laughed at a few years ago, and feel like my entire day will be stunted unless I get my full 8 hours. Its ridiculous.

I am M 36 and I live alone, my last couple was 6 years ago and there is a girl of 23 YO who I have been meeting for a few years (3), she worked for a while in the same place as me and we liked each other, but then she got pregnant with her ex and she had his son, but whenever she wanted to see me it was because of her needs, whether of affection or money, in these years I have supported her economically and practically it has become a passive relationship where I give my time and my money at her pace , and she only gives me her crumbs of her time, I know that her economic situation is not good and I have really supported her without asking for almost anything in return but I feel that this is destined to fail and end in the worst way possible, what can I do? I have spoken with her, I have faced her I told her that I only want a carnal relationship, nothing sentimental and even with that it seems that she is hooked up to me, I have stopped talking to her, she look for me after and this is what happens, after a year that of this intermittent hide &amp; seek game  I see no solution, I know I want a stable GF and a good relationship with someone but loneliness sometimes does not let me think straight and she with what little she gives to me, makes me think that she love me but ... at what cost?

120,"This will probably sound kind of weird, but, for me, it's been a hair pulling struggle that's leaving me feeling more and more disillusioned and hopeless. I don't expect anyone to be able to turn my life around, but, a little understanding would really help me out. 

So, some background: I'm a 28 year old transwoman. I've always been a shy, quiet, nerd. Kind of a hopeless romantic type. Been with my girlfriend for almost nine years. I grew up in an abusive household, and have had a few anger problems here and there, but overall, my friends and family have considered me to be a very empathetic person. A ""good girl"" I guess. 

Anyway, in the past year, some things happened in rapid-fire succession in my life. In no particular order:

* My estrogen dose was switched from shots to pills. I've come to find out that with a few people, this causes the amount of E1 (estrone) in your blood to be higher than your E2 (the target, estradiol). According to my research, E1 is what surges in girls in their teen years and causes, subjectively, ""bad"" behavior. 

* My abusive, cultist, father passed away. 

* My girlfriend had an allergic reaction to a medication she was taking, and became violent towards me almost every day.

* A new ""friend"" came into my life, who turned out to be a really twisted individual. Lying, manipulative, possibly sociopathic and I believe completely narcissistic. The type that has -no- qualms with hurting people, to any degree. 

Anyway, with all of those things going on, it's like... something just sort of snapped, or changed, in me, idk. I became totally enamored with this new friend, well, even more-so than them, their behavior. It was addictive to be around them and to act like them, like- what I could only imagine heroin would feel like. 

So I started doing things like cutting, lying, emotionally cheating, idolizing anything ""dark"" that I could get my hands on. Which I know sounds really cheesy, but, that's just all that drove me. Suddenly I could only listen to music about power tripping, it's all I could write about, violent films/games/anime were all I could consume... 

I've never felt this before, but, I feel like there's a hole in my heart or something. That's the literal sensation. A numbness, or emptiness or something. That's like- addicted to horrible behavior.

That friend is gone. I've switched back to estrogen shots. My girlfriend is off those meds (and more or less back to her sweet self). And I've mourned my father and moved on. But the behavior lingers. It feels like an infection that keeps wanting to spread. Sigh. It sounds ridiculous, but I don't know what to do.  

I just don't recognize myself anymore. Sometimes I see glimpses of the old me, but, it's like it's fighting this new ""thing"" that keeps trying to win. 

**tl;dr I've spent most of my life as a quiet, shy, hopeless romantic nerdy ""good girl"". I'm a transwoman, and between a change in my hormone administration, my dad dying, my girlfriend having an allergic reaction to a med and becoming abusive, and new friend who was a horrible influence, something in me's snapped and suddenly I'm addicted to bad behavior and can't figure out how to stop despite my hormones being fixed, the friend being gone, and my girlfriend being back to normal.**

133," 

So just a pre text, I’ve had 2 surgeries in the past (a hysterectomy and appendectomy) which I don’t remember at all. But over the summer I had a series of electro convulsive shock treatments about 3 times a week for 2 months. Never had a problem with falling asleep from anesthetic in the past but for some reason the last couple times I do remember falling asleep and it was awful. As soon as the drug came through the IV I was overwhelmed with panic and nausea and felt like a brick was on my chest and I couldn’t breathe and just so uncomfortable and fear. I didn’t have any reaction like I fell asleep but it was so awful for me that I stopped treatment. This week I have a colonoscopy that I’m going fully “under” for. I was doing some research in hopes there is a way I can make it less anxiety filled but I haven’t found anyone who’s had this experience with anesthesia. I read that they use a different drug for electro therapy to put you to sleep called methohexital and for my colonoscopy they’re using propofol so I’m wondering if that has anything to do with it? Has anyone else ever experienced this? Any advice you have/things I should ask the anesthesiologist to do to make that feeing not happen? I’m super anxious about it and just am freaking out about this whole “falling asleep” discomfort. Thanks! ",02Oct2018,1

Due to the fact that I am no longer in Band, I'm finding it harder and harder to relate with some of my oldest friends (mostly computer guys, not the kind of people focused on sports) I still love them all to death, but because of my new lifestyle it has become harder than ever to relate with them, and the only ""connection"" we now have is sitting together at Lunch. 

My friends in CC share a lot more of my interests and I enjoy being around them more.

Am I a bad person for wanting to disassociate with my oldest friends based on interests? I still love them all, but because of my change in lifestyle, I want something different.

138,"So I have been friends with this man for about a year and a half, maybe two? As soon as he was on my radar ( he remembers things about our first time meeting, but I do not) I have been very drawn to him. I was in a relationship so I had to keep it on a friend level and he knew that too. He would come over and even spend the weekend at our house because it was so close to work, and his house was about 30 to 40 minutes away, so it made sense that he would stay over to get to our job in a restaurant the next morning. It just made sense for him to stay in town rather than making the commute. He was my friend, he was my room mates friend, he was my boyfriends friend....

Anyways, over the course of knowing him I've realized that I like so many things about him and he has so many qualities in a person that I like. He's really smart, well-read, independent, funny, creative, sensitive, and just an all around beautiful human being but I couldn't act on any of this because I was in a relationship.

So short-cut to now: the boyfriend and I, that have been having problems for a long time dumped me. It was a relief. He has a lot of issues with depression and has attempted suicide multiple times over the course of our relationship. I love this guy in a friend way at this point, which means I would never leave him high and dry because I love him, ya know?

He and I broke up and I was able to have these other thoughts flow freely about this other person. And I ended up spending a whole weekend at his house for an event that had been planned a month ago. My boyfriend at the time was also invited because we're all friends but he had to work so it was already decided with no hard feelings I would go alone .

We spent the weekend together and my feelings are stronger than before because I don't have the guilt of my relationship with my bf there. I have told my friend I loved him many times but I meant it in a friendship sense, which I still do, but now the feelings are stronger.

What should I do? We plan to keep in contact but I don't want to pick things apart because he is definitely not the type to say things like that. And I think he's pretty damaged from past relationships so if he said ""I love you too"" he would feel weird. Because I tell him I love him all the time and he just says ""I know"". My feelings about him are stating guarded because I just got out of a relationship 2 days ago and I know this all sounds crazy, but, I think I love him to death and wanna tell him that. I'm 31 btw.

140,"I suppose my basic issue is that I can be melodramatic and act impulsively so I’m not sure how to handle certain situations.

I’ve been in committed relationships for the last eight years with only about a month or two in between them. While I had a good man at one time, six years of that time was spent trapped in two physically and sexually abusive relationships. I’ve already hashed our with therapists that this behavior in itself is completely toxic.

However, I’m now with a very sweet, compassionate, gentle, thoughtful person. Basically a unicorn of a man. Every time I expect the worst out of him he surprises me with humor or understanding and not abuse.

However, as time goes on I fantasize about mundane things like living on my own. I revel in the thoughts of having a life completely outside of anyone else. That isn’t to say that my partner smothers me. He gives me space and encourages my independence but it’s more than just wanting a life outside of him.

I truly do love him, but am I reeling from all of my past trauma that I feel resentful of all the wasted years and all the time being isolated and abused? Am I being resentful out of bitterness, am I being entirely unfair to a wonderful man by wanting something outside of him?

I am so conflicted with the idea of staying with him and having one hell of a partner to brag about but also enjoying a moment where I’m single and not pinned down to a future. Is this just a case of that relationship slow down where the honeymoon fizzles out? I’m not sure anymore.

144,"I’m 21M, and one of my part time job is selling suits. Recently a customer working for the RCAF came in and we starting chatting. Turns out he is the (forgive me I don’t know the exact term) guy that oversees the pilots for the RCAF and I told him that I was in the air cadets for 6 years where I got my pilots license. He told me that if I went to a recruiting center they would (provided I pass the aptitude test) take me on almost instantaneously as a pilot. The air force right now is 275 pilots short and given my background it would be a no brainer for them. 

Pros : 
- I’d be making over 100k a year within 5years
- I’d be doing something that I’ve always wanted to do
- Good pension
- the RCAF would pay for the rest of my university
- Get to see the world and travel

Cons :
- I have been with a girlfriend that I love very much and have been for three years. I see potential and perhaps a family later on. 
- Family life as a pilot does not seem ideal especially not for the air force
- I could not physically stay and live in the city that I live in now which would mean, breaking up with my girlfriend, and being away from my family and friends for at least 3/4 years.
- I also have my photography/cinematography business on the side which I love doing. Pursuing a career as a pilot would most definitely mean the end of my business. I also don’t want to lose my art/creative drive. It gives me a sense of fulfillment and meaning. 
- Not a fan at all of the culture within the army

Part of me wants to do it, its a not brainer! Its a very lucrative, fun and exciting lifestyle. I have always wished of becoming a pilot.

I want to tell them how angry I am and how much pain they caused me, but honestly, I think that would just make this person happy. I just want to get rid of all these emotions and be apathetic. But I have to see this person every fucking day. And that makes it hard to just let go.

This person has some serious and very well hidden mental illness and trauma in their past that only I (as of last time we spoke, 8 months ago) know about.

146,"I have something i want talk about. My aunt was verbally abusive and is generally just a really terrible person. But my whole family loves her and is too scared to say anything to her. I'm not the only person she's been like this too. She's horrible to everyone. i can't just ignore her because she always just shows up at my family's house. I wish i could avoid her, i've even found myself hiding in the bathroom when she comes over.She's been on vacation with her children the past couple weeks but she comes back next week. I'm not looking forward to it, but what can i do?


Now, i'm sure you're wondering what exactly she did? Well, it's a very long story, because she's just a bad person in general, but i will post everything. It's very long, but here's a tl;dr. She verbally abused me, stole my painkillers, threatened me, and is just, well...an asshole in general

this is a post about a really bad injury i had, and a series of events that happened over a 3 month period. It's been on my mind for a long time, and i want to get this off my chest. I just can't keep this secret anymore. When i was 20 when i got injured, and because of it, I was living with my aunt. In my opinion, my aunt is a very bad person, and a toxic individual. But, my family likes her, so no one ever calls her on it.

But, before i talk about the actual abuse, i thought i'd go over some of my aunt's past, for context. Plus some of the points that show she's just not a good person, some of this has nothing to do with me, but still.

My aunt doesn't work, and lives off of military benefits, which is why they wanted me to stay with her, since she's home all day. Because she was widowed about 8 years ago. I don't remember much of her husband, but i remember he was a soldier in the army, he was a pretty nice person from what i remember though. Anyway, they had to move to another state due to him being stationed there. That's why i haven't got many memories of him, just when they'd visit. They had 2 kids together, a boy and a girl. about 8 years ago, the unthinkable happened. I know They seemed happy for a while, but after a few years, they argued a lot. I'm not sure why, though. I know they were on the brink of divorce, i heard from my dad it was because whenever he was home, he'd either sleep all day, or hung out with his friends a lot. I'm not 100% positive though.

But, they didn't actually divorce. He was deployed, and during this time she had cheated on him with another man. I'm not completely positive of the details, but while he was deployed she had an affair and got pregnant. She moved back with my dad after that. Her husband unfortunately passed away in an accident (him and 2 other soldiers were in a black hawk helicopter, which malfunctioned while mid-flight.). So, she has 3 kids now.

But, i think because of insurance or something, i don't know, but her and her family recieve benefits because of the accident, except the 3rd son from the affair. (the kids themselves get health insurance, college tuition, and $50,000 for them in the bank when they turn 18. My aunt however, gets a monthly check, for like 5 grand a month or something.)

She was really just a pain in the backside to deal with, that was until i had to live with her. For about 4 months, she used and abused a serious injury i had for her own benefit. Now, i had a bad knee injury, i was stuck in a wheelchair and using a walker. My family thought it would be best to stay with her, since she's a ""Nurse"". Not really a nurse, she took a medical class one time 15 years ago, and claims herself to be a nurse. She's the kind of person who holds herself to a higher standard, bit of a know-it-all. She is also bipolar and has a really bad anger problem. Everyone in my family knows this, but they still wanted me to live with her.

Now, for a few weeks, it was normal. But, after a few weeks she started to show her true colors. There was Lot's of abuse, quite a few examples, nothing physical, but quite a few emotional and even some threats, i know some of this may seem petty, but please read it all.. Now, i know some of this stuff may seem petty, but please read the whole thing. I have compiled an entire list, in chronological order. However, i will also include some things from my past as well, before this injury incident.

I continuously tried to tell my family, but they'd never care, they'd tell her to quit doing it, but all that did was make her madder. She'd get mad at me for telling my family. She'd yell whenever i would (always when we were alone, never when family was over). She'd literally wait, and as soon as she saw their car leave, that's when the yelling would start. At least with my dad, who they both share an unstable relationship. But, she would yell at me in front of my grandmother. Who was very non-confrontational and timid. I told her to tell my dad, but she never did. I kept telling them, but my aunt would always accuse me of lying to them. My family stopped listening.

Now, keep in mind for this next point, i've always had a bit of a weight problem, i'm only 285 pounds. She used to always make fun of me for being overweight. Always. She'd make various comments about it. Plus, she'd make me wear a shirt in her pool (the only person she made do that) because ""no one wants to see your man-boobs."" Also, she constantly made me watch My 600 Pound life, everyday. She'd make me turn off my phone and stare at the screen, and would shout at me if i so much as looked away. ""That's gonna be you some day"" She would tell me nearly every 5 minutes. Not to mention, recently, she secretly tried to sign me up for weight loss surgery. Without my knowledge. Without my consent. She hurls alot of insults around actually, She's also called me retarted on multiple times.

She's also fond of browbeating me. She'd constantly ask ""Don't you care about you appearance?"" or make rude remarks about the way i looked and dressed. She actually has a fairly strict dress code for her kids. She makes the boys have buzz cutted hair, and only buys them ""nice clothes"", i swear that the boys only get to wear polo and slacks. My personal look is slightly different. I have a large collection of graphic T-Shirts (concerts, anime, wrestling, Jokes) and i always wear shorts, athletic elastic shorts. She always says ""Lose some of that weight and you could wear some actual normal clothes."" But, i hate dressing like that, i like to dress casually. I also have somewhat ""unkempt"" hair in general, it grows fast and sticks up a bit on it's own. She took me to get my haircut, i told the barber to take a bit off the top, making it shorter. But, she flat out shouted at her to cut it as short as they could (not buzzed, but fairly close).

Another thing, with my injury, i had to get surgery. Of course, they gave me some really strong painkillers. hydrocodones, but i got a bottle of 30. I rarely took them since they'd make me a little loopy and very tired. I only really took a few of them, not the whole bottle. But, even though i wasn't taking them...somehow the bottle was empty. And to make it worse, when i went to the doctor after a month, she kept pushing me to ask for more pills. Later, i found out she was taking them herself and selling them as well.

Another thing i can't stand, is she constantly bad mouths my mom, anytime i mention her name. She hates her, because she cheated on my dad. Which is understandable, she says my mom is a horrible person because she cheated on my dad. (I find it a tad hypoctitical, because she cheated on her husband as well. Her deployed husband. I don't justify cheating, but i also hate hypocrisy.I would've called her on it, but she gets even madder when you bring up her affair. Not too mention, whenever she's around my mom, she's nice as can be. Gotta put the mask on, i guess. Another thing, she's been lying to her younger son, that her husband is his father. Her older son doesn't like it, but i don't think he's called her on it either. Keep in mind, the younger son never met her husband because he passed away before he was born. But, during his toddler and early years, her and her kids lived with the person she cheated with.

Plus, she constantly shames me for choosing to go to community college. Both my parents are poor, so i can't afford to go to a university, plus i never really wanted to go a university. It's Just rude comments in general. Because i was supposed to be ""The Smart CHild"". Because my cousin (not her son, a child of my other aunt) goes to a university. She said i was supposed to ""Do Better"" for myself. Of course, i quit college to pursue my dream anyway, so it doesn't matter.

But the worst part, was the yelling. The yelling was horrible. For a bit, she'd only yell at her kids and not me. I thought she'd have the common decency, that you don't yell at children who aren't yours. But, i guess not.

After a few weeks, tell me if you think this is a big issue. Some mornings, she'd go out and get McDonald's breakfast when she didn't have time to cook. The whole time, i had gotten bacon. One night, i was about to go to bed, and she wasn't there, she was at a ball game for her son, but my dad was. Before he left, i told him if he saw her to tell her i'd rather have chicken from now on. Because i wanted to go to bed before she got home. THat's not a big issue right?

Well, to her, it was. That morning, my grandmother came to take me to physical therapy. Soon as i got up, she just started screaming. SHe was calling me ungrateful, asking why i couldn't tell her about my preference, i tried to explain that i was going to bed, but she just did not want to listen. She said a lot of stuff actually, in front of my grandmother because she knows my grandmother is very timid and won't confront her. I told her to tell my dad, i thought that would be the end, my last night living there. But no. No one ever said anything to her. I had never felt more on my own in my life. My mom was at that appointment, i told her how bad it was (i told my dad since he lives close, but mom lives pretty far away, in another county). I told her, she was absolutely horrified. My grandmother was actually defending her ""Oh, she's just a little highly strung. I'm sure your just exagerating."" Mom told me she'd try to get me out. But, she made a mistake, she called her beforehand. My aunt has a really bad habit of outright lying to protect herself. She told her a bunch of lies about me, outrageous stuff to. SHe believed her, and that was it. I couldn't depend on mom for help anymore. My aunt sounded so nice on the phone with mom, but as soon as she hung up, she started screaming at me. It continued like this for a long time.

She'd get mad over all sorts of petty stuff, like accidentally dropping stoff and forgetting to pick it up (like shampoo bottles). ""Just because your mama lets you treat her house like shit doesn't mean you can come fuck up my house!"" or leavign the light on by accident. But, a big thing was her couch...a couch she's had for a few years. I sat in it, because you know, i was injured and couldn't really get around much. She has 2 couches in her living room, one i usually sat on and her's. I sat on that one because it was a little more firm and easier to stand up from. THe other one was very soft and sunk down a lot, making it tough to get up from.

Then, one day she started screaming at me, that there was a hole sinking in it from where i sat on it so much. Even though, i looked at it myself and there wasn't a hole at all. Even my dad, i asked him just out of the blue if there was a hole, and he said no. Anyway, after my lecture, the next day i tried to be good and sit on the other couch. You know what she told me? ""Sit on the other couch, i'm going to take a nap before i pick up the kids"", i couldn't win for losing, i swear.

I hated it, becasue she'd just go on forever. This was a dealbreaker. I felt like i was in a prison, i told my dad, but he never really tried to confront her or anything. He never tried to get me out or anything. Not to mention, any time she'd yell, she'd always finish with ""Yeah, go cry to your mama. I know how you are.""

She also forced me to sign up for food stamps (against my own will) because ""Your fat ass needs to contribute.""

I Just wanted to call the police or something, but i didn't know what to do. I didn't think it would help. I just bared with it for about 3 months.

Thankfully, i did get out. My grandmother took me to therapy one day, and once my appointment was over, she went to take me to my aunt's house, but she wasn't home, she was taking her older son for chinese food. So, my grandmother took me to her house (also living their are my dad, and my grandpa). I told them that i didn't want to live with my aunt anymore, and that was it. Right? Wrong.

After telling my family what happened, i half expected her to get chewed out by my dad, and grandpa. But no, no one did or said anything to her. But at least i was safe, right?

No, actually. She came over and visited the house quite often. I ignored her, never looked at her or anything. She told my grandpa that i only left her house because i didn't want to exercise, which isn't true at all. My dad took me to a walking trail everyday, not her, and he still did when i moved. The reason i left was because she was a complete psychopath. But, she's that kind of person who can't blame herslef for her own problems.

The worst time she yelled at me was when my grandmother invited my mom for Thanksgiving. My mom didn't really have anything to do for Thanksgiving, My grandma thought it would be nice to invite her to spend it with my dad's side of the family. I was a bit worried about it, since my parents didn't really get along, they aren't as hostile but are not friends. They'll talk to each other here and now, if they have to.

Now, my family aren't particularly fond of my mom, but when i brought it up, they all seemed ok about it. Not excited, but willing to accept (since i hadn't seen mom in quite a while at this time). I thought it would be ok, that was until my aunt found out. Keep in mind, i didn't ask her because of the tension with her and my family, but my grandmother insisted. So, about a week or so before thanksgiving, my aunt came over. She just asked about her coming, i told her i didn't invite her, but it was somehow my fault. Because ""i need to think of my dad"", even though he seemed ok with it. She went on a long winded rant about how horrible mom is, i tried to tell her it wasn't my idea. Then she starts yelling at me, i don't even know what set her off, but she started insulting me, she said i was nasty, called me a fatass, fatass, nasty, ungrateful, spoiled, quite a lot of things. I ""gray rocked"" her, which is essentially just ignoring someone, which didn't help much. Sheeven made up stuff like how i NEVER walked up there and wiped shit on her walls. she also said i was faking my injury and would be hurt again in a month.

She threatened to flip my chair over, raised her hand to me and got right in my face and threatened to hit me. I pulled my phone out, i was going to record her and send it to the police. She snatched it out of my hand and threw it on the ground (it didn't break, but still).

i remember she said something like ""has nothing to do with him for 10 years, and he still defend the little bastard"" and ""my kids don't act like that""

As if! I can't count the number of times she's had to go to school because of their behavior.

Seriously, a lot of the things she said were just made up. Like the couch.

its a couch she's had for 10 years. apparently me sitting on it caused a dent in it.

guess what? NO DENTS. Dad didn't even see one, at all.

She also said ""just because you don't have nice things where you live doesn't mean you cam tear up my stuff "" i told her we are well taken care of and do have nice things.

""All your clothes are from goodwill and smell like piss""

My other aunt heard the whole thing, i told her to call the police, but she said there was nothing she did was wrong. It's only illegal if she actually hit me, which she didn't hit me but threatened to. So, i didn't call them.

Even worse though, i told my dad, he said he'd talk to her, but he never did. He never confronted her or anything, and eventually everyone forgot about it.

Even after everything, no one cares, they still like her and let her come over. She hasn't gone into any rages like that since, but she still makes rude comments constantly about me.

And to be honest, it's not just me, i'm not the only person who's dealt with her, if she doesn't get her way, she goes into a tyrade, and to be honest, she's kind of a bad person in general.

Recently, she was kicked out of her apartment, because her and her kids completely trashed it. I'm serious, there were drawings on the wall, holes in the wall, and worse. So, he promptly kicked her out and sued her for damages. The case hasn't been resolved yet, but recently she was bragging that the judge would let her off because she's a single mother and because of sympathy. That's literally her only justification.

Because of that, she moved into my other aunt's trailer. She was supposed to pay 400 dollars to her sister a month for living there. But, no, she pitched a fit again, and now my sister lets her live there for free. Her only justification? Well, 10 years ago, my other sister lived with her and didn't pay rent then. That's it.

She's kind of racist as well, and makes no effort to hide it. There's a coach on her son's little league team, who happens to be black. And whenever she mentions him, she never refers to him by name (his name's Ben, by the way), just as ""That N*r"". It gets worse though, one time, the other coach was telling her that Ben wanted her to talk to her son because he is very aggressive and violent with other kids on the team. She responded with ""WHy should i care what that spearchucker thinks?"", there's plenty more examples, another prominent one is that one time she was talking on the phone about Ben, she mentioned ""How would i know what he said? I can't read jungle drums."" Also, there was a time that her older son was on the football team his freshman year, and they were making him pick up the balls that player's dropped during practice, and things like that, which she refers to as ""N*R work)

Recently, there was an incident with my grandfather's farm hand (he owns a farm, he hired this guy to help, since my grandfather is kind of old and sick and just can't take care of it anymore). Real nice kid, and when my aunt was moving, she asked him to help her move. She paid him and he showed up to help. However, she went out all day, and it was almost 9 in the evening, he went home after waiting on her all evening. and SHe was mad at him because he went home with her money (she paid him in advance).

Also, her 7 year old son is violent and very ill tempered. And, she irresponsibly buys him knives and guns.(He's actually threatened to kill my sister in her sleep before). Her new boyfriend takes him out in the yard to shoot, and he walks around the house with them. He actually has easy access to the guns, they are not locked up or anything. Just about a week ago, my aunt was talking to her friend and he got out one of their guns and was parading around the house with it. Another big deal is she doesn't bother to teach him any safety tips. The guns are loaded and he was walking around with his finger on the trigger. (Which if you know about gun safety is a BIG NO-NO, it is like rule number 1. Never touch the trigger until you are ready to shoot.) She doesn't realize that a kid with that much anger management issues having easy access to a gun is a bad idea.

(She also bathes with her 8 year old son, just throwing that out there)

One time, my dad bought a car, it was an expensive car, and he had been paying monthly on it for about 3 years or so. And, she didn't have a car (she didn't pay the bills) so they repossessed it, and my dad let her borrow his car. She never paid any payments on it, even though she drove it all over the city. Plus, her kids tore up one of the seats. They tore up the motor in it because they were messing with it, moving it back and forth, now it's stuck right up against the dashboard, and nobody can actually sit there now. Plus, there's marker all over the car too.

She lets her son drive alone, across town, even when he was 14. And she lets her 7 year old drive and steer.

She also has a bad habit of encouraging violence. She was praising her son for breaking another boy's hand at a football game (is that really something to be proud of?). Also, her younger son was left on the side during a football game. She was so mad, that she told her son to beat up the coach's ""Little Fag"" on the field (the coach made his son the quarterback).

Thank you for reading my wall of text, i'm sorry if it seemed like i was venting, but I just feel someone who treats everyone like shit doesn't deserve to live the high life. They get to buy houses, cars, and everything without having to work or earn anything. They'll get college paid for, and 50 grand as soon as they turn 18. It just seems kind of unfair, because my dad works over 50 hours a week, and can still barely make ends meet (plus he's constantly sick, because he has to wake up every day at 5am and can barely ever get sleep). It's made especially bad because her older son constantly brags about all the stuff he'll buy with it. Plus, she always borrows money, even though she makes way more then anyone else.",02Oct2018,1
147,"A friend of mine that I've known for roughly 5 years now has been being systematically abused, verbally, emotionally, and physically by her parents.

Skipping straight to the point, recently, her situation has been made much worse. She was enrolled into college with zero control over what her classes were, her schedule, or anything. Even her school emails and college portal for example, completely dictated by her parents. Which is absurd, because the friend in question is over 18.

And most of her classes (completely arranged by their parents) cover topics they know nothing about.

For example, two daily c++ classes while prior to college she had never touched c++ before.

So, shes failing, and hard. And it's getting to her mentally, to a very large degree.

Their parents are already contacting them by phone and other methods, while monitoring their grades because they have complete access to everything, and telling her that shes failing and one of the parents is verbally harassing them over this ordeal for hours at a time

This hastily written out reddit post does in no way encapsulate the full scale of the abuse that has occurred, because that would be absurdly long, and I need to get advice regarding the ongoing situation.

Who could my friend contact in college, what positions?

What is *anything* they could they do or try to get out of this extremely shitty situation.

They were planning to try and get out of their parents grasp after college ends (their parents have withheld basic documents, like birth certificate and social security card, and prior to college, prevented her from obtaining a job, but the time in college we thought would let her obtain them in secret, preparing over a large timespan)

But this is completely absurd at this point, her schedule, which was not set up by her, leaves her with absolutely no free time, in things that she's massively struggling with and don't even know the basics of.

And I outright don't know what to do to help them.

Disclaimer: This is in no way intended to be a sob story, I need applicable advice that I can investigate and relay to them, anything.",02Oct2018,1

151,"in my junior year of high school i had to be online schooled. my mom, brother, and i lived with my aunt and uncle because my mom was financially unable to care for my brother and me. my mom was never a mom to me, thus she was always gone and never really took the time to raise me. my aunt and uncle kind of just stayed out my mom and my’s way bc they had their own life going on. so i’d stay in my room and do my schoolwork online. i was always too scared to ask to go somewhere because i knew i’d be yelled at or there wouldn’t be enough money to let me stay at a coffee shop or something. and i stayed in my room alone for 8 months. my circadian rhythm became completely overturned. i’d sleep all day and be awake from 2am to 10am doing my work. and since i have a past trauma of being molested for 5 years, it kept me up all night. sadly, the same thing is happening again. i’m a senior now. my mom, brother, and i moved out of my aunt and uncle’s house and we live on our own. but money is tighter than ever. i still have to do online school. we don’t have money to get me a car, i can’t get a license bc insurance is too expensive, and i have a hard time getting a job because i don’t have the ability to travel to my job. it just seems like a dead end. how do i survive another 5 months of staying inside my room all day?

152,"I am 19, used to live with abusive father. Horribly depressed and suicidal since I was 14, finally ran away with my mother 2 years ago. Since then my dad is back in my life and I have to deal with it because he pays for my uni in full.

I am falling in a deep pit now. The design major I chose has not much income in my country. It was a mistake. If I switch to my alternative, computer science, I will need another 5/6 years in contact with my father. If I stay on with current, I will graduate in 1 year and 3 months. 

Thing is... I really dont know if I can deal with 5 years with him. I am trapped, I cannot stop crying. But it really could change my future ahead. But I really really dont know whether I could deal with so many more years. I am told to not have friends, and am monitored. I am miserable at home. He is scary. I dont live with him, still constant contact. 

Or should I stay on with my design? I used to have a passion for it. That has faded. But I graduate fast. I can get a part time job. Will manage to travel a bit with this money + my allowance for as long as i am studying. But I really dont know about my future job... I will not make much money... My dream is to travel and live abroad. I will struggle to do that with my own income once I grad and with a job that isnt in demand as computer science! I dont even think I can get a job abroad!!! and my parents are constantly struggling financially and I DO NOT want to be like that ever!

But I dont know how!!!! I can live like this for another 5 years!!!!!!! I am concerned of suicide. I really NEED to leave this country. I'm drained. Ive never been out my city since I was 13 and am desperate. An compu science degree could be my ticket away from this country. I know I have to think of my future but i dont know if i will even live to have a future if I do this............ Please help me",02Oct2018,1
153,"Hello Reddit.

I have a situation and I'm not sure how to handle it. Throwaway because obviously. My friend (we'll call her N) who i've known for 15 years is getting married. She lives back home, and I live in a city about 300mi away for university. 

N texts me one evening last year to tell me that she's planning on asking another friend (K) to be her maid of honor, but still asks me to be a bridesmaid. Because of the distance and other factors (K is notoriously hard to get along with), I declined being a bridesmaid. If she would have asked me to be her MOH, I would have declined anyways but still felt like I owed it to her to be a bridesmaid. Fast forward a few months, K and N are no longer friends and the MOH spot is filled by a different bridesmaid.

Things are normal between us and some time goes by. In March of this year, K floats the idea by me to gauge interest in a destination bachelorette party in September. I tell her i'd be happy to attend. She sends me an actual invitation via text in late April and I accept. I'm then added to a private facebook group where planning information is supposed to be posted. K is involved in all of the planning, and her MOH is not throwing the party for her. I purchase plane tickets for the dates she chooses and then hear nothing from her (nothing is posted online either) until I see a picture post on Facebook. It's a picture of their drinks at the airport before they leave. Good thing my tickets are refundable.

All of that weekend there's photos and videos posted on social media, but I don't hear a single word from her. Two weeks later, I receive a card in the mail. It's an invite to her bridal shower. 

Am I wrong to feel slighted by this? After two invites to her bachelorette party, she forgets about me just long enough to jet off with her other friends, yet invites me to an event she knows I can't attend (it's being held early-on in week of the wedding), and also requires a gift. I know that wedding planning is a huge ordeal, but I feel like I was either deliberately left behind or legitimately forgotten. I'm not sure which is worse. At this point, I'm not even sure it's worth making a big deal about, as it seems like she's been drifting towards a different kind of friend group since she met her fiance. My immediate reaction is to go to the wedding since I've already paid for non-refundable accommodations, offer my congratulations, and then quietly disappear from her life. Another friend of mine is telling me to not go to the wedding at all, since she clearly doesn't want me around that badly. I'm not even sure how to approach the subject without sounding self-centered. After all, it's her day and not mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Friend of 15 years either ditches or forgets me over bachelorette party, instead invites me to events requiring gifts. Do I forget about it and move on, or tell her to fuck off?",02Oct2018,1
154,My gf has been acting extremely depressed over the summer and has even self harmed so many times she says it doesnt hurt anymore. How do I get her to stop. I know its not easy as I too used to self harm but it has been over 2 years now and i forgot how i actually stopped. Her family isnt helping either cuz when she tries opening up to them they just tell her to stop being a pussy. I am not joking that is what they told her. I really want to help her cuz it kills me seeing her like this but i dont know how.,02Oct2018,1
155,"So I just wanna come out of the gate and say that I'm 16. I feel like maybe we can all relate to doing some dumb things and what I did today really takes the cake for the dumbest things I've ever done.

&amp;#x200B;

Context - Once before I used my grandmas credit card (CC) and I spent around $200. Now I'm not saying I'm proud or anything, its just what I spent. Anyway, when my dad found out he was livid! However, I didn't get that harsh of a punishment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Up to date - So, once before after the whole grandma thing I stopped using CC's without permission of my parents. However, my apple ID stopped letting me purchasing things because the balance on my fathers card was empty at the time. So I used my moms so I could download snapchat and some other social media apps, etc. However, after a while I spent around $10 on the card for a game. (Once again not proud). Anyway, my mom found out about 2 hours ago and the guilt and what I expect to be a harsh punishment are really getting to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It really sucks because I know I messed up on so many levels. 1) My use of electronics - I believe my parents are gonna take everything away from me for a while and I'm worried because I currently have a girl that I've been talking to, and it would really be bad if she lost interest because I can't communicate enough. 2) I'm afraid I'll never be trusted with electronics and I'll have parent controls set on everything. 3) Trust - I know I'll get it back. But I don't think I'm ready for how long its gonna take. I know how my parents are and I'm worried that this will be the nail in the coffin for them to not trust me for a long time. 

 

Overall, after reading all of that what should I do? What should I expect to be done from my parents ( I understand you guys aren't them, but from your perspective)? Honestly, any thought is okay with me. I'm fine with a hard ass answer saying how I deserve everything that comes to me and I partially agree. ",02Oct2018,1
156,"I’m currently in high school, and I have a friend who I met online that will be moving near me soon (We’ve done meetups, he’s only a year older than me). And so my mom and step-dad who I live with have very... interesting views on the world to say the least. For example, they think all rape accusations against trump are fake and all Hollywood actors are pedophiles. Anyways, so me and this friend have very similar interests. I want to be an actor/director and he wants to be a director. I also have other friends with interests similar to ours. So this kid, some of my friends and I came up with the idea to start our own film production company once we get out of high school, live in the same house, etc. So sometimes I would vent about how obscure and insane my family’s views are to this friend. And based on everything I told him, my friend got PISSED OFF. So much so that he decided to kind of toy with my step-dad on social media. The problem is, if my step-dad connects the dots and manages to trace it back to me, then he’ll find out about all the other stuff I do in my spare time that they don’t like (joking around, acting immature and occasionally offensive, etc. Hell, they don’t even want me on reddit.) There have been occasions where I don’t take my friends into consideration in certain situations and it becomes inconvenient for them as a result. So as a way to send a message, my friend refuses to delete the stuff on social media that he said to my step-dad, so my step-dad is one twitter check away from seeing my friend saying this stuff about him. So this might ruin all of our plans for the future, and completely shatter my lifestyle that consists of frequent gaming and theme park visiting. My friend said he wants me to stick up for myself or some shit. I thought about doing that, and it would be hard to do because I’ve tried to stand up to them in the past but to no avail. Keep in mind it’s already hard for me to argue against adults because I’m on the autistic spectrum. So I’d don’t know what to do at this point. Any advice? Anything would be appreciated.",02Oct2018,1
157,Ok I realize that this is going to seem super dumb and petty. All my older sisters and I were having a late night meal. My sisters enjoy cracking some jokes at my expense. Mostly jokes about how clumsy I am and how I break things on accident a lot. It’s fine I can handle jokes about me for the most part. My sister made a joke about me and I in response gave her the finger. I viewed it as teasing her back but instead she got offended and demanded that I apologize. As far as I see it I shouldn’t apologize for offending her when she seconds before made a sort of offense joke to me. I refused to say sorry and all 3 my sisters got on my case. My blood started to boil and I left before I said  some mean shit... although I did make sure to give each one of my sisters the bird.

158,"Once a week we have a woman come and do a deep clean of the house. 

It really seems like she doesn’t like me. She always gives short answers when I ask her questions and gets flustered if I ask for anything specific (e.g., I asked her to use a specific kind of spray on the counter tops in the kitchen because they’re made of a different material than the other counters) and she responded like I’d criticized her personally. 

I don’t know what it is. We never leave the house despicably unclean when we know she’s coming, we don’t hover, we don’t keep her late, we always pay on time, we’re consistent with our schedule. 

I’ve asked her if everyone’s ok and she always says things are fine. But even then she sounds like she’s repressing some kind of frustration. 

Is there anything I can do? ",02Oct2018,1
160,"First of all, throwaway and all that jazz. Names changed, don't know if it's really that important but hey, it was fun doing the ""I am not a robot"" thing to make this account anyway.

So ""Claire"" went to a party with a few friends, and I happened to catch them as they started walking home. Naturally, they were all pretty smashed, so I thought I would offer to walk them back. Claire, a girl I've been crushing on for a while, was clearly hammered,  as I approached she was saying stuff like ""Hi OP! I love OP, OP I love you,"" you know, like a drunk person. But then, she grabbed my face and started kissing me. I, completely off guard, just sat there like the best Casanova and let it happen. It wasn't too long, but after she stopped she said ""I dont want OP to see me like this"" and then pulled me in again for round two. I was a bit more prepared this time and pulled away, while an equally smashed girl she was with said ""Claire, it is not time to kiss OP"", and that was the end of it.

I helped them get back home, and they all completely forgot that this happened. My first instinct is to say nothing and act like it didn't happen, but I'm coming here because I'm just hoping there's a different option because I've never anticipated being in this situation ever, and I would like to have some sort of relationship with Claire. I'm pretty sure all the answers will be similar to my first reaction, but a guy can hope, right?

TL;DR: A girl I've been crushing on for a while kissed me while she was drunk and I was sober. She forgets, and I know I should just do nothing, but I want to do something

161,"So I am unsure what to do because I feel stuck. I have been with this guy for several months now and at first it was great but now I have seen his true colors I am unsure of what to do. 

Problems started a few months ago when he looked thru my phone and he got mad at the fact that I would text other guys (not flirt mostly just coworkers or classmates.) He was extremely upset and I wasn’t sure why because they were just casual conversations about class/homework/ covering shifts. He also insisted I delete all my social media and I did disable them for a month but started getting them back.

Now here is where things get sketchy, so about a month ago he slept over my house and while I was asleep he downloaded my data for most of my social media accounts. If you don’t know what that means basically you have access to every message, search history, likes, basically everything you’ve ever done in your account since you created it. This makes my skin crawl because I made most of my accounts in middle school and it just creeps me out that he was able to see everything I’ve ever done on the internet even before I met him.

Occasionally he will threaten to post nude photos of me on the internet and I am not sure how serious he is.

I am just overall very unhappy and I feel like he doesn’t like me as much as he thinks he does and I am very scared for my safety if I leave him.",02Oct2018,1

165,"So, basically, I had a deadbeat roommate that only lived with me because another previous roommate, who I didn't know, vouched for him. He was an alcoholic, apparently didn't pay rent for 5 months, said he was going to sign the new lease.

Landlord ran into me one day outside the apartment complex and asked about past due rent that I was totally unaware of. Also said deadbeat roommate was dodging her attempts at getting ahold of him.

Other roommate informs me he lost his job because he had a suicidal episode earlier and got put into detox.

I'm pretty certain he doesn't have any money, his parents live abroad, and he went into detox when we kicked him out after finding out he wasn't paying and wasn't going to sign the lease. And now he's avoiding calls from the landlord and I.

Now I owe 5 months of rent that I can't afford. I can take him to small claims court, but I'm pretty sure it won't do anything because he doesn't have anything. The landlord is being seemingly reasonable and said we weren't at risk of being evicted any time soon, but that can change in a heartbeat, and I don't particularly trust landlords.

Not only that, but apparently he vomited all over his room one night and never cleaned it up. So I get to do a cleaning job that would probably cost hundreds of dollars professionally, and is also just disgusting.

Just not really sure what to do here. I don't need legal advice, I don't think, because the next step is to go to small claims court. Just curious if anyone has been in a similar place or not?

169,"I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. 

I dropped out of high school in grade ten, and went back a year later with the adult education program. Even though I was only 17 they let me take it because I couldn’t handle being around people socially. 

I remember I would walk around covering my face with my jacket and never say a word to people or try to talk to anyone. After finishing grade ten I just never went back because I couldn’t deal with it. I knew my vice principle because he would always try and talk with me and ask me what’s wrong. He suggested I join the adult education program because it would just be adults trying to get their grade twelve and nobody would be trying to talk me. 

So I did that and got my grade twelve in a year and during that year my teacher thought I would like university since I was always picking her brain and asking these pointless questions. 

I was 18 and left to live with my uncle in the city for a year before going to university. I had some money saved up, but I still ended up working two jobs and quitting one. I had a vehicle but I’ve always been scared of driving, so I worked fairly close to where we lived. 

When university is nearing my mom tells me about these dorms on campus so I wouldn’t have to drive across the city every day or take the bus. I move out of my uncles and into a dorm and start going to school. 

The early part of the first term is going somewhat okay. I still get crazy anxiety whenever I’m around people, but when I’m in my room it’s fine. I’m keeping to myself and studying. During the end of the first term I’m really feeling the anxiety and I start drinking to lessen it. I would pour rum in half a bottle of soda and bring it to my classes to calm me down. Then I would drink at night to go to bed because I would always think about my own mortality and how everything is meaningless at night. 

I end up failing two of the three classes I was taking in term one. Then term two rolls around and I tell myself I’ll get back on track, go to class, and stop drinking. I have a student advisor and he notices I haven’t been doing so hot. He keeps trying to tell me to seek professional help, but I can’t accept help for some reason and I don’t like talking about feelings. 

So eventually I manage to fuck it up again and I fail not two, but all three of the classes in term two. I even started smoking during that time for some reason. I decide to drop out of university and move back in with my mom and siblings. I quit drinking and smoking because to them I’m just a happy guy and I didn’t want them to know what’s actually going on. I tell them university just wasn’t for me and that I’ll do something else. 

During my time in university my mom has been using my car for the year because she doesn’t have one. When I moved back in she kept using it for work and shes borrowed over $1,200 over the course of four months. It’s now six months of me living here and she’s telling me to move out (I don’t blame her) but I have no money, no friends, she’s using my car, and I’m depressed and afraid of people and driving. 

What do I do? I would kill myself, but I’m too weak of a person to actually commit. I’m just a leach sucking the blood off of everybody around me. People like me shouldn’t exist.

173,"Hello, 

I hate my job. It’s a decent job. Probably the best job you can have in retail. Decent pay. Great benefits. Good people all the time. However, I’ve been at it for over 16 years. I quit once but after a year came right back. It has consumed my life. 

I hate the hours I work. I hate doing the mundane work. I hate we have a black out period for vacations during the holidays. I hate that I am topped out in pay and I still struggle to pay rent and bills. I hate how in the grand scheme of things this field of work is insignificant. I’m just burnt out. I’ve dabbled in management and it isn’t that much better. If anything I have to get on employees about their performance and attitudes. Wouldn’t even an issue if I gave a shit. Because I don’t give a shit.

You might think I’m ungrateful or lack perspective but I’m slowly realizing that I chose the wrong path in my career. All these things sound superficial but I just don’t want to do them anymore. I can’t just quit though. I need the benefits for a chronic condition I have and the money is good. If I were to quit outright, the only skills I have is retail. I’d only be able to find a job in retail, and end up making half or less of what I make now. 

I have my associates degree but there was no focus. If I could I’d hit school full time and get a bachelors in IT and work with technology. I enjoy building computers and I’m doing my best to get involved in coding. It’s hard to go to school full time and deal with work full time. 

I don’t want to do this job anymore. Not one more day. How do I go about getting my education and leaving my current field? Has anyone been a situation like this and succeeded in getting to where you wanted to be? How did you do it? What did you do? How long did it take? 

Thank you for your time.

176,"19 year old female here, first year of university. As long as I can remember I've had pretty bad anxiety, not so bad that I can't function or anything like that but I get nervous about first interactions and what people think of me. I'm not all that attractive in my own personal opinion and at best I'm a little below average, I've been told I'm pretty by a handful of friends and family and like 3 or 4 strangers. So it's not like I'm the kind of person who gets approached often or even at all.

Like there was a guy at my church choir who I had a crush on for a year and eventually gave up on, and now as of tonight a guy who works at one of the fast food places on my campus.  My friends know this and playfully tease me about ""Choir Boy"" and now ""Taco Boy"" people I'll hopelessly want to talk to but won't.

My problem is that I want to try for a relationship, I wasted my high school dating opportunities due to my anxiety and I don't know what to do. I know the worst they can do is say no, but I panic too badly and can't convince myself to be bold enough. I'm on as needed mild anxiety meds, but it's like any little bit of confidence  dissolves out of me as soon as it's time to apply it.

I know this is stupid to be anxious over, I wish I wasn't. I wish I could see it as insignificant as it is. A guy rejects me, so what? But I just can't. I know I'm young with my whole life ahead of me but if I don't address this now, I never will.",02Oct2018,1

So I’ve been cheating for about 4 months. Not really cheating (I’ve never laid my hands on another woman) but I’ve spoken to other women extensively about it and having online sex. 

I also think she may have some inclination of our drifting apart because she’s been having more and more nightmares recently.

187,"When I first started going to college, I went to a university that few people from my high school went to. After the first few awkward days moving into a new environment I began to socialize with people on my floor. I lived in an engineering hall so I was fortunate enough to have a lot of people with similar interests all localized nearby. It wasn’t before too long until I met some great people and had tons of fun. It wasn’t too long before I noticed someone off to the corner that wasn’t socializing as much so I made my way over to them and as all engineering students do, started an insanely awkward conversation. It wasn’t long until we bonded and he began to be the main person I socialized with in the dorm. I learned later on that he was from another state and that his girlfriend had transferred to a small community college not far from my university with him (she receives in state tuition thru her parents owning properties in our state). 

As time progressed we ended up becoming roommates at the beginning of our second semester. As we began to room together our friendship progressed even further to where we wouldn’t do stuff without each other. Consequently we signed a lease together and we are currently living together at off campus housing. However, as all great things must come to an end I learned early this semester is that he plans to transfer back to an university in his native state. I don’t feel as if the plan is his own because his girlfriend is moving back as well and i am sure is the main driving force for the sudden decision to move back. 

Recently people who associate with him and his girlfriend on a regular basis is noticing that she manipulates him a lot.  His girlfriend will not receive in state tuition eligibility at the university we attend as it is more strict in how it gives out eligibility.  All along I knew her plans were to go back to their native state and complete her degree at a smaller university nearby to their residences. However, they have now decided that they are both going back to a large university in their state to complete their degrees and transfer out of their schools. 

I’m sure there was a reason why my roommate decided to go to college two states away and get his degree here when there are better schools in his state. I am increasingly afraid that his wishes are to not leave this university but feels obligated to transfer back to his state since his girlfriend transferred here for him. 

When I most recently saw his mother, she wanted to reinsure my loyalty to this university as I was assuming that this would eventually come. I explained it to her that I wished to remain here as it is the most affordable option for me to complete my degree and that the university I attend is ranked highly with my degree program. 

Back to the main topic at hand, how do I accept the fact that I am losing the closest friend I’ve ever had to this point? I have developed a codependency with him as he is upset if I ever have to leave for an extended period as well, because I mentioned previously we complete pretty much all activities together.  We spent the summer apart and I felt lonely and depressed that I couldn’t just walk to the other side of the apartment and ask if he wanted to go do X activity with me. 

I want to tell him how him transferring away makes me feel sad and anxious for what the future holds for myself. However, I feel like going back to his state may be what he truly wants and I don’t want to make him feel guilty for leaving me or consequently not to leave as I ultimately want him to be happy. I’ve discussed this with some of my other friends and none of them have been able to provide any advice other than the typical I’m sorry to hear that. 

How would you guys and girls address me to be able to find new friends and move on from a great friendship?

TLDR; losing a great friend and roommate due to them transferring to another university. Have developed a codependency on them and I don’t want to tell them that in fear I’m gonna alter their plans. Need to find a way to make new friends and get past the grief of losing someone close to me.

192,"A little b/g: I'm 10,000km away from home, a continent away from my mum (my only immediate family since my father passed a few year ago; my brother is estranged from the family) to go to university - been here for 2 years, I'm starting my MSc now. 

I've been feeling blue and depressed lately (not actual mental diagnoses) for a while because I cant support/help my mum financially since I'm also working two jobs to barely cover my living expenses. I don't rely on her giving me money and I don't want that either, I'd rather she keep it to build a savings (the city where I come from is very expensive to live in). I feel sad that she recently decided to secretly take a bank loan to help me - I feel especially stressed when loans are involved so this was the last thing I wanted (even if it is in her name), all I want is for her to be financially independent &amp; not have to worry about anything other than for herself to be sufficient. feel like I've failed her. To top it off I also miss her (been almost a year since we last met) and i feel immensely guilty for not being more useful...  


I can't wait til I start my PhD or get an industry job so that I can support her financially... I guess it is an eventuality but til then, what can I do to curb these feelings?

195,"I've recently experienced a spate of anxiety across the board after shedding some really toxic people out of my life. I'm totally out my comfort zone even though life is a hundred times better than it was before. I've always been quite healthy on a mental level and have only ever experienced a short period of depression in my mid-teens. I'm now 24 and am finding that this is affecting everything I'm ever doing. I'm seeing a girl who i absolutely adore and I am nervous around her. I am going to meetings with work (the same job I've been doing for nearly 8 years now), and I am panicking in situations where I would normally hold it together fine. I used to really enjoy smoking weed, and it used to relax me, now it just really puts me on edge. I ended up starting smoking again when this started but have stopped again just now. This last month has changed my perspective on a lot of things and I'm not really sure where to go from here or what the solution is. Will this just pass in time as I adapt to major life changes or should I seek professional help with this? I came close to self-medicating using Xanax but was talked out of my stupidity (and in hindsight, I was really fucking stupid because that shit is no joke). Has anyone ever had an experience like this before? I haven't heard much of anxiety being bought on by life events, but honestly at this point I feel stupid because I really don't want this to have any impact on the relationship I have with the girl I'm seeing. I am constantly waking up in the night at stupid hours too, for seemingly no reason and can't get back from sleep. I am pretty sure I keep having nightmares but I can't remember them to be able to say for sure. Thanks in advance for any pointers.",02Oct2018,1
196,"My partner and I have been together for almost 10 years and we have 3 kids together and 1 child of mine from a prior relationship. 

My partner and I fight a lot. I feel anxious when I know he’s on his way home because I don’t know what kind of mood he’ll be in. He seems to always be angry. I’ve spent much of this relationship biting my tongue for the good of the family. He doesn’t seem to ‘get’ me. He makes fun of a lot of my interests and gets resentful when I don’t like things he does. He gets frustrated when I like things my sister suggests, saying that I always get obsessed with the stuff she likes (can I help it that my sister and I just click) and I don’t get that way with stuff he suggests. 

To give a little back story, about a month after we first started dating, he had a car accident that wasn’t his fault on his way home from work.  After having persistent pain in his lower back for a couple of weeks after it, he went to the drs where he discovered he’d actually fractured his spine and it had healed in the time it took to come in. He eventually (3 years later) had a spinal fusion performed. The car accident ultimately led to probably the toughest times of our lives. He was unemployed. In pain and very angry with his situation (quite understandably). I stuck with him through all of this. Working while I was pregnant and returning to work as soon as possible after having our kids. It has been very hard on him but also very hard on me. I feel selfish even saying that but it’s difficult. He’s back at work now and angrier than ever that he has to be. We simply can’t afford for him to stay home anymore. I’m home looking after the kids now as his physical condition made it too hard for him to look after the kids. He doesn’t help out around the house. At all. He doesn’t do anything with the kids. He doesn’t really spend time with me and gets angry when I don’t spend time with him. There was a time when I was spending more time with him than the kids! I don’t feel appreciated or even like I’m in a partnership anymore. I feel like this isn’t a healthy relationship anymore. 

Obviously people can’t get the full picture of our relationship just from this post but I’d really appreciate it if someone who is in a long term (minimum 5 years) relationship, could please tell me what they’re relationship is like after being together for so long? 

Does the kind of relationship you see in movies actually exist or is it only in the movies?

198,"i’m 18f and completely fucking lost and broken.
my life has been hard, really hard. it would take hours to go through everything, but it’s fucking sad.

but it’s not all bad, i love parts of my life so much. i’m quite a realistic, level headed person and i can see things worth living for. 

but in my whole 18 years of being alive i’ve been severely depressed, anxious and the last few years i’ve had horrible depersonalisation (where nothing feels real, it’s a form of dissociation my brain decided to do to cope with stress).

my heart is aching so much. i’m too anxious to get a job, although i’m trying. i live out of home and i feel so alone. i had to leave to escape my traumatic, dysfunctional home.

i’ve experienced some really horrible things, but one of the most world shattering was when my step dad admitted to having sexual feelings for me. i had known him since i was 12, and i thought the world of him.

he was the person i told when i downed 30 xanax’s and realised i didn’t want to die. i held his hand at his mothers funeral, his grandmas funeral. i cherished our relationship and thought of him like a father. he told me when i was 17.

i decided it was too hard for me to tell anyone, . know. i know i should.  everyone tells me to tell somebody but i can’t. i still love him and want the best for him. he never touched me, but he kept the gross comments and verbal advancements going for another few months. it ruined me.

he has a child with my mother, my baby sister, who i love more than myself. she is the biggest reason i am still here. i can’t let her grow up without a father, but also, how can i face the fact that her father ruined me in such a way? 

it is ruining me. it is destroying me. 
i don’t know what to do anymore, i was so certain i’d never tell a soul because i don’t want my family to fall apart. but i’m starting to realise i will never be able to work through this trauma in secret.

i want to take the easy way out so badly, i want to rest. i’m so tired, my heart hurts so much. life is cruel.

I live with one other guy in a flat. We had one of my friends stay with us for 2 months recently just while looking for jobs. No rent was agreed or spoken about until the day this guy moved out. I'm fine with him not paying any rent but my flatmate has been trying to chase this now, but my friend is not wanting to pay as much as my flat mate would like.

Now in a month's time, myself, my friend and several others were going to have a reunion in the town I am living in now since everyone else is scattered about the country. I offered my place to stay, but my flatmate has said that he does not want my friend who stayed with us to stay because because of the tension and awkwardness, he doesn't want to feel uncomfortable in his own flat.

Again im not trying to control her but I dont know if you should be saying that on dates. anyway let me know if you dont understand what I mean and ill try to explain better, its like im the last plan for doing something even tho she wants a relationship with me, which to me is a red flag as it might just be playing me along.

But it causes me insecurities in daily life i try to overcome, not being enough is the main one. I get horrible nightmares and thought processes about it. My girlfriend is extremely caring and is aware of it all. But some days i feel almost numb to most things around me. And i'm afraid of hurting her or distancing myself from her in the future as life progresses and we aren't within the highs of engagement and marriage (early stages).

The last 6 months Ive gone through a major health scare. I still dont know what its looking like itll be Inflammatory bowel disease.


I went through weeks and months of thinking I had colon cancer and/or heart failure. I have dealt with anxiety all my life but my symptoms caused it to spin out of control. And after almost a year of being out of depression, it finally pushed back through. 


I cant stop thinking about death now. Everything reminds me of it, its in front of me every single day. When visiting my dad, I had to keep leaving the room to cry because I was seeing how old he has become.. seeing my niece and nephew, it just reminds me of how much better life was then.. talking to people at work, they have kids now? They got fat? Why does it seem like all of this is happening at once!


I camt stop thinking about it, Its driving me insane! I am so chronically depressed right now. I live alone after kicking my GF out, which is GREAT timing! But she was causing me even more stress. But now I am in a spiral. I can feel myself seaping lower. 


I have no friends and am doing nothing with my life. I want to do things but I am so depressed, I am barely even taking care of myself..  and I have no one to hang out with except my ex now who has betrayed me and my trust.

216,"So my ex is a journalist and works for a major news company who publishes liberal leaning stories, at least on the pages he manages. 

He also has a fb page with a huge following where he posts alt-right stuff. I am pretty sure he would be fired if they found out about his real opinions, even though he is good at his job. 

In the past I didn‘t care that he has this sort of double life, and nobody else that knows him personally, including those who disagree with him, have or would dox him. Few people know about both. 

Selfishly, the reason why I want to dox him now is because I am angry that I shared personal stories with him about sexual abuse I have experienced and how he is writing stuff in favor of Kavanaugh. He has also experienced physical bullying and harassment so I don‘t know how he can stand to say the things he is saying now. I find it so bizarre that he has this double life, and it is like he isn‘t taking himself seriously. In the past if I tried to confront him about what he says online vs in real life I am meet with either the opinion that he is just trolling people or that he thinks he had to engage in what he considers a culture war against himself, an upper class white christian male. 

We are not on speaking terms so I cannot discuss with him how this makes me feel. I feel personally attacked by him- like the abuse I have experienced is less important than the reputations of the people who did it and that he sees me as this broken thing who makes poor life choices and blames other people. Those are obviously some of the painful darker thoughts that go through my head already, and feeling like they are confirmed by someone I once trusted hurts even more. 

I think I know what he would say if we talked. That it isn‘t about me, I don‘t think that of you, I told you to stop reading my page many times, I don‘t have time for this, ect ect. But I think that is just an act and that deep down he really does want to blame victims, partly over the guilt he feels about how he handled abuse poorly in his personal life. That his fb page is showing his „true colors.“ 

I do not think I am asking if I should dox him... he is good at his job even if he does not agree with the work he is doing. I am asking if anyone can shed some light on this situation. Do I just need therapy? And why would someone systematically say things that they know will hurt people they care about and then just shrug those people out of their life? 

It wouldn‘t be the first time and wont be the last that he loses respect and friendship over this stuff. Over the time that I have known him he has lost many friends over his racist and judgmental commentary online. And he just shrugs it off like ‚well I still like these people even if they don‘t like me.‘ A few times while we were dating his mom came to me crying asking what happened to her son, that he used to be such a nice person. And indeed he was nicer when we meet. I usually ignored her because I didn‘t want to get in the middle of it- until he started ‚coming after’ me too. 

So am I tempted to dox him for ‚his own good,‘ or just selfishly? It isn‘t really my place to decide for someone how they should live their life. Is it? I really wish he would quit politics and do something else because I feel like he is just constantly inciting a culture war from both sides and then claiming that he is doing it because of the culture war. It‘s like the person hitting their partner and then saying ‚you made me do it.‘

What I mean is that someday's we'll talk normally like everyone, we're in the same group at work so we talk to the same people all the time and have the same sense of humor and everything so we do get on when we talk normally. Someday's I'll say hi to him and he'll nod and walk away and only talk to me if he absolutely has too. Other days I can go a 10 hour shift without him saying a word to me even though he's a manager and usually alone running the shift. I try every time I see him to be just normal, I tried when we talked about everything to tell him I wasn't interested in him at all anymore but it was like he didn't want to hear what I had to say but at the same time I know I take things the wrong way so it might not have been like that, some people had gone too far stirring between us and it had upset me so he wanted to know who it was more then talk about where we stood with each other and it wasn't because it had upset me that he wanted to know it was because they'd been saying he had said things that even if I guess he did say he can't because as I said he's a manager.

The last straw was a stupid moment, he suddenly showed up as a new user on Instagram the other week and I was going to add him then realised it might be a bad idea. I asked for advice on here in a different sub and most people were like ""just add him I'm sure he'll be fine with it or if not you'll have your answer"" so I did and he didn't add me as in his profile is private so he had to accept my request and just left it. I became a bit obsessed with checking because it made me angry as he added people who everyone knows he actively dislikes at work to it but still just ignored my request. I then thought ""maybe it's because unlike others I have a weird username and my photo isn't actually of my face"" but he's a 30 year old man who would bloody check that so he is just ignoring it.

So I guess long story short is...

I kind of want to have a normal relationship with him comparable to the other people in our group. I'd prefer if he was honest with me if I've done something to really upset him or annoy him and for him to openly say ""just work nothing else"" if that is what he wants. The Instagram thing has made me realise he IS very two faced because he makes out to some people and said to my face as well that he likes me just not in the way I liked him (which I knew from the beginning) but then refuses to add me to something as mundane as Instagram whilst adding people he doesn't like. We're friends on SnapChat and he views pretty much everything I put on there, I was sure he'd just delete me from it but I guess he doesn't really use it publically much just sends messages so it isn't like he's letting me into his life or anything. I'm not sure it is worth trying anymore though as I have tried and got no response from him and this probably should be the indication that I should stop trying but... I dunno. I guess I just want to think we can save something from everything that has happened but I don't know if it is worth it anymore. I wish I could read people better or understand human interactions because I'm sure I've missed so many signs one way or the other but with social anxiety I just don't get interacting with other people.

My best friend, who well call Mary (19F) for the sake of this story, is currently hanging out with a guy everyone in our friend group has said is awful and is now doing meth with him. A couple months ago I had to sit with her through a Xanax withdrawal after she did it for a week straight (I wasn’t doing it with her for clarification). I didn’t say anything about it and just tried to help her. That was when I started to really worry. I’ve always known she’s doing to get herself into addiction or a bad situation, but never knew how to talk to her about it. She is the most stubborn person on this planet. For context, she had a really good friend before me and ghosted her because she wanted Mary to stop smoking cigarettes. That was it. So it’s not weird to assume she’s going to block and ignore me for telling her to stop doing fucking meth. She hates people who tell her what to do with her life, negative or positive. And I knew she was like this and I always thought I was able to get through to her and make her listen. She didn’t and she won’t. I told her my feelings about this and she told me “not to worry, I won’t get addicted to meth, i don’t have the stomach for it.” Which is obviously bullshit. She’s now angry at me because she hates anyone who tells her anything like that. I came to terms with the fact i’m probably going to lose her as my best friend but I don’t care, I just want her to be healthy and alive. I’m so angry and frustrated and heartbroken over this, I just want to help her but I don’t know how. I can’t go to her about it because it’ll just alienate me from her further and I can’t ask her parents for help because they’ll do everything wrong and lock her in their house or something crazy.

233,"About 1.5 years ago now I met this girl online, we immediately connected and have since then had as romantic a relationship as you can under that situation, we were pretty “locked in” to each other as well and though she seemed sketched at the idea of calling me her boyfriend (I get it, we’ve still never met in person) she’d still talk about how she doesn’t want or need anyone else as we had each other. We were talking pretty much every day for the last 1.5 years, constantly and about everything and it had gotten to the point where we even felt comfortable exchanging “I love yous” and all. This weekend she went out and was drinking, and at some point in the night she texted me and said some woman came onto her (she prefers going to gay bars in general) and that they were grinding a lot. This alone made me uncomfortable to hear because I just felt like she’d throw me away if I said anything similar to her, but I just swallowed it and figured maybe I was overthinking because I mean, they *were* just dancing and it was a club so what’s to be expected. She went quiet and a while later she told me that the woman had kissed her though and she didn’t really seem too beat up about it or like she felt bad, she just told me. Again, I was hurt to know but I just figured I was overreacting and maybe I somehow (even through the very serious nature of our “relationship” which I couldn’t explain if I tried- we were *always* together in the ways we had and spent as much time together as we could besides playing games or whatever online) was overreacting. I just kind of laughed it off though and that was that, but she texted me a while after again asking me if I minded. And when she asked that, something in me just woke up or changed and I felt sick to my stomach and had to stop messaging her for a while, because suddenly it was like she thought we had meaning and I knew she thought that and yet she still kissed this other person even with that. I messaged her for a bit after just to say goodnight because I had disappeared for a few hours feeling anxious and just sick and sad, and since then I’ve kind of ghosted her because I don’t know what to do. On one hand I know I overreacted a little bit, I didn’t say anything mean besides asking why she’d ask me if I minded because I just, I felt like it was obvious I would and I don’t feel like dealing with the drama of talking it out with her I’d rather we just move on or move apart. On the other hand, I just get all twisted up again every time I try to talk to her, and she has messaged me a few times since then to the point that I just had to mute notifications from her because for some reason it sets me off. I do really like her, I loved her for the last year, and I felt like we had something and we had genuinely talked about one of us moving to be with the other multiple times and were so serious together to the point that I think we were a couple to the extent that we had and would have easily moved into being a couple fully when that time did come, but I don’t know how to get over this barrier. I don’t know what to do, I’m just really sad and feel sick to my stomach just typing about it and didn’t think she’d be the type to bring this sort of drama (I hate that word but that’s really what it is) around yet here we are.

Personally, I'm terrified of the military part. I'm (relatively) intelligent and fairly fit, so I know I can make it in.

240,"My middle brother (56) passed away yesterday.  My oldest brother (60) told me (41) today something that annoyed the shit out of me, and I’m wondering if I have legal recourse to halt him from adding me to his will.  

In 1993 my mom died.  Because she had no will, half of our family home (paid off) legally went to me and my 2 brothers.  My dad remarried, and moved out of that house (leaving my middle brother and I in it), and eventually bought a new one.  In 2014, my dad died without a will, leaving his half of the paid off family home to his wife, and leaving his half of their new (not paid off) house to the 3 brothers.  Now that our middle brother is gone, I technically own a quarter of 2 houses that I have no interest in owning.  My step mother rents out the old family home, and lives in the newer home.

Cut to today, my oldest brother (who is a master at pushing away responsibility... yet is the only one of us with a child) tells me that he’s putting me in his will to get his quarters of the homes if something happens to him.  I said “why not deed it to our step mom?  That’s what I plan to do.”  He said, oddly, “she wouldn’t understand it if I did that.  She already thinks she owns the home.”  I said “I think she’d get it if you said ‘hey... you think you own your houses, but you don’t, and we want to make sure you do.’ and even be grateful.”  Because here’s the thing... she will likely not outlive my brother and has extensive family (she’s from Mexico, finally remarried, has a cousin living with them and is renting the old house our to her niece and nephew), and if she dies, then my brother dies, I’m suddenly on the hook for possible taxes, a lawsuit, having to sell a home, etc.  

Am I overreacting?  Is there a way to keep my name out of his will?  If there’s no other way, I’ll talk to him, but he’s pretty stubborn and illogical.  The police failed to remove the massive amounts of prescription medications my brother was on, and he tried pushing their removal off on my wife just because she’s a nurse. When she balked and said he could take it to a pharmacy, he said “I don’t want to be driving around with all that stuff!”  I’m not kidding when I say he’s an idiot savant at avoiding responsibility.

251,"Okay so this will be a long one so thanks to anyone who may have the time to read.
I am 21 years old and have been friends with this group since around 14 years of age. They are all 21 too. We will call them D, J, M, A, and O. I have always been closest to D and M but get on well with J, A, and O. Five years ago when we were 16 M and A entered a relationship together. They are still together now. Me and D had a 'thing' but it was a while ago and it just brought us closer together as friends but we are not romantically involved. It all started around a year ago when we went on a group holiday. L, my now ex, also came. The holiday went okay in my opinion and we had a good time. And then the problems started. After me and L broke up I started to really feel the need to have friends around me. I wanted support. Seeing my pals once or twice a week is what kept me going. I don't think I did anything wrong but after the holiday I became pushed out of the group if you will. They started doing things and I would be the only one not invited. I spoke about this with D and M but they just said 'oh it's the five of us that are closest together It's not personal' I said 'okay just I really need my friends right now and I would appreciate it if I could come along.' Their reasoning was not the truth as I had always come along to nights out in the past. I was always invited. 
Fast forward a year and things have got worse. I have literally begged M and D just to tell me what I have done wrong but they won't. I think that the resentment is coming from A as I am M's best friend and he is rather controlling and doesn't like M going out without him. I have mentioned a couple of time to M that A's behaviour isn't normal however that is it. I feel like he sees me as a bad influence on her. However nobody will tell me what the problem is so I cannot say for sure. On my birthday all of these people attended and they were all okay with me. Which is really making me anxious as I don't know what the problem is, and despite somebody there having an issue they have never confronted me about it. 
This summer M and A got engaged. I am invited to the wedding but I feel like they are sort of treating me wrong. I don't want to feel like they are taking me and leaving me when it suits them. I don't think it's fair to want me at your wedding but then nothing else. I know this sounds childish perhaps but these guys have been my life for so long, I feel heartbroken and I don't know what I did wrong. 
It is driving a wedge between myself and D and M. I feel that if it was the other way around I wouldn't allow the others to make one of them feel like that. I would stick up for them. I sort of feel like they would rather do what is easy instead of right.
The icing on the cake came last Friday when I found they were planning another holiday, this time without me. This has really hurt my feelings. M insists that she cares about me and wants to pursue friendship but all of this makes me question if I want to. It is making me anxious and very upset. Skulking around behind your best friends back (They lie to me about plans. I know it comes from a place of care and they do it to protect me but it honestly hurts more that M and D are dishonest with me) is kind of nasty in my opinion. I wouldn't dream of doing this to them. What do you guys think? ",02Oct2018,1

256,"Hi everyone. I have a neighbour i don't know whose back yard is attached to my back yard. I've seen they have a new puppy (maybe a boxer or something similar, but he is very small still). He has been incredibly distressed and crying a lot lately and I've noticed and become concerned for the last 2-3 days. Today it happened again and i tried to look through my fence. I saw another older dog, a very small breed, and a cat. The cat was in a cage but it was next to a wall so i guess it's possible the cat had access to the inside through a pet door, but I couldn't tell. The older, small dog was wandering around and didn't seem upset. But the puppy i am worried about was near a cage with the door open. I kept going outside to check on him and i noticed car lights and then saw the owners come home. They got home and let the dog in reasonably quickly but when they came out i heard them say something about the cage door being open and that it shouldn't be. This made me think the puppy or maybe all the animals are usually locked up. It's a small cage for an energetic puppy. I am thinking a neighbour may have heard the extreme distress and opened the cage, or maybe they forgot to lock it, I'm not sure. Also i couldn't tell if they had food and water, it's just not possible to see through my tiny fence gap. Basically I'm really concerned for this poor dog but i also don't want to disrespect anyone, accuse someone of something without the full picture, or cause drama. I'm definitely going to leave a note in their mail box letting them know how distressed the dog has been (they didn't get home till 7:30 pm so i guess it's possible they don't realise what's going on), but I'm not sure if i should call animal protection or approach them. I'm a female and a little scared to approach because the man didn't seem very friendly and they may take my concern as hostility. Please give me an opinion about what i should do!! Thank you for reading.",02Oct2018,1
257,"This story might seem weird because it is but I'm really at a crossroads now. So basically, a couple years ago, these two girls moved into my neighborhood. Both of them were cool people, one of them was a bartender who had her life together but the other one was a huge drug addict. I'll call the first girl G and the drugged up one A. So I guess G and A are really close friends and G is trying really hard to help A get help. After about a month, they come to me and my family asking if they can use our WiFi (they got our signal and I guess they couldn't afford it). A wants to get her GED online which is cool. Fast forward to about a month ago and um..

So A has been catfishing people using my identity. I rarely ever touch my Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat, and found out she actually hacked into all my accounts and began friending people and talking to them. These people are people from some weird forum she was on. My pictures were on her account and she was pretending to be me personality wise, yet for some reason instead of telling people who I really was, told everyone I was actually trans and people fell for it. I find out about this, delete all the people off social media, and change my password of course. I go onto this site myself and tell them all that someone is using my identity and one admin helps me delete all the pictures, but everyone else is talking shit. I guess A is a huge liar who makes up a lot of stupid shit and nobody trusts her to the point where they won't even believe me. So, they start harassing me over social media. I keep getting messages from these people calling me a liar and a traitor and I'm really really confused about how to get these people to stop. I'm very clearly not a heroin addicted trans girl yet people keep bothering me.

One more thing, about a week after I find out what happened, A overdoses on heroin. Really sad situation, but it happened. G tries really hard to cope with As death because G comes from a bad family and all she had was A. The investigation found a suicide note on A. This crushed G. Once G was able to get over denial that her best friend killed herself, she went to the forum to tell them what happened. Of course, everyone just says she's a liar again and now both of us are being harassed. I don't know if I should go to the police or what since it's an online forum but this all needs to stop.",02Oct2018,1

260,"I suffer with a life long illness called crohn's disease. Its an illness that causes diarrhea constipation, cramps and all manner of intestinal awkwardness. Worse than the awkwardness of this illness is actually the pain it causes you and it has an unpredictable way of expressing itself in your life. You can have weeks on end of good health, if your able to manage it (and I have) but all of a sudden you can be brought down into weeks of debilitating discomfort and pain. I've been on many medications that have failed to cure the illness so I have resorted to more natural approaches to my health, I now eat healthy and exercise, and it helps. However I can't do this on my own I need help from my parents. I'm currently living with them and they show at times complete indifference towards my needs. My father is unemployed and is incapable of helping me, my mother is never at home. I want them to be more helpful but they act as if I'm being an inconvenience to them. To my dad who is unemployed, what is cooking a meal for both of us everyday? He only cooks food he knows I cannot eat because of my illness. He is like a brick wall, I can't ask anything of him because he just acts like it's too much. So I cook for myself everytime even when I'm so sick I can barely stand up, asking my parents to cook something simple for me like a soup can send them into a childish fit. They're so self absorbed (and I understand why), but can they not see that I need their help sometimes? Why do they have to act this way? They also refuse to pay for things such as a simple gym membership, I have to do everything myself. My parents are super cheap which is incredibly frustrating. But GODDAMMIT I NEED THEIR HELP. I feel like I have to ask for everything, even the most obvious thing.
I've accepted that they cannot look after me, despite having the means and time to do so. So I'm going to go back to the hospital to start on this new medication which, as with previous medications, may or may not work. This medicine has a 1 in 5000 chance of giving me brain damage according to the list of side effects, its an immunosuppressive so God knows what else it will do to me, last time I took an immunosuppressive I got zits that never disappeared, cuts that never healed and severe bleeding gums. I didn't feel good and I don't want to go through that again. I feel like it's serious but my parents are thinking more about their pockets and they have an ignorant trust for everything that comes out of the national health service and they don't believe me when I tell them I can manage my illness naturally. So they don't believe me and there fore they don't want to help me. I can't finance this stuff myself as I'm out of work so what the hell do I do????? Are they being insincere or am I? I can't even tell anymore. ",02Oct2018,1
261,So I just recently started college about 3 hours away from home. Back in my senior year of HS I worked with this girl who I really liked. I grew a pair and asked her out one day and in the middle of the date told her that I liked her she said she liked me too but said it's too much with me going away and all (my college choice to move wasn't certain) so after that I decided to actually move because I felt that I had no reason to stay. About a month and a half later she asks me out. We start dating for about 5 months and those have been the best months of my life so far. I love her until she broke up with me because of family issues and me going to move away soon. The thing is I still love her and I feel like I made the wrong decision moving away because she needs someone to talk to about family problems and I'm not there. Any thoughts?,02Oct2018,1
262,"Hello, I am currently in my final year of college. I thought everything was going well -- I was about to take my last set of majors this term, I was elected at an executive position in my organization and I have a good friends that I could hang out with.

Apparently, I was wrong. I've been awake for god knows how long due to studying, and I still end up failing my exams which comprise more than half of my final grade. I feel miserable and stupid. I work my ass off and still end up like this. Worse, I have to keep my scholarship. We cannot pay for my tuition fees. 

I've been bombarded with a lot of tasks in my org, which are something I cannot easily dismiss as those are crucial. My fault cos I failed to see how heavy the workload of my position is. 

Also, I developed a really bad acne. The worst one I ever had. This probably gives the biggest impact in my life, sorry if you'd think I am petty.  My friends have pointed out that I have low self-image. Maybe I agree. Having acne really makes me feel uglier, and it's like I'm not in control of my life. 

I tried reaching out to my parents, but I now I fail to see the point. They would just tell me that everything happening to me now is my fault; that these are a product of my mistakes. Their words make me feel much worse. I cannot reach out to my friends now because somehow they feel shallow and impersonal and only like to talk about themselves.

263,"Hello, I should probably preface this with a lot of information before I dive into the issue. I'm 20 years old, still in college majoring in computer science, very very passionate about the field, and live in a small city without a lot of IT jobs. Ok, so thanks to my community college I was able to land a job last year with a company that has it's HQ in the city. Didn't get paid the most lavish salary but it was full time and money was enough to be comfortable. The hope was last year I would be able to stay on full time, but due to some issues within the company that were outside of my managers range of control I and a few others were unable to stay with the promise we'd be offered positions in the fall of the following year. Fast forward today, and the promise came true. I returned working in a higher position than I did before. Without giving away too many details I went from a support role to a scripting and support role, and because of this the pay increase was substantial. I was told this year that they were pretty confident in my ability to stay with the company. Last year they said it was a toss up but this year while they can't guarantee it are confident. Well now more unforseen changes in the company are taking hold. Nothing that sets in stone I won't be staying, but enough for some of my co-workers to express they are unsure if I'll be able to. I don't wanna give a lot of details but the company had a change in hands as to who controls it. I really don't want to be put back into a position where I'm having to work part time, and needing to take out student loans just to stay afloat as I have been able to remain debt free for the time being . My current jobs revolves around my schedule, full time hours, a good pay for the area, and frankly I enjoy what I do. However, it lacks security something that freaks me out greatly. There is a position opening up near where I live that offers a similar position. I'm unaware of the pay, but the position is to be full time and not a temp job either. I do not know if they will work with my college I have at the moment, but I meet all the qualifications they are looking for and then some. My question is should I ride the wave since my manager has not expressed concern that I may not be staying, or bite the bullet, leave for a new job(if I get it obviously) and perhaps burn the bridge of some of the professional relationships I have established.

267,"Hi everyone. I know this might seem a bit juvenile compared to the rest of this sub's content, but I need some help.

&amp;#x200B;

Our school is nearing the end of our production of High School Musical. It's going well, but as all high school shows must end, some students are throwing a cast party. The hosts invited 25 people including myself. When I went through the list, I found that there were 12 juniors and 13 seniors total invited. This wouldn't bother me if it wasn't for the fact that there are 15 seniors in the cast. The two people that were not invited are very close friends of mine, one of which I will actually be going on a date with very soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I reached out to the host, X, asking if it would be too much trouble to invite the other two. I mentioned how I had been ""forgotten"" a couple years ago to be invited and had to watch all of my friend's snapchat stories. X replied that 25 was the maximum her house could hold, not one more. I then recieved a message from X's friend saying that I was stressing her out and that I should drop it.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to go to this party as I have pretty intense fear of missing out, but at the same time it doesn't sit right with me that close friends of mine are not being invited after being ""forgotten about.""

271,"I'm gonna self-censor to avoid giving personal information. My email address is my name @gmail. No numbers, nothing other than my real name @gmail.com. I have a somewhat unique name. Still, every now and then I get an email to another person with my name.

Several months ago someone opened a checking account with a San Diego-based bank using my email address. I do not live in San Diego. I live on  the other side of the continent. So I was very concerned. I did what I could to close this account, but since the only information I had was my email address, the bank wouldn't listen to me. I reluctantly left it be, because whoever opened this account didn't use my home address, my phone number, etc.

Then, a couple of weeks after that, I received a receipt for a car windshield from a San Diego-based company. There were no details about who purchased the windshield, but I learned what type vehicle they drove.

A few days ago I received a receipt from a San Diego-based tire service. The guy using my email address had bought tires for the same type automobile he'd bought the windshield for. But on this receipt was his home address and phone number. I googled him up and learned that his name is very similar to my name. We share the two names that make up the email address, but his first name is something completely different, and he apparently goes by his middle name, which is the same as my first name. 

Some more information - while investigating this guy I found that he runs a home restoration business out of him home and either he or his wife recently went bankrupt. That last fact made me a little more suspicious of the guy and his motives.

276,"So i recently discovered Jordan Peterson and ive been on a bit of a binge of his videos. I find his social and political opinions to be very interesting even if i dont agree with a lot of it, however what ive listened to most is his life advice, 'rules', etc.

Ive found some of it to be very helpful, things like having goals and 'purpose', small accomplishments every day/taking things one step at a time, making a daily schedule, not thinking too far ahead, taking responsibility, etc.

I had a few questions though about some of the things he preaches.

 1. When he talks about 'wasting time', what exactly does he mean? What is considered wasted time? He says a student's hour is worth 50$ and that wasting 6 hours per day is like wasting 100k a year. What?? Where do i find a job paying students 50$ an hour and does he expect people to work nonstop 16 hours a day? I had personally always really valued my free time. Obviously i make sure to do all my projects and assignments on time and work part time on my weeks off/vacations but like, this semester for example, i have a pretty light schedule and end up having a decent amount of free time on my hands. I like watching movies and tv shows, watching sports, hanging out with friends, going to restaurants and clubs, relaxing on the weekend days and going out at night, hooking up with different girls, going to the gym, etc. I also like to take my vacations to relax, do fun activities and travel. 

I was honestly really enjoying it but im not so sure now, is this something i should feel guilty about? Should i force myself to work more? I have some physical issues relating to brain trauma so i physically cant work non stop all day cause i need naps and breaks occasionally or else i get awful symptoms but still maybe i could do more then i do now, idk.

2(second). On the purpose of life, what exactly does he think the meaning is. I kinda interpret him saying like 'the purpose of life is to work hard nonstop and have kids. There is gonna be nonstop pain and tragedies but you just have to push through, you have to not indulge in simple pleasures and instant gratification'. 

Is it bad if i think that sounds super depressing? I suffer from severe anxiety currently that was triggered by the brain trauma (although it is steadily improving) but like stills, i was always optimistic about life tbh. I had many 'bucket list' things i wanted to do and experience, i had my dream condo and neighbourhood pictured, im currently in school to work in a field im very passionate about and i was honestly never sure if i wanted kids. I always kinda told myself i wanted to retire early and relax and travel the world. Im my professional career, i hoped to get vacation time and a decent amount of hours every day to indulge in distractions and pleasures and spend time with friends and loved ones. 

Honestly though, jordan Peterson's videos have given me a lot of existential dread. Is his way the only way to live life? Does is really have to be nonstop work, then kids, then death with nothing but tragedy and pain in between with the only purpose being work and responsibility?

I know i probably come across as lazy and whiny but that's not true, i work hard and ive gone through incredible pain and challenges throughout my life, still do today and im only 18. However, i always kinda felt like the purpose of life was to find peace and happiness, 'die happy', enjoy life, life amazing experiences and form memories with friends and family, love, connections, etc. Idk, is this bad? Is Peterson right on this one? Am i not mentally healthy if i dont live the way Peterson said? Is his way the only way for humans to live and be 'happy' or have purpose? 

3(third). Religion. Ive never been religious at all tbh, my parents are not very religious and they didn't impose or teach it at all to me as a kid. Is religion something i need to get into? I guess my grandma is very religious so i could ask her to help me, im not sure i believe in god but if its something thats necessary i could give it a shot.",02Oct2018,1
278,"First a bit of insight of the situation. For a while now I've (20, Female) had the suspicion that my parents weren't going to last for much longer. I have grown extremely close with my mom and we talk on an almost weekly basis, discussing very personal topics at times. Because of that I know that my parents have been fighting and arguing a lot lately. I moved out when I was 18 and see my parents about once a month so I don't really feel as much of the tension as my brother (17) has. 
Last Sunday (two days ago) they broke the news to me that they were officially getting a divorce. I am doing my very best to be strong for them all, my mother is crying a lot, she is still dealing with a burn-out), my dad is very upset and my brother has a glazy look on his face (he didn't see it coming like I did). In front of them I have stayed very calm, asking a few questions and being very supportive overall. But I can tell that it is a lot harder on me than I give away. 
My mom is moving away to a different city and so it will be harder to split my time between them because they now both will live an 1 1/2 away.
I should also mention that there is no one else in play, my parents are sadly two very different people and have lost the love for eachother (at least one of them has).

I've been toying with the idea of changing my career for a long time now. I work as an insurance broker and basically I'm sick of it. Almost literally sick - my mind is in such a bad state that my physical health suffers as a consequence.

It's not like I don't have stress outside of work but it's a significant cause of my anxiety and I feel if I took control of this, it would be a massive win and other things would start falling into place.

I get that stress is a feature of any job but if I did something I enjoyed, I would be able to deal with it better.

So the advice I'm asking for is whether or not people have changed careers and if so, how they came to a decision on what they wanted to do.

281,"It feels like nearly every aspect of my life is messed up in some way, which is why I'm trying to post here instead of specific subs. Warning: this is a long read. I've put a weak conclusion at the end. Thank you to advance to anyone who reads this, and especially to anyone who also takes time to respond. One thing I'd like to say beforehand is that I realize I've made a lot of mistakes, and want to get my life on track. 

Here we go:

*1. My Career*

I have a degree in nursing. I've been a nurse for six years, and have never really enjoyed it. Basically, I got into it because a couple of family members are nurses and promoted it, plus the program was only 18 months. On the advice of said family, I decided to pursue LPN with the intent of going for RN afterwards. I haven't yet made it back to school. Some of it is finances, some of it is the dissatisfaction I've felt with my career and hesitancy to put more money and effort into it. Being more of an adult and more experienced, there are so many other careers I could pursue that might fit me better.

Mostly what I don't like is the stress and the drama. Some days I feel like I'm doing an awesome job, keeping up on orders and charting and providing excellent care. Most days, I feel like everything is coming at me at once and I'm expected to be in multiple places at once. I try to prioritize the best I can but, ultimately, someone is still going to get ticked at me, whether it's the doctor I couldn't go talk to because I was cleaning up an incontinent patient, or the patient who had to wait an extra five minutes for their meds because the doctor needed to talk to me.

Honestly, the most I've enjoyed my job was working in a surgeon's office. I liked the variety: some days nothing but paperwork, some days nothing but seeing patients, some days a mix of both. I do enjoy the hands-on part of it, but sometimes I just don't have the energy. I've thought about going back to an office but a couple of issues arise: I prefer the 12 hour shifts 3 days per week versus 8 hour shifts five days a week, and the pay is usually less.

I just don't know what to do with my career right now, as I'm not much enjoying what I do, and don't know if I should keep on with what I have in hope of finding a job that really fits, or if it's time for a career change.

*2. Finances*

As with most people, finances are a huge concern in my life. I have some debt, which really isn't too bad at &lt;$5k and which is mostly medical. The biggest strain on my finances right now are student loans. I know this sounds incredibly stupid, but I didn't know I had federal student loans until tax season of 2017. When I applied for financial aid way back when, it wasn't explained to me that I was receiving loans that would have to be paid back. In fact, I remember very clearly being told: ""It's free money, why wouldn't you take it?"" and the only correspondence I've gotten since regarding student loans was on my private loan from Sallie Mae. I was young, naive, and without much knowledge of how ""the real world"" works. So, it was an unpleasant surprise when I filed my taxes for 2017 and found my return was to be garnished because my loans were in default. 

2017 was a terrible year financially. My boyfriend owned a house that he was trying to sell, which ended up catching fire. So from early 2017 up until about the end of it, he paid mortgage on that house in addition to his contributions to our actual household needs. He also decided to pursue full custody of his daughters, which I think was the right thing to do, but it did cost quite a bit more money. So, I tried to focus my finances on these problems and didn't really have the extra money to get my loans in order. I'm not trying to make excuses here, just explaining why I continued to let things go. 

So, I was expecting another tax return garnishment this year but it was worse than that and I'm now having 15% of my income taken to pay off my loans. This last year has been a huge wake up call and I'm working on figuring out a plan to get things paid off and improve my credit. 

I'm not so much looking for advice here because I know what I need to do, but it just makes everything else more difficult to deal with. 

*3. My Daughter*

I have an 11 year old daughter. She really is a good kid: she's kind, she generous, she's funny, she's blossoming into a talented artist. She's still just a kid, but she's very responsible and mature for her age. 

The problem is, I know she's having a tough time at school and it sounds like she's getting bullied. One thing I know she gets made fun of his her size. She's tall and a bit chubby. We eat pretty healthy. I try to limit meat portions and go heavy on the veggies, and try to avoid frying foods. We don't buy a lot of snack foods. We go on walks around the neighborhood every night that the weather permits, which take about 40-45 minutes, and she goes out to jump on the trampoline most days. I also have her walk the dog after school. So I'm trying to encourage physical activity and help her get rid of that extra weight, both for her physical health and with the hope that it will stop some of the bullying, but it's not something that happens overnight. 

The problem is that I know it's not just her size that she gets teased for. She's just one of those outcast personalities. I was, too, and kind of still am, which makes it hard to guide her. She's not into hair, clothes, and makeup like most girls seem to be. She's kind of a dorky gamer kid. No matter how much she gets teased, I try to encourage her to be herself and not worry what other people think. I'm hoping that next year, when she starts middle school, she will have an easier time making friends. I never had close friends until about halfway through 7th grade, and the friends that I made and kept through high school were some of the best I could ask for. 

In the meantime, I just don't know how to help her through the bullying. I fear she's getting depressed and I'll most likely get her in to see a therapist if things don't get better. I have a meeting with the principal and her teacher today. I'm not sure what they're wanting to discuss as they didn't say much on the phone, but I'll probably bring up my concerns and see what advice they can offer. 

It's just hard helping your child be ""socially acceptable"" when you're kind of an awkward loser yourself. 

*4. My Relationship/Home Situation*

I've saved this for last because it's the most complicated and kind of ties in with everything else. 

I've been with my boyfriend nearly four years. We've lived together since November of 2016 and I feel that the relationship has taken a downward spiral since then. 

There are so many issues that I don't really know where to begin. 

One huge thing is lifestyle/parenting style. He has three kids from prior relationships and, quite honestly, I think he has taken a rather passive role in parenting. I don't really feel that he has taught his kids respect and pride for one's home. They frequently incorporate household items into their play, which would be fine for the most part if they realized that these things aren't actually toys. For example, using dishes and cooking utensils. They'll take them off from the kitchen and then either the items get broken, get lost, or I have to go hunting when I need something. The bigger problem is being wasteful. I've often found rolls of toilet paper unrolled around the house, entire bottles of soap or shampoo dumped in the sink, and food left half-eaten and sitting out. I'm not saying my own child is never guilty or involved but, knowing what his home life was like prior to us moving together and based on how I've raised my own child, I don't think she's the one doing most of these things. 

It's just frustrating to me that these kids just don't seem to care about anything other than their tablets and nothing I say or do seems to help. If I try to bring it up to my boyfriend or ask for help getting his kids to be more responsible, he says things like ""your kid isn't perfect"" or accuses me of not helping enough or just generally gets defensive. On occasion, he has admitted he needs to do better at being involved with the kids but it ends there. 

On a same vein, I don't think he does enough to help with the house. I try to keep the house tidy. I do most of the chores on my own and all I really expect is for the rest of the family to leave things the way they found it. I mean, when I've emptied the dishwasher and wiped down the counters, I don't understand why it's so hard to put dirty dishes in the dishwasher instead of the sink and wipe up the crumbs from the sandwich they've made. 

I'm not controlling but, for one, I expect to have help keeping things clean and not be treated like a maid. Also, it feels disrespectful when I take time to get the house picked up and it gets trashed within an hour of them being home. 

I've talked to my boyfriend about my concerns and it does no good. In fact, any concern I have usually leads to an argument because I don't feel he listens to me or really even cares. Honestly, most of the time I just keep it to myself because it's not worth the argument. 

Speaking of which, I hate the way we argue. It's usually me trying to explain my point of view and him telling me why I'm wrong. He says things like ""everybody here is happy except you"" or that I'm irrational. He twists things to make him look like the better person. He'll get just as fired up as me during an argument then, when we try to discuss it the next day, he talks as though he was completely calm and reasonable, and that I was flipping out. 

One example of this that happened recently was that I was trying to go to the grocery store after he made a snarky comment about the kids not getting a ""real"" dinner. They had an event that evening and so I fed them what I'd consider a heavy snack because I knew they'd be getting snacks at the event, too. I mean, I think we've all had those days as parents. It's not like they were starving or I just gave them bread and water. Anyway, he got snarky and started huffing around the kitchen looking for food so I said, I'll just go to the grocery store which, for some reason upset him even more. At one point he stood in front of me, blocking my way and, when I tried to move, he would shift his position so I couldn't get past. I called him out on it, he acted like it wasn't an aggressive move, and I made a comment like ""Maybe I shouldn't come back then"". Immature, I know, but I was upset that he was trying to prevent me from leaving and acting like it was perfectly OK. 

Here's where it got bad. I went out the door and realized I forgot something so I went back for it. We have like a little screened porch before you get into the house he actually stood there and, as soon as I unlocked the door, locked it back and said, ""What do you need in here for?"" I tried unlocking the deadbolt and he held the latch so I couldn't. I didn't realize he was doing this and ended up bending my key. So, it went on like that, me trying to unlock the door and him flipping the lock back as soon as I did. 

The very next day, when I tried to address it with him, he tried to justify this behavior by saying I had said I wasn't coming back, saying that I was acting crazy, and then claimed he didn't want me to go to the grocery store because he thought I'd spend two hours stocking up when we just needed food for the evening. Which is fine, if that was his concern, he should have said it when I first said I'd go to the store. 

Look, I'm not perfect and I own my share of the blame when we argue. The problem is, I just don't think he does. I'm the bad guy in Every argument. I'm always wrong, I cause all the fights, according to him. And I'm tired of it. It doesn't feel like a partnership; it feels like an old school marriage where the man runs the show and the wife's job is to look pretty and take care of the housework with her mouth shut. One of the reasons I was interested in being with him to begin with is that I thought he saw women as equals and respected them but, after four years, I honestly think he thinks he is better than women. I see it in the way he treats me and how he talks about his exes. 

I know this is getting long so a couple quick things I want to say about our relationship:

His youngest daughter (7) has severe behavioral/mental health issues that he does very little to address. She needs a psychiatrist and is starting to make me uncomfortable/concerned for the safety of others. I think he enables her behavior by not f through with punishments or caving in because it's easier (i.e. She will scream, be rude, try to hit him, says things like ""I wish you were dead"" for an entire evening and he just hands her his phone to play with). Her behavior causes him to ignore and neglect the other kids, something I know affects them based on comments from the oldest where she says she feels like he cares more about her than them. I've tried to help out with her but, after four years getting nowhere and him not getting her help, I'm burnt out. Of course, according to him, it's partly my fault because I won't take her to a psychiatrist. He doesn't seem to understand that I am not her legal guardian, I can't just stroll in and get her seen. 

Other things: his work takes up any extra time that isn't spend dealing with the seven year old. He comes home from work, eats dinner, and will spend literally the entire time until he goes to bed in front of the computer. I understand that work is busy, but it feels like he doesn't value our relationship enough to give me half an hour of his evening. I feel ignored and neglected. I go to bed every night alone, and wake up alone in the morning. We don't have sex (again, according to him, my fault for not initiating it) and I'm desperately lonely. Over the last few weeks, the thought of cheating has crossed my mind more than once. I know it's wrong and could probably never actually go through with it, but I feel so alone. It's not even necessarily sex I crave; just an intimate touch, a real conversation, a bit of attention. 

I apologize for the rant there but my relationship has such a huge impact on my happiness right now. I've tried to explain my feelings to him but all I get are excuses and the blame shifted to me. I don't think he loves me anymore, just likes having someone around to help and, honestly, I don't think I'm in love with him.

*The Conclusion*

So, all of this comes together and puts me in a very unhappy place. I want to leave this relationship, genuinely feel that I'd be better off on my own. Financially, it's a struggle. I'd either have to find a better paying job or work more hours. It would take me a couple of paychecks to save up the money for a deposit + first month's rent. I have to get all that figured out before I really even consider a career change. I'm working on plans to save money and get my debts taken care of so that I can hopefully purchase a home within the next few years. I'm just tired of renting and moving around. I'm tired of being in a relationship that doesn't seem equal. I just want to get stable and settle down to give my kids a good life. Looking back at my life over the years, I've come to realize that I'm usually better off in times where I'm not in a relationship. It seems that I do better when I am focusing on myself and my daughter rather than trying to make a home with someone else or meet someone else's needs. I just don't know where to go from here.

282,"So this girl is interested in me so I wanted to get to know her better. I told my friend about her and he all of a sudden finds an interest in her. Keep in mind that he has known her longer and has had plenty of time to go through with talking to her. I called him out when he said he liked her too and he told me to chill because she was easy and not the girlfriend type. A day passes and we both see her while walking so on a spur he invites her over to hang out with him. She accepts and we (including a few of her friends) watch movies together. We stay in a shared space so I can see the girl and my roommate laying down with each other. Part of me says that that doesn’t mean anything since they weren’t touching, but it still bothers me. Before she left my roommate again decides on a spur, ( keep in mind that I have been his wingman quite a few times now and I have never seen him go after a girl this aggressively the first time they hang out) to slap on her the ass as she leaves. After she leaves he talks about how they aren’t that compatible and that she is too “weird”. Now about a week later they haven’t even talked again and I learn from a friend of hers that she was actually really interested in me. Now I feel weird because I want to go through with having a relationship with her but it bothers me that she was so close to my roommate just some days ago.

one day i decided enough was enough because the office manager was unbearable. 

she’d reprimand employees in front of clients, gossip about them to others including other employees, she’d text us with complaints in our days off but made it VERY clear never to text her on her day off. she chooses favorites and i’m convinced she’s a bit racist. she talks crap about her husbands stepdaughter all the time. she made me feel like crap one year that i was injured (i couldn’t walk or stand) and would compare my injury to others. she assumed my recovery should not have taken so much time and i ended up going back to work before my doctor okay’d it. i can go on and on. 

fast forward to now. 

i ended up getting a new job somewhere that really benefits my schedule especially with school. i had a hard time letting go of my old job because i was used to it, and my office manager had a hard time letting me go as well. but the way she went about it was wrong. 

“how much are they even paying you?”
“how many hours?”
“make sure you get everything in writing in case they try to screw you.”

etc. etc. 

i agreed to work a few hours for her ONE day out of the week. mind you it’s a 30 minute drive whereas my new job is only 13. 

i was exhausted doing this and it left me no time for school. 

anyway, my new job changed my schedule and has me working on that one day i was working at the old one. 

i could really care less about working there (old job) anymore, especially since the office manager is a complete monster. she never valued me or anyone. 

i know she’s gonna text me today when i don’t come in.

290,"Alright people,

I’m a 23 year old guy with the following problem – I’d really appreciate all advice I can get.

I became friends with this girl when I was 17 through a mutual friend, let’s call her “S”. I wanted to bang her at first, but we got along so well that that never happened but we remained friends anyway.

Then I got with my ex, she said I have to stop hanging out with S, that’s it’s either my ex or her. So being the young infatuated pup that I was, I text S explaining the situation and we didn’t speak for like 2 years. I broke up with the ex and me and S were back to being friends pretty much immediately.

Again, a few years later she went on holiday, and banged like 4 people in a week. When she told me about it (voluntarily, I didn’t even ask), I was disgusted by that and I cut her loose, again. For like a year. Eventually, we made up again and since then we’ve been closer than we’ve ever been.

I get that this doesn’t look good already – if I cut her out of my life repeatedly, why do I keep going back?

We both have mental shit going on – I have quite a bad case of the black dog, and she’s bipolar. We get each other in weird ways, to a point where she can tell me what I need even if I don’t know what that is, and vice versa. We’re there for each other at times where we feel down, and overall she’s one the closest people that I have in my life. We went on a holiday together this summer, just the two of us. And for what it’s worth, we even tell each other we love each other.

The other week we were Snapchatting as she was going to come see me for the weekend (I live an hour away). I put “housemates are out of town so we can bang in the kitchen”, obviously joking. She replied saying “go back to the friendzone”, or something along those lines. That made me furious, cos I thought our friendship is… not that.

I’ve never hung out with her with some false hope that something might happen one day. I do find her attractive but I never did anything to try and bang her, I just thought that if it happens, it happens.

When she called me friendzoned it cast our friendship in a different light. I don’t allow any girl to friendzone me, I just cut them out for good if it ever happens. I didn’t think I was that to her, but if that’s what she sees me as, then I don’t want to carry this on anymore.

This has been happening for the last two weeks, I’ve seen her every weekend this month. I went to see her this weekend, we had a nice time chilling, and then we argued about this when I left. I told her to leave me alone for a while.

So what do I do?

On one hand, she’s one of my closest friends, we’ve known each other for 6 years and I don’t want to lose someone like that over something this petty.

On the other, I can’t look at our friendship the way I did before, this is always going to bug me. If I cut her loose, it will be for good this time, and it’s gonna suck, but this is one of my principles I live by and I don’t want to break it for anyone.

All input will be appreciated, thank you all in advance.

**TLDR:** Home Depot brought the wrong carpet for installation a couple of weeks ago and missed the rescheduled date for today.  Wondering what, if anything, I should request from them.

**Detailed Events:**

So, 8/25 my wife and I go to Home Depot, pick out some carpet we like, and schedule the in-home measurement.  The measurement happens on 8/29, we get our quote for $4,300.00 and put it on a credit card for 24 month no interest financing.  The installation is then scheduled for 9/18 which I arrange to take off of work for.  I spend the weekend before moving furniture out of the three bedrooms getting the new carpet.  All is good so far.

The day of the install, they arrive with the wrong carpet.  There was some back about whose fault it was but after some calls and digging there's no doubt it was theirs.  They say I'll receive another call scheduling another appointment.

That call came last week.  I ask for the earliest possible appointment, which was explained as ""next Tuesday"" (today).  Again I arrange to have off of work and spend my weekend moving furniture out of the bedrooms (had to move it back to accommodate guests).  Today I received no word from them so I just called and was told I was scheduled for next Tuesday (10/9).  I tell them this is a mistake and they offer up tomorrow for the install (I can't make that work, but to me this proves they messed up in their scheduling as I did ask for the earliest date initially).  We eventually settled on this coming Saturday for the install.

The dilemma I have is that I spent a good many years working in customer service so I have a major soft spot for associates and never like to give anyone a hard time.  All this wasted time and effort is really pushing me over the edge, though.  So what would be reasonable on my part?  Assuming everything goes well this Saturday do I just accept it and leave bad reviews?  Do I request a partial refund? Maybe a discount on a future purchase or something?

He’ll make insane demands - for example, the day after my wedding he “fell in love” with my moms best friend that was at his table.

307,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for near on 18 months now, and I’ve only come to terms with the fact that I’m no longer sexually attracted to her today. 

I still love her with all my heart, I love kissing her, spooning her at night and taking her out on dates and generally spending time with her. But I just can’t for the life of me think of her sexually. When I eventually do put out and let her have me, I have to think about someone else. 

So I’ve been cheating for about 4 months. Not really cheating (I’ve never laid my hands on another woman) but I’ve spoken to other women extensively about it and having online sex. 

I also think she may have some inclination of our drifting apart because she’s been having more and more nightmares recently. 

So I know I have to confront her about it. It’s what’s best for both of us. But I’m terrified to do so, it’ll destroy her and break my heart to do so. But I know it’ll destroy her more to find out that I’ve been cheating. I’m also terrified, because of it goes badly and she breaks up with me, I’ll have nowhere to live. 

I honestly have no idea how it will go. On one hand she might break up with me, blow up my life and leave me with absolutely nothing. On the other, she understands and we enter into an open relationship. Either is possible because she loves me to death and wants us to be together forever, but absolutely hates other women for even looking at me a certain way. 

So I guess my question is: How should I tell her? What should I do? I’m so lost and need help. ",02Oct2018,1
308,"I’m a junior in college and I’ve never had roommates before until now. I have 3 other roommates and we are sharing an apartment. We have our own individual bedrooms and we pay our own rent and we split the common area (living room and kitchen). 

Ok, so two of my roommates get mad that i have this guy I’m seeing over at night. They say they need to know who is in the apartment and if someone is staying the night. (Eventhough the guy would be in MY room). Whenever i have someone over, they are always in my room. They say they need to know because it’s for “safety reasons” and that it’s inconsiderate to have guys over late at night on a weekday. 
**Even though, i pay my own rent and utilities.**

Last night, they texted who has a guy over and I did text “I do” but my message didn’t deliver so it didn’t go through and i woke up with paragraphs of them freaking out. 

Whenever they hear the front door open or close at night, two of my roommates always texts in the group chat “whose here?? Who left??” And when i don’t answer, she confronts me about it first thing in the morning. 

I’m not sure if she was joking or not but one time my roommate told me to turn on my current location so they know where i am. They all share each other their current location so they know where they are.

309,"I rolled my foot last Thursday pretty badly and was unable to walk so I decided to go to the ER about 15 minutes after the toll occurred. While there they took x-rays and the original notes stated that no break was present. When the Doctor came in to talk to me he has brought up that he “thinks” my cuboid is fractured and was speaking to a optometrist about it. I never saw the doctor again in my visit but the final notes stated I had a non-displaced cuboid fracture and to follow up with a specialist next week. It’s been about 5 days and I can walk and jog with ease and no pain. I’m highly skeptical that it’s actually broken and with my deductible I’m going to have a to pay a lot out of pocket to see the specialist. Has anyone else experienced anything similar?

312,"I've been contracting for this company for the last four years, and have worked on many projects in this time. About 4-5 months ago I got switched to a new project, arguably the most desirable one going on, with the brightest people. 

Every code push gets reviewed by someone else (fairly standard process). This one very senior engineer (and I say this from a position of holding senior roles for the last decade) has been reviewing my code for the last few weeks, and his attitude is becoming a problem.

Now, the guy is smart, and is someone I've long respected, but his communication style has always left a lot to be desired. His methods, approaches and demands are also not inline with how I work, and this is where the problem arises. 

(Technical jargon to follow - apologies to those not in the loop, but it's necessary.)

First, he looks for problems where there are none, or creates them. He'll find something as mundane as string concatenation in my JavaScript code, and will ask me to refactor that to use the latest &amp; greatest syntax available to JS, claiming simplicity and readability. He'll make me refactor code using other latest &amp; greatest syntaxes and approaches, claiming solutions to problems which are not problems at all. 

He'll tell me things like to NOT write DocBlock comments for protected methods, because if someone wants to know what the code does, they should read the unit tests, and since he's of the opinion that comments are always out of date. Now, I'll completely agree that the documentation HE writes IS always out of date, but I make a point of keeping mine current and have never had any issues. 

I also think that it's a ludicrous notion to have to search for a test file and read a whole bunch of CODE in in order to try to understand what OTHER code does, when you could have the option of simply reading inline, human-readable comments in the original code to begin with.

He'll complain (to me) that I'm not pushing code frequently enough and tells me to push even if the code is not complete (ok, sure), and when I do so, complains that the code I push is not passing tests (keep in mind, I'm working on a branch that no one else is touching).

Just today he's complained about my choice of a commit message (not the greatest, I'll admit) - a single one - despite the fact that his own commit log has plenty of similarly pointless messages.

And all along the way, he's sending me abrupt chat messages asking whether I've pushed code, whom I've spoken with, what exactly I'm working on, how much I've worked, etc. As much as I hate the word, it's borderline harassment. 

Best of all, while being a very senior engineer on the project, he's NOT my manager/supervisor/anything else. 

This is all very negatively affecting my mood. Every morning I wake up to a bunch of unfounded complaints and criticisms, and every day I have to justify what I'm doing to him. I feel like I'm the subject of a witch hunt.

Bringing this up with the management is an option, but I'm not sure it's a good one. He's an important part of the project/company and is held in high regard. I'm worried that won't end well for me.

On the other hand, continuing to deal with this is also not something I'm fond of.

Any options I haven't considered?

316," I don't know where to turn. My girlfriend said she was assaulted/raped, during the waning months of the school year. Which was my final year as a senior at our hometown high school. She's now just begun senior year. Before we got together she was assaulted. This led her to moving cities, she's attending another school at another town. I've already caught her lying and, it makes me feel like a shitty person for wanting her to clarify. She said she trusted me. But to go into detail is something she'll refuse. Yet bits and pieces will come out during her story.

She said they confiscated all sorts of items from her bedroom, including her sheets, pillows, etc. Anything that could be contaminated with DNA evidence. When I responded ""It was in your room?"" inquisitively, she recoiled, telling me to ""Get off of it"". She also said there was a girl who was involved, the girl and her had a fight before that night. And when she thought they had made up, they let a dude in who commenced to assaulting her. My girlfriend said this was beyond her permission, stating that girl had threatened her. She'll gladly talk about this assault but became threatened or defensive when asked to go into detail.

And now she's saying her court case is even more muddied up as they are delving into her family, asking about her history and what not. She's saying that it might be dropped since her detective found out that she got into a relationship too quickly after the assault. One thing that strikes me as strange is that I asked if she was getting therapy because of the assault. She said no, and I asked why, with her saying she doesn't want therapy nor does she need it. I'm not a lawman, I barely finished high school. I just want to clarify that this court case, this assault, it's all real. I don't want to feel like I'm accusing her but she has a history, rumors were spread about her even before this. I need all the help I can get on this I'm utterly confused.

322,"I’m currently a 3rd-year chemical engineering student, set to graduate in spring 2020, so only 3 semesters left not including the current one, but as I get further into this degree program I’m not sure this is what I want to do with my life. I’ve always excelled at science and math and for the first 2 years of college I made straight As with minimal effort because it came naturally to me. Now my classes are getting harder and while I still do well (3.5 gpa), I’ve definitely noticed my grades are dropping slightly and I think it’s because I’m just not passionate about this major. Sure I’m pretty good at it and it will pay well after college, and it’s not that I hate it but when I think about doing this for 40 years after college I feel a sense of dread. I like it but I’m just not passionate about it and don’t want to be stuck in something I don’t really want to do. 
On the other hand, in the past few years I’ve become extremely passionate about music. I’ve played guitar since a young age and I’ve started producing my own music with FL studio in my bedroom. I make all kinds of music and while I recognize a lot of it isn’t great, it’s something I really love doing. I’ve specifically become interested in audio engineering. I love learning about recording, mixing, and mastering audio and it’s really something I could see myself doing and loving with my life. I love listening to music, learning about different production techniques and the history of different genres, technologies, etc. I could talk about it all day if someone would let me. I know how incredibly difficult making it big as an artist/producer is which is why I don’t want to pursue that as a career, but I think it’s a lot more reasonable and attainable to make it as an audio engineer. 
The issue is that my current university doesn’t have an audio engineering program otherwise I would switch to that in a heartbeat. I don’t know if I should finish my current chemical engineering program while teaching myself more and practicing with audio engineering on the side, or try to transfer to another school where I could get a degree in audio engineering. I’m already pretty close to finishing my current program and a lot of audio engineers I look up to all say experience in audio engineering is much more important than a formal education. I could always go back to school after graduating to get an education in audio engineering. Additionally I feel a lot of pressure from my family to finish my current degree. I’ve always been “the smart one” in my family and I think they expect me to get some high paying job, but I don’t really want to do something just because someone else wants me to.

324," 

I apologize in advance for the long post, but there’s a lot to be said about my current situation and I’m struggling to find a way out of it. My dad has been having financial issues for a while, and now some of his financial burden is falling on my brother and me. How he got to this point in life started well over a decade ago. Most of the information I have is just from what he has told me, and this is mainly how I’ve interpreted it all.

He’s been a real estate appraiser for 30 years. He has also been big into investing. The appraisal business was good and he made a lot of money from real estate investing. We were pretty well off for the first few years of my life.

I believe the his troubles began when he and my mom got divorced. They got divorced when i was maybe 5 or 6. I was too young to know what was going on at the time, but now that I’m older I understand that this had a major impact on his mental health. He hasn’t remarried or even dated(as far as I know) since. 

Also around this time, many of the things he had invested in began falling apart. He invested several hundred thousand dollars into a local security surveillance company. He ended up with over a million shares in this company. He was good friends with the owner of the company for a long time, and was promised he would be paid back and that his shares would be worth millions one day. Eventually this company was being sued by another company and had to file bankruptcy. They opened up again under a new name. The shares my dad owned became worthless, and the owner of the company claimed he had already paid my dad back, though my dad claims he did not. I’m not sure if he ever took him to court over this or if he just let it be, or if he actually was paid back.

Another “investment” of his was in a warehouse that he took off the hands of another friends who was having financial issues. He was promised to be paid back. Either from being too nice or from expecting a big payout in his future, I don’t know which, he held on to this warehouse for far too long. By the end he owed over $100,000 on this warehouse and it got repossessed by the bank.

He owned the office building in which he worked, and rented out the rest of the office space to the surveillance company, some animal physicians who treated horses at the racetrack in town, and to an insurance agency. The rent he was receiving every month paid for the expenses that came with the building. He was even turning a profit on the rent. The insurance agency moved out, cutting the amount of rent he was receiving drastically, and eventually everyone had moved out of the office building. He was the only one working out of the building, and he was left with the full force of the monthly costs without any of the cushion from renters. He eventually surrendered ownership to someone else, but made an agreement he could stay in the office rent free if he paid for the utilities. 

We lived in the only house on a local golf course(not as extravagant as it sounds) and our mail would come through the golf course office. My dad was struggling to pay the bills, and would prioritize payments for things as needed. He eventually got a foreclosure warning letter in the mail, but the owner of the golf course decided not to give it to my dad. We were forced to move out of our house seemingly out of the blue since we hadn’t seen the letter, and overnight moved all of our stuff into the last remaining house my dad was developing. The golf course owner later bought our foreclosed house. A pretty scummy thing for him to do. I’m not sure if my dad took legal action or not

Growing up, this was all normal to me. My dad kept a lot of this from me as a kid, but I was also too young to understand the situation we were in. My mom was pretty well off after the divorce, so even though i was seemingly poor with my dad, I didn’t feel like it with my mom. This contributed to the feeling that things were ok. As I got older, I would start to understand it better and knew that my dad was struggling, but I was always under the impression that we would be fine and that he was handling it. My brother was the first to leave for college, leaving just my dad and me at home. By my senior year of high school I knew how dire my dad’s situation was, and did what i could to help him. I knew that staying in the office and paying the utilities was an expense he could not afford, so I helped him move his office home. This helped ease his financial burden a little, but he still had a lot of expenses as well as struggling with his mental health. 

I could tell something changed in him when I left for college. He was not the person i used to know. Since he was working from home, he rarely had a reason to leave the house unless it was for work or running errands. He was completely alone, with the weight of all of his debts and feeling like he was a failure with nobody to help him out of his situation. He didn’t take good care of himself or his living space. His home was hoarder messy. I tried to help him clean and get his life in order as I could, but I was going to college out of town and I couldn’t balance college life and helping him.

I graduated last year and have a full time job with decent pay. My brother got a job several states away. At this point, he has become very bitter towards the world, his social skills have deteriorated, and he is becoming forgetful. He spends a large amount of time reading politically biased news articles. When i come down, He is happy to see me, but he has a hard time talking to me without talking about his extreme political views or without going through all the reasons he’s in the situation he’s in. He struggles to get his work done, and barely brings home any money from his job. His main source of income is his social security check, but it is not enough to cover all of his expenses.

I’m trying hard to get him out of this situation, for his sake and for the sake of my brother and me. He has drained his bank accounts and is at the point where he is asking us for money. I fully don’t expect to get any of the money that I give him back, and i accept that. But I know that it is only going to get worse. I know i should have helped him more a lot earlier than I have, but I went through much of my life not knowing how bad it was, and when I did know how bad it was, I was trying to get my own life started.

I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to put a decent amount of money away from work I’ve done since high school, but now he’s starting to eat into that savings. I have a girlfriend going through graduate school, so we are going to have debt of our own from her schooling. I can’t support myself and my girlfriend while also supporting my dad. Recently, I’ve mapped out his expenses to the best of my ability in a spreadsheet. His expenses are much higher than his income. I’m trying to cut costs for him, but he stubbornly does not want to break from his current way of life. The house he lives in and expenses from his job both leach money from him. I am trying to convince him to move into a cheap apartment and get a part time job. He would have a more steady stream of income and might actually be able to save a little too. I also recently managed to get him to apply for food stamps, and we are waiting to hear back on that. 

I feel like all the responsibility has fallen on me to dig him out of this 15 year hole he has dug himself. If i can’t get him out of this situation, he is just going to keep leaching money from me that i can’t afford to lose. He does not help me with his situation very much, and my brother can’t help much from a different state. How can I help someone out of a decade long depression who is in severe financial crisis when I am fresh out of college and trying to start my own life?",02Oct2018,1

326,"I'm male in early 20's.

I fell in love with my seatmate for a semester in college and 2 years ago she started working for another branch (another city) of the company where I work. Luckily (I thought), I was temporarily moved to the same branch for about two months. During my short stay there, we had alot of moments together which many of our officemates noticed. We had constant communication since then, even after I went back to the branch where I'm really assigned to.

Another two months passed and I was called again to assist the branch for about a week and by then our manager already started ""teasing"" us which made me really uncomfortable. Which made me decide that I should avoid her because it might affect my personal goals.

However, on my last day we had a little conversation about her personal life and she suddenly cried (we talked nothing about me or ""us""). I wasn't able to properly comfort her. This was our last conversation not work related.

Days passed and I went back and forth to the branch where she is assigned to and I avoided her to the point that I always tell them I have other things in mind to avoid being in a group with her. Also, for sometime our officemates were teasing us until they learned I started dating other girls. I just fake my reaction everytime it happens.

 Unfortunately, she noticed that I am avoiding her, which a close friend of ours told me. He told me that she is trying to reach-out but I obviously don't want to engage.

Just today, I visited her branch again. And by twist of fate, I learned she is scheduled to move with me in few weeks in another city to augment another branch's workforce. We will be staying in the same apartment, woking in the same office, same department, same bosses.

I still love her and the situation is kind of awkward for me. I could not even seat beside her in the car, stand beside her in the elevator (happened today and I was pokerface the wholetime).

330,"I am 24, turning 25 in December. I graduated last year with computing degree and got a FIRST in that degree. 

About my work - I commute 3 to 4 hours every day to my workplace. When I get there, I literally do no work and watch other people carry on talking about projects, work, etc. I am in fact getting annoyed that I am not making progress in my career. I spoke to my manager 5 weeks ago and he said he'll look into it.

What I am doing to help - I have been applying else where for last 2 months but keep on facing rejection. I've been approached by dozen recruitment companies and saying that this is the opportunity for me but after couple of days, no reply or feedback. This is literally destroying my self esteem because I even question myself at night thinking, am I this dumb, why will no-one hire me, why is no-one considering my top grade from my degree... I am literally crying inside. 

I leave home at 6 and get home around 7 to 8. I try my best to do some computing work before sleep but I have no energy left. My weekends are tied up with my family and helping them with their work and chores. 

What I think solution is - I am thinking about resiging my workplace. While unemployed, I can work on my personal projects and increase my skills set then. This way I am more likely to get a job. 

My parents counter argument - firstly, you'll lose money. Secondly, no guarantee that when you'll get the next job.

331,"I am a software developer, mid twenties, and have been working with the same company for about 5 years, half as an intern while in school, and full time salary every since. It is a small company with incredible work life balance, but pay as always been a little sub par. I am the only developer who isn't nearing retirement and as such there seems to be ample room to grow, but in 3 years if it doesn't go my way I may have spent nearly 10 years with sub par pay not getting as much experience as if I had been hopping around every few years. I am currently being head hunted by a recruiter who is hinting at a potentially 25%+ raise, but I have enjoyed my experience in my current work. I am mainly worried about losing my interesting with my company after some years, but then lacking broad experience to stay as competitive after.

332,"I want to set up a negotiation activity / competition for school students which teaches them how to bargain with others in typical life situations (e.g. buying a car, setting house rules, etc.).

Obviously, I want to reward getting a good outcome for themselves. We'll be able to quantify this by attaching points to certain outcomes (e.g. you get 400 points for keeping your rent under $200/week, but only 20 points for being able to move in next week because you don't mind so much when you move).

However... win-win solutions are sometimes possible in life, and I don't want to reward anybody for absolutely screwing over somebody else. If they have to choose between A) getting 900 points and their opponent getting 100 points, and B) getting 850 points and their opponent getting 500 points, then surely B) seems like good, ethical behaviour to encourage in kids.

So how the hell do I format that competition while still keeping quantifiable points?

Ideas so far:

* Rank teams by points for themselves first, then points for others if there is a tie — this would still reward taking advantage of the opponent in most cases, I don't expect too many ties

* Rank teams by cumulative points for both them and the teams they faced — enables a lazy approach of just giving the opponent everything, to score an ""average"" mark. Even if I give the points diminishing returns (so the best result for both teams is a decent outcome for both teams, not a lopsided ones), it still risks happening and screwing over the better team... and besides, it limits my ability to set win-lose negotiations sometimes.

* Some multiplier of the above cases (e.g. ranked on your team's points, plus half your opposition's points) — didn't find anything convincing here.

Any ideas? Or ideas for subs that could help?",02Oct2018,1
333,"It's such a weird thing, and in a way I feel guilty and ashamed at myself, but hear me out, I guess. So, my 15th birthday was on Sept. 8. My parents wished me happy birthday, we went rollerblading, that's it. I ate two slices of cheesecake by myself because both of them were working. My mom said that there would be a birthday party, but none seems to follow. I can't stop thinking about how disappointed I am in that birthday. I didn't even want to celebrate my last birthday, but even then my parents and brothers sang happy birthday to me with a cake. My aunt and grandmother still took me out to go shopping. But it's like everyone forgot about it. I feel so hurt by that.

I've been a lot more agitated lately, even before that, but this just really set me off. If some girls laugh too loudly in the hallway, I feel like telling them to shut up. I hate having long conversations because I don't want to listen to something I don't care about. Sometimes I wish I could curb stomp that one kid who interrupts the math class with a stupid comment. I'm just always angry, and if someone is bragging about how happy they are, or something ""awesome"" that happened, I want to spontaneously combust. 

I know some people have it harder. I'm sorry about that. It's probably stupid for me to get so hurt by something small like a birthday. **If you have any advice on how to maybe not be as horribly agitated I would appreciate it!**",02Oct2018,1
334,"There's an app for buying and selling stuff in person where I live(Russia). I was looking for a decent angle grinder and I found one. Bought it. Only uses it today 3 weeks after the purchase. It worked for like 15 minutes and broke completely with smoke everywhere. I've been trying to figure out why it happened throughout the day and then came across a video with a fake version of this exact angle grinder compared to an original piece. Shortly after watching the comparison I got it. I bought a fake tool. The thing is, there are no checks or witnesses of this happening. I found the rest of this guy's goods on that app and realized that they are all fake versions of decent tool brands(Makita, Bochs, etc). The thing is, I can't go to the police due to not having any evidence (I asked a lawyer about that) of the deal, but I have his name and a phone number (might be fake as well) and more importantly, I know where he lives.
I'm extremely angry since I work for minimum wage and I cannot afford another tool anytime soon.
The only option I see is calling from a different number pretending to be a new customer and visit him again and have a conversation with him.

335,"Moved to a new city for school about 3 months ago, moved into a ""rent the room"" apartment where multiple tenants (strangers or not) each rent only their bedrooms and share everything else. Each tenant is on their own lease, and therefore violations or lack of rent payments of one tenant do not necessarily affect the other. 

For the first 1.5 months, roommate and I got along smimmingly. We operate on entirely different schedules so the bathroom/kitchen is always free because the other is always busy/at work/at school. 

Rewind to a month and a half ago and my roommate's girlfriend shows up. I've had roommates with SO's before, and I can be tolerant to a point. Allowing your roommate's SO to visit multiple times a week or every other week is not unreasonable, I feel. So I was fine with her being here at first. We never spoke about house guests, though in hindsight I guess I should have. When she arrived unexpectedly (my roommate didn't even tell me she was going to be coming), she herself told me that she would be visiting for the week. I nodded and smiled and decided to just allow it. 

She's now been here for a month and a half. She hogs the bathroom and kitchen constantly, is always very noisy when my roommate is around (use your imagination, sometimes they're laughing or cheering and sometimes they're obviously doing ""something"" else), she uses my toiletries and pots/pans/plates almost constantly, though for the latter at least she (sometimes) cleans them when done. 

More and more of her stuff seems to be arriving every other day, and she's been here for a month and a half now with no end in sight as to when she'll leave. This might sound extreme, but I think I'd rather just circumvent the whole ""sit down my roommate and have a chat"" thing and go straight to the management and tell them that my house mate has an extended guest who is not paying anything. 

What is the reasonable course of action here? I've had plenty of roommates in the past, though this is my first ever roommate who I'd deem ""bad."" He by himself was fine, but he's an entirely different person now that she's showed up.

336,"I just got out of a relationship a couple days ago that lasted 1yr and 8mo with somebody I saw a serious future with. We had lots of ups and downs but ultimately it came down to her not being trusting of me, after an incident summer ‘17 where she found out I knew my best friend at the time (M, same age as us) had feelings for me and I hadn’t shared that with her, after he made comments to my sister about us not lasting and I said something to the effect of “he’s just mad he can’t be with me.” I hadn’t told her because he had been my best friend for about 4mo prior to meeting her and I knew I didn’t have feelings for him (I am bisexual), would never act on it, would never let him think there was a chance, didn’t want it to affect our friendship, etc. We had been dating for 6mo and  from that point on I cut off contact with my friend, we had many arguments where she tried to break things off and I fought to keep her. I constantly felt like things were my fault, like she couldn’t see that I wasn’t the terrible person she made me out to be sometimes. Anytime I tried to bring stuff up that bothered me, mostly some questionable interactions she had with people on social media, it turned into “this is toxic, I can’t deal with it anymore.” It was like I couldn’t have an issue without it turning into her wanting to leave me. 

We really have been through too much to give you a good understanding of how close I am to this girl, how much she means to me. But despite everything I can’t help but feel so committed to someone who doesn’t even want to be with me, and it’s probably the worst feeling I’ve ever experienced. She broke things off with me because she was unhappy in our relationship, didn’t think we treated each other well enough, and couldn’t get past everything that I’d done that hurt her.

348,"So a little backstory is needed. I've been going to therapy since i was 11 or 12, and my dad always was fine with it as long as i didn't take any medication. He didn't want his preteen daughter to be doped up on happy pills instead of solving the problem. Eventually, i got a lot worse and I've always been closer with my mom so i confide that i think medication will do me good. She agrees, calls my dad and tells him. He reluctantly allowed it. 
But he was abused all his childhood and he is literally the happiest man on Earth. When my mom and him divorced, he kept up the smiles for me. This is important because he thinks that since he could stay happy despite the horrible things that happened to him, i should be able to stay happy too. He just doesn't get how someone can be mentally ill, and its not his fault. 
Anywayyyyysss after a ton of misdiagnosises (misdiagnosis' ?) 5 years later, i finally have one that suits me. A lot of horrible doctors and taking medications that don't help, i FINALLY found something that describes my every symptom and found medication to lessen them greatly. All is great.
My mom for the last couple years takes me to every therapy and psychiatrist appointment though, so my dad naturally fell out of the loop. And its too taboo for him to ask. I was diagnosed schizophrenic about 5 months ago and began trying treatment to possibly recover. How do i tell my dad this?
Also, I haven't seen him in about 11 months because his work and my agoraphobia don't line up well. So he doesn't see or witness ANY of my symptoms. He will be mad if i tell him how long i've been diagnosed and he didnt know. He would think im making this whole thing up. I know i have to tell him im schizophrenic, but he

B. hasn't seen me go through any symptoms
C. has no contact with my doctors or therapists

350,"Hi. I'm 17 years old, I'm in high school, and I am scared to death about my future right now. I really need some life advice and you guys seem like the right people to talk to.

To be kinda cocky about it, I was born with above average intelligence. I come from a family of clever people, and generally speaking, I am really good at figuring things out when I want to.

But there's the problem: *when I want to.*

My entire life, I've been lazy and self-focused and concerned only with doing what I want to do when I want to do it. I'm not heartless - if you need my help, I'll do whatever you need without complaint - but when given the choice between what I want to do and what I need to do, I will rarely if ever pick the latter. What's worse is that I almost never stress out about anything, so I can't even worry myself into getting things done.

This is hurting me in every facet of my life. I don't get my homework done (often it doesn't even cross my mind, which is frustrating), I don't think to do things like empty the dishwasher or take out the trash at home, I can't stop myself from eating like shit, I slack off at work, and I lay in bed for hours on the weekends even though I'm only wasting my own time. Even things I *want* to do, like playing music or writing or working on a project, I can't bring myself to get around to. I typically spend my afternoons browsing the internet, because I know I can't do anything fun until my work gets done, but I desperately avoid doing it anyways. I can put 110% into whatever my current fascination is, but the moment I stop enjoying it, it becomes a chore to me. Put short, I have zero work ethic and zero self control.

Today I walked into English class and discovered that we had been assigned a huge thing a month earlier and I had completely missed it. The classwork was based on it, so I couldn't even participate. I spent the period catching up on it, but I could hardly focus because I was having what I'm pretty sure was my very first panic attack. I've been facing the same problem and having the same argument with my parents for my entire life, and I legitimately believe that if I can't get this under control, I'm going to die homeless and broke. I only have a year before the world stops giving me the luxury of youth, and if I can't fix myself before that, I don't think I'll ever be capable of success.

I've tried to find solutions before, but I've learned that I can ignore any alarm or reminder, and I can't seem to go more than a day or two before settling back into my usual routine. I started taking ADD meds, and while they've actually helped with my eating a bit, they seem to do nothing for my attention span. I've had more 'first days of the rest of my life' than I can count, and every time I tell myself I'm finally gonna get it under control - but I never do, and I'm starting to think I never will.

I'm sorry for writing such a big piece but I think I needed to air this out. If you bothered to read it all, I thank you for listening. Is there anything I can do to fix this? How can I teach myself to have willpower without having it in the first place?",02Oct2018,1

354,"A bit of back story; I have been talking to this girl that me and my buddy went to school with. Me and this girl had been pretty close friends during high school, but lost touch up until July 4th when we saw each other at a party. After that day we talk with each other quite frequently and hung out quite a bit. I finaly decided to shoot my shot, however she said she wasn’t look for anything at the moment because she just got out of a long relationship and found out she had been cheated on, but she said “we’re just friends for the time being”. This was fine by me for the most part because she wasn’t quite ready for something. My feelings were still there, but I ignored them. 

Now to the juicy section: She had been having a hard time with the passing of her grandmother and she wanted out of the house, I was already at my best friends house and I asked if he was alright if she came over and he said yes. So that night we watched a few movies on netflix. I had to go home to get some sleep because I had to get up for work the next morning at 5 am. My buddy followed me outside and we moved his truck back so I could pull my truck around her car and leave. As I was getting in my truck he told me he respected me too much to do anything with her that night, and that he wanted her to leave his house but he wasn’t going to just kick her out because she was depressed. I left and I just had a gut feeling that something was going to happen between them. The next day I asked him if anything happened after I left and he told me nothing happened. 

Over the course of the last three weeks they both basically shut me out and hardly talked to me. My friend told my Sunday, September 30th what actually happened that night. I was flooded with a waterfall of emotions because I had convinced myself nothing happen that night and it was my two closest people that were fucking me over. He told me that night they went into his room to watch netflix and they ended up taking their shirts off because it was hot and they ended up making out she gave him head that night. 

My friend and I ended up hanging out like a week later and afterwards he went to her place and they sat in his truck for a while and talked and she proceeded to give him head again.

He said he felt terrible about it, because Inwas always a good friend to him. A little while after he told me I confronted her about it and really fucking grilled her about it (which was a terrible idea). She said she also said he felt bad about it, but her reasoning was because she knew we were not going to work out in her mind. 

In the end I want all of us to be friends, but it really feels like they betrayed me because they both knew how I felt about her. I also kind of figured she would have enough decency to know my best friend was kind of off limits seeing I already had a thing for her. I have already lost a lot of trust in both of them and things definitly won’t be the same between us. I’m tettering between just dropping them as friends or trying to salvage whats left of our friendship. The only problem with dropping them as friends is that my buddy is also really good friends with my only other two friends that was left.

355,"My mom lives by herself, and has become more and more of a isolated shut in, in recent years. This has made her susceptible to some particular internet fringe beliefs, as she's turned to these sites and forums to make up her social deficit. We've argued about it on more than one occasion, and I can't seem to get through to her, regardless of how objectively false her beliefs are.   
Recently, she has asked me to help her out financially, because she has mismanaged her limited income. I don't really have the money, I \*could\* make it work, by really crunching down on my own budgeting. So I had an idea:

I've considered giving her a list of short essays for her to research and write up, maybe just three pages each, with clear guidance on what are or are not appropriate sources. I'd then pay her each of the essays. Obviously, she'd be researching the objectively reality that goes against the beliefs she has fallen into, as well as related topics, like the people she has fallen in with, or topics like Dunning-Kruger, cognitive dissonance, and the ostrich effect, to see if I can get her to understand what's happened to her.

I don't like leveraging her need against her fringe behavior, but I definitely can see that it is harming her, her already limited social network, and causing her to make poor decisions. I don't necessarily have the money to support her, as I don't really see how her month-to-month deficit is going to change, so I'd basically be taking her on as a permanent expense. These essays could at least allow her a \*chance\* to climb out of the ideological hole that she is in, and making better life decisions from here on out. I could more easily justify the costs if I believed it was encouraging her long-term recovery, rather than just a band-aid that will perpetually support her further decline.

tl;dr - is making my mother choose between being poor or facing the realities of her fringe worldview cruel? The cost will definitely effect me, but ""getting"" something (her possible recovery) makes the cost more reasonable to me. Thoughts?",02Oct2018,1
356,"Give a test which I've worked hard for and show people the marks I get ""well dude calm down you're gonna fail like the rest of us next time, don't even bother to try""

Hit the gym and see a massive improvement ""This won't be for long, you better just quit""

Never been popular with the girls, but was asked out by at least 4 different girls in a matter of few months ""They are clearly playing a prank on you, how could they even like you""

I could go on and on about specific examples. I literally only have gotten 5 hours of sleep every day ever since my main exams have started for over a month and still always go to the gym at 5 am religiously. Spent so much time writing and studying.
Even spend little time every day to talk to close friends, spend every day learning to code even if it's a minuscule of an improvement. Learning so many other skills with no acknowledgment. Not once have I gotten any positive feedback and this includes family. 
These guys don't do shit with their lives, not even close to being interesting nor do they even try, yet here they are talking shit not behind my back but on my face trying to discourage me.
Well, it does seem to be working though.
This drives me to seek comfort and is forcing me to get into a relationship with a certain woman. I don't want to end up in a relationship just so that I get some positive feedback, this doesn't seem like an ideal relationship I'd want and I wanna do so many more things before I even think about women.
How does one go about ignoring these? I can't take it and it's driving me insane. I really wish everyone would just shut the fuck up with their opinions if it's meant to discourage others.

361,"Some backstory: I’ve been with a local brew pub for about a year and a half, and make good money with them although the distance from home does seem like a hassle some mornings. I work here about 30 hours a week after dropping a few shifts to make room for the other two jobs. Within the past two months I stared a second restaurant job (at a spa) slightly closer to home, but I’m not making much money, and him here about 30 hours a week right now. I’m scheduled to begin a third retail job next week. It’s at a store I’ve been trying to get into for about six months now, so I’m very excited and while the training only requires 15-20 hours a week, by the beginning of November we go into holiday hours which will demand 35-40 hours a week. 

With all of that said, I cannot keep working the  60 hours I have with adding even just the training hours on with the new job, I’m already feeling the stress of it. As it is I only have Mondays off. It seems in my best interest to leave the spa restaurant position as I’m making significantly less there. My currently problem is actually going about that. I’ve had plenty of jobs in the past, and my circumstances upon leaving have always been obscure. I’ve never been fired and I’ve never had to put a two weeks in. 

I’ve mentioned to my managers at the spa that I am beginning a new job and they seem hesitant to drop my hours given that they are VERY understaffed and have an extremely high turn-over. Both my manager here and my GM are great people and on multiple occasions have told me how much they love me working here. I don’t want to disrespect them by leaving, even if it is for my sanity. Giving my two weeks to them plus obviously be the most respectful thing to do, but with the new job beginning next week I’m terrified that I will end up draining myself mentally and physically. For the two weeks that I would inevitably be working between the three. 

I’m already sick and have no time to rest to get better and have health issues that kick up when I’m stressed. I think this is my main reason for concern. 

I would feel awful about picking up and leaving here without giving them the respect but I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle it, or give my full effort to anything. 

I do have a friend that is interested in stepping into my position at the spa, so an idea was to let them know I needed to get out as soon as possible and I could train my friend while I’m on my way out the door so that they don’t have any lapse in staffing. Problem is my friend is only 90% on board with it and I don’t want to force her into anything, so I wouldn’t put that in my managers ear until she was 100% prepared (she’s really indecisive). 

I’m at the spa all day today and wanted to get the ball moving on letting them know I’m done while I’m here, so I don’t elongate the process any further but I have no idea how to handle this. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I’m stressed. Thanks in advance  to anyone that actually read through it hah

363,"&amp;#x200B;

Throwaway because my friends use reddit, and sorry if this is too long.

I moved away from home a couple of months ago for work, and i haven’t been back in like 6 months. 

Recently, one of my friends invited me to her birthday celebration. I figured this would be a good excuse to finally head back home for a weekend. As soon as i was even thinking of heading back, i let my guys know.

Now, someone from my guys group, lets call him E, doesnt like the bday girl, lets call her B. E, at this point, practically hates B. So much that he gets annoyed/mad at me whenever i hang out with her. The reason E hates B has absolutely nothing to with me and id always preferred to stay out of it.

Anyways, i let the guys know over a group message I’m thinking of heading back and to leave the saturday I’m heading down open. E asks what the occasion is that I’m heading down for. i know he hates her but i have no reason to lie, so i tell him that Friday is B’s birthday and that i left satuday open to hang out with the guys and Sunday i head back. He doesnt reply after that.

A week later i confirm that i booked my flight and that yea I’m going to be heading back. Only one person in the group responds. no respond from E.

2 weeks before I’m heading back, again i tell the group that I’m heading back and if they are up to doing something. 2 people respond but again no respond from E.

1 week before i head back, i tell the group ill be down there on friday, no respond.

5 days before i head down i message E directly telling him that i will be down there. He responds by saying that I’m going down there for B’s party, i say yea but thats on friday, saturday is open. He specifically tells me that he works saturday and that another friend in the group is also working through the weekend. 

Eventually i head down, and have fun at B’s Party. 

Saturday at around noon i ask the group if they are doing anything. One guys responds he’s free, i tell him that ok we can go get something to eat a while later. No one else says shit. So fuck it i make plans with my family. I left my phone inside and had a cookout with my family. 4 hrs later E is the only one who responds what time we are going to go eat. i didnt check my phone till around 7 so i message them saying i was with family and i wouldn’t be able to do anything till later, again no one said shit. I message the one guy in the group who responded directly, that if it was ok if we went to go eat on sunday morning, he said sure. 

i hangout with the one guy who responded on sunday and then left back.  

Monday morning, E messages me directly saying that next time i head down, i shouldn’t “act” like i want to hang out. Heres an exact transcript of what the messages were…

E- Next time, don’t make it seem like you wanna hang out with us if you’re coming down here.

Me- I did wanna hang out, i had been telling you guys for weeks i was heading down and if y’all wanted to do anything, no one said anything.

E- No, you were coming down for B’s party, which is fine but don’t try to squeeze us in when you’re only staying for a short weekend.

Me- That was friday, i left saturday open for you guys, but again, no one except \[name A\]responded to me

E- If YOU wanted to hang out with us you would’ve said something like “hey guys ima be in this Saturday i think we should blah blah blah”.

We aren’t making plans for you, you are the one who has to go back at a certain time.

We would’ve said yes to anything you said but you left it up to us.

Me- i asked, you said you were working.

E- We even agreed to to eating, \[name B\] didnt even eat until 12am waiting for you. I even asked what time are we eating. And you saying you are with your parents we understand. But it doesn’t take long to say “ hey guys i know i said wed eat but I’m with the family right now”

Its the same bs everytime though, I’m not even mad its just annoying.

Me- i had been asking you guys for weeks, and again, \[nameA\] was the only one who ever said anything, even a couple of days beforehand, i asked you and you said you were working sat and sunday.

E- and again we agreed to going out to eat.

Me- Last minute, and at that time i wasn’t on my phone which is my fault

E- i asked right after, and then you got \[nameA\] to ask me if y’all could come over

Me- you asked 4 hrs later, and i didnt ask him to ask you, he did that on his own. Again you said you worked sunday so i didnt ask. This is literally just bad communication.

E- I’m tired of the same bs all I’m saying, next time you come, plan on it. Don’t try to squeeze us in. You know me and \[nameB\] work all the time. We aren’t in the position to be last minute shit.

Me- Yes i know, which is why i didnt ask last minute. As soon as my flight was booked i told everyone. no one said shit. A week later i asked again. \[nameA\] responded. A week later, same thing. Then i asked you personally.

E- we know you were going for B’s party and you were most likely going to hang out with your family. why try to squeeze us in is what I’m saying. Do you. We don’t care. But when we responded you didnt say anything.

Me- you responded sat afternoon, after weeks of asking.

E- I WORK!

Me- I know

E- i responded when i got the chance, \[NameB\] didnt even work.

Me- you said he was working

E- and \[nameA\] doesnt even work thats why he’s able to respond to you its easier for him to hang out with you than it is us. He told you he didnt work, he wasn’t too happy, this dude was waiting for you to answer to go eat. Told him to wait maybe we do something and nothing. but i don’t wanna blow this up more than i have to.

All I’m saying is if you’re gonna hang out with us let us know ahead of time. You were going for a party, not us. Which is cool like i said.

Me- miscommunication is all it was

Sorry if this is way too long, i just can’t seem to wrap my head around what i did that was so wrong? Yea i get it thats my fault i didnt have my phone on me when he finally did respond, but i tried to be open and honest about everything. What did i do that was so fucked up?",02Oct2018,1
364,"Long back story and then onto my dilemma.

My ex asked if she and the kids could move 20 hours away to X. I said yes and that i will meet back up with them when I find work. 

That was in August ‘18

I have a job that I love.  I make 84k a year. Have nice benefits, nice vacation policy and also a 4 day work week. 

I asked my boss a few times about remote work and each time it was stated he will see what he can do. 

So I began applying for other jobs closer. I found one in Y. Only a 6 hour drive and the pay is 20-25k more a year. The work is in my field however the job is a bit of an outlier. 

I tell my boss that I have accepted the job and he then finally gets Approval for me to work remote. I explain the pay difference is huge. But I’d be willing to stay for 90k and remote work. He tells me he can’t do the raise, since I was just recently promoted. 

However with 85k I could still live within 2 hours of my kids and see them more frequently. Plus work from home. 

I love my kids and miss them like crazy. But I also like money with hopes of providing them with more. 


Do I take the new job and move to a new city for 20k salary increase. 

Or do I stick with what I am comfortable with and see my kids 2-4 days more a month?

366,"Hey all, currently in Grad school. There has been someone who has been pretty disrespectful to me, called me a 'wimp' in front of our professor when we were doing something. I just asked him one a question once, and he said 'i'll kill you mo$#er f#@$%.' I didn't say anything back those two times.

I even noticed hes been saying hi to everyone else but me. Maybe he looks down on me because I'm Asian (South Asian) and hes White, probably but thats not my problem.

Today when I was walking, he was behind me and said, 'your walking to slow.' And I just responded back, because I never want him to talk to me, by saying 'Fuck off.' Then he said 'what did you say? Why did you say that. Do you want to take it outside.' Then i said do not talk ot me. Other people later came to me, didn't know how they knew, maybe they were listening when we were walking out.

Update: moved to roaming around the city for now as shelter still has no room and I'd love some advice from anyone? My mind is starting to go negative quickly..

I moved to this new city (Niagara Falls) about 4 months ago to be with a guy. He became physically abusive and was always emotionally abusive but I never really saw it until I lived with him. I was pregnant when he kicked me out after an explosive fight and I never heard from him then. I got a bit of help from neighbours of his (who took me in a for a few days), I got an abortion and that mental scar is haunting me to this day. Since then, I've bounced from a guys place (met online, room in exchange for household chores but turns out he was crazy - I know this is very dangerous but I was desperate) to shelter to shelter. I've slept in a park more times than I can count. I have picked up odd jobs here and there, I have an interview on Thursday which I hope works out.

376," 

So I met this guy on Tinder, I hit him up because we had similar interests and he's really hot. After talking for a bit, he gives me his IRL name and for some reason I decide to google his name + username and find his personal tumblr. I couldn't resist looking through it, and it turns out we have a \*lot\* of shared interests. From obscure music to tv shows to  
specific games. I of course didn't tell him about this, since that'd be really weird imo.

He's new in my city, he's from the other side of the world, so I ask him if he'd like to grab a drink and maybe hike around the city. He says he'd really like that and gives me his number. We make plans for that Friday night to grab a drink. Come Friday afternoon and he says he's actually really emotionally drained and would rather stay at home, which I totally get. He just finished his first week of uni in an entirely new country. I tell him to take it easy and that we could grab a drink the next week. Tuesday comes around and I hit him up again, proposing to play some Pokemon Go that weekend (PoGo because he put it in his bio and that was the reason why I hit him up). He says he'd like that, but he has an important exam the week later, so he can't hang out for that long. It's Saturday morning and I ask him if he has time to play some PoGo and he says he'd rather hang out when he has some more time. I'm obviously disappointed, but I understand it.

Fast forward to a week later, and I hit him up last Saturday, asking how his exam went. He hasn't replied yet, nor even read it. I'm pretty sure he hasn't even been online since then, since I've never seen him online, while I've seen him online plenty of times before then. He did say that he's really busy with uni and work, so that might be why.

Now I can almost hear you guys think ""I'm sorry dude, but he's not interested"". And I'd think that as well, but I don't think that's the case. He said he's just looking for friends, since he's new in the country. He told me he's doing fine but ""could do with some new friends"" when I asked him how he liked the city. He has also posted to his Tumblr a couple of times that he's lonely and would like some (gay) friends. I'm okay with just being friends, I don't necessarily need anything more than that. About 4 days after I found his Tumblr, he posted something along the lines of ""Hello stalker from \[our city\]! Shout out to you! Hit me up, please don't be shy!"". I'm 99% sure he was talking about me, but I never hit him up. To me that seems that he actually wants to make some friends in the city.

I'm also pretty sure he's at least kinda interested in me, or at least hanging out with me, because whenever I suggest something he seems excited. The first time we were supposed to grab a drink, he said that we could even do some Pokemon Go things. I doubt he'd say that if he wasn't planning on hanging out. The day before out first ""date"" he sent me a selfie with the caption ""This is me!"", again if he didn't want to hang out I don't see why he'd even have to send a selfie. I've seen his profile pic already. Both times he canceled on me, he seemed keen on making other plans. Like he said he'd rather hang out when he felt better/had more time. He never just said that he couldn't because he felt bad or didn't have time, he always added that we could do something some other time.

I'm unsure what to do. He seems way too perfect to just let go, since I also would like a (gay) friend with the same interests whom I can talk to, but I also don't want to come across as pushy. I've come really close to just hitting him up on Tumblr or text him and say that I'm his ""stalker"", say that we share a bunch of interests and hope he's not too creeped out, but I'm afraid that'll just creep him out. At this point he doesn't know \*that\* much about me, he knows we share some interests but not nearly as much as I know.

I have experience in a variety of fields but besides for computer help I’m not a pro in anything. My girlfriend of 5 years also left me out of nowhere in April so that didn’t help. 

I decided to go back to school for IT but will take 4 years to get this degree. I started going to the gym in February and I’m in the best shape of my life but I’m also unemployed now. I know with full time school the most I can get is a part time job or I won’t be able to handle the workload, I’m living at home still....

Just sucks seeing everyone succeed, have families and great jobs. And here I am unemployed and single at 30 living at home starting his life from scratch. I’d understand if I was a bad person but my whole life has just been full of misfortunes to lead me here. I don’t even have anything to blame myself over anymore. I just feel like shit and it’s out of my control. Anybody else been in a situation like this? What did you do to get you out of your slump?",02Oct2018,1
378,"Throwaway name for obvious reasons.  

I'll try to keep this as coherent as possible but there's a lot of backstory.  

I graduated from college a little over a decade ago and landed a job at a financial services company working on collateralized securities as a consultant to investment management firm that invested in distressed securities.  This was a dream entry level role into a very well known financial services company.  I'm a bit of an introvert so I have difficulty meeting new friends as the job is in a city well away from home.  I come into the office everyday and always have small talk with the receptionists out front.  One of them, we'll call her Nancy, is always extremely nice, attractive, and friendly. 

 

Fast forward a few months to the company Halloween party and me still not really knowing anyone in the area and still being introverted.  I was planning on skipping out on the festivities when I decided I might as well go and make friends.  I get there and run into Nancy.  We start exchanging small talk and as the night progresses we agree to exchange numbers and go catch a movie later in the week.  Things go well at the movie and as the weeks go by we enter into a relationship.  She tells me about her abusive ex and how things ended poorly with him and that she has been in a professional mentorship program for sometime as way of building herself back up after the way her ex tore her down mentally. 

&amp;#x200B;

This sounds great and I fully support her continuing doing this.  As the program progresses she tells me all about her mentor who's 10-15 years older than us.  This wonderful guy we'll call Bernard.  Nancy and I are getting along great and since we're both young we frequently go to social outings several times a week as I make more and more friends.  Nancy invites Bernard one night and I notice that Bernard, who has a very successful career, a family of his own, and is deeply involved in his church.  He is also a big party animal.  I believe he was on cocktail 4-5 by the time I finish cocktail one. He frequently visits the restroom inviting others to go with him.  We can all put two and two together on that one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I bring this up to her and Nancy blows it off as no big deal.  I figure, whatever.  That's his deal.  I had a very serious job and couldn't partake in that kind of thing.  Time passes and Nancy and I decide to get hitched and I see Bernard from time to time and he's still the same guy I met the first night.  Nancy and I decide to get married and that's when shit started going down hill.  Shortly after we got married the financial markets collapse and I'm starring down the road at unemployment.  Nancy gets laid off as well.  Most folks with my background were almost radioactive because of the perception of anyone tied to those financial institutions and since the whole economy was suffering even receptionist work was impossible to find.  Things got pretty dire financially as we both were out of work for some time.  Nancy had always enjoyed a drink or two but it was around this time I noticed how severe it was.  

&amp;#x200B;

I started working contract software development jobs as I was previously a CS major in undergrad and could still program a little but things were still extremely tight as I was making a fraction of what I was making.  I sold my car to make up for back rent and was taking the bus to work.  The whole workday was a 12-14 hour ordeal each day because it took forever to get to work on the bus.  Nancy wasn't working and quite frankly wasn't looking.  Almost everyday when I got home, the apartment we had to move into was a disaster.  Food left out.  Empty beer cans and wine bottles on the counter and Nancy would be passed out drunk in bed.  I confront her about this and she says it isn't an issue.  I disagreed and our relationship starts to become extremely strained.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon after that, we find out Nancy is pregnant.  Not the best timing.  I hadn't been drinking for a while because we quite simply couldn't afford it and she stops the drinking as well, but is noticeably anxious and short tempered all the time Looking back on it, it probably was withdrawal and depression.  Bernard keeps in contact with Nancy throughout the pregnancy but only more frequently.  They spend all day texting and chatting and I think nothing of it and encourage her talking to someone to work through things.   Fast forward to the birth of the baby and things are a little better but not much.  I was contacted by one of the firms I used to work with to help them untangle some of the mess they were in due to the collapse and things were improving with us financially.  After the baby hits 3 months or so, Nancy starts drinking again and returns to her old ways.  

&amp;#x200B;

I had gotten into a health kick while was unemployed to help stave off some of my own issues with anxiety and didn't really drink much anymore and Nancy was at home with the baby full time because she had never sought employment.  Same thing starts to happen.  I come home and the house is destroyed, beer cans everywhere, and Nancy is sitting on the couch drunk texting Bernard while I cook, clean, and take care of the baby.   I seek out Nancy's parents who live around the corner to get advice on how to handle things because I'm worried something will happen to the baby if things continue.  They approach her about it and she tells them I'm lying and their isn't an issue.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if she does it out of spite but she seeks out Bernard as an outlet to let her frustration out.  As time progresses they're talking so frequently I feel like I can't get a word in with her and the messages are starting to come at all hours of the night.   I approach her again about this and she says they're just friends and nothing is going on. 

 

Nancy comes home from happy hour with her girlfriends one night completely intoxicated to the point she climbs in bed and throws up all over it.  It was 3am on a Tuesday and that's when the idea of leaving starts to creep into my head.  I honestly couldn't stand it anymore.  Her dings and I notice Bernards name pop up on the text notification.  Trying to figure out what the hell he wanted, I pick up the phone and see the message ""U make it home ok?"".  Knowing this her mentor I respond, ""yes she did."".  That's when the entire chat history popped up and I found out that had been talking romantically and for the past couple of months and Bernard had even tried to convince her to leave with my 8 month child and runoff so they could be together as a family.  Keep in mind, Bernard was married and had his own family.  Nothing had happened sexually, but the intent was clear.  This was the final straw.

&amp;#x200B;

We divorced soon after and they continued on as paramours for a little while before Bernard found a newer, younger one.  Years go by and Nancy continues drinking and being an utter mess.  She can't hold down a job, continues drinking, and pays little to no attention to our child.  After the divorce, I decided to focus on just my child and my career as a way keeping myself busy and coping with my marriage ending.   

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward x amount of years and my career is going extremely well and during that time I met the true love my life and we welcomed a child of our own into the family.  I honestly could not be happier.  Until last Thursday.

&amp;#x200B;

I now work in corporate development that owns 40+ companies and have to frequently attend meetings at those companies to cover various efforts, strategy, etc.  We recently acquired a new company and I was attending the post acquisition meet and great.  I had met a few of the executives during the due diligence process and was exchanging greetings with them when in walks Bernard.  I immediately recognize him but he doesn't recognize me.  Thats when the rage starts building up inside of me but I calm down enough to control my anger and continue with the meeting in a professional manner.  

&amp;#x200B;

The executive team is presenting business unit performance numbers as part of building the integration plan for the newly acquired business and I notice the BU Bernard runs is wildly inconsistent and generally underperforming.  The meeting concludes and typically we have a general understanding of who needs to go and who needs coaching in the acquisition. 

&amp;#x200B;

I retire to dinner with a colleague of mine that I'm close friends with.  We're discussing work stuff and the conversation turns to Bernard's piece of the business.  Without noticing I blurt out something along the lines of ""yeah, fuck that guy."" and my colleague questions why I feel this way.   We're very good friends (he was in wedding no. 2) and knows about my ex and I explain that Bernard was the guy causing all the issues in my first marriage.  I explain to him Bernard's habits outside of work and how that may be contributing to his poor performance.  My colleague replies with a simple, ""He has to go."".

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the conundrum.  The vindictive side of me wants to make the recommendation that we can him but the morally conscious side of me knows he has a family that depends on him and what happened was some time ago.  I don't know if he's still up to his old ways but usually we like to try coaching first before we let people go that have that much responsibility for the sake of continuity.  This would mean I would have direct access to him at some point to review process and best practices and the light will surely flip on for him during that time.  If I make the recommendation to terminate immediately, I'll have to explain myself and bringing personal matters into the fold won't do me any favors.  If I don't, I face the possibility of having to coach a terrible human being into performing better in his role.  I honestly have no idea what to do.

That shit was rough, now we used to talk really shallow shit everyday, but it was just our way to keep in touch, usually meet twice a week, and sometimes we could go on deep talks, we really had some close friendship.




I have never lost someone close to me, really the death of his father is what I have felt the most, I tried to be on all the ""formal"" things we do here when someone dies, I tried to be there for my friend. After that we haven't talked and I kind of wish I could ask him how he is doing, but I feel asking him will just bring him back to think more on the stuff or will be overwhelming because I am sure he gets that everyday, but also feel that sending something like a meme or other stuff is like, ""Dude come on, remember what I am living, don't be stupid now"".

382,"Hey reddit,

So I'm a 22 year old straight guy. This has happened maybe 5-7 times in the past year, with almost all coworkers. I previously worked in a restaurant with 3 gay guys.  I'm pro lgbtq and I'm a really non-judgemental person, so I would befriend whoever, regardless of the orientation or gender, yada yada. What starts off as casual conversations and friendships turns into ""well I thought you were bi/gay"" and ""well you don't have to hide anything"". And no matter how many times I say ""no. I'm straight"" it's as if i would catch them always telling me ""well you have options"" and calling me ""handsome""/touching my back and arms and stuff. I was going to eventually put my foot down after it started escalating, but I had to leave the job due to unrelated reasons. My coworkers told me that the gay guys do it to a lot of the straight guys, and to not take it personally.

I started a new job at a different restaurant... same thing happened when I met a new coworker. He pulled the ""I thought you were gay"" and then touched my back when I walked away and called me handsome even after I said I'm straight. I don't want to seem like a homophobe, and I'm a very scary guy when I get angry, so I hit my tongue and walked away Even though I really just wanted to turn around and break his jaw for being so fucking rude and uncomfortable. 

Then, on 2 other occasions (maybe) I've had gay guys catcall me (do the *come here* with the finger, ask for my number) but granted it was in NYC and the venues were questionable.

I'm a clean cut guy, I have sharp long eyebrows,  6'0 180 lbs, athletic (former big college recruit for hurdling and also a a possible d2 football player), I pay attention to what I wear and I really have no problems with women, at all honestly. I'm a generally attractive guy but this has been fucking bugging me and I don't know how to take it/what to do. No girls have ever told me this, ever. When i tell my current girlfriend, she laughs and says its because i'm handsome, hygenic and have a nice butt. It's just gay dudes.

I really believe my grandpa is either mentally ill or just an asshole. I don't know. But he believes everyone is selfish, and that you can't trust anyone. I grew up being told my family was full of junkies and scumbags, and that I needed to be successful in order to not be like them, so I wouldn't end up alone, unloved, and a failure. He constantly pushes these things on me, and the pressure and anxiety is often debilitating and crippling. 

I've been trying to find a job so I can pay for drivers Ed, but I can't find a job without transportation. My grandparents are reliable, but my grandpa doesn't want me getting a job because he believes it will ""kill"" his own job. But he won't even try to help pay so I can take drivers Ed, and won't teach me how to drive either. 

Hes always indirectly talking me out of going to college, saying I can't afford it and I'll just get fucked over by the government. And the things he says really get to me because I've looked up to him for a really long time. I constantly doubt myself and my abilities. All through high school, he told me the reason I was failing was because I wasn't trying hard enough. I have been trying so hard to 'escape' but I literally can't. I'm so desperate. I just want to leave but I've got no where to go. 

I'm just a burden to him. He says he sticks around because of me, but will then tell me my problems don't exist. He doesn't believe I have anxiety, something I am diagnosed with. Nobody in real life understands the extent of my situation. I feel like a prisoner.

387,"I’m a supervisor and I wait tables at a small ramen restaurant. It was as busy as a weekend night on Monday night but it was just me and a new girl instead of 3 like weekend nights are staffed. It was horrible. An older couple said I was doing fine and that they waited tables when they were young and it would be okay. I cried. A lot. 

This specific environment is too stressful for me. We have to host, bus, answer the phone, get drinks, take and package to go orders and serve all at the same time and we share everything. We don’t get assigned tables. We just run all over the place doing what needs to be done and we have to be aware of the status of every table to stay on top of it. Apparently, I’m good at my job because customers say I’m their favorite waitress. I’m also a supervisor. 

What’s hard to leave is how much money I make. We get $7.50/hr (or in my case $8. Big whoop) + tips. It comes out to averaging like $25-30/hr. So if I work 18 hours a week I get at least $900 in two weeks. It’s more like $700 after taxes though.

I’m a junior studying Informatics in the Fulton schools of engineering at ASU full time and I’m fostering 3 cats and trying to beat an eating disorder and all that jazz. My boyfriend and I have an apartment that’s about $1100/mo and it’s pretty crummy but we have to live close to campus where it’s more expensive because he doesn’t drive. There’s been a couple shootings this year. He works on campus and only gets a few hundred a month and they’re really inconsistent about when the checks get distributed. I have some classes online and some in person so I only go on campus 7:30am-4:15pm Tuesdays and Thursdays and the rest of my week is flexible.

Is there something that I can do that would have similar pay that I could structure around my school schedule?

What I can do: I am alright at programming with java and I can do web design like css, html, JavaScript. I’m good at scheduling things. I’m great at customer service. Pretty good at memorizing codes and things (I used to work at Starbucks and my mom worked for an airline so I memorized a lot of codes and things). I’m incredible with animals. I can calm any animal down. I’m fantastic at doing busy work well and quickly. When I have time I act as producer for my friend’s production company, which means I handle scheduling and equipment management as well as film permits and communications. Sometimes transcription. 

Any suggestions? I am ready to look into anything. 
I just need some hope. I know I’m asking a lot.

388,"Recently I entered college as a freshman, and I was super excited to meet new people and make new friendships... until despite my best efforts I ended the first week with virtually none. 

Desperate to at least have some friends, I joined a university discord and tried putting myself out there. What I found was that most of the people in the chat were already tight-knit friends, having been in the discord and chatting together since before school started.

Since joining I’ve managed to finagle my way into some meetups and stuff that they’ve done, but it’s always felt like I invited myself. I really want to be a part of this friend group because they share so many of my interests and they all seem super cool - but I’m having trouble with feeling like they want me around, I guess.

When I went to those meetups, I always felt like I was figuratively in the corner of the room while they were in the center, and whenever I said something I felt like I was kind of invisible and that no one really had anything to say in response to me. Recently they all planned a lunch together, and despite expressing interest in coming, I felt like I was ignored and I again had to invite myself to their lunch. They were ok with it, it’s not like I was uninvited, but the fact that I wasn’t really a blip on the radar when they were planning it worries me.

What advice would you give me for this situation? Is it bad to be too forceful in this?Coming in as a relative outsider and trying to push myself into their group feels weird and difficult to me, and I already have issues with feeling accepted by people in general. Thanks.

Bringing things up from a decade ago and asking why they weren't resolved (they were...also a decade ago). Not only was it annoying at first but now it's impacting many people's day to day work (mine included). She has a cat and siblings that live in other states. She doesn't date or have a ""best friend"" I've even heard of. I'm afraid this will start to trickle to clients and ultimately our business as a whole. I'm obviously also concerned about her. To get ahead of any questions- I've kept our relationship very professional and do not feel like I can bring this up to her. I mention she is unmarried and childless because I don't think there's anyone else that would notice how impactful this is day to day.

390,"I have always regretted this. Not taking the initiative. It's been over 2 years. Almost 3 years now.


I met someone that i felt a real connection to. She was Cute as a button, but I just never took the initiative. It's really tough for me to talk about, but here goes. I don't know, just read and tell me if you think i would've had a shot, or if it would be smart to actually talk to her again. I still think about her from time to time. But would it be a good idea to message her, or, potentially, ask her on a date, or even just straight up confess?


It was my first year of college when i met her, there was a group of friends i used to hang out with in high school. They were sitting in the lobby, talking. Since i didn't have anything else to do, So i joined them. She was with them. One of our friends introduced us, and said she was new in town and didn't have many friends here. We talked a bit and the next day, i saw her again, so i went up and said hello. We talked for a bit, and every day after that we would talk to each other, sometimes up to a half hour.


We were very similar. Seriously, like scary similar. It really felt like i met, like, a duplicate of myself. Except, you know, female. We were similar in a lot of ways, similar values, hobbies and even similar personalities. Plus, neither of us drove. We both got picked up by somebody. We also hate tomato, yet love ketchup and spaghetti sauce and pizza. The only difference I ever really between us was that I like anime and she doesn’t. The biggest part for me, however. Was politics. You see, i am a conservative. That's just how i've always been. Now, i've always heard about how left leaning college campuses are. I never honestly expected to run into another conservative. especially one so incredibly vocal and active about their beliefs.


I started to like her, she might have felt the same for me, i don't know for sure though. I saw a few signs, nothing certain, but still. I know she always laughed at my sense of humor. I have a very weird sense of humor, i think it's called dry humor, but i make a little ""quip"" about almost everything, and most people think it's bizarre or stupid. It's gotten me a lot of weird looks, but not her, she always bursted out laughing whenever i would. I've never really was able to make anyone laugh like that. And some of the things i said were really stupid. Our first meeting, we only learned each other's first names. The next time we met, i learned her last name. Her last name is also that of a celebrity and i just said ""Any relation to (that celebrity)"". Laughed like crazy, she asked me for mine, i told her mine, she said something about it, like what country of origin it is because i have a fairly unique last name, it's german, then i just said ""Hey, maybe next time, we can learn each others middle names"" more laughing. My celebrity impressions also got a kick out of her. Then there was the time a celebrity died, she was on her phone and said something about it, and I just remarked “well, looks like Hillary just got another vote”. But, i think most i've ever made her laugh was a joke i made. It was something about Hillary Clinton and having something fall on her. I just said ""If that happened, i wonder if her feet would curl up and slink back under it.""


Yes, my quips were stupid, but they got a laugh out of her. Every time. Everyone else gets weirded out and annoyed by my humor, but not her. They always got a laugh out of her. And I enjoyed making her laugh, she always had this cute laugh, which she’d snort. That’s the only sign I ever got from her, well that and she always tried to high five me and shake my hand if that means anything


Anyway, we were also both somewhat shy people, so i never made a move, she didn't either. And for 2-3 days a week for almost a year, we talked every time we saw each other, not just saying hi as we passed each other, but we would sit in the lobby together after class, talking as we waited for our rides to come to pick us up, which sometimes took up to a half hour. Every day, she'd talk to me, just me until her sister picked her up. About life, some favorite interests we had in common. It was really nice and I actually looked forward to it. Then there was the last day before Christmas vacation, I sat at a table, we sat at the same table and talked for almost an hour before her family came and got her. Exclusively me. She didn’t glance at her phone, except to call her family that class was over (we had our final exam that day), but it took only about 20-30 minutes and class was generally 3 hours).


We had the same math class my first semester, but the second, however, we didn’t. Our paths just crossed because we had the same schedule. I mean, I had a girl, with whom, I had a solid connection with and saw every day. But I never did anything about it. My first semester, I didn’t know her as well as I did the day before Christmas Break. I thought that would be it, but the next year we had a similar schedule again. I still didn’t do it. I wanted to, but I just couldn’t formulate the words to do it. I’d always freeze up before I could do it. I just kept telling myself “next week, I’ll surely do it next week” but weeks turned to months and before I knew it, the semester was over. She was gone the next year. She transferred to a university (it was a community college). And my chances were lost forever. I never saw her again.


She was smart, she was cute, she’s one of the few people I’ve met who actually really liked my sense of humor, she always wanted to talk to me and even approached me on her own, she seemed interested in me and I just let her get away.


i kind of miss her, and still, honestly, have some feelings for her. I am friends with her on Facebook, but have never messaged her. I mean, over 2 years has passed since that time. Since we’ve talked or communicated whatsoever. I really miss her, and letting her slip by it definitely one of my biggest regrets. In the time, she's graduated, but she hasn't posted anything about a boyfriend, getting married, or anything. She posted about how fun her summer was, but everything she posted was with her sister. I still have some slight hope that maybe I still have a shot at rectifying things, but she probably doesn’t remember me anyway. I haven’t even bothered trying.",02Oct2018,1
391,"I've been dating my boyfriend for 4 years now. We started dating my senior year of high school. We went through a really rough patch in our relationship and broke up for a month about a year ago (I broke up with him for good reasons). Since that breakup, things have been really awkward between him and my friends (stuff happened that makes them not really like him).  But also since that break up, our relationship came full circle and we've been having a wonderful time, our relationship is loving and fulfilling. We really do make a good pair.
 
I left the country a month and a half ago and wont return to the States until January so my boyfriend and I are long distance. When I left, it really sucked and I cried knowing how much I was going to miss him, but now I don't feel that same longing anymore. We message frequently and facetime 2 to 3 times a week. But when he says how much he misses me and I don't reciprocate the same feelings. I dont know if it's the distance or if I just genuinely don't miss him that much. 
 
I don't know whether we should stay together or not. Every time I think about breaking up with him, I feel so miserable thinking of my life without him, I just can't do it. On one hand, our relationship is wonderful and we truly love eachother and talk about getting married some day. And on the other, our relationship has so much baggage and negativity in the past, it's hard to forget. It's also important to me that my boyfriend can be friends with my friends and that's never something he's been able to do.

392,"A girl (Janet) just moved in with my two friends (Lisa and Steve) and she's insufferable. Her personality is basically middle school Hot Topic on steroids. This opinion is shared by at least 2 other people that we all hang out with. I get the feeling that her obnoxious behavior is generally just off putting, so I'm not the only one noticing. 

I wish it was as simple as telling my friends to stop inviting her to our get togethers and parties. She's apparently been friends with Lisa for at least a decade. I have no idea how Steve feels about Janet, but I'm fairly sure it doesn't matter as he's (as much as I hate to say this) whipped.

Is there a polite way to tell Lisa and Steve to leave Janet at home? Tbh, I don't think there is. However, her presence is starting to affect whether or not I invite Lisa and Steve to things and I feel like an asshole. ",02Oct2018,1
393,"To fill you in on the deets, the neighbor is someone I went to high school with. Used to be friends, drifted apart. As I got older I didn't quite agree with his moral character. ( Got fired for being racist, got his ass beat right in front of my door for saying racist things to my upstairs neighbor... the list goes on. )

Anyways for the past couple year I noticed him eaves dropping on me. I live in some cheap apartments. I can hear EVERYTHING. I can tell when someone enters the building and I sure can tell someone whispering shhh and crouch near my door. Back then it wasn't bad. It would happen maybe every few months. But recently he has made it into his routine. Almost everytime he comes home, he steps by my door before going in. And if he can actually hear me, he'll do some creepy shit like pretending to go in and then stay near my door in order to catch me off guard. Yesterday he repeated this process over five times. And after an hour had passed, I figured he had gone, so I went to grab a drink from the fridge which is right next to the front door. I hear ""oh shit he stood up!"" And I see through the peephole him and his gf running to his door. This kid just staked outside my door for a freaking hour. I don't know what his problem is but I'm pretty tired of hearing/seeing them giggling outside my door being creeps. 

 I have a couple theories why this may be happening. In order from most likely.

 - I occassionally trip on acid and he may have heard something goofy like me singing. I think this is the most likely option considering the giggling and getting his gf involved. 

 - He's trying to dig up dirt cause his sister likes me and has been trying to hook up. She sends me gifts when I hardly know her and barely talk to her.

 
 Regardless of what his reasoning is. I'm pretty annoyed and feel like my privacy is being violated. I'm tired of him listening in and commenting on what he hears inside. This isn't a paranoia, I've physically seen him outside my door and his comments are very specific.

 I'm debating whether to confront him or just go straight to management. Guys bit of a loose cannon. He got jumped at our apartments cause he pulled a gun on someone ""as a joke""

394,"I have (had) a great friend who I've know for a few years. We saw each other everyday and got along really well. I ended up getting her a great job (put in some calls with a personal contact) and she moved to the other side of the country for the summer. During the summer I tried to stay in touch, but hardly ever heard a response from her. 

We had a group trip planned for August, and it had been scheduled for a long time in advance, and it was planned for after her job wrapped up. Two days before the trip I got a text message from her saying she had another vacation offer from her new friends she made at the job, so she wasn't coming on my trip. She also did not offer to cover her accommodation that I had pre-paid for.  She then went on her vacation and proceeded to block me and my friends that were on the trip on Instagram (sounds childish to care, I know). But when we confronted her about this, she said she blocked us so she could still post on IG and not feel guilty because she knew we were mad at her. 

She was still traveling for one more month after this incident, and I didn't hear anything from her during that time. She is now back in town and has been for about a week, and I found out she has a new job. I've still heard nothing from her and I'm really hurt. She was a really good friend of mine, and I did a lot for her (including getting her that job) and I feel like I have just been removed from her life.

396,"I live in an apartment-style dormitory with three girls who have a very different definition of “clean” from me, it seems. I grew up in a house where I was taught to put away as I go so that the cleaning work doesn’t pile up. The phrases “many hands make light work” and “clean as you go” are probably burned in my brain indefinitely. In my early childhood there were schedules my parents made that I adhered to, and if I didn’t have those chores finished in time to go somewhere then I had to complete them before leaving. Let’s use the example of making cookies - if I were making cookies, I’d take all the ingredients and materials out and put them away as I go (i.e. putting the sugar and flour bags back after measuring the right amount out), and then wash the dishes as they baked. Keeping clean is just a part of my upbringing, as we had a small house where small messes were more apparent to the eye than they would be in a bigger space. I am not perfect but I do perform a nightly scan before going to bed to make sure that my personal items are not in the way of others, and that all I can do is done.

My 3 roommates, however, are very much not this way. If they were making cookies, they’d take all the ingredients out and leave them out, leave the dishes sitting in the sink despite an empty dishwasher right next to it, and their plates and milk glasses would be left out in the living room area over multiple nights. They’re nice people, and I wouldn’t want to say anything to ruin our friendships, but it definitely feels like they leave things out knowing I’m going to have a panic attack and fix it. They leave out homework papers, backpacks, shoes, dirty socks, dirty dishes, tampons, laptops, frat party paraphernalia, empty beer cans (we’re all underage, and that part particularly upsets me because while I’m not a straight edge myself and am known to enjoy some booze every now and again, the school performs random apartment checks and we could be expelled). The kitchen particularly upsets me. Two of my roommates cook a lot, which is fine but they don’t clean up after themselves for days at a time. There’s crumbs everywhere, butter and milk get left out to the point of melting/spoiling, dishes flood out of the sink and get placed on countertops, if things boil over on the stove they don’t clean that mess, and the kitchen counters are overridden with food crumbs and more personal stuff. I have a paralyzing fear of mice/rodents and I’m beginning to get nervous that we’re going to get them. It wouldn’t be that big of a deal if they’d just clean when asked, but 1) they don’t, and 2) I shouldn’t have to ask a 20-year-old to put butter back in the fridge. 

I can’t tell if I’m blowing this out of proportion by needing things cleaner than they are, or if this is as genuinely gross as I think it is. I sometimes feel like I have three children. They have friends over a lot, which is fine and I don’t mind, but I see in their faces that they think this space is really dirty. When I step in crumbs or trip on shoes I can’t help but feel a little upset, or think to myself “I would be so embarrassed to have my friends over”, and then that thought makes me more upset because I feel like I deserve to live in a space where I feel comfortable having friends over for dinner.

I’m not sure how to address this with them. One of the girls has passive-aggressive tendencies and I’m never sure if the things I say have us on the same page or if she’s just going to gossip about me to her boyfriend later. The second girl is very sweet and tries to keep clean when I ask but it’s just genuinely a habit of hers that she can’t break, and the third girl I barely know and don’t feel super comfortable asking her to do stuff considering we’ve only talked a handful of times.

I just need things to be cleaner but I’m not sure how to address it with them in a way that won’t be rude but will get my point across. I’m not sure they really understand the full extent of the problem because I am usually so quick to clean up behind the messes.",02Oct2018,1

398,"So my dad is Republican and my sister is a Dem. I am somewhere in the middle, and my mom doesnt talk politics. We haven't really been a political family up until Trump started running for President. When Trump started his run my dad began posting politically motivated things, mostly anti-Democratic things. Right before the election there was a short conversation they ended awkwardly.  Since the Kavanaugh appointment and allegations have started my dad has been posting more and more things about it, siding with Kavanaugh. I usually stay out of politics on Facebook, but he began posting things that were basically saying because it was 30 years ago it shouldnt matter and we need to worry about stuff like that, and that struck a nerve because I good friend of mine recently came out that she was sexually abused by her dad. I will say I do not believe this is guilty until proven innocent atmosphere that has been created with the #MeToo movement. But a recent post made me comment because of something my dad said. I simply said something along the lines of I would like all the cards on the table before a vote is done on him, and we went back and forth for a bit before I moved on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this morning, my sister called me and said she called our dad last night because of another post he put out there which struck a nerve with her. She went to ""unfollow"" him but said to herself, he is my father I can't and decided to  call him and talk to him about the posts. Saying that she understands what he is doing but it is making us feel uncomfortable because of the message that is coming out of it. She brought me up because we were on a trip over the weekend and had conversations about it. She said she couldnt read how he was reacting over the phone, he kept to prove his point and then just said ok to what she was saying until she hung up. Like I said usually ignore most political posts on Facebook because they are mostly just memes or uneducated opinions. But with this being my dad and now that I have commented on in it and he knows the feeling I am worried about what this do to us a family at the gatherings.

So long story short, I am wondering if I should reach out to my dad about it, wait until we do one of our regular family gatherings, or just let it go.

There's still hundreds of people ahead of me on the waiting lists I signed up for last year.

I'm not financially able to hire a nanny. My husband can't support our family with his income, nor could I with mine.

He wants to move in with his parents, and have his mom take care of the baby. This would be tough for me as his sister and her boyfriend already live there, in the three bedroom house. I also feel like his mom won't be able to say no, even though it's a huge ask. His parents would have to eliminate sleeping in different bedrooms and get rid of their office to make room for us, so I'd feel pretty intrusive. Also, it's a ton of work to look after a baby,especially for elderly people who have already raised their kids. Also it would raise my husbands and my commute by at least an hour each way,which is also why we can't just have childcare without moving there (too much travel for baby).

401,"So here is a condensed backstory. I've been married for 10 years now, and we have two children.  My wife has a sister named Melissa, who is 28 yrs old. We used to get along great.  Thatwad until she married her long time on and off again boyfriend. He was never liked by her parents or my wife or I. He was just really immature and treated Melissa pretty bad. Infidelity,  mental abuse...etc... he was even really mean to my wife a couple of times which of course caused us friction between me and him.   Well, right when they were married she turned on me. I guess the best way to put it is to say that she is continuously trying to make her family hate me, instead of her husband.  She has even gone as far as to tell heparents, and some of our friends,that she believes I hit my wife. Nothing could be further from the truth.  My wife and I have never been violent with one another, not even close. When we are around melissa and her family, she just flat out treats me like crap. Ignoring me as if i'm not even there, or flat out talking about me while I am standing right there.  She had a mental breakdown when she was younger,  so get family will not say anything to her about it because they fear she will lose it again, so i'm left there with no defense.  My wife and her were always close,  and honestly,  she's a great aunt to my kids, so that makes this even more complicated.  She now lives out of state, so that's been a nice break, but now my wife, her sister, parents, and aunts are all going to a rental on the beach for a week, and I'm having so much anxiety about it.

402,"Hi, as a pre-requisite, I have recently been diagnosed with Asperger's (high functioning). I've manage to get to 27 without being diagnosed, but have had breakdowns since leaving University and entering full-time employment in a data related field (healthcare). This is all within 3 years.  

I have a real problem with authority, or of my belief that nobody above me or around me has a clue about what they're doing. I'm pretty advanced in this career for my level - which is restricted so far by age and not wanting to move so quick, although I am in a senior position at the age of 27 within 2 years of qualifying which isn't too bad.  

I work in the NHS, and upon my climb up the career ladder I've always struggled with not being able to accept that those around me don't have the interest, desire, or capability to be productive and passionate about what they do.  

This causes me significant distress, I am never satisfied with how my teams are skilled or their desire to improve, which is especially painful to me. It's our national treasure, and we need to do all we can to make it work. But people don't, they turn up for a paycheck at the end of the month and aren't interested in understanding their day to day work and the impact it has on healthcare.  

My opinion is that people have joined the NHS and stayed there long enough, without any development, that they end up in higher up positions of authority and influencing power. There's no funding for development, and no interest for personal development. Teams are made up of ages 40+, systems are from 2008, and any hint I make at change is responded with ""this works and it's how we've always done it"". Part of my condition is having to understand why, and as a result I need to know the ins-and-outs of everything I am working with. When people can't answer a simple question of why, I feel my heart race, these people get paid to do a pretty basic job from my understanding, and don't know why they're doing it.  

It's frightening, and I don't know how to deal with it. Is this widespread among private companies also? There's no consideration to the impacts of their work. People can spend an hour looking at holidays for next month (deputy directors...), speaking aloud in the office, or getting in at 08:00 (before anybody else prior to when I started) and doing their shopping for an hour. But nobody is bothered, it's always been the case and it's what's ruining the NHS. I firmly believe that we'd not be in this position if there was a suitable capability or management structure, and I feel like a duck out of water, trapped in the middle of a circle of friends who all support each other in this incompetent circle.  

I don't know if this is how it is everywhere, but I can't continue like this, I get specific interests that make me learn to an extremely in-depth level of the subject (Asperger's), be it finance, politics, data, mathematics, engineering, but nobody can match that desire, and I feel alone, isolated, and at an ends to wanting.needing to make a difference.",02Oct2018,1
403,"Yesterday I went for a nice meal at a family run Vietnamese Restaurant.   
While eating a fresh and spicy chicken I noticed that the owner/cheff, was using extremely sharp knives in order to prepare the food.  
Upon exiting I had a little chat with him about the knives and the sharpening, and it turned that he, of course, does the sharpening of the blades himself.  


Now, since I myself always wanted to learn knife sharpening properly, I thought about asking him if he would teach me for a day or two.  
As a counterfavour I would offer him to work for him for a day(or two?), or to clean the restaurant on the weekends, or do some other errands.  


It's such a distant memory that I always saw people in TV shows just showing up at restaurants and ask things while offering to do the dishes, and now that I want to do something similar it kinda feels strange.  


Should I just ask? Is it even appropriate to offer help of that sort without any kind of contract or anything else?  
Should a day of practice be enough?

Met thru overwatch, were great friends. But she had a child and it freaked me out so I convinced myself I would be better off without her and left her. 3 times.

 Now she's left ME, and I see what a fool I was for throwing her away. I would raise her child in a heartbeat if it meant we could be back together again, but she's moved on. She works in a casino and is dating the bartender there.

Since then, I've been slipping into depression. I have no friends here, and I've dropped out of school. I have barely been able to get out of bed in the morning.

She was the only friend I made since moving to a different state (not healthy, but it is what it is). Now I just found out I need to find a new place to live, and I've been considering moving back with my mom.

The moment i wake up, rage and horrible thoughts rush into my mind. My work performance dropped substantially. No matter what i do that asshole is in my head. All the emotional abuse hes causing my parents.. Never experienced such strong hateful emotion towards a person before. Stopped most of my social interactions as im constantly agitated and am becoming an asshole myself towards my friends, Even hobbies. I sometimes spend hours daydreaming of violent acts towards this man. It will be a month before i meet my parents and handle my big brother

So please, if anyone experienced such a scenario can you tell me how you were able to deal with it? Any advice would be great as i currently feel like im going into a deep void.

420,"I started dating one of my friends about a month and a half ago and we really hit off well. Like, it’s really fantastic. I have no problems other than the one thing that comes up like once a week is that she smokes weed and I’m really uncomfortable with it.

TL;DR I’m really uncomfortable by it due to my family being separated by it and seeing weed take over and even incarcerate my loved ones. I’ve had people I love die over it. Drugs aren’t my thing and I barely even drink. 

I personally like to think I’m not overreacting for being so uncomfortable with it due to my past, but she seems to not get the FULL picture and still thinks i shouldn’t see it as bad as it is.

We talk about why she does it and how much she does. She does it about 3 times a week and when she’s with her friends.

I tried to come up with a compromise that when she is with her friends/high in general that we wouldn’t text or see each other for that night. She seemed okay with it at first, but it seems like when this happens once a week we fall back into square one where she feels like she’s doing something wrong or I’m just too uncomfortable. I’m never upset at her, but mostly at the situation because it’s very tiring.

We sit down and talk about it to try to come up with different solutions, but I’m not going to start smoking and she doesn’t plan on stopping (which ideally, yes I would love for her to stop, but I would never make her). She says she mostly does it for her anxiety and would want to stop taking medication one day for her depression and replace it with weed. I’m not too much of a medicine person either so I don’t know how I feel about this. 

She recently stopped smoking cigarettes too and she constantly asks me why I’m not as bothered by cigarettes when it’s worse and I always tell her about what happened to my family and friends. I mean, either way I hate cigarettes too, but that’s beside the point

I just need some help figuring out how to come up with different ways to help us grow out of this and to help us become better for each other. As short of a time as I’ve been with her, I’m very committed to working this out. I’ve been in a 2 and 4 year relationship and I’ve never felt this way for a person, like, ever. She’s open to trying new things too.",02Oct2018,1
421,"So there are two reasons why I’m writing this post. I need to blow off some steam and write it down for my own sanity and I am after advice on how I handle the potential shit storm in work ahead of me. 
So I am a newly qualified nurse who has just started on a paediatric ward in August. I have been there just over a month. I have worked as a care support worker one day a week on that ward for nearly a year. 
In the last 6 months or so a male colleague and I have become very good friends. We work well as a team in work and we started texting and phoning each other out of work sometimes to have a gossip and a moan about life. It is strictly friendship based as he is old enough to be my dad and I have no feelings towards him. 
Anyway, the last month I have developed quite severe depression. I began cutting my legs as a way of coping with it. I have few people who I can discuss this with and therefore decided to confide in my work colleague. He was mortified and regularly texted me and called to make sure I was ok. This was very comforting and I trusted him. He asked for a picture of my wounds so he could see what I had done and if I needed medical treatment. So I sent and asked him to delete it straight away after he had a look. (This was last week) 
This is where is gets ridiculous. Last night I felt like cutting myself again. My colleague told me to call or text when I get these urges. So I messaged him around 19:30. Only, it wasn’t my colleague who replied. His girlfriend had picked up his phone and messaged me back. 
So at 1940 I get a WhatsApp saying ‘Message my man ever again and this is landing on your boss’s desk, you’ve been warned’ and sent a picture of my mutilated leg. 
I read her reply and instantly felt sick and felt like I wanted to cut so I contacted a sucidal support line to talk as I knew I was in danger of doing some real damage from the anxiety. This helped and they advised me to contact the police. So I did, (investigation on going) 
I was on shift the next day (today) and I decided that I was in no way fit to go in work and called in sick. My manager answered and told me the girlfriend had already contacted her very early this morning and informed her of my self harming, she also got the nursing sisters phone number off my colleagues phone and sent the pictures to her. When I heard this I honestly felt like I was dying inside. 
So this brings me to this point. I have an appointment with Ocupational health tomorrow and I’m seeing another councilor. I’m also reading lots in r/self harming which can be helpful. But how am earth do I show my face on the ward again. I’m so scared of everyone finding out. People LOVE to gossip and i am terrified of people judging me and not trusting me as a competent safe nurse. 
Other than get a new job has anyone got any ideas or even words of support would be appreciated. I am so lost right now and don’t know where to turn. ",02Oct2018,1

427,"I slept over last night at his house, when I woke up he was gone and went to school. His mother called me and told me his father died, and was worried that he was too upset to drive.

428,"This might be a little long but I need to get it out of my head and into someone else's to hopefully gain a little clarity. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25 years old, a college graduate, and am currently working as an EMT. I just (unsuccessfully) went through my first round of nursing school applications. I applied to 2 schools, one of which I was waitlisted for, the other (my first choice) I was rejected from all together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've wanted to join the National Guard for about 8 years now, but because of timing and certain life circumstances, it  never played out. My dad and roommate (who just completed a 6 year contract in the NG) both suggested I pursue this venture now as I'm feeling a bit stagnant and am in need of a physical and mental challenge. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I'm in desperate need of a change of scenery. I hate the city I live in, I like my job but I hate the company I work for, and all my best friends besides my roommate have moved away. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of my best friends recently moved out to Denver and is in love with the city and state. I've been before a number of times and can understand why. My other best friend has been going to visiting my Denver friend and has also fallen in love and plans to move out there in May/June of the coming year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been messing around with the idea of moving to Colorado and joining the national guard. That would provide me the mental and physical challenge I crave, the change of scenery, the sense of moving forward and working towards something, and then once i'm settled in, I can reapply to some nursing programs out that way, which the NG would help me pay for if I were to enlist. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this sounds incredible and tempting except for the idea of leaving behind my father and brothers. I don't have a close relationship with my mother but my father and I are best friends. He and my mother split recently and he's having a hard time adjusting, and although my brothers are around for emotional support, it's not quite the same as with me. I don't mean that to sound conceded, he and I have just always had the closest bond. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, I really need a change and this would be an excellent opportunity for me, but the thought of leaving my dad just about rips my heart in half and cripples me with sadness and guilt. I know it would only be for a few years as I explore and pursue something new, but I cannot even bare to think about leaving my father behind in his time of need. I know the timing isn't great, but if i keep waiting for the ""right"" time, i'll be waiting forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'm looking for advice or perspective from anyone, especially those who have moved away from family and loved ones in the past. How did you get over the guilt and was it worth it?

Job #1
Working for an agriculture company (what I majored in). It’s a small company in a very rural area. The advantages are that I’d enjoy my job and the atmosphere at the office is very friendly/tight-knit. $45-50k starting. The disadvantages are that I’d probably be living in rural areas the rest of my career which doesn’t sound appealing to me at all (inb4 chose the wrong major. Don’t remind me). Average benefits, no 401k, Plenty of room for growth. Oh and it’s a 50 minute commute one way from where I currently live.

Job #2
Working for an engineering consulting firm. Very large company. Excellent benefits (401k, insurance). Starting at 37k but with a $700/mo housing stipend. Five minute commute from my house. Plenty of room for growth. The company’s got a good reputation and locations all over the US.

437,"I’ve been in public schools all my life, but I decided I wanted a change. My experience in elementary and especially middle school has not been very good. I’ve been bullied for most of my school life up to this point, because I’m pretty different than the other students. I’m into the arts, I’m quiet, shy, awkward. I’ve never found anyone like me who shared my interests and cared about what I had to say. When I’m in conversations with other classmates, I’m always the third wheel, and people probably think I’m really uninteresting. I personally don’t think so. It’s just my anxiety gets in the way, and I become really aware about everything I say, so I tend to shut up.

Another reason I decided to move was the better education and environment. Public schools here look like utter shit and have really dirty bathrooms and classes. They’re also all really religious, which makes everyone here ignorant and hateful towards groups like gays and non-muslims. That’s pretty bad for me, because I’m from both of those groups lol. 

I’d say the teachers are ok overall but that might be the only positive thing about my former school.

The problem is here. I was never given a tour of my new school. Have not received my books. have not received my uniform yet, so I have to wear clothes from my home for now. Have not been able to get my laptop ready with all the required programs installed in it. And worst of all, this registration process took so long, that I missed pretty much an entire month of school.

It seems like my first day will be a disaster. I feel so nervous and anxious about it and I don’t know what to do. I can literally only bring my notebook with me for now. What if I get made fun off all over again? I don’t want to give a bad first impressions to people on the very first day. How am I gonna catch up with all the lessons that were already given? Do I just have to write notes all day tomorrow?

Also, I wasn’t even given a schedule for my classes yet. I literally have no idea where to go, or what to do. Do I just ask people for help? That kind of makes me nervous because I always embarrass myself when I try to get help from a stranger.

She had to leave after our Wednesday class last week to go to India for two weeks to visit her mother who is very sick. She got a sub for the class in the meantime.

This past Monday was the first day with the sub teaching. We were reviewing a practice midterm for our first midterm on Wednesday (tomorrow). At the end of class, students asked if she would post the solutions to the practice midterm we had just gone over in on our online course system. She said she did not have access to it, but she said that she would email it to one of us if we could post it for everyone. I volunteered to do so.

Today, she accidentally emailed me the answers to the actual midterm rather than the practice midterm. I emailed her back immediately and tried calling the number on her contact to let her know of her mistake. She replied within the hour asking me not to send that document out, and she attached the correct document which is what I sent to the class. I really don't want to get in trouble for the fact that I had this document. 

What should I do to protect myself? Should I email my professor and let her know even though she's in India with her sick mother? Should I wait until she gets back? Should I just keep it on the DL?

445,"Hi all, 
I started uni in England about a week and a half ago, had my Freshers week and have started lectures.
My accomodation was not my first choice, and I got put in a same sex flat, I'm a guy.

My flat has 5 others in it, all are nice people, but 4 of them spend all day in their rooms and don't drink and don't socialise. Just not my kind of people. I leave my door open and chill in the kitchen and make an effort but they don't really engage with me. There's one guy who I get on with, he's 23 (I'm 18) but he's from the area so he's often with his old friends, and he has just taken a break from alcohol as it was a bit of a problem for him, which is annoying because for 3 of the nights of Freshers we just got pissed together.

In my lectures everyone seems to know a few people and talk amongst themselves and I just stand alone. I'm the kind of guy that if people talk to I'd happily talk for hours but I hate approaching people, out of fear that they just don't want to talk to me. So I dont know anyone from my course. 

I ran into people from the flat below, got chatting and they invited me out and we got on, but that was once.
I also have a friend from home here and I went out with him and his flat once. But I don't want to pester these people who are already in their own groups asking to tag along.

I just hate it really because everywhere around me I see everyone having a great time going out, whilst a lot of the evenings I end up sitting drinking in our flat alone. 
All my friends from home are constantly sending videos of them out every night and I just am always sat in alone. I also don't play sports so don't have any friends from that.

446,"I'm in my mid 20's. My parents are in their 50's. I have a very close relationship with my mom, and I'm certain that if I asked her in a 1 on 1 setting, she would give me an honest answer. I'm not sure if it's appropriate to ask... I'm not sure if I really want to know... but contrarily, my best guess would be that my dad is a cheater, so sometimes I think it would be better to know for sure than just be forever resentful/suspicious. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons for my suspicion: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) My parents have been together since high school (my mom got pregnant when she was 17). They got married around 25ish. Before the marriage (and after the first child), it is a fact that my dad was a perpetual cheater. They both have admitted this (nonchalantly, for whatever that's worth). My suspicions begin here because I somewhat subscribe to the ""once a cheater always a cheater"" school of thought. I have friends who are cheaters, I have been cheated on by someone who cheated in 3 straight relationships. I have heard these people ""logically"" justify their cheating, I have heard these people completely disregard the other persons feelings. My best friend, a cheater, feels no guilt at all &amp; rarely reflects on his actions. Contrarily, I have never cheated, and am confident I never will. I believe this is because I have a guilty conscious and I cannot live a lie/life like that. I would obsessively think about how much of a POS I am. I'm not trying to ""prove"" that cheaters are indefinitely cheaters,  but have typed the previous sentences to paint a picture of why I am deeply suspicious. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Approx. 10 years ago, my dad was getting a private massage (i.e. not at a business, he used to go to this persons house) for some ridiculous amount of time, e.g. 3 hours. I remember my mom confronting him, saying, ""If you're gone for that long, you're fucking her."" I'm not sure if this was the last time he got a massage from this person, but overall, it stopped shortly after. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) My dad can be very shady with his phone &amp; computer. To be fair, most people watch porn, maybe he has nudes of my mom, whatever, and obviously he doesn't want his kid to see that. But little things can be a hassle... e.g. if I have to print something from his computer, he never gives me the password (logs me in himself). I think the most suspicious thing though is late night text messaging. I'm not sure who it is, but it's not too uncommon for him to be texting someone at 2am (we both stay up very late, I observe him texting at these hours). He has like 2 friends, and is not the type of guy who texts his pals all the time/is sending funny memes at night. Also, unfortunately, I CONSTANTLY see him liking girls pictures on Facebook. Oddly/grossly/embarrassingly, these are girls who I went to HS with (now in their mid 20's). He's certainly not having sex with them, but I wonder what pictures he's liking that I can't see (i.e. people who aren't on my friends list). The pics he likes are the typical pics a pervy dude would like, e.g. bikini pics. Additionally, even my mom has labeled him as ""shady."" For example, a few months ago, my dad was getting drinks with a girl he used to work with. She is now his client. Oddly, he told my mom he was ""getting drinks with a client."" We all know her by name (my mom has always been jealous/suspicious of her), so referring to her a client was ridiculous. With that being said, she is getting married in a few months (both of my parents are going), and has been to a few family parties, so part of me thinks it's unlikely you invite the person you're banging to family parties/your wedding, but people are weird. Similarly, my entire life, no matter what his job was, he always runs ""errands."" He always worked from home, my mom always worked in an office. These ""errands"" are always for more than an hour. I literally have no idea where he could be going for so long (besides perhaps banging someone).

4) I got in a vicious fight with my uncle a few years ago. He cheated on his wife, and I took a low blow and mocked him for this. He replied with something like, ""People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones... You should ask your dad about cheating, he knows all about that."" There was never a follow up to this from him, but my mom said to me that my dad never cheated once they were married when she found out he said this. We weren't having a serious convo at the time, so she may have been lying. As I mentioned, in the right context, I am certain my mom would give me an honest answer. The time &amp; location at that point wasn't the proper context for an honest answer. 

&amp;#x200B;

5) It's unclear to me how in love with my mom my dad is. For example, my mom told me before she can count on one hand how many times he said she was beautiful. This hurts her self-esteem. I've been in love before and in my head I  saw the person as the most beautiful person in the world (which seems to be a common thought by those in love, regardless of whether or not it aligns with reality) and consistently told this person how beautiful I thought she was. Sometimes I wonder if my dad simply stuck around with my mom because he got her pregnant at a young age and didn't want his child to grow up with his parents separated. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think I should do? Am I right to be extremely suspicious? Is it my place to interfere with their marriage... I have no doubt that if she answers ""Yes"" that it will destroy my relationship with him (I'm incapable of being the person who plays pretend/puts on a bullshit smile), and I would imagine this would create a huge schism in their relationship...But with that being said, my suspicions are already damaging my relationship with him. Sometimes I just view him as a fraudulent person. I live out-of-state for months at a time and don't care to check-in with him (but talk to my mom almost daily). Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thank you so much for reading this lengthy post! ",02Oct2018,1

448,"I am the son (19m) of my two parents (48m/48f) and I have a sister (16f). My brother, or technically half brother is 27 years old.

Around a year ago, he had a seizure in the shower and the near boiling water caused him to have 3rd and even 4th degree burns. 

We decided to help him out by taking him in. After an adjustment on the water temperature and proper treatment, he has long since recovered.

We originally planned to have him stay until he recovered. 

We let him stay in the game room, which we are greatly regretting. A once clean room with a pool table and the latest gen consoles is now a disgusting wasteland of a room filled with monster cans, weed, and random junk he buys from thrift shops.

We were able to tolerate this because, well, he is family and he needed help. But now its a MASSIVE inconvenience. He never cleans up after himself and uses my bathroom. Recently he took a massive shit all over the toilet. HOW DO YOU MISS???

He plays video games and smokes pot until he goes to work, comes home, smokes cigarettes outside, and then smokes pot in his room, which he spends all his money on.

Logically, the next step would be to talk to my parents about it. Here's the thing:

My dad is super against him staying there. He has fought with him multiple times.

My mom is also against him staying there, but he is her son and she loves him, and he has nowhere to go.

They fight constantly about whether or not to kick him out. That's all they fight about ever nowadays. They hardly ever fought before he came.

If I bring it up to them they fight. I'm afraid to confront my brother because he's violent.

I realize I might sound entitled and I apologize, but he has LONG overstayed his welcome, and I feel like he's taking advantage of my parent's generosity. 

He is not on reddit so he wont see this.

Any help would be appreciated, I have no idea what to do, or if I can even do anything about it.

449,"This is a somewhat long story so i'll start from last May.

Last May my friend and I are looking at places to live, we'll call my friend Ian for the sake of the story. We wanted a 2 be doom apartment but eventually we had to settle to live with my sister and her friend due to us finding a 4 bedroom house that's a good distance from University and the epicenter of the city we live in. After seeing the house in person we noticed that the rooms were not all equal in size and 2 of the rooms out of the four did not have a closet. My sister and her friend were able to sort out who lives where without any issue, mostly because my sister avoids conflict so she dealt with getting the smaller room without the closet, whatever. My friend and I however did not have such a simple resolution. We softly agreed that we should decide fairly who gets what room in June. Now my friend is a hardworking guy and has had a job for a while back in our home town that he was intent on keeping up into a week after our move in date. However I didn't have a job and needed to move into our city house ASAP because I got a job for postmates where I could make good money on my bike, on my own time. This is important down the line for when we decide on rooms. 

As the move in date got closer my sister and I painted the living room and cleaned the house because it was not anywhere near move in ready. Dust and dirt had accumulated for what seemed like an entire year and we were not going to live in filth. During this time I decided that it isn't fair that I have to wait to start my work in the city because my Ian refused to mover in sooner. I went ahead and painted my room as well as bought and assembled my furniture for the room with the closet, thus leaving the last room in the house to be his. During the month of July my sister and her friend all contributed to cleaning and moving in furniture for the entire house while Ian stayed back and worked from his home in the suburbs. I tell Ian that i took the room with the closet and the short story is he gets upset and tells me he wont do me any more favors. Up to that point his favors consisted of smoking me out a few times which is an activity that I like to partake in from time to time.

Move in day comes for Ian and I don't hesitate to help him carry his dresser, desk, bed, mattress, and other times into the house and up to the second floor because that's what friends do right? I installed his curtains for him as well since he has no clue how to do any handy work.

The weeks go by and the only times he smoked me out since the move in was when we would have 5 friends over and we would all be chilling out and having a grand time. Meanwhile he's smoking literally every day right in front of me just dangling it in front of my nose. I ask him a couple times to smoke and he tells me to go fuck myself because I stabbed him in the back over the room. 

Now I can see that I did fuck him over for the better room but my life was on hold and I wouldn't be able to make any money that i needed for the upcoming bills if I had waited for his arrival to decide fairly. In addition Ian rides my bike every day to work and school because I don't want to be an asshole and fuck him over for his transportation. Ian also owns the TV in the living room and we've had disputes over the bike/weed/room thing and it always comes down to this. I take bike, he doesn't let me use the TV, we stop sharing food, and pretty much ruin our friendship more then it already is. 

I'm writing this today because I think I've had enough. I have been nice and shared everything, done him many favors for the past 2 months, and have tried to be as nice as possible regarding whatever the situation is. I went to make a sandwich today with my bread and his meat and he said I couldn't use it because i didn't share my cookies. This shit is all so fucking petty that I'm about to take my bike back and ruin his means of transportation to work and school because every chance he gets to be a dick he takes it. There's been way too many times in the last 2 months where he's pissed me off  and fucked me over because of the room situation and I looked past it. I'm over his bullshit. Do I take away my bike and release the wave of sanctions/ fuck our friendship? or should I keep living with his pettiness until I move out nest year?

TL;DR roommate got pissed that i took the better room, became a petty asshole while using my bike for work and school. Do I take away my bike and release the wave of sanctions/ fuck our friendship? or should I keep living with his pettiness until I move out nest year?

451," 14 years ago,  my mother died and my stepdad and step siblings moved away.  My aunt basically raised me my entire life.

I can't make amends with my mother because she is dead and most likely my stepdad is dead.  However,  there is a good chance I can make amends with my step siblings .

452,"Hi, I'm a recent college graduate with a BS in Economics. It's been somewhat hard to deal with since, when looking for a job, it seems that a Bachelor's means almost nothing in US society without connections or relevant experience (which we all know are hard to acquire when you can't get a job in the first place).

&amp;#x200B;

So the past month I've been applying to all sorts of banking jobs that sound like they could be in my wheelhouse, mostly seemingly entry level things that specifically list having a Bachelor's as a ""preferred qualification."" But I do have bills to pay, and after waiting several weeks I sent out desperation applications to a CVS (my first job was at a CVS so it's my only work experience). Almost immediately, a store reached out to me and now I'm in the process of being hired as Shift Supervisor Trainee (in the middle of a background check and drug test). But just today, I received an email from a nearby bank about a phone interview for what seems to be a Teller position. Now I'm unsure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The pay at CVS is 14/hr, which is only $2 more an hour than I was making as a cashier a year ago without a Bachelor's (and minimum wage in NY increased by at least 80 cents in most areas) so I don't feel very valued, but I really need a job immediately. No idea what I'd potentially get as a Teller.

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking for some advice. I've never really looked for jobs and negotiated salary before, not to mention that I don't know if retail management experience or introductory banking experience will be more helpful for me in the long run. Should I do the bank interview? If so, what should I say? If they offer more money, should I try to leverage that at CVS? Is one work experience definitely invaluable compared to the other?

• My part-time role gets changed so much to the point it was affecting my mental state so I had to leave
• I now have 10 years experience as a personal trainer
• I do so much volunteering &amp; coaching for Collegea, Universities &amp; National Governing Bodies (NGB).
• I am a qualified tutor and freelance teach upto L4 Fitness qualifications when they become available.
• I now have said BSc (Hons).
• I am lead Olympic weightlifting coach at a University (6hrs/week).
• I have a tutor contract with a NGB who do not give me any courses (0hr contract).
• I own and run the very first and only NGB Olympic Weightlifting competition in the North of my country.
• I am now also doing a masters degree
• I am voluntary lecturing assistant on biomechanics + S&amp;C modules

All of the above, yet I bring in less than £100/week, and I cannot for the life of me get accepted even to interview stage for any fitness/tutor/PT jobs, and if I do, they’re unpaid roles (!?!?).

460,"I moved away from home 3.5 years ago to accept an incredible job offer in my field. I went from having no experience or money to being in a really good place. I'm very grateful for the opportunity, and it has given many positive experiences. 

I'm a little torn now about the future, and whether I should continue living here or if I should try to find a job closer to my home (area I grew up in).

While accepting this job and moving has brought many positive things, I've also struggled a lot. My work place can be intense, and I find myself getting caught up in work and worrying about it way too much, partly because I don't have the same support network here. I worry about growing apart from friends I've known for years (and family), all of which still live back home. I'm also worried if I stay and meet a significant other, I would never move back if my SO was from here (would be a lot to ask). Contradictory, I also worry about never meeting someone here because I get into anti-social funks sometimes.

Pros for staying is that I like the area, I'm starting to make good friends, I have a good job that I've put a lot of work into to be in a stable spot.  I don't want to take this opportunity for granted. I feel like there is still a lot of exploring to do in the area. Also, I kind of like the freedom of living here. I also think there are more growth opportunities here, personally, but maybe I'm wrong. 

It's about a 12 hour drive, 1.5 hour flight to travel between. Even if I lived back home, I could easily live 5-8 hour drive away from some of my family and friends, who are dispersed.

I like the idea of going home in some ways, but I'm worried it's a step back, or I'm moving back because of the past (not totally tho). For my friends, I love them and they are great, but we both understandably have grown in different directions. However, moving closer could help build the friendship back. I guess I'm worried about doing it to please others, vs what is right for me. I moved when I was 25 and am 29 now, I think the turning 30 thing is freaking me out. I'd like to meet someone and start a family one day, and I think I'd rather raise kids back home.

I graduated with a BA in English with two minors (business and history), so considering career choices that aren't teaching, I landed the best possible option.  I actually ended up with my degree because I wanted to teach, but it just wasn't for me once I got into the field.

-Sitting in a windowless cubicle for 40hrs a week doing pointless feel-good work. 
-Feeling that my degree and job are unskilled, undervalued, and that I would be easily replaced.
-Being a spokesman and having a lot of interaction with people.
- Supporting an organization that has a mission and value I personally disagree with.

What I like:
- A steady paycheck of about $1100 every two weeks and decent benefits.
- Holidays and 2 weeks vacation or sick leave per year.
- Understanding, family focused atmosphere.

462,"Hi, this is a throwaway account.

I also posted this on r/raisedbynarcissists but I want to get some opinions from here too.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 25. When I was 22 I left everything behind. My job, friends, family. I moved hundreds of miles away. I found myself a magically warm and supportive lifestyle and for a few little stretches I knew what it is to be happy, for the first time in a long time. I intentionally stayed distant from my family because they did not understand and reacted very negatively when I left. (They think I am in a cult. That's another story.)

&amp;#x200B;

After I left, I started to feel more secure in myself, I was able to make a lot of emotional realizations, about how I was hurting myself and other people, about how other people have feelings too. About how I have feelings, that influence my actions, that I had been repressing for who knows how long. As silly as it might sound, this came as a revelation for me.

&amp;#x200B;

As time went on and I gained perspective from being in a safe and loving environment I began to realize that my upbringing was not normal or healthy. I started to realize how messed up our family was, and I started to read about dysfunction, narcissism, and abuse, and it all sounded very very familiar.

&amp;#x200B;

My eldest brother left and went no contact with the family a long time ago and I was too young to understand then. I haven't heard from him in over a decade. We don't talk about it. Our family unit cuts off all of our extended family. We don't talk about it. My aunt doesn't try to reach out anymore. I could never have friends over growing up and everything about our family was considered a secret that must not be discussed on the Outside. It is just my mom, my dad, my middle brother, and me. My other brother (the middle child) is extremely withdrawn and keeps completely to himself and owns a house now. I can't communicate meaningfully with him, he just talks in memes and pop culture references. I don't remember the last time I communicated meaningfully with any member of my family.

&amp;#x200B;

Later, it turned out that because of a long term point of argument between my parents about where to retire, my mother, when my dad dared her during a fight, decided to move to a different town, much closer to where I live. Now it seems that my parents plan to build a new house there - they bought the property and have the plans. This all happened in the space of a couple of months. It seemed so sudden and so off the cuff for a major life decision like this. I kind of hoped that my mother would discover a new life and escape from my father there, but that did not happen. I think they are too codependent after decades of mutual abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

With this new sense of openness and security I opened up to my parents a bit again. They came to visit me in my new home (which they still see as just a ""Phase,"" and my mother reminds me every time we talk ""Promise me that you won't stay there for the rest of your life."") They told me that to finance the new house, they will have to sell their current house. And my dad, having been laid off a year ago because his coworkers found him toxic, is renovating it on his own, to increase the value of the house before selling it. He has no renovation experience. He's a perfectionist and everything takes him years to get done. He has leukemia. He's very unwell, he has no friends. Everything to him is a trade, everyone is out to ""get theirs,"" there is no mutual human cooperation, no real altruism.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, in my confidence I offered to come help with the renovations. I regret it now, but it happened. They took me up on it and offered to fly me home.

&amp;#x200B;

I initially thought I would be away for a couple weeks or so, that was what I told everyone in my new home. It's now been a month and a half. They had a realtor in to tell them how to get the best value for their house, he told them to just get new countertops and finish the bathrooms (which are half renovated) and get the driveway repaired and offload it.

&amp;#x200B;

Contrary to that, my parents' plan is:

&amp;#x200B;

\- to repaint the entire house

&amp;#x200B;

\- to refloor all lino areas

&amp;#x200B;

\- to recarpet all carpet areas

&amp;#x200B;

\-significant drywall work etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\- tiling around fireplace

&amp;#x200B;

\- new cabinets in kitchen

&amp;#x200B;

\- remodel all bathrooms

&amp;#x200B;

\- etc. etc. etc. (Far more than the realtor advised.)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is all, as I see it, unneccesary. It's ridiculous to me, to do all this. The house is fine. All this work might raise the selling price by maybe 30k. And it's going to take months and months. They need to sell the house ASAP but they're taking on all these projects instead. House prices are dropping in my area and I think they want to get the value out of it that their neighbors were getting 2 years ago. My dad is insisting on the highest level of perfection and cleanliness in everything. So we have made almost no progress, any pro would have been able to accomplish what we have in less than a week. Everything I contribute to the project is not good enough for him, and he makes a point of going over it again. The vaccuum haunts my dreams, every fucking day, every 10 minutes he is vacuuming.

&amp;#x200B;

But that's not the real issue. The real issue is, being here, alone, with no income and no car and no cellphone, alone, with my dad, who I do not feel comfortable with. He is usually an ok guy, and he has even shown a willingness to change, (usually only after I call him out on some of his BS) but there are moments where the curtain comes down. I want to leave. But there is such a burden of guilt on me that my parents are taking on all this work, way more than they can realistically manage. My dad expressed that he was expecting me to stay until it's all finished. (!) I feel like anyone outside of the situation would see me as an ingrate and a freeloader or something, for not wanting to help. My parents have really bitten off more than they could chew and they need the help. But it's so hard for me. The work would be enough but I have to spend all day around my dad who makes me very uncomfortable even when he is not belittling me or yelling at me. All my healthy habits fall apart when I am here and I fall back immediately into my old coping strategies, staying in my room as much as possible, staying up late and waking up late to avoid having to interact as much as possible, using video games, excessive masturbation and the internet as a temporary escape from my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I had yet another belittling comment jabbed at me (I was about to go to the hardware store to get some supplies and asked ""Should I get anything else?"" and he muttered ""You could get some ambition."") and something just broke in me. I don't know if I can do it anymore, I don't know if I can put up with this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

469,"Hi everyone,

I am currently 16 and will get my license within the next few weeks. However, my parents insist that they will not let me drive myself after that due to my ""inexperience."" However, I have been driving for 8 months already and have not even gotten close to an accident. When asked about why they think I am inexperienced, my dad can think of only one incident which he thought was dangerous (even though I was following all rules, and was nowhere near a crash). On the road, I follow all rules perfectly, rarely speed, and never forget my turn signal. I can maneuver different roads and turns with ease, and never get lost on the road when I am able to navigate myself (using GPS or memory, not my dad spitting meaningless directions in my ear). They constantly mention how I am not able to drive unfamiliar roads. Even though I strongly disagree with this, it doesn't matter, since I literally want to use a car to shuttle between school, the gym, my job, the grocery store, and a few other very local places. When I try to be reasonable and explain why I feel I should be able to drive, they interrupt me and just restate the same points over and over. Then they start screaming at me for being disrespectful, and say I started it. Then when they are out of steam, they just leave without actually listening to me. We have a safe car, good insurance, and a safe set of roads between the places I want to drive to. But nothing works.

This truly feels extremely unfair. Apart from trying for nearly a year to become a safe and confident driver (in my mind, successfully so), I have done everything in my power in other parts of life to excel. I maintain excellent grades, have gotten stellar results on my SATs and AP exams, and have worked extremely hard in various extracurriculars (captain of a varsity team, president of a club, multiple awards for research and other events, multiple internships, etc.). I have never even considered using alcohol or drugs. Without sounding stuck-up, I have worked extremely hard to be a posterchild for my parents.

As an only child, it gets extremely boring to sit cooped up at home. All my friends are out driving and hanging out, and my license was supposed to be my way to join them. Only recently was I able to really get become close with a few good friends of mine (I did not have many close friends when I was younger), and my parents restrictiveness is simply preventing me from doing anything significant with them. We rarely hang out outside of school, since most of the places my friends go are the gym and restaurants which I need a car to get to. I can't even remember a time where I wasn't counting down the days until I got my permit, and then my license. It's natural for me to want some independence - even more so when I have typical helicopter parents. Whether you want to call driving/independence a right or a privilege, I think I have earned it regardless. I should be able to drive, plain and simple. But my parents will not budge. I try to show them how (not exaggerating) every single person in my grade who is able to get a license is allowed to drive freely. They say they don't listen to other parents, but flip-flop on this and constantly take random parents' advice for issues such as college.

When I try to tell my parents that the situation genuinely feels psychologically-damaging, they tend to ignore me and keep repeating the same crap about me being inexperienced. When I try to ask for a fair date by which I would be able to drive, they won't give me one. It is truly like hitting a brick wall.

In the end, is there any way to reasonably convince my parents to let me drive and have some independence?",02Oct2018,1
470,"Over the past year I moved into a house with 2 of my male friends, we're all relatively young (early 20s) and all of solid jobs. Now the house is essentially a bachelor pad so naturally we started throwing parties at our place. 

During one of said parties, my roommate met a girl and they started to see each other on a pretty regular basis. She (18) seemed really nice for the first couple of months and they started to grow attached to each other. She went from spending the night at this house, to spending 3-4 nights in a row here, to fully moved in. It all happened so fast, and she's made herself comfortable. 

Now I don't really have a big problem with this (she pays rent and is nice to be around). And she keeps to herself in the room in the basement where my roommate stays. However, some nights I can hear my roommate and her arguing, like, very VERY loud. Not only that but I can hear what sounds like doors slamming shut, smashing furniture on walls(I think?), and at times i'll hear either one of them exclaim ""OUCH!"" Or ""STOP THAT!!"". 

I used to go down and case the situation out. However, Whenever I did this the arguing would always stop once they hear my footsteps coming down the stairs and I would be greeted with a ""what do you want?"". The arguing would always continue about 10 mins after I left. 

Me and my other roommate have talked about this but are both too scared to call the cops or do anything serious because he is our friend.

473,"First off I would like to state that I am not an English speaker and might not be as coherent as I hoped so please bear with me, I come from Québec, Canada. And this is a extremely urgent matter.

&amp;nbsp;

So here's the backstory. 4 years ago, my mom married a Chinese dude who can only speak Chinese and English but not our native tongue (French), we are now a family of 4 (me, my mom, him and my little bro) I'm 22 years old and my little brother is 14 years old. So about a week and half ago, my little brother found out that my stepdad taped us with a camera surveillance hidden in plain sight in the living room on a tree beside our TV in the living room. Here's a picture: https://imgur.com/a/XLqmV3A The hidden camera was made to look like a regular phone charger and had a built in memory. Unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture of the bottom of the camera and he removed it so here's the memory device instead: https://i.imgur.com/0f8IYIx.jpg when we told our mom, she was surprised at first and said he should've at least told us but later pardoned him saying he is a Chinese immigrant who doesn't know much about Canadian policies and that he is just afraid of burglars. (We'll get into that later) Later that night he came home from his trip and he saw that my little brother tapered with it and unplugged his favorite device and so he got rid of it. Now you'd think the story ends here and that it was just a simple misunderstanding and we're just one big happy family well you're wrong. Fast forward to yesterday, we found out that he installed ANOTHER camera only this time he installed in a way which lets him see where everyone is going, even when we go inside the bathroom and outside (I'll draw a picture later for clarification later) but for now here's more pictures of his NEW camera he installed disguised as a box: https://imgur.com/a/r21KjwU My little brother did a quick search on Google and found out all about his camera. Picture here: https://imgur.com/a/vLPrU9j It's a camera from China with motion captures, playback and Night Vision with a built in voice recorder. At this point I highly doubt it's about burglary since there's night vision and a fucking audio recorder. I forgot to mention that he's a secretive motherfucker and doesn't trust most people except my mom, and is a total control freak. Like he doesn't want people to know what he's doing or where he's currently at but he has to know what everybody is doing.He's a total hypocrite and it bleeds even on the business side of things too, but this is another matter and I'm getting sidetracked here. I'm sure he doesn't trust us too considering he only drinks from bottled water and rinse his teeth with it. I'm pretty sure he got his new camera from his trip considering it wasn't there before (I think). Or maybe me and my little brother never noticed it. Please I need help, we are completely fed up and we'd like to know what's the best course of action to proceed with. This guy doesn't give a fuck about our privacy.

474,"  TL;DR My father is being conned by IRL “girlfriend” (who is married), I fear he will run out of money and my brother and I will have to support him. I want to scare of the girlfriend, what should I do?

My father is turning 79 and has prostate cancer. He owns his property but otherwise basically lives on social security other than a very small dwindling savings (probably &lt;$10 or 20k at this point). He sometimes drives for Lyft to make extra money. 

About a year and a half ago, he said he was “dating” who was maybe 40 years old and showed me her pictures—she was very attractive. He met her because her car “broke down” in his retirement community (she had no business being there, I suspect she was looking for someone to con). She is already married to someone even older than my dad, which my dad is aware of but doesn’t care. I then learn that she began charging him for weekly “personal training” and she’s not a certified personal trainer. Later I learn he loaned her $8k which she claimed she needed for her daughters “volleyball”. After she got this, she said she couldn’t see my dad anymore because she’s married and religious and believes dating my dad is wrong. I ask my dad if she’s paying him back and he gets very touchy, saying he doesn’t care whether it’s a loan or a gift. 

I met the woman one time and she seemed very wretched....was sarcastic and bad attitude. She actually is quite attractive and what she would want with my father is beyond me. Today I learn that they are still talking or seeing each other once again.

I’m concerned that 1) he’s going to name her as a beneficiary to his estate (he says he’s not but he’s been known to go behind his family’s back) and 2) she will take more money from him and once my dad runs out of savings completely, my brother and I will have to pay for medical bills / long term care that Medicare doesn’t cover. Aside from those concerns, I just don’t like to see this horrible person taking money from my dad when she’s already married and has a real estate license so probably has her own money. I’m also confused as why she would run such a long con for such a small amount of money. I don’t think it’s possible that she actually enjoys my dad’s company or has feelings for him. 

I’m not sure what I can do. I want to try to scare her off. I didn’t have her full name until today so now I know how to contact her. Part of me wants to threaten to reveal the “affair” and con of my father to her friends on Facebook or to her family unless she promises to leave him alone. I’ve never done anything like this before and I’m afraid it may backfire and not really be worth it. What should I do?",02Oct2018,1

My thoughts are very complex, plus I am a scatterbrain and often can't remember what I wanted to say.

So, I frequently ask my therapist if I can dump my thoughts out onto a Word document, and ask him to read it before our appointment. Because 1) this will 'prime' him for what I want to talk about, and I want to save time, spending the appointment discussing strategies rather than explaining, so that it is more productive.

**I have even offered to pay him for his time to read the documents.** But he always says, ""oh no, I would much rather you tell me in person."" I wrote down a lot of my anxious thoughts and thought patterns and I want to ask him if he can read it before our appointment tomorrow.

I discovered that my boyfriend had briefly sexted his cousin in another state in the beginning of our relationship. There was no overlap, but I nearly broke up with him because I was so disgusted.

I told him that he needed to block her on everything and cut contact if we wanted to work through it, which we did. Honestly, though, I only stayed with him because he's the first person I've ever been with who was *nice* to me. Such a low goddamn bar, but there it is. First non-abusive relationship I've ever had, and I didn't want to lose it.

Today, while browsing my 'what my followers are up to' feed, and see that my boyfriend ""liked"" a picture of a woman's panty-clad backside. It was his cousin that he was supposed to have blocked.

When confronted, he raged that he didn't know how it happened, that he *ABSOLUTELY* didn't like that picture, she was supposed to be blocked, I'm such a jerk because I always do things like this - he's disrespectedy online boundaries before, publicly, so, yes, this isn't the first time I'm confronting him about his online conduct - I always make him out to be a bad guy, he's a loser, he's always wrong...

Just deflecting, as per usual. He thinks it's okay to like pictures like this - of his cousin, no less - but if I draw porn, it's a fight. I can't model - my only source of income - because it's a fight.

486,"So a little backstory: my recent ex and I had planned a trip to Hawaii during Thanksgiving this year. We thought it would be cool to escape the family and do a luau instead of the traditional turkey dinner. The trip was definitely her idea and I can honestly say she was more more excited than I was for the whole trip. 

 She bought the plane tickets ($380 each) and I bought the Hotel ($1250 total). I'm not asking for any money from her since things got ugly with us and I just want it to be civil now. When I bought the hotel I didn't realize she found this Hotwire Hot-rate deal that is nonrefundable. She had been looking for months and I was just ready to buy the dang thing so I did it without reading the fine print (yup, that was not wise) Well we broke up about a month ago and I thought I could get a refund since I got insurance but after reading the policy, it appears the only way I'm getting my money back is if I commit insurance fraud (which I'm NOT trying to do) or get extremely ill or have a family actually die.  

I really don't know what to do at this point... She cancelled the flight already and the hotel is completely non-refundable and non-transferable.  If I wanted to still go, I have enough PTO saved for this trip, but I've never been to Hawaii and it just seems like a total couple's vacation and not a lot of single travelers.  I am a reasonably attractive 30 year old male and could probably have fun solo, but I have no idea what to expect and sort of doubt I'm going to meet Mila Kunis working at the hotel lobby. Plus I've already blown so much money on hotel and I know I'll blow even more going on the strip. I'd still have to find another flight there and any friends I've asked can't go with it being on Thanksgiving either.

So I don't know what to do...do I just go solo and hope for the best while spending more money than I really have?  Should I just say screw it and save my PTO and money for another time and just let it be a really expensive lesson?  Do I make an online profile seeking a date for Hawaii?

Well one night I was staying at her place and she had fallen asleep. I was considering making a move but ultimately decided against it so I sat at the end of the couch to go to sleep, she was sleeping on the rest of the couch. I accidently woke her up when I was sitting down and she waved me over to spoon with her. I took this as another hint so I spooned with her and ended up doing hand stuff, after rubbing her sides and stomach (it specifically went slow so she could refuse if she wanted). I'm the kind of guy to ask before I even kiss a girl but this girl specified that she hated when guys did that so I didn't ask before, but I asked afterwards if I crossed a line and she said no.

Well I noticed distance in the following days and decided today to message her about it and she told me she did not want it. I apologized over and over again and ultimately deleted my Facebook out of impulse because that was the only way apart from in person for me to talk to her.

495,"I (34/M) met a girl (32/F) on social media at the beginning of September. We had enough in common to be able to hold conversations for almost every day and have gone out on 2 successful dates.

There are a couple things that kind of worry me since we have been talking...

First off, she has openly admitted to me that she is Bipolar. I've never really dated anyone that has been bipolar but I have heard some stories from friends who have and they say it takes a lot of work. I know that sometimes a lot of people like that need space and I am trying to do the best I can to accomodate that.

Secondly, she has a lot going on in her life. She works as a Preschool teacher at a facility a half a mile from where I live and she is always drained when she gets off in the afternoon. Also, her father has some pretty bad medical issues in which it has landed him in a nursing home and she is pretty much the only child (has several brothers and sisters in a nearby state) that goes to see him and helps take care of him. I obviously know that this takes a lot of her time.

The thing that is getting to me, however, is I feel that especially in the last 2 weeks, things have been a little more strained when she talks to me. I'll sometimes text her something and she won't even answer for the rest of the day. I'm not saying she has to answer exactly when I text but it feels like everytime I asked if she wants to do something, I don't even get an answer at all (she has also admitted to doing this to other friends as well). She will occasionally call me (last time on Sunday afternoon before I went into my second job) but even then it wasn't long. I physically saw her for about 5 minutes Monday morning because the last several weeks, I go to her work on Mondays and get her some breakfast as a nice little gesture she likes.

I know a lot of this may be in my head as sometimes I tend to overthink things and I also don't want to smother her with texts if she doesn't answer; but I'm worried that she doesn't want to talk to me. And I'm afraid to ask about it just in case she really is busy and may have just forgot to text me back, and I don't want her to be angry with me since I myself have done that on occasion.

Again, we are not technically dating but we have talked about it in the past so it's not like this is a dire situation, but I am interested in this woman and I find her really intriguing. I guess what I am trying to ask here is...

What can I do for her to know that I'm still here and want to talk to her without seeming like I am smothering her?

How do I let her know that even though it may not be anything, it does bother me when she doesn't even answer back sometimes?

tl;dr 34/m talking to 32/f and not sure how to deal with some of the things she is going through but still wants to be around her",02Oct2018,1
496,Hi all. I’ve experienced this twice. If u can’t tell your friends your business who can you tell ? ,02Oct2018,1
497,"So my poor grandparents, due to their old age or technical ineptitude or WHATEVER, have been getting scam calls/e-mails/pop-ups etc etc for the past couple years and today was the final straw. It seems like once a month I am at their apartment, my grandpa in literal tears, wiping their computer clean or reassuring them about scam calls and so on and so forth.  

  

I'm the ""computer guy"" in the family though I'm not a wiz. I just know the basics. I've installed Malware Bytes and run it. They also pay for McAfee. Neither has found any sort of malicious program. This is also on a new computer. They got a new one as they once allowed a scammer to remote access their computer to ""remove a dangerous virus.""  

  

I guess this guy has been calling them regularly ever since and has even gotten money from them. They never have any real concrete details and I don't know why they keep falling for it/get continuously targeted but it is NOT their fault and they DON'T deserve this.  

  

Today my grandpa called my mom in tears, again. He got a call from a scammer claiming to be my brother, saying he was in a car accident and broke his nose. My mom called the number back and it was the ""district attorney"" now claiming that my brother got into a car accident with a pregnant woman and killed the baby and that he needed $4k for bond.  

  

This is ludicrous. How do I stop this? Smash all their electronics? I've coached them time and again on how to spot fake e-mails, pop-ups, and phone calls. Even when they do catch it, it's a very stressful moment for them. I feel awful. I wish they could just live in peace.  

  

There has to be SOMETHING I can do to make this stop. Please, anything. I'll go vigilante if I have to. I just want my grandparents to be able to relax and feel safe again. ",02Oct2018,1

499,"A relative of mine has narcissistic tendencies. She has trouble talking about anything without imposing herself into the discussion in obnoxious ways, including inviting herself to things, feeling slighted by not being invited to things as simple as a dinner with one's significant other, etc. Or a baby shower for my best friend, who she knows tangentially. It's infuriating, but I'm usually able to keep her in her place by telling her how it is (""I'm not allowed to have dinner with my SO alone?"", ""I'm not in charge of invitations, and none of my friends relatives were invited"", etc.). However, there's an issue I've been having trouble with and I'm not sure how best to handle it. 

She has a tendency to burn bridges in her personal and professional relationships. She's fallen out with many friends, neighbors, family members, contractors, etc. but those situations rarely affect me directly. What's worse is when she tries to insert herself into my relationships. For example she'll ask who I hired for gardening, so I'll introduce the two of them. She'll have an argument with them for one reason or another, and the provider will drop both of us as customers. Worse, another time when she needed her lawnmower repaired, I (stupidly, impulsively, and perhaps optimistically) suggested my friend's 13 year old son take a look because he's very mechanically inclined. He told her it could be fixed but would probably be expensive, and surprisingly she offered the mower to him and said she'd rather buy a new one. Well he fixed it up within a week, and of course she suffered ""giver's remorse"" and basically accused him of ripping her off. A 13 year old boy! As if he manipulated her into giving it to him. It really boiled my blood and I let her have it, and she apologized, saying she was just stressed, and then asked if he'd come to help her with something else. Well, I caught hell for it, but I told her he was too busy with school so she'd leave him alone, and thankfully she did. I HATE lying but it seems to be all that works with her!

This has happened more than once, and I'm tired of her ruining my relationships - but she won't stop insinuating herself into my relationships, and when I try to string her along, she won't take a hint, and keeps nagging and guilting me. 

Lately, she's been asking me to hook her up with a pet groomer I've been going to for a decade and have developed a friendship with. I don't like to lie, but I feel I have to make up some reason why the groomer can't help (isn't taking new clients? Too busy now that school started back up?). I feel if I tell the truth, it will unnecessarily cause a meltdown resulting in her screaming denials at me. Confrontation with her always ends in a screaming diatribe, followed by days of silence, then an apology - but then right back to the nagging and guilt. I can tolerate her behavior toward me, but I can no longer tolerate her damaging my relationships. If she'd just create her own relationships, I wouldn't care if she destroys them, but she keeps nosing into mine!

I have a fundamental issue with lying, but I don't want to endure her inevitable explosion of anger if I tell the truth. Is this type of confrontation necessary to solve this problem in the long term, or is there a solution I'm missing? 

tl;dr: Relative continually inserts herself into relationships with friends/contractors, etc., proceeds to burn bridges, then repeatedly asks to do it again. Is there a response better than lying, which doesn't result in an angry confrontation?",02Oct2018,1
500,"So I had this kid I knew ever since I was in preschool, and now I'm a senior in high school. We did almost everything together for the 13 years that we knew each other. We went to the same elementary school, but not the same middle school. Although, for high school I went to a different school for freshman year, then I went to a independent studies program for sophomore and junior year, and now I go to the same school as him for my senior year. Despite not even going to the same school for all those years, we still managed to hang out at least once a month. Ever since he got this bitch of a girlfriend in late junior year, we haven't been speaking to each other as much as we use to. We were pretty close with each other, we would always let each other know what was on our minds. These last couple of months he's been talking to me like I'm some random asking for an eraser. It really feels like a switch went off, no slow transition, just an instant affect. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being a new kid at school after not going to a regular school for two years isn't very easy. He was the only person I knew there and I don't even want to sit with him at lunch because he often talks about personal things with his girlfriend, which is fine but... c'mon your best pal is literally sitting at lunch alone for his first week. Usually when I text him, he is always replies with one text, never wants to start the conversation. These last two weeks I've found some other people to sit with, but I really want my friend back. He broke the bro code of ""bros before hoes"" that we always praised as 6th graders. And these last 6 total weeks at school, every weekend I've asked him if he wants to hangout, but he is always ""busy"", he would mostly say fuck yeah or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been reading what other people say to do when this sort of thing happens, a lot of the posts just say something along the lines of - ""You just need to let it happen, you can't interfere."" or ""It happens, it's know for girls to have more authority over the bestfriends, sucks to suck."". I don't want to just /let it happen/... is there something I can do to have him at least acknowledge me anymore?",02Oct2018,1
501,"The last week has far been one of the most trying in my life. I don't know how I'm going to make it, so please any stories or advice related to this type of situation would be so greatly appreciated.

The snowball started once I learned that my bf's parents who we had been renting from actually owe nearly $10,000 back rent, and we all have to be out by the end of the month. Under the impression that thing would be okay, I visit my mother and sister's apartment for a night to discuss my bf and I moving in. It would be a tight squeeze, but it would allow us to set money back.

The next morning I head out for school (currently a college senior), and my car isn't there. I call the police station to get an officer, and it turns out my grandfather had my car repossessed. I understand that he was well within his right to do this, however it did hurt me deeply, because when my Nana passed at the very beginning of this year it was her intent for me to have the car to finish my education, and provide for my family since I am the only one who can drive.

After about twenty minutes of stunned staring at the wall that he would do this to me without notice. I realize I have to contact my professors, and call in for work that afternoon. I was doing secretarial work for a small appliance center, and stupidly admitted over the phone that I no longer had a vehicle and did not know when I was going to get one (mostly cause it happened half an hour ago). I was let go.

My professors advised me to my Dean of Students, and we have a meeting later this week. However, at this point I don't see what she can do for me, if anything. So I believe I just lost my degree in nonprofit/ business studies, and a minor in child advocacy in my senior year.

The final blow, at least to I pray it is, due to our eviction my bf wants to take a job in a major city several hours away. He wants me to follow him there. However, he knows I would never leave my family due to my mother's disability, which would leave my younger sister to take care of her. So, my relationship of two years just ended today as well.

I am at my wits end. I am stunned and hurt, but mostly lost. How would you/ what have you done to overcome circumstances like this?

TL,DR: In a week I lost my place to live, my car, my job, my college degree, and my boyfriend. Please help me figure out where to go from here.",02Oct2018,1

She never seems to do anything wrong through her eyes. I question why my dad doesn't leave, because I would. Its like walking on egg shells. I never spend time with my family because I fear a fight breaking out. I hate holidays especially. Im at the point where the constant fighting has started to make my anxiety worse. 


If i even mention moving out she makes me feel guilty. Making me feel like im being irresponsible. If i mention that i eventually want to move somewhere else like a new city, she gets really upset and angry with me. I feel so trapped. 


I just dont know what to do.",02Oct2018,1
503,"So I need two bits of advice here- first, what you guys think I should do, and second, if I decide to back out, how to go about discussing it.

Basically, my boss is a real rad guy to work for, we get along great, and I generally love working for him. I've only been at the company for two months, so I'm not married to it here, though I am very comfortable and enjoy some decent benefits (18 days of PTO, health insurance, dental, life). The boss sat me down one month after I started and told me he was leaving, but wanted to extend an offer to go with him if I wanted. He told me to think about it.

He ended up staying an extra month and a half to finish up affairs, and just last week sat me down and basically said ""I'm not just offering you a job, I actively want you to come with me."" So I negotiated my current salary (67k/year)  plus the difference in benefits. So, not really a raise. I guess I'm a bad negotiator. But I like the guy, and the idea of striking out on our own on this operation sounds like a fucking rad adventure. Plus, he's taking two massive clients with him, so he'll have plenty of work and checks rolling in. He's also taking two associates with him and they intend to get proper benefits in 2019. He's also intending to dock my pay back down to what it currently is once those benefits roll in. I agreed to this.

However, by going with him, I'll gain a ton of opportunity, and two years from now, a move like this could very well pay out much better for my career than staying at the big corporate firm, where I'll likely be shuffled away to do my daily tasks, with no exposure or opportunity to learn new skills.

That said, the amount of comfort, and some thoughts from r/financialadvice has started to make me question my initial excitement over the move. And giving up my comfortable current gig IS a legitimately scary notion, even though I have little actual risk, and I could likely find a job elsewhere fairly easily if it didn't pan out. That said, there's a certain likelihood that my current firm will can my ass if they don't need me with him and his clients now gone.

But i've essentially already verbally accepted an offer of employment, though I have not signed anything or put my time in at the current place yet. So I could back out, or try to negotiate for higher pay, but both make me uncomfortable. How would I approach backing out after he already thinks I'm on board? What's the best way to broach that? Write an email explaining myself as clearly as possible? Call him? I just feel like an ass saying ""I changed my mind, sorry."" ",02Oct2018,1

Well about 2 months ago (8/15 to be exact) I bought a ""new"" car for $1,200. 600 down and rest payments. That Friday the same week I bought it I gave them the keys and said just give me $500 for it in payments, both of them have jobs and get paid every other Friday so theoretically making it so they get paid every Friday. Which from the day I'm writing this, 7 Friday's has passed and only got $180 to license and register my car. Little background for them; they can't handle their money to save their life. They go out and party every weekend can't just can't control their financial situation. 

I gave them an Ultimatum, either give me the money for the car or insurance is getting shut off the 12th, see I'm on my dad's insurance and so are they, my dad has been fed up of them ignoring me and cutting me off from money, I just told him to shut insurance off. Just to clarify I'm 19, my sister and her boyfriend are in their late 20s.

511,"Okay so first of all, this isn't a throwaway account. My friends don't know that I feel this way so if my friends see this..  Hi. Anyway so since I was younger I've always hated the idea of working for someone that can tell You what to do and end your career just like that. Working several hours a day for several days a week just for basic needs like food and water (that everyone should have anyway) seems very off to me. I'm now 16 and being pressured into getting a job by friends and family. So far I have refused. I have tried to make sure I'm not making my parents spend too much money on me and have only been asking for basic needs such as food and water. Anyway, the idea of having to work for what should be given to everyone anyway worries me. My friends have recently got jobs and I never get to see them anymore. It seems like too much of my time would be taken up with college too. I would hate to deliberately stress myself out just to get a bit of money (Which I don't really need anyway, I would just go out and buy shit I don't need) My friends have told my I should feel guilty, but honestly I don't feel anymore guilty than the people that sit at the office waiting for the hours to go by just to ""earn"" enough money to put dinner on the table. I know I'm 16 and don't have to worry about things like that but I've been told to ""man up and accept it"" and worry about these kind of things. It's hard to get my full opinion out in a reddit post. However, I'm not lazy. I would want to teach myself new things that interest me and put them to good use. I just don't know what to do

521,"I’ll try to keep this a short as possible - apologies in advance if it gets long as this is a huge worry for me.

My mum was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. I don’t think I’ve actually fully digested/processed it yet, but I’m trying to do what I can to prepare for her first chemo this Friday. I did some research and found that chemo pretty much destroys the immune system, so that means I’ll have to help keep everything clean. I live with my mum and dad. My mum and I are already good at keeping things clean - and I have an extreme fear of being sick, which turned me into a germaphobe, so that means frequently disinfecting my school bag, desk, phone, etc.

But here’s the big problem: my dad has no sense or understanding of cleanliness whatsoever. I feel horrible typing that out, but it’s been worrying me a lot. Even before I turned into a germaphobe, I noticed it. He would go to the toilet, and never wash his hands properly (don’t ask how I know - we often leave the door open). By this, I mean he turned on the tap, *touched* the water with his fingertips, and turned it off, all within the space of about three seconds. And then wipe his hands on the bathroom hand towel which we share.  Never used soap. If he dropped something in the kitchen bin by accident (with rotting food, dead bugs, raw fish bones, and god knows what else inside), he’ll dig it out with his bare hands and happily go about his day. It was disgusting to watch. Only occasionally will he “wash” his hands afterwards (read: touch the water with his fingertips for half a second, without soap, then wipe it on the kitchen towels which we use for hand drying or for drying clean dishes.)

He goes on his phone while on the toilet, and has never bothered to clean it. It’s getting tiring for me to clean his phone, and the screen is always oily and disgusting. He picks his nose in the middle of prepping food. He’ll be the one in the house doing the cooking, and this really concerns me -  to him, raw and cooked food are indistinguishable- e.g. he’s washed raw chicken under the tap, with cooked food lying around next to the sink. He would often then “wash” his hands then wipe them on the clean kitchen towels.

It’s a huge health hazard, and however much I try to talk to him to get him to understand, it’s almost like he doesn’t care. Even last summer, when I got salmonella poisoning which triggered my phobia (likely from contaminated food) - it was a week of agony, he still didn’t realise the dangers of bad hygiene. I try to explain to him how important it is to wash your hands with soap, and he just nods and completely forgets. The moment my mum or I bring up his hygiene habits, he simply zones out and starts ignoring us.

I don’t know what to do. I’m scared. Really scared. I’ve heard all the horror stories of chemo patients dying from minor illnesses/infections, and how 90% of deaths aren’t from the cancer, but from infections. I don’t want this - something so easily preventable - to happen to my own mother. I sound selfish but it’s just too much stress on top of looking after her and all the school work and the stress of university applications and interviews and part time jobs.

522,"I did a charter school, so I had one teacher/counselor for five years. I always got along with her great and she was always super supportive.

She was really pushing me to apply to colleges because I was gifted in a lot of areas and she wanted to see me succeed. However, I had no intention following the traditional life script, and I ended up taking classes at a community college to figure out what I wanted to do for work.

Anyways, I ended up landing a highly competitive apprenticeship track in IT, and got hired at one of the biggest companies in the area.

I wanted to reach out to her to let her know I ended up all right in the end, despite not going to college. The charter school I went to was filled with kids that got kicked out of normal school so I thought it might be nice to see that one of her former students was doing well.

Just an hour ago, I got an email from walmart and mind you they interviewed me like a month ago, but I got an email that basically said I was hired. I really want to accept the walmart offer because the pay is WAY better and it is closer to my house, however I feel like it is wrong to just quit after well, getting hired only a week ago at tims...  I have been waiting for a call back from walmart for months and and now that somebody hired me.. they email back I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!! ",02Oct2018,1
527,"I'm not sure where to begin, but I will start with the night it happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my girlfriend of one year were at a friends birthday party. We were arguing before getting to the party which we suppressed for the sake of being cordial. Midway through the night and after too much alcohol we got into an argument upstairs away from everyone else, and I impulsively hit her. We'd gotten physical with one another in the past, but this was the worst of them all. Just to be clear-- I didn't beat her or injure her, but laying your hands on a  women in any case is never okay. I understand this and I am so so so remorseful of my actions.

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend was at the party and mediated the entire situation afterwards which led to both of us going to our separate homes. She told her sister what happen. Her sister didn't want my girlfriend talking to me ever again, but despite this event, we do have a loving relationship and until this point haven't spent more than a day apart in the past year so you could imagine how difficult it would be to respect her sisters wishes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her sister ended up telling their mother, who moments ago showed up at my house and threatened to call the cops if we refused to separate. We are both so distraught and I just really need advice on what to do in this situation as people close to me just aren't able to provide proper guidance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make this right. I want to fix everything. I want to be with my girlfriend and make sure that this never happens ever again. I've agreed to quit drinking alcohol and seek out therapy, but I fear that her family will never let us be together for as long as they live.",02Oct2018,1
528,"I know this probably isn't this place for this, but I like when things are told to me and not a general ""10 hobbies that will keep you entertained for weeks.""

In my eyes, I'm a generic introvert. I'm living on a college campus and don't really have any friends out side of my gaming buddies that live in other states. All games have felt boring lately and I would like to pick up another hobby or activity to pass the time.

I would say i'm a fairly competitive person, grew up playing all kinds of sports and play mostly competitive video games. I've thought about picking up racquetball, but I don't know anyone who I could play with. I also enjoy pretty much anything adrenaline related. I went downhill mountain biking over the summer with my sister's boyfriend and had a blast. I would try more of that, but its a very expensive sport to get into.

Thanks for the help, I know this isn't a very serious matter in the grand scheme of things, but I feel like not doing anything all day is starting to take a toll on me and I really appreciate any help.",02Oct2018,1

Here's the email:

 ""Have any of your ever been to your breaking point, because of how frustrating school has become?

Sometimes I can barely handle what goes on during school and how corrupt it is.

Some teachers give more attention to others, and sometimes, they call you out for pointless things, like drawing during class, not knowing instructions for a sheet, and coming late.

533,"There are a lot of things online about dating a longtime friend, yet I feel this is not one of those situations. I am a sophomore in high school new to this section of my orchestra and  I recently started playing double bass. There are only 2 people in my section (David (14/M) and Jill \[17/F\]) and I get along well with them. I really learned a lot from them and I have been having a great friendship for the last month getting to know them, but for some reason my opinion changed on one of them as we were talking about music and Jill said one of my favorite bands when she was talking and I guess cause we both like electric bass or something I’m not sure but now I have a massive crush on her.

The thing is, I’m not into relationships. I see her and talk to her for an hour every day in a closed space and I really don’t want to like her, I just want to be friends. She hasn’t made any moves on me, but when I Yeah see her I instantly get very nervous. I’m not really sure what to do and I’ve tried denial but every time I see her I like her more. A plethora of awkward moments have ensued since, since I can’t control myself around Jill.

***In  summary, I suddenly had a crush on a girl and I really don’t want a relationship with her but I just have a massive pull towards her. What should I do? We have a lot in common and I feel like our friendship has gotten more and more awkward. I see her every day and I'd just love to be friends with her and keep learning about the subject we are learning about.***",02Oct2018,1
534,"I went on a date with this girl I’d been talking to for a while last weekend and it was going really well, she was having a party at her house later that night and she said I could stay over. Later on when her party was winding down we were both drunk (like 6/10 drunk) and she was touchy so we went to bed. We spooned/made out and talked until we both fell asleep, fast forward to the morning everything seemed ok she didn’t seem weird or anything but she said she had to go to her friends house,  she said I could stay so I stuck around for a while until I got an ice cold message from her saying that i should leave and she was uncomfortable with me that night. My friends say she might have mentioned  seeing somebody else that I didn’t know about and everything we did seemed very well received by her. but when she told me that I made her uncomfortable my stomach sank I felt so shitty. I’m just wondering if I should reach out and clear some things up or fuck off forever?? I still kind of have feelings for her but shits just so weird ",02Oct2018,1

Okay, so a couple of hours ago, I received a text from those 5 digit numbers. It gave me a ""Venmo verification code"". I had to Google what Venmo was. I don't have an account there. I am 33 and have never bought anything online. I am a stay-at-home mom. I don't even have a plastic card in my name. I know. I'm not old, I just have never had to. My fiance does all of that because he knows everything about all the computer stuff inside and out. 

Anyways, I asked my fiance to help me figure it out and he replied ""stop"" to the number. The next message said something about me being removed from Venmo notifications. Well, about 20 minutes ago, I got another one. A Venmo verification code from the same exact number. Can someone tell me what's going on here?

540,"Okay so I was finally able to do my final interview for my dream job after months of applying and waiting. 

At 7:30am, right before the interview I decided it was be a great idea to take Adderall because it helps me focus. My sister has always had a prescription and through college I would occasionally take one to help with exams, but it had been a very long time since I’d taken one.

The interview went way better than I ever expected and I got the job on the spot! They had me fill out paperwork and then... a surprise drug test. 

I don’t do any drugs but I had just taken that Adderall at 7:30am and then had the drug test at 12:30pm. I took the test with a broken heart, but there was nothing I could do.

Now the company has sent me paperwork that’s very time sensitive and the plan was for me to go ahead and put in my two weeks notice at my current job, but I’m paralyzed with fear.

The dim and hopeful part of me hopes that somehow I pass the drug test, but the more realistic part of me is sure I failed and that the company will rescind the job offer. 

I’m in desperate need of advice on this matter as I have to make a decision either way. Any help is really appreciated! ",02Oct2018,1
541,"Somewhat frequently (in average 3 times a week; sometimes more sometimes less) the couple living above me have HUGE yelling arguments (one is happening as I write this out).

If I am home and outside smoking when they leave or get home (almost daily during the work week) they always greet me, are very nice and make small talk about the weather and whatnot as they go into their apartment regardless if it is just him, her or both.

I’ve seen a lot of news articles as of late (and subsequently reddit posts) where someone was in the position to do something, didn’t, and something bad happened.

552,"I was sure I was never gonna drink, then wenton several school trips in a very short period of time where everyone got drunk and partied. I said I wouldnt drink to my friends and I didnt. A week later I am on vacation and for some reason wake up with the thought „Im gonna get drunk tonight.“ I was so happy and so determinded to do so even though I would usually know how stupid that idea is. I didnt get drunk but I did drink a beer that night. After a while of feeling relieved of any sorrows, more self-confident and generally happier, I immediately started to worry. Why did I give into drinking? I went to bed that night but since then (5 days) I couldnt stop thinking about drinking another beer. I even used to hate the taste of it. In my family there have been some alcoholics but my mom and dad can easily drink responsibly. Also, a day or two prior to my first beer my dad and I met and he tried to get me to like beer (alcohol free on that day) so I wouldnt be awkward at social meetings being the only non-drinker...

I just wanna know why I have this really, really strong urge to drink again and this terrible feeling of anxiety when I think about how little I can resist a single beer and where this could take me. Is this normal? Should I keep drinking from time to time? Would a short period of drinking make quitting easier?

I dont want drinking to become a habit. I never wanted it to. I must have been pressured into feeling like I have to drink by being surrounded by people that think drinking is a must to be cool.",02Oct2018,1
553,"I do not need a juridical answer, just some thoughts or tips would be nice. 

I (F22) was at a party with several friends and some others. I remember pretty much from the party, but at one point I completely blacked out. When I woke up the day after I did not remember going to bed. This was my first ever blackout, and at this point I was confused and had no idea how or when I got to that state. I did wake up alone in my friends bed (the one who hosted the party) – but without underwear. I also found a new message on my phone: «I hope you had fun last night». This could mean more than one thing, but I expected the worst and started asking both some close friends and the guy who sent the message about last night. 

I had sex with the guy at the party (he confirmed it, but I did not remember it at all the day after). He felt so bad about it and told me he never wanted to do anything against my will. 

These are the most important details as far as I know:

* I made the first move at the party (and potentially some more). 
   * I can not remember this, but a close, honest friend told me I did. I do trust this as I already know I am all about flirting when drunk. 
   * I guess he was just glad I made the moves
   * I was told that we both seemed to have a good time
* I did not even remember talking to this guy at the party. (And I still have absolutely no memory of it happening).
* He was drunk, but not at the point of blackout: 
   * He told me that he remember us having sex
   * He also told me he was pretty drunk
   * My friends told me he had drank alcohol, but that he did not seem too drunk
   * I have no memory of wether or not he was drunk or how drunk
* He did not give me any alcohol – I managed to get wasted myself
* I have no reason to belive I told him «no» when we had sex
   * As far as I know «drunk me» might even have told him I wanted to have sex with him (even tho I would never do that while sober)

As I was already sexually active at this point I did not see this as a big deal. It's easy to pretend it did not happen when you can't remember it. My problem now is that I've started getting flashbacks from things I did not remember at first. And I still feel shitty knowing I let this happen. I just wish we never had sex. 

I don't need anyone to blame – what happened did happen. I just want to know how I should deal with the feels. And I am a bit scared of remembering more – even tho I kind of want to know it all.",02Oct2018,1
