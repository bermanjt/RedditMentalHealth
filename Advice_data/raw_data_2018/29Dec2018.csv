0,"A little background, my mom has severe depression and anxiety her whole time, she's been taking different anti depressants and meds the last 40 years, I read something about people who have taken these types of medicines for 15-20 years hit a tipping point where their brain chemistry is permanently changed and there is no going back. Anyways,  She spends almost 100% of her time on the couch watching TV.  She needs knee replacement surgery in both knees, she just had open heart surgery to fix a valve issue and this procedure just rattled her to her core. She is so anxious, so depressed, she just suffered the loss of her mother, her life has been so chaotic she's literally suffering from PTSD and she has gotten to a point where she can't do the basic, simplest things she needs to do, and she's such a mope, sorry but I am done enabling her and I'm tired of her victim stuff, but I love her still and although she made it through this crazy surgery and was given this 2nd chance on life, she's WAY worse off mentally right now than before the surgery, not to mentions she's still smoking a ton of cigarettes... I am so frustrated, upset, sad, confused, I don't know how to help her. There are money issues, she is barely holding onto this town house she's lived in for 35 years... How can I help my mom get back to a healthy or at least managable mental state?",29Dec2018,1
1,"Legit. I'm a senior, captain of my high school's debate team. And at my school- all-male Catholic boarding school-debate is like a goddamn religion. People spend tens of thousands on coaches and briefs. And the competition is incredibly stiff.

As captain, I decided to try to enact 'caps'- basically, limiting the number of tournaments someone can enter. To me, this is fair, because otherwise, the best debaters will continue to go to tournaments, and although the school would win tournaments, the less good debaters would get no chance to improve. This was obviously unpopular with some of the members of the club and the faculty, which wanted lots of wins. But I didn't think it would go this far.

I guess now is as good a time to mention that I'm addicted to Adderall. I don't even remember the first time. It's just that between late nights, AP classes, debate, model un, and mock trial, it's a grind. I know it's unhealthy. But still.

Anyway, winter break is almost over, and there's a new debate in the middle of January. I posted on the debate groupchat about it and mentioned the caps. Soon after, I recieved a text from an anonymous number. It said that they knew about my Adderall and would tell the administrators unless I remove the caps. I just sent a text back asking 'what if I went to to the administration and told them you were blackmailing me?' They just responded that if they were caught, the school would obviously discover my secret as well, and it wouldn't be worth it. Whoever sent the text has a point. They'd probably get expelled, but I'd be expelled as well. And keep in mind I'm a scholarship kid. I have no pull with the school through money or connections, and if I get expelled I'm done.

Anyway, I narrowed down the list of people who could do it down to the 4 most hurt by the caps. I'm listing them from most to least likely to do it:

Tied at 1st:

Honestly a typical rich spoiled kid, plus lots of intelligence and ambition. His mom is a CEO, his dad is the Vice Principal, you get the idea. I honestly get the vibe that ultimately he just is an attention whore, and from what I've heard from his 'friends', he's incredibly narcissistic and only in debate for the glory. He joined debate freshman year, became friends with all the upperclassmen who were in elected positions, won some tournaments. He's a good debater, he has good speaking skills and decent logic, I'll give him that. But he's a scheming asshole. He makes people cry in-round, stabs them in the back, talks shit about them, and used a girls emotion to make her go easy on him in a round. He'll do anything to win. You get the idea. He's an asshole, so I think it likely could be him. He also hates the second guy.

In a way the opposite of the 1st guy. He's also a scholarship student. He joined debate freshman year, and he did the exact opposite as the 1st guy. While the 1st guy sucked up to all the leaders of the club, this guy is a straight loose cannon. I have to say, he's the best debater I've seen to this day, which is why the 1st guy hates him. Anyway, back to him being a loose cannon. Normally, varsity debaters provide novices with evidence to help them at first. He straight up told us our evidence was bs. We Explained to him that if he did all his own research, that would put him at an unfair advantage to those who actually were using just our evidence. He said okay and took the cards with our evidence. As soon as he went up there, he just read his speech anyway, and he went on to win the tournament. So yeah. He convinced the then-president not to punish him. Generally, people love him since he's funny, very charismatic, and wins. But he's been a constant headache for whoever is in charge.

3rd (kinda likely)

Basically spoiled and kind of douchey. His dad went here and was debate captain here, so he wants his son to also be part of it. He's more interested in sports, since he plays a sport each season: football, wrestling, rowing. He's also in a lot of dating drama with girls from our sister school all the time, and openly admits he doesn't care about debate. He says he just does it to please his dad. I don't think it's as likely as the first 2, but still. He wants to make his dad proud. He's proven he can be an asshole, since he lies to girls to fuck them. So it's a possibility. 4th (least likely)

Honestly a basically normal kid. He does debate and is good st it, plays tennis, gets good grades, like I said very normal. Maybe I'm underestimating him, and I know he wants to be president, but he's just very understated compared to the others I've already mentioned. They all have outsized personalities. Maybe it's just that I don't know him well enough, but he's not a problem like the 1st and 2nd guys, constantly gossiped about like the 3rd guy, or as douchey as any of the 3. Or maybe I'm being paranoid. Who is most likely to have done it? What do I do?

Tl;dr: I made an unpopular decision as debate captain, and I'm being blackmailed using my Adderall addiction to overturn it. The suspects are: an ambitious and douchey rich kid, an ambitious and douchey scholarship kid, an unambitious and douchey athlete who just wants to prove himself to his dad, and a normal average but ambitious guy. Who most likely did it, and what do I do?",29Dec2018,1

3,"I’m an 18 year old female. I was treated inappropriately as a child (not really molested, my older cousin was just incredibly inappropriate with me), and then last summer, i was raped.

Even when I’ve tried to date, it’s ended bad because i start doubting myself and not trusting the guy or myself. My therapist is telling me that i need to change my psyche and stop linking men to danger or hurt, but it’s so hard. Are there actually good men out there? I’m not looking for the cliche “yes just find it”, i really wanna know what you guys think.

7,"Firstly Thank you for clicking on my post, this is the first time I've ever made a Reddit post so please forgive me if I do anything wrong in this post currently I'm just looking for advise on what to do as I'm currently in a bad ish situation so I'll try my best to explain it so I'll start right from the beginning 

It was Summer last year in 2017, I just got accepted into this team who helped out this famous youtuber with stuff, that was going well until one time I logged onto teamspeak (this is where we talked) I found this girl crying in one of the channel another person was in the channel can't remember there name so ye let's call them  L (just to keep ids private, stuff don't want people witchhunting) so L was crying over her ex boyfriend who she had been trying to get back with for months now, she just gave up L told me so I calmed her down and we got to know each better over the course of the few days via Skype this carried on until about Mid August when L came home one night, she was drunk from this wedding and somehow we both confessed we liked each other so we become Boyfriend, Girlfriend the next day I got to know her ""personal friends"" people that were close to her via online, (this relationship looking back on it now wasn't good it wasn't health for neither of us I'll explain it in a bit) so this carried on and through September I was instantly come home from school, just talk to her for
6 hours straight ish every day non stop, we started to get 
more emotional attached to each other, this all builded up to a break up in Mid-Late November L told me she broke up because she wanted to focus more on her college rather than me but I would have taken this normally and said ""Alright etc"" but she decided to do this at like 2am in the morning, I shouted and complained at her until like 4am, still to this day I regret that so the breakup happened, into December one of my friends decided to talk to her for some reason idk why but ye I started to get close to another girl called C, C was alright 
Me and her got along well, we were thinking about dating each other in mid January but L found out about this I told L my feelings for her were stronger than C but she didn't want C to be upset so she pushed me away to date C, C was shocked at this as she knew my feelings were stronger for L so she was with overjoy, we started dating around February this went on for about two weeks but she broke up with me because ""She got a letter from God telling her to stay single"" (No I'm not making fun of God before you jump the gun) so I accepted then I asked her why, she couldn't give me a answer so I kinda bugged her about it for a week or so (Makes me feel like a dick now), she still didn't so I just left it, we're still friends if anyone is wondering so skip up until Easter break around April me and L got back together again as L called it ""Trial Week"" L got back with me because she felt sorry, my friend from early had to talk her how I still have feelings etc so the week went by, I knew straight away we weren't going to get back together again ever after this week I just had a gut feeling that she was going to pick college over me again (now I'm not saying college isn't bad or anything just feels you know), that's what happened if you believe it she told me she needs to focus more on her college work so ye things went quite from there until around Mid-July when we got into a call, we talked about the future, stuff L said to me ""well I have to study this course for two more years if you still have feelings for me then maybe we can try again"" (usually this means it never will happen one of those replies this is just my way of thinking) I replied with ""Alright"" so here we are Late December going into the new year, our contact has been   
Barely nothing we rarely message each other now, when we do it just 'U Ok"" ""Alright"" those type of messages, I still have feelings for her but like I just feeling it's impossible, I'm not weirdo who just thinks this girl is the I'll fall in love with etc I just feel like this is the only girl I truly like not in weird way, yes I've tried to move on but it honestly doesn't feel right, again I know it doesn't usually doesn't feel right but trust me I've tried

9,"Hi everyone,


I am a 23 male and I am not sure how I could myself in this situation but the new year is coming around the corner and I am trying to plan things out. This last year hasn't been the best for me. In facts, the past few years haven't been helpful at all. I got a new job this year switching from web development to industrial automation. With the new job I had to start with a pay cut (from 56k to 51k annual). But I did managed make a few good moves and got a raise to 59k annual.


However, since my job is based on a contract and the contract is up for review this year and I am not sure if it will be renewed. One thing is that my supervisor at the plant said that he would be opening a position in the city (public servant sector) and that he'd like me to apply for it. He said that I would be a good candidate and would most likely get in. But the thing is that I would be taking a pay cut again to 48k. I feel upset at this since all the potential job changes that I make would resulted in a pay cuts. It really hurts my pride and my optimism for the future.


I haven't had the best mentality in the recent years. A breakup and car accidents really ruined 2016 for me. 2017 was the year that I graduated but couldn't find my dream job and had to take up web development. 2018 had been really painful with my mother relapsing to mental illness and me contemplating about my future at this new job.


I guess that I could supplement my pay cuts with overtime where they allotted 40 hrs per month for individuals and it'll be a public job so the work won't be super demanding or pressured. I also feel like that there'll be a recession coming up and this job will be safe from it all.


One other thing is that I'd have to get a car and since my accidents, I've had super anxiety about driving in the city and the freeways. I've been going to therapy to try to alleviate my anxiety and taken measurement to help me get over my fear. It didn't help a lot when my mother was sick and got me really anxious again.


I feel really lost and I tend to be really pessimistic about things so I am asking reddit for help with opening my eyes to different perspectives because I am having anxiety about the immediate future. I feel like my anxiety isn't in check because I am not seeing my therapist until next week cause it's the holidays :(

10,"Having trouble deciding where to move to. I have two options right now, both in the same complex. 

Apartment One: Second floor loft, more expensive, less storage space, but has two bathrooms and washer and dryer in unit. I would most likely have to pay for a storage unit. 

Apartment Two: First floor, only a little less expensive, more storage space, no washer and dryer. 

I calculated the cost of EVERYTHING and Apartment One would be about $20 more dollars than Apartment Two. But I would have my own washer and dryer. But I’d have to have some things (holiday decor) in a storage unit.

However, she needs room to run around and likes to feel like shes outside (a patio or lanai). 

We will be moving from a townhouse style apartment to a stairwell apartment on the second floor of a fancy new construction. 

My brother has agreed to house her during the transition and has expressed mild interest in taking her in for good. He has a three level home with an enclosed patio which I know she would love.

The thing is, if he doesnt take her, I cant have her in my new apartment. Its smaller than our old place and she becomes rambunctious without the illusion of freedom. 

Shes a good cat and I'm opposed to the idea of putting her in a shelter, she would never be adopted, being in an enclosed cage like that would drive her crazy. 

What do I do? I want her to have a good life. I want to keep her but I feel that I cant. But i cant tell my brother I'll get rid of her if he doesnt take her either.

22,"So, over 10 years ago my Grandparents told me they were leaving all their possessions, house and money to me, and giving £1000 each to their other grandchild (my cousin), my Mum and my Auntie.  At the time, this would probably mean I was getting around £80k, and the rest of my family £3k.

I know that seems harsh - but he discussed it with the family and the reasoning was that my Auntie was in a secure, rather well paying job, my cousin had a decent inheritance from her other grandparents and parents, and my mum was settled after a divorce, however, during the divorce due to debt my parents lost their house so I had no inheritance.  Thus, he thought it was fair for me to have the majority of their estate.  Generally, I agreed - although, I’d have probably staggered the inheritance more than he did.

Anyway, my Grandma got dementia and he cared for her for three years before his death.  But, this meant they could no longer guarantee the house would come to me if my Nan had to go into a home.  So, they separated the house between them so that *if* she went into a home, they couldn’t use his half for fees and that would come to me instead, anything remaining of my Grandma’s half will be split 4 ways between me, cousin, Aunt and Mum.

After my Grandad’s death, mostly it was fine. But my Auntie keeps mentioning the money in different ways:
1 . I sold his car, which he gifted to me before his death and my Aunt reiterated that after he died - yet when I sold it, she claimed that everyone in the family should get 1/4 and when I refused she gifted the other 3 £1000 each.
2. I asked to borrow money for bills, and she initially refused even though I was facing fines from the council - that would be fine, but the month before she’d just gifted that £3000 with no reason and here I was facing eviction.
3 - Usually, we get money from my Nan for Birthdays/Christmas, and my Auntie said the bill loan wouldn’t affect that with me yet this year excluded me from Christmas money from my Nan saying she didn’t think I needed it because of the bill loan and the car sale.

My Auntie and Uncle always used to seem annoyed when my Grandad bought me new things when I was younger because he didn’t buy my cousin as much (only because he didn’t see her as much with them living far away).  And it feels like because they’re not getting a cut of this money, they want to be unfair with me.

I told my Grandad I would rather give up my entire share than fall out with my family, which I still stand by. But, equally, I can’t see the point in family that is willing to let money taint things like this. We’re usually so close, because we’re not a particularly big family yet I’m feeling constantly ousted.

What should I do?  Do I just give up my share?  Do I ignore it?  Confront them?  Cut them out of my life?",29Dec2018,1
24,"I’m a Juilliard trained musician.  I won an audition with a regional orchestra 2 years ago.  At the end of my first year with the orchestra we played a huge piece, and at the end of the concert... before anyone got to take a bow, The conductor walked through the orchestra to shake my hand.  It was one of the proudest moments of my life.  

At the beginning of my second year they hired another player in my section.  Every week he would spend more and more time getting drunk with the conductor.  (Boss).  And it felt like he was inserting himself between me and my colleagues.  He was unhelpful in the section. He wouldn’t do what I asked.  I was the principal player and he was as unhelpful as possible.  

So I started to fall apart.  I could see everything falling apart.  I didn’t know what to do so I just kept working as hard as I could.  Well guess what.  It wasn’t enough.  I was so stressed out from the maestro giving me dirty looks all the time and brow beating me into a musical corner that I had no room to make music. I had an unhelpful section.  I made too many mistakes.  

So at the end of my second year they ended my contract.  I retook the audition for the job they just said they didn’t want me for and it came down to me and the unhelpful section-mate.  Guess who they picked.  

Now I’m out of that city and moved closer to my family.  I got married.  I love so much about my life but every time I start to think about practicing and getting back on the audition circuit I literally think about killing myself.  Music has been a huge part of my entire life.  And now I know that everyone who ever said “good job” was a fucking liar.  The people in this industry are horrible.  

There are other options for musician, like teaching,  but how can I possibly encourage any hopeful kid to get into this industry?  

There are other ways to be a musician, but now I don’t know if I want that anymore.  If I went into a new field would I forever regret that I let these fuckers chase me out?  That I let them get the best of me?  Would it even be different in another field?  Because I imagine that there fuckers everywhere.  

I don’t know how to bring up these feeling especially to my family who are so proud that I went to JUILLIARD blah blah blah.  My husband knows but thinks I should just make different music.  He doesn’t know that the thought of being in AND getting out of music makes me paralyzed with self loathing.  

I can’t see a way out of this because I’m in it.  I’m in an emotional spiral.

How can I shift this to myself? I want to have a similar drive when I'm doing stuff for my own sake. I don't want to rely on inspiration, but I find that I rarely have to do that when working on something another person requested. ",29Dec2018,1

34,"So, some context.

I have a friend that I met at summer camp. She used to hang around me and my huge group of friends there. We basically included her and a bunch of other younger kids in our group because they were sweet and wanted to be involved. That and there weren't a lot of older kids at that camp anyway. Long story short this girl got really attached to me specifically, she told me she sees me as an older sister and she still messages me on instagram to tell me about her school or ask for boy advice. She's a total sweetheart and I see her like my little sister too. Recently she invited me to her birthday party and I dont know if I should go. I'd feel so weird being so much older than everyone there and I can't imagine what her parents are going to think about a high school graduate coming to their freshman daughters party. But at the same time I know it would mean a lot to her if someone from camp came since our whole group keeps trying to get together to no avail and I don't want to let her down. So, what should I do?",29Dec2018,1

Christmas Eve rolls around and nothing shows up. I email him Christmas eve and he immediate responds “woops sorry forgot to ship it out. I can ship it out overnight the day after Christmas and it will arrive Thursday.” I agree to that.

I emailed him early on Thursday asking for a tracking number. It’s now Friday at night, past the time deliveries arrive, and I have nothing and he still didn’t respond to my email.

36,"Alright so here's a little background before we dive straight into this. Been in a couple of relationship's that didn't work out and came out having trust issues due to them lying, cheating, and being manipulative. I've been single for about a year now and I was really happy being single... That's until recently when I met this girl just on tinder. Another thing I should mention is I move fast with my feelings and I usually try to hold them back, so I don't scare the other person away. That being said, I have expressed my feelings in the past and it has gone both ways of good and bad.

I didn't think much of her because I was used to talking to girls that lost interest on tinder. However, we met up and I instantly realized she was way out of my league. I didn't let that get to me though. We went out to the beach and ate dinner. Something about her felt different, so I started talking about music that I like (80's, 90's, synth, rock. etc) she instantly started naming other bands that I loved too! Then I moved on to other topics and we started to find out we had so much in common that it was kinda scary/weird. It was that type of scene in the movie where both people would say the same sentence at the same time. We both admitted to having trust  issues and other things that really meant a lot to me. It was getting late and I had no intentions of having sex with her, so I dropped her off home and I did not sleep. I really fell hard for this girl, unlike any other girl in my past.

There was only one thing I really didn't like, but I was thinking how silly It was. She doesn't text back regularly, she even admitted to saying how frustrated she gets when she texts back because she has to find the right thing to say, but she backed it up with how much she adores me and lives talking to me, so I wasn't going to let that bother me.

Moving on to Date #2 ( Yes, she wanted to go out again) After dinner, she had to go use the restroom, so I dropped her off to the nearest store. While she was in the store I saw she got a message from a guy. It was one of those things you wish you didn't see because my trust issue rose up again and I felt sick to my stomach. After she came back instead of accusing her I asked her if she was still talking to anyone. She answered honestly and said yes, which was great! I understood I just met her yesterday, so she said she wasn't interested in anyone and stopped talking to the guys she met. She asked me the same wuestion I asked  her and I answered honestly of how I stopped talking to the people I was talking after that night I met her. We pretty much went straight to the beach after that and just started talking about how we felt for each other. I was scared, but I told her how I felt. I told her I wanted her and I could see her well into my future. She smiled at that and said you mean getting married and being the mother of your kids. I said yes, she smiled again. I told her I didn't want to pressure her into anything and she didn't need to give me an answer right away. She said she really wants me, she just has to think about what I said because again it's a pretty big deal. I take her home again and the night ends and I don't sleep because I'm thinking again. 

She wants to go out on another date, but now her texting is starting to bother me because she will go for hours without texting back. I've been thinking about so much in the last two days about her that her not texting me back right away is bothering me... But I think it's silly to say anything and I don't want to ruin anything. I also usually don't mind if people take hours or days to text back, I even myself do the same.

So all of this is a big ass emotional rollercoaster and a long ass story about a girl I just met. I know she wants me. We are a little far( 4 hours) , but I told her I'd make it work. My questions to the people of Reddit are as follows:

Am I losing my shit? 

Is she playing me? 

She says she wants me but hardly texts back? 

Is it normal to feel like this?

37,"I'm sorry if what I'm trying to describe is confusing or makes no sense, because I've also never been able to pin down what happens to me or why. I use the term ""obsessions"" for lack of a better one.

For background, I'm someone who has dealt with depression for most of my life; I feel like the obsessions are somehow correlated to this. It isn't clinical and I'm not medicated.

The first time I ever experienced an obsession was when I was in the fifth grade, which was also the same year I had my first experience with depression (though I only realized that's what it was years later). It's going to sound really silly, but the obsession was with Digimon. I was definitely not the only kid who was ""obsessed"" with it, but I remember clearly when it started to feel more distressing than fun. I started to feel sad when I was watching my copy of the Digimon movie, despite having watched it many, many times happily. I felt... empty, watching it and knowing it wasn't real and I could never meet these people or be a part of it. I had a dream one night that it was real and I was one of them and in a relationship with one of the other kids, and when I woke up I was just so hollow in the wake of how good the dream had felt.

Over the years, I've had this happen again with various different things. Sometimes it's a person; I'll be listening to the same band I've listened to hundreds of times, but suddenly I'm thinking about the lead singer non-stop and I consume every bit of content I can that involves them (music videos, interviews, etc.). More often, it's fictional and is either the entire fictional work/world as a whole or a specific character that I think of in a more romantic context. I read a Daniel Handler book about a couple breaking up once and I was consumed with sadness for days after I read it, re-reading certain passages over and over and trying to find fanfiction and reviews and forums discussing it.

I can't seem to control how long the obsessions last but I always try to stop them to no avail; I just wake up one day and it's over. It can last from as little as a few days to as long as a month. The thoughts of them border on intrusive, and when they sneak up it feels the same way as trying to repress the memory of an ex-partner; it's this sinking feeling in my stomach and the same hollow, empty feeling it all started with years ago. I can't tell if consuming content around the thing with which I'm obsessed helps me get over it faster, like I'm getting it all out of my system, or if it just makes it worse.

I can now also tell as soon as this is coming on with me, but I can't predict it ahead of time. I re-watched the movie Heathers last night for the first time in a few years, and as soon as the credits rolled I felt that familiar feeling, like my brain was latching on to the character JD. I knew I would wake up today feeling weird and hollow and like I was somehow missing a fictional character from my life. It feels ridiculous and I hate how dumb it sounds to say I can't stop thinking of a fictional person (especially one who's a murderer :|), which leads me to the other distressing element of all this: it's obvious something is wrong with me when this is happening because I withdraw from others, but I've never told anyone about this so I feel I can't share and it feels impossible to connect with anyone real when this is happening which probably does not help and only drives me further inward. I almost end up *resenting* everyone around me for not being the person I'm obsessing over or being part of the world I'm wishing I could be a part of instead of the real world. It sort of takes on a dissociative quality, in a way. I'm someone who has a hard time sharing my feelings even when they feel normal; the idea of trying to say I'm feeling depressed and empty because I can't be with someone who doesn't exist or be somewhere that isn't real feels insane.

Currently, I'm visiting my mom with my best friend and they've both been asking me what's wrong all day when I fall silent or seem upset, and I've had to just keep deflecting and saying I'm tired. I want nothing more than to feel normal and engage with them and enjoy this visit, but I feel so firmly entrenched in this strange feeling that I can't just break out of it right now.

Does *anyone* relate to what I'm saying and has felt something at least remotely similar? If so, what have you done to snap yourself out of it? I just need to know if anything helps and if I can control this somehow. I hate how it feels. I hate how I can't reach out to anyone.

TL;DR: I become ""obsessed"" with fictional worlds or characters (and sometimes real people) and feel distressed and empty, but can't tell anyone around me even though I'm obviously withdrawn and upset. I want to be able to end this awful feeling.",29Dec2018,1

41,"Not-so-Quick backstory: On st. Stephens night my best friend cheated on his girlfriend with an old crush he had back in our hometown.

This is a girl who he has consistently dismissed his gf's concerns over and has said she was being controlling in wanting him to distance himself from her. That night he was all over her, cuddling and hugging her. 4 of his friends including me went to try and intervene earlier in the night and he basically fucked us off, even palming me off in my face to ""leave them alone"".

Now at this point, I'd been stressing the whole night about him ruining his relationship over what could be, so this complete disrespect for his oldest friend who was trying to help him, set me off. I left to calm down, it didn't work and the next time I saw him i smacked him full force across the head and started roaring at him for being a gobshite.

I know that was an over reaction and I apologise less than a minute after I slapped him.

We haven't spoken to each other in the days since, but I've been getting updates on how he is dealing with this from another friend. Apparently he is trying to blame his gf for what he did, and without getting more into it, is trying to minimise how intentional his actions were that night(I kept him in my sights for 90% if the night, I was disgusted with him).

Idk what to say, I'm meeting him tommorow with our mutual friend to mediate but I know I'm not gonna be able to keep myself calm. Is there anything I can say/ anyway to phrase my dissapointment and anger at what he did without him taking it and crawling into a shell.

Also, it seems he is lying to his girlfriend about what went down that night, like I said, he's trying to pass off the whole thing as this girl having taken advantage of his vulnerability due to his gf. I think that's extremely manipulative, should I contact the gf and say that he's not giving the full story? She's a lovely girl, I just don't think she deserves to deal with the shit my friend is doing, at least until he improves himself.

So yeah, two main questions from extremely angry, conflicted individual.

How can I best avoid my friend from shutting me out to avoid guilt?

Should I tell his gf what actually happened that night?

And we're all 20 years old here, they've been going out for a few years now, if that changes anything. Any advice is much appreciated, my head is in bits the last few days from all this.",29Dec2018,1
42,"Sorry for how long this is.

This girl was my closest friend from 6th grade to 10th grade. We drifted apart when she became very closed off and kind of mean, and I became closer to someone else in our group of friends. I had to move across the country the summer between 11th and 12th grade. I kept in contact with everyone else via text, Snapchat, Instagram, etc., but she never answered me. When we graduated high school, I wrote everyone in our group of friends a letter and mailed them. Everyone responded but her.

I did a lot of thinking and realized she'd been a pretty shitty friend. I went to all of her choir events, but she was never able to come to a cross country meet or track meet to see me run. I always had to reach out to her to hang out; she never invited me over first. She was awful about me coming out because she wasn't the first person I told, so she turned me coming out into some sob story about me not trusting her enough to tell her. And the list could go on and on. So I stopped missing her and stopped thinking of her as a friend, I got rid of a charm bracelet she gave me, I donated a couple stuffed animals she'd made me, etc. 

I did not hear from her again until my second year of college when she texted to ask if the fires were near my house. The fires weren't where I live now, they were where I moved away from. I told her I moved away three years ago. She didn't reply. I deleted her phone number from my contacts.

Two days ago I got a text from a number I didn't have saved calling me by a name I don't go by anymore asking me how things were going. I didn't answer the question, but I did reply asking who it was because I don't have this number in my phone. She told me who it was and I said (I'm copy-pasting my text here): ""Thank you for reaching out to me, but I don't want to talk to you about anything including how I'm doing because I don't think of us as friends or even casual acquaintances anymore. You weren't a good friend to me, didn't reach out to me, didn't reply to my letters, and forgot I moved. I'd prefer it if you deleted my number from your contacts and didn't contact me again."" 

She hasn't responded, but everyone in our old group of friends has let me know just how upset I've made her, while at the same time understanding I don't have to make up with her and I also don't want to make up with her. What should I do, if anything? I don't want to be her friend and, if I'm honest, I don't want to comfort her even, but I don't like knowing she's apparently really upset about someone she was shitty to saying he doesn't want to talk to her anymore.

He is my older brother. 30 yrs old now. He drinks basically everyday. Maybe once or twice a week he drinks into oblivion. Like slurred speech, barely able to walk....and the worst part is he drives. He drives home drunk, he drives talking to his friends, and drinks. When home and drunk he will try to drive to get food or go other places. The only solace I get is when he passes out and goes to sleep. He drinks on weekdays and weekends. 

Going back to when I said he drinks into oblivion once or twice a week, their will be stretches when he won't do that. But then it will start up again for a few months. I feel like he's sad.

I was going 50 in a 45 so I didn't feel the need to speed up.  They stayed tight on me for about a mile and I decided to flash my spotlight at them through the rear window.  (Never doing that again).  They cut on their high beams and I did it again.  I laughed because I knew I had annoyed them.  They got even closer so I slowed down to 45.  When the road opened to 2 lanes I pulled to the right lane to let them pass.  Nope, they stayed behind me but further back.  I pulled back over and speed up to 55.  About 2 miles later they were still on my tail and I was close to home.  

I knew it wasn't a cop, their lights were old and the high beams were separate from low beams

There was a figure-eight traffic circle and I gunned it around 3 loops.  They raced to stay with me, until I noticed a sheriff was on the circle too and they held back.  I sped up and turned right then left again then left once more and cut my lights off.  I was a block from home and then I saw them turn in behind me so I cut my lights back on and headed to the freeway.

They stayed with me ~10 miles back into the city.  At one point I slowed up to about 95 mph trying to lose them but they stayed close behind.  I slowed down quickly to get them to pass on left but they slammed brakes to stay behind me.  Finally the interstate ended and speed limit went from 70 to 55.  A new set of headlights pulled behind me outta no where.  It was a sheriff (running my plates I assume).  I pulled into a left turn lane and u-turned and the sheriff kept straight and I lost the tail.

Instead I found them being an asshole to someone else and got angry so I defended the person they were threatening to ban.

I then took a screenshot of the convo (blurred out usernames) and posted it on r/modsarekillingreddit subreddit. That is where person #2 finds me and misinterprets the facts thinking I was the one who made the rape threat. They started harassing me telling me they screenshot my face pic from a previous rate me post and were going to find my Facebook and message all of my friends and family. Unfortunately they found a post I made earlier on r/unpopularopinions “eugenics aren’t a bad idea” and misinterpreted the facts again claiming I am a nazi which I am not. They told me they are going to go through with all of this and find my Facebook and unearth anything remotely negative I said on Reddit and tell all of my friends and family. I’ve been so scared I don’t know what to do. Are they bluffing? Should I be worried? ,29Dec2018,1
66,"Hey, 

So I don’t even know where to begin. I’ve been married to my husband for just under 2 years. The problem is... he sleep talks. 

He regularly sleep talks other women’s names especially his ex, regularly sleep talks sexual situations, and just now he sleep talked saying he fancies some woman. 

I’ve asked him on several occasions what that’s about and he says he doesn’t believe he says anything of the sort, but he’s known that he sleeps talks since way before he met me so I think he’s just pretending.

Sometimes he’ll tell me about a dream he had the night before and it’ll tie in with his sleep talking hence I think he’ll be pretending not to know what he sleep talks about. 

Anyway, I don’t trust him at all because he’s cheated on me before. His sleep talking does nothing but fuel my mistrust of him. 

Do you think I should attempt to talk to him about his sleep talking again or just assume that he’s basically cheating on me and maybe consider leaving him because I don’t want to waste my time with someone who clearly doesn’t value or appreciate me.  ",29Dec2018,1

He knows this, and he knows I am moving away from our condo and back to my home city in 3 months from now.

73,"I have a total of 4 dogs, all very loved and well taken care of. My heart dog is a 12 year old German Shepherd Dog, I also have a 13 year old Border Collie/Beagle Mix (the other two are younger chihuahua mixes). 

I want another GSD, I absolutely love the breed, and Constance has been the absolute best dog I’ve ever had... I’ve had GSDs in my life from family members and as I was growing up, and we also had a male that had to be put to sleep earlier this year due to health complications)... so I’m an experienced owner of the breed. I love everything about them except the shedding lol 😂 

I know my time with both of my old girls is short, my question is if I should get another GSD while they are still with me, so they can teach the puppy, or should I wait until after my sweet OGs (old girls) have crossed the rainbow bridge? Even thinking about losing them is more than I can take, but I’m not dumb, I know they can’t live forever. 

Puppies are hard work, and it’s not something I take lightly. Once I get a pet, they are with me for life, no matter what comes. I owe that to them. I would love my girls to be able to teach a new puppy all the things that they’ve learned, but at the same time I’m not sure it’s fair to them to make them live through another puppy.

74,"Short story incoming: Two months ago I moved cities (same state) for a new job. My old job was a small, niche, tech company (100 employees). I started there ten years ago and rose up to manager level. I knew everyone, hired many people, knew their families, joked around with everyone. Even went to the gym regularly with a small group of guys. All my needs, financial and otherwise, were met, but I felt like I was stagnating. I saw myself in the same role ten years from now, and being in my early 30's, I didn't want to settle so easily. Plus I felt like my technical skills were growing stale and that kinda scared me. So an opportunity at a big tech company (you've heard of them) came up and they offered me more pay, company stock, etc. I've been here two months, and to be honest, its a fine company. Its run by smart people; I haven't met any jerks; they're growing steadily. I'd like to say I hate it, but I can't - it’s fine. But I am not fine. My life is absolutely falling apart. Two months ago I had everything figured out. I had a schedule, I had hobbies, I was fit, I ate clean, etc. Now I feel like everything is disintegrating.

• I am wracked with guilt over leaving my teammates.
• I literally haven’t sleep a full night in the last two months. I’m having nightmares (mostly about my old team) and wake up multiple times per night in a cold sweat.
• I’ve gained, like, twenty pounds, all due to stress eating. I used to be in great shape and now am flabby and unhappy.
• I have no willpower to do the things that used to make me happy. I come home from work and watch tv.
• My drinking is starting to increase, and I’m losing the ability to say no.
• I’ve been unable to make a set of friends here. Mostly because I’m an older guy and my coworkers are about 10 years younger. Also, many people work remotely, so we don’t have an opportunity to meet.
• My new boss is fine; but I feel like my old boss was better.
• I’m not in management anymore, and this has been a big, uneasy adjustment.

I completely blame myself and can't forgive myself for such a bad decision. I’ve never had any mental health issues, but if this is what depression feels, then I get it. I can totally see how this can sideline someone for years. I feel like I made the worst decision of my life and like my life is ruined. I also know that I can’t go back and change the past, so I really don’t know what to do to move forward. I desperately want my old life back, but it’s gone.

80,"My friend has moved overseas. We caught up properly a few weeks before she left as sort of our proper goodbye. My boyfriend is also friends with her (not close friends) and wanted to see her before she left. I tired to organise this. We had organised for specific day to meetup. My boyfriend took the day off work. On the day she messaged me to let me know that she desperately needs a coat and she can’t catch up. 

I said no worries, I understand that she is stressed and has limited time. I tried to organise to catch up another day but it’s difficult because she is working until she leaves and my boyfriend has his shifts at work already. 

My mum and I bought her little goodbye gifts. I told her this and I wanted to come past to see her to drop them off. I asked if I could call her and she called me straight away. The conversation seemed normal. 

She wanted me to come and see her when she is seeing another person. I have generalised anxiety, social anxiety and more. I feel anxious about seeing this person. I declined and told her how I felt. She experiences anxiety also so she said that’s fair enough. She said she would let me know if she could see me the next day. I let her know what time I’m available.

The next day I asked her if I was able to come past to drop the gift off. She had seen the message but did not respond. I figured that she is stressed and I could just mail it to her when she is settled. 

She leaves on Boxing Day, i has sent her a longish message wishing her a merry Christmas and well wishes for her new journey. 

She never opened that message. She has posted on social media, responded to other people and been online the same time as myself. I decide to message her elsewhere and ask if I could call her. She never opens that message either despite going online and posting more photos. 

I would have figured that she doesn’t want to respond yet because she may want to settle down, however she is responding to other people. 

I don’t know what I did that offended her. If she doesn’t communicate with me and is ignoring my messages how can I defend myself and explain my rationale of things?

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is 23 and I am 26. our relationship has been somewhat strained for years but not as bad as it used to be.

​

It all started when I broke up with my first girlfriend who was and still is one of his best friends, maybe 7 or 8 years ago. From their I went on a downward spiral, which peaked when I was 21 and my best friend committed suicide. I basically became a huge alcoholic after this, I think the worst of it was one time, in front of friends, a verbal argument between my brother and I, where I decided to pull some brass knuckles. I got my ass beat but it had a strain on my relationship with him for years.

​

This summer I got in a big argument with him, which is rare these days, but it lasted like 2 days. He said a bunch of really crazy stuff, that he doesnt love anyone and just tells them he does to give them peace of mind. He also said that he hasn't felt joy since the age of 10 or so and has never been excited for life and just simply exists. He said he views my family as just people to see on the holidays, and that he wants to die in a hospital bed with no one else around, just quiet and peaceful. All of this stemmed from an argument over me robbing someone in a bad drug deal. I told him that he shouldnt want to die and he turned it around on me and said thats selfish of me not to, and that its his decision.

​

Now he's told me he's loved me every time i've seen him since, which he never did before. on Christmas eve I went to pick him up from work, we were going to stop back at his house than go to my parents to spend the night, a tradition of sorts. Within the first half hour he told me that he plans on committing suicide around the age of 35, that he will be done ""playing the game"" by then and that everyone resents old people and he doesnt want to become one of them. By this point we had gotten back to his house and were around roommates and friends and the conversation had changed.

​

I dont see eye to eye on my brother on many things but I love him to death and hes one of my favorite people ever. I can't talk to my parents or siblings about this because it will just make this worse, I feel like I can't tell him not to kill himself because he will turn it around on me again and say that I dont want him to do it for selfish reasons, and that anyone wouldnt want him to do it for selfish reasons. Lately i've been trying to suggest to him that we both get off drugs (we both smoke weed and do psychedelics, him much heavier than i do, also he does amphetamines) and get into fitness. He has agreed that this would be a good idea but I honestly think that if he got off weed with the amount he smokes it would not be good.

​

I have not been a good example as an older brother and he is heavily involved in crime. I worry very frequently, on a daily basis, sometimes all day. I can't go to parents or family, this will make things much worse. We honestly came from a good family, my parents never were big drinkers and always worked very hard to provide for us. My mother is a very worrysome person. I have 2 younger siblings besides my brother. My entire family is so innocent, I saw what happened when my best friend committed suicide and it just would never be the same, and I dont want it to happen to us

​

I'm sorry for the long post, theres so much else about the history and family dynamic and my brothers eccentricities. He wont listen to me because he knows that deep down I am a hardcore conservative and he hangs out with queers and communists. He is also far more intelligent and way better with people then me. Part of me hopes that hes just a sociopath and trying to get attention but I know thats probably far from the truth, and theres nothing I can do. To me it seems like he decided on this awhile back and its just a matter of time, hes just in it for the ride and once shit dies down from his party lifestyle and his good friends move on and settle down with their lives, hes just gonna be done. I've suggested a therapist, he says hes too busy and broke, he also doesnt have a license for the next few years, and that he doubts there would be a good therapist in the city anyways. So instead he self medicates by smoking $1000 worth of weed a month and microdoses LSD and adderal multiple days in a row, which is something I dont agree with.

89,"I'm a female in my 40s and own my own home. The house behind me is rented by an 82-year-old man, who I'll call Bob.

Bob first approached me about a year ago while I was outside working in my yard. He seemed harmless and helpless and told me he just had surgery and needed to get to his doctor appointment in a couple of days and he wasn't supposed to drive yet. Long story short, I gave him my number and told him I could give him a ride.

Bob has extreme body odor. I made it through taking him to his appointment and decided to steer clear of him without being rude or mean. However, he has made my life a nightmare since then. He started calling non-stop and coming outside any time I went outside. He started walking his dog to my back driveway, letting the dog poop in the driveway while he sits on my back steps waiting for me to come outside and let my chickens out.

Since I knew he was watching me every time I stepped into the backyard, I started doing more yard work in the front and side yards to try to avoid him. Then he started circling the block in his car every day and stopping every time he sees me, gets out of his car and asks me for a hug. This happened all summer until I stopped going outside. At all. I had long since stopped answering his calls.

I confided in another neighbor that Bob is stalking me. He told me that Bob had made some lewd remarks about me to him. I'm in a relationship, but we don't live together and Bob had started acting jealous over my boyfriend... who I have been with for years. Apparently, Bob thought he was my boyfriend because I took him to the doctor.

After not going outside for months, I slowly started going into the backyard again. Cue the Jaws music... he's back. I can't step foot out of my house without him seeing, hearing or somehow sensing that I'm out there and I hear this low, ""Hey Carrie"" when I least expect it because he creeps up on me. It's jarring and unsettling.

I still feel that he's harmless, as in he isn't going to attack me physically and I think I could take him if he did. But I am so uncomfortable and creeped out by him and ignoring him doesn't work. I don't want to hurt him or be mean to him, even though in some ways he may deserve it. What would you do?",29Dec2018,1

My cousin is offering me a job at this tutoring place for little kids and thought this would be a great job, plus I love teaching little ones.

I’m just hesitant to take the job because I’m doing a lot of things in school right now and even more next year. I know for sure in junior year, I’m trying out for the volleyball varsity team. If I make it, I don’t know how I’m gonna balance my practices and games with my job. I really really want this job too. I’m still debating whether I want to stay on the softball team this year too. If I stay, that’s gonna add on during January-April. (If I really have to, I wouldn’t mind leaving softball)

I’m also planning to stay in clubs too.  Ahhh I want to do so many things. 

The actual school work and homework isn’t a big stress for me because I’ve learned to stay organized and figured things out my freshman and sophomore year. But everyone says I’m going to be stressed as a junior. I’m looking at colleges and I’m already getting worried.

It took him until the 4th date to really make a move and I’m still the one who had to kiss him. I really like him and he seems to be really into me too but he is pretty timid. 

He has talked about plans for the summer and expressed interest in going on a trip together. I also told him I’m planning on getting my own apartment to which he said he wanted to help decorate, like put some of his stuff in it, he said. Recently, he also started using pet names, like baby. For Christmas, he also offered to give me an old flatscreen for free. To me, this all indicates that he wants something more serious  and he knows I like him but we aren’t exclusive yet. 

However, he just went on a cruise to Mexico. When he first left, he was saying that he was going to miss me and was asking when he could see me next. Regardless, I was being insecure and annoying and checked tinder and saw that his location updated which prompted me to check it again later on which showed that it changed again. According to what I know, this means he’s opening and using the app. I’m obviously upset but I know we aren’t exclusive. 

Why would he be doing all of this, practically treating me like his girlfriend, if he didn’t want a relationship? Should I address this and essentially ask him to be exclusive? 

Thanks for any advice. 

Tl;Dr: I (18F) met this guy (20) on tinder 2 months ago. Practically treats me like his girlfriend. I want to be with him exclusively. Found out he’s still using tinder because his distance changed. Should I address being exclusive with him? ",29Dec2018,1

106,"The day before yesterday my sister stayed at her friend’s house for a night and came back a day later. This isn’t her first time staying over, in fact she’s done this for years since she and her friend are very close. Even her friend’s family come visit our house pretty often. We grew up in the same neighborhood and have known each other since I was two. Apologies for any ambiguity but I don’t want to give out too much personal details in case anyone I know finds this post.

Today she came to me crying and told me she was harassed by her friend’s dad while she was staying over. It happened when she was sitting down and was looking, texting or whatever at her phone and he approached her, grabbed her thighs, and looked down at her phone asking her what she was doing. My sister didn’t say what happened next but she tells me it made her feel uncomfortable. 

Now I’ve know her friends dad for over a decade, and I really don’t know if the intention was to creep up on her like a pervert. You see, people of my ethnicity have an annoying habit of picking their noses into other people’s business. They’ll peek at your phone or at your computer, or even ask to look at your text messages, your search history, especially if you have helicopter parents. 

Next she tells me this isn’t the first time he harassed her. Six years ago when she was eight, he made her sit on his lap and he touched her breasts. What’s strange is that she never told anyone this before and she says that she’s 75% sure it happened. I’m not denying her claims. I just feel very confused and shocked right now. How could someone I know and trusted for so long do this to my sister.

I should also mention that before she came to me she told my mother what happened, but my mother only scolded her and told her she should’ve sat somewhere else or whatever.

My heart is throbbing right now and I’ve been able to hold back tears. Part of me wants to help but can’t, and the other part wants to keep my sister safe without getting too involved in drama. Her friend’s family have been very close with ours for so long and I just don’t wish to deteriorate relationships.

108,"Okay so I called the ambulance on a friend who passed out after some heavy drinking. (We're both legal adults) He was unconscious and was taken to the hospital I assume. Everyone else is telling me I overreacted and that I may have crossed his boundaries. I'm afraid he'll be mad at me when he wakes up. But did I really overreact? This is the situation he was in:

-We were outside, at night, during winter and he was totally unconscious.

-I couldn't call his relatives or friends because his phone had a PIN.

-I couldn't have dragged him ANYWHERE. We were like 5 minutes away from any public space.

-I was also drunk as hell, there was no way I could've helped!

109," 

Hello,

I have a friend who I have talked to for many years, but whenever he talks to me he always leaves out so much information when he says things to me that I have to spend so much effort asking him questions to figure out what the hell he's talking about and it annoys me so much. I've brought it up to him and he still doesn't do anything about it. (I think he's just really dumb so he can't help it)

Examples:He randomly messaged me what's your address I'm going to stop by after work. So I ask him what do you mean? Why so suddenly, are you going to come right now or something and what for? He then replies ""it's near where we're going to eat."" I then have to assume he means it's near where we are going to eat when we go to KBBQ in 7 days, I'm assuming, but am unsure because he didn't specify crap and literally saying as little as possible whenever he messages. He then replies ""after next week, I'll stop by"". It's really frustrating to talk to him because he always does this no matter the situation.

Another example is when we play League of Legends (popular MOBA computer game for those who don't know) There are a lot of characters you can use and he's played for years so you'd think he would know the names of the characters, but he doesn't so when he talked to me he says ""the person who shoots arrows is op"" (overpowered). I have to ask him, ""who are you talking about?"" He doesn't know and I have to keep asking him questions because there are multiple characters that shoot arrows. I finally figure out he's talking about Varus. So I mention to him, ""oh yea he's pretty good, but Vayne(another marksman in the game) is more annoying to play against."" He then says ""who's vayne?"" So I have to spend even more effort explaining to him because he doesn't know the names of characters even though he's played for several years now. He doesn't make it a habit to remember the names of other people (unless they're super close friends) or characters in games.

TLDR I have to spend so much effort to have a normal conversation with him and it really annoys me.

Should I be annoyed with him or not because he is clearly not going to change the way he messages and talks. He's done it for years.

When I brought it up to him, he said I was making a big deal out of nothing and that made me even more pissed off because he doesn't see how difficult he's making things for me when we try to have conversations. What should I do to help resolve this because I get annoyed very often when talking to him? This only occurs when I talk to him. No other friend I have leaves out key details when we have conversations. It's really concerning because his way of speaking/messaging makes me not want to talk to him because of the amount of effort I need to put in to have a conversation. At the same time I don't want to just lose\* or avoid a friend because of his bad typing/speaking habits.",29Dec2018,1

Anyways, for context, I am 17 year old Male in high school. Socially, I'm in a semi decent spot. I am active in two friend circles, talk to a few ppl out of school and occasionally I'll hang out after school. I also have many friendly acquaintances. That being said, I only have one female friend and frankly, the thought of asking someone out or forming a bond with those of the opposite sex terrifies me. Not due to sexism, but I consider myself too inept to commit to a relationship of that nature. I'm not interesting, my looks are 6.5/10 at best and I get anxious really easily.

115,"I’ve been working as a cook for over 9 months now, and it was okay for a long time, but I hate it so much now.

I know some people just aren’t good at answering texts, and some people don’t treat texts as something that needs to be answered right away.

119,"So I should start this post off by giving some context. My bro (25)met a girl(30) off tinder who, at the time, lived with her abusive father and worked as a stripper. I guess the sex blew his mind because within a couple weeks she had moved into his house. That was about 10 months ago.
My brother informed me of her multiple sources of income (pornstar(girl on girl), stripper, cam girl, premium snapchats and “companionship” (but claims to not have sex with clients)). Now when he first told me about her, I’ll admit I was happy for him because I knew he was sort of a freak and it sounded like he was having a good time.

Flash forward to meeting her over thanksgiving week.

The couple came into my city on a greyhound, from which I picked them up to drive 5 hours to my parents’ place where we would spend the next few days.
From the moment I met her she was unpleasant, climbing into my car and not even looking at me or acknowledging me while I’m turned to her, saying hello with my hand extended to introduce myself.

I chalked it off as maybe she was nervous... I should have known better.
As it turns out this woman has no regards for any person besides herself.

As I spent more time with them, her openness to tell me about her life led me to find out really disconcerting things. I don’t know the right way to lay this out so I’m just gonna bullet the major points of concern.

-the first day we got to my parents she went to the strip club next door to ask for a job. Brother convinced her not to strip on thanksgiving break.
-she’s an avid satanist
-she has a toddler with her ex husband whom she hasn’t seen in years because she “hates him”
-she shot ex husband in the gut for cheating (my brother has seen the bullet wound)
-she used to be drug dealer with ex husband
-used to hang ppl over coyote pit in backyard if they owed her money
-told me she’s eaten human before (baby, claims it was from the Philippines)
-she is currently married to a guy in the army (married to dodge deployment, guy got deployed anyways)
-immediately got in a physical (and bloody) fist fight with brother because she saw a dm on Instagram saying “do I know you?”
-I have a LOT more instances of what makes this woman a despicable human being but for the sake of length I just need you guys to trust me on her nature.

So that was all found out over thanksgiving. Needless to say, my family is not a fan.

Now, shortly after thanksgiving, she proposed to my brother, who said yes. I only knew this bc she intensely messages my sister over Facebook and told her the news. My brother refused to share it though.

Then, over Christmas they stayed with my family at my aunt’s house.
She made my aunt cry multiple times saying she “doesn’t feel welcome” even though she had been starting arguments with everyone since she arrived.
She also told my aunt about all the sexual kinks (they’re FREAKY) they are into, to which my aunt drunkenly told my mom.
Finally, after a fight and a breakup, my brother informs me of her “mild personality disorder”. They got back together later that day and my brothers gf informed my parents of their engagement claiming “it doesn’t matter whether you like me or not because Brother and I are engaged”


Usually I would say “I’m not my brothers keeper” but I’ve witnessed his girlfriend dump him two times now (the most recent being Christmas). I’m afraid she’s warping his mind because he can’t see all of those red flags and I’m genuinely afraid if he tries to leave her she would try anything to make him stay or, if that didn’t work, take him down with her by hurting him or making false legal accusations.

Seriously considering kidnapping him while she’s stripping and moving his stuff out in the middle of the night. I have plenty of volunteers from friends family and coworkers.

I love my brother and want the best for him and I know he has to change within himself but I’m genuinely worried she’ll trap him with a baby or a mortgage. I’ve told him how I’ve felt and he seems very conflicted about the nature of their relationship, but I feel like those problems subside when they go home because she is the only one he deals with (he doesn’t have a lot of friends, none in the area he’s living currently) so she can hide the craziness.

120,"Hello everyone, over the past few years anxiety has quite honestly made parts of my life a living hell.

It sometimes ruins vacations and social gatherings when I’m too stressed about something entirely different to what I’m doing as I panic and have to cool down by myself.

I’ve dated this guy for a couple months and we stopped dating around August for no reason other than he got very busy because of a new job where he basically worked at night and slept in the day time and had almost no days off. I really loved this guy, and we had a real connection. He was not my dream guy in any way but I really fell for him - also because I recently moved to the US from another country. So he was my best friend too. It was really hard losing him because we didn’t break up over anything, he literally just got less time. The first month it was really hard on me and I was thinking about him every day. Then at the end of the month he reached out to me and apologized for not having time and he told me he missed me, we didn’t really talk that much after that and a couple times more he texted me about missing me and we hooked up once. In November he told me that he wants to be with me, but he doesn’t have the time for a relationship. I asked if all he wanted was sex because that was ok, and he said absolutely not and he wanted to be more than that. We both agreed on seeing each other casually after that. But after the agreement we didn’t really talk much because again he was working.. then a week or so after I texted him in the evening asking what he was doing and in the morning when I woke up I saw that he just opened the message.. it made me really mad so I deleted him on my social media (I know childish) and since then we haven’t talked. But I still can’t stop thinking about him, and I want to text him so bad but I really don’t know if I should. Our relationship never ever ended badly and I know he still wants me or at least wanted me a month or so ago.

127,"Hi everyone, hope that I'm not being a bother here. Just looking for some advice &amp; I figured that this would be the place to do it. I'll lay a foundation for my situation,dig into some of the options &amp; maybe you can weigh in? Feeling very stressed about my situation lately.   


So, I lost my job two months ago, I don't have a ton of experience as I've mostly worked temporary jobs &amp; for myself in the music world for the last few years. I have 90/120 college credits &amp; an associates degree in Liberal Arts. I would love to work for a nonprofit or progressive business that I could truly stand behind.   


Option one: Take a chunk of the money that I have left to spend &amp; buy a resume rewrite, I've posted on here but to no avail. I figure that if I find a good person to do this, maybe they can make me sound better than I am &amp; I'll be able to find something. If I did this I would run out of money very quickly &amp; would be f'd.   


Option two: I met with the dean of my department at the University. She suggested that I take out max loans &amp; finish my degree. I owe 15k right now &amp; if I did what she suggested I would have a BA with 40k in debt. The debt is very scary for me, even the 15k is an unfathomable amount of money for me. 40k seems out of this world. I understand that it's about your return on investment, but a lot of people say that they wish that they didn't have the debt &amp; I don't really have anyone to bail me out if it backfires.  


Option three: Join the military because they are always hiring, hate myself for it.   


Option four: Continue doing what I've been doing. Looking on Ziprecruiter, Monter, Indeed &amp; Craigslist every day and wait until something comes up. Stop being so picky. Learn to love myself.   


Option five: get off Reddit &amp; do something.

136,"Hi guys...I really could use some advice. 

I don't quite want to post on legal advice yet because I don't want it to get to that point. 

To start off, I accidentally cut my hand open and and had to receive 8 stitches at the ER. At the time my work had not offered me insurance, and since it was a work related injury, charged me double the usual rate. My employer offered to pay for everything and shamed me quite a bit for making such a stupid mistake. 

On my part, I could have been more careful. However, I work in a warehouse environment and honestly, worse could have happened. I had been trying to open a box that had come in and didn't realize it was a pull tab Fed ex box. I'd never seen one before, and was just going about opening it the same way I did with the other, with a box cutter. The box cutter slipped and I knew immediately I needed to be taken for stitches. 

After this, I've been patiently waiting for the bill to give to my employer. The bill end up being $3400 dollars (it's actually two separate bills 2k, 1.4k) and she was incredibly unhappy with me. She doesn't want to push it through a workers comp and has asked me to have it reduced. 

I called and tried but was redirected to taking g the steps to apply for assistance. I was then asked to lie and say I didn't get it at work that way the price would get reduced. I was further shamed for not handling this situation better. She kept reassuring me that she would pay for everything, but it made sure to make me know how much I was costing her for such a dumb mistake.

As I was leaving, I called again and tried to say I received it on break and therefore cannot get workers comp. After I did that, I received a text from my text from my employer telling me not to say anything yet and she would think on the situation. But at this point...I've already fucked myself over. 

I don't really know what to do at this point. I'm hoping she sticks to her word and helps me if I'm able to reduce the bill. But, I still fear that if I don't, I will lose my job in the near future if they are given a small enough reason. 

I'm just really freaking out and need some advice on this. ",29Dec2018,1

I’m a female working in an auto repair shop so it’s only me and another female who work there. Who knows how many other times he’s done this or will continue to do this... I understand I work with mostly all men but I still think this is inappropriate and I shouldn’t have to put up with it.

140,"**TLDR;** housemate never cleans or takes out the bins and refuses to help or move out. We have no way of talking besides through the landlord. The bins haven't been taken out in ages and has caused a swarm of fruit flies in the Kitchen which has gone to the rest of the house. Any advice about what to do?

&amp;#x200B;

I moved into a student house with 2 others and 1 person we didn’t know (X). The house started out with a lot of problems with the X being arrogant, unsociable, and ignorant with even the Landlord seeing this. The landlord asked X to move out about 3 months ago but X still hasn’t, now the landlord has given up trying to get him to move. During the time we’ve lived here X’s never cleaned the shower (after leaving what looks like soil all over the floor of it), never cleaned the stove after leaving burnt food over it, and has never changed the bins, all this despite telling us that cleanliness was the most important thing to him.

We never see X, but when we do it’s very briefly and nothing is said. We also have no way to message X as they refuse to use social media and removed themselves from the house group chat the landlord made. This means we have to go through the landlord to ask about things like cleaning, which is ridiculous.

Recently we had enough regarding the bins as X had not taken them out since moving in but still used them like everyone else. They got so bad that the kitchen got flooded with fruit flies so I left a note asking someone else to change the bins because we had done it since moving in. After a couple days they still weren’t done so we messaged the landlord asking him to ask X to take out the bins (again, ridiculous…). The reply he got was that X didn’t use the bins and that X “isn’t a slave”. We know that this is a lie as we’ve seen him use the bins and have seen fish heads in the bin when changing them last and X is the only one in the house to eat fresh fish. 

I went away for Christmas and X was the only one in the house, before leaving I didn’t have time to change the bins and now there’s a massive swarm of fruit flies everywhere, they’re even in the fridge. The other week I had to throw away food because of this. It’s horrible to do anything in the kitchen, let alone cook, and they’re all in the living room and bedrooms too. It’s so bad now that we’re worried they’d attract mice or rats.

I’m not sure what to do, not only is the house a hostile environment it’s now an unsanitary one. And yes, I can just change the bins, but we can’t live like this for another 8 months. We’ve tried talking to X ourselves but he doesn’t listen and it always ends going round in circles or ending with an argument. The landlord can see this and X’s stubbornness too and agrees that he should move out but isn’t doing anything about it anymore.

We’re all doing a Master’s so everything is very stressful atm without any of this going on, and moving to another house doesn’t seem possible. It's all extremely infuriating and is not only making a horrible living environment socially, but now physically too.

Any advice about what to do?

147,"So my ears have always been sensitive to metals. I can't do gold or nickel or generally anything except sterling silver. Well on my birthday last month I had new holes put in, a third pair on my earlobe, and one in the top cartilage part of my right ear. The woman that pierced my ears said the metal was white gold, which she claimed was just as good for my ears as sterling silver. Well along with the daily upkeep of cleaning them, they've swelled up recently, with puss and soreness, in the third hole pair. I took the earrings out for a couple days and kept cleaning, and the swelling went down. Back to normal. So I put the earrings back in. Well last night I felt itchy in my other piercing, the cartilage one. I reached up to scratch, and felt... A pimple of sorts. When I scratched it, it popped, and I saw blood on my fingers. It didn't hurt at all. So after work (where it popped and bled) I came home, showered, and took the earring out. My ear was swelled horribly. It was bloody and swollen inside, kind of hard when pressed on, and leaking fluid. The outer side, on the back, was raised in what I can only describe as a cone shape, and honestly looked like a literal blood pimple. I pressed on it, got some fluid out, cleaned the hell out of the earring and the hole, and reinserted the earring. So far there's not much swelling today, and no itchiness or pain, but I'm very worried. Is this a reaction to the white gold? Or the new piercings? Or both? I didn't have problems with my second hole pair, but that was because I stuck with sterling silver.

154,"Hi, using a throwaway account. For the past year (that I've known), my dad has been using/sending money to random people and is very possibly being scammed. To talk about the latest issue, he has been sending $200 a few times through Moneygram to someone in Jamaica, saying he'll get $1000 back for each $200. He didn't tell anyone about it, my mom only found out when she found the receipts. 

Due to past, related events, she is beyond pissed and her blood pressure from stress has risen so much that she has to take medication. When she confronted him about it, he first denied it even through she showed him the receipts. He then goes upstairs after hearing it all. Then when he comes downstairs later, he tries to say that it's completely legal, not a scam, and should be receiving the money in ""U.S mail"" by the end of this month. He went again today, telling me he's going to CVS (where he sent the Moneygram) and that he's also going grocery shopping. 2 hours later, he didn't come back with any groceries. 

Unrelated but still a problem is that he uses Messenger and Facebook on his phone or tablet to talk to possibly fake ""beautiful women"".

159,"So me and this guy have been talking for about 8 months now off and on. We have seen each other twice, each time he couldn't make me orgasm no matter what. We have had some really bad fights, leading him to say that he has had better sex with other women. We are not in a relationship, but talk somewhat frequently. After the first break, he suggested we just send pics and videos to each other, this caused us to meet a second time. He would send like 1 or 2 a week, while I would spam him sometimes.....he got frustrated. 
After that, he called it quits since he said there is no compatibility. We didn't talk for awhile, but then started the pics and videos thing again....except this time he seemed more into it. He would constantly spam me and seem more into just talking sometime. I have offered to have casual hook ups, but if I mention to him that I'm stressed or worried that week he would not even try to contact me no matter how horny he is. He usually just tells me about it after and how he wanted to but remembered I'm stressed or something. He still says he enjoys looking at me naked and thinks I'm attractive and make him horny, but he doesn't want to meet again. If we might meet, he says he doesn't want to have sex, he just wants to have me pleasure myself while he watches. We were having a conversation once he said to remember that out of all the girls that he has met, and all the potential girls, that he still picks to talk to me, so I shouldn't worry about him thinking I'm not attractive or wants something better. In a different conversation, be said that we don't have a relationship and probably never would. 

So my question is, what is the point of this. Like why keep me around if he doesn't want to sleep with me and doesn't want a relationship.

161,"My brother just visited the parents for Christmas. Somehow an argument got started, which turned into my dad screaming and berating him for the next four days. Some of the complaints:

* He called my brother a drug addict, because he was smoking pot in college. I actually did too but never heard anything about it -- unfortunately it's been common for my brother to get blamed for something we both did.
* He generally accused my brother of destroying the family. From my point of view the family isn't destroyed and everyone gets along well with both of them, except of course each other.
* He said my brother crashed the car the same day he was allowed to drive it and crippled the family finances. While my brother is far from blameless, the actual crash happened months into driving it when it wasn't in great condition. And it happened 10 years ago.
* He was ranting about how my brother is off starting his own company while he (Dad) is broke and on food stamps. The fact that my brother is working his ass off for his new company while Dad is unemployed, plus the hypocrisy of my dad starting companies his whole life, strikes me as incredibly bizarre.

The story of my dad's life is worth telling for some context. Shortly after my parents immigrated to the US he a very successful company around 1985. He made 2-3 million dollars over the next several years after which the business dried up. Over the next 5 years he tried to start a new business and put half a million dollars into it, but it never got off the ground. During my teenage years the parents were sort of treading water with their finances, and everything sort of collapsed from the combination of the 2008 crash and our college expenses (the parents paid about 2/3 for each of us.) To his credit he volunteered to pretty much take on all the debt for himself when he and my mom got separated. His finances have gone off a cliff, and together with the stress of two court cases he has been on antidepressants and suicidal.

When we were growing up my dad was really authoritarian and would explode whenever someone tried to talk back to him. My way of dealing with this has been to just kind of listen and let it pass. My brother was more assertive, calling my dad out when he accused him of something untrue. This led to bitter arguments. On the flip side my dad was really committed to helping whenever he could -- for example calling everyone he knew to help me get a job, working with doctors whenever anyone in the family had medical issues, or as I said before volunteering to take all the marital debt for himself. My brother believes he didn't receive much of this goodwill for whatever reason, and I may have to agree.

Yesterday my brother called me, somewhat sad but level-headed, to tell me the story of the Christmas visit. He said he's been trying to shrug off the bullying for the past 15 years. Most of the time my dad apologizes, but the next time the arguments just go back to the same issues. He told me that he never really considered my dad as a father figure and always went to other people when seeking out life advice. So he's saying it may be time to stop having contact altogether. My mom called me today and told me a similar story, saying the original argument was mutual but that my dad was to blame for the escalation. She was really emotional and upset at how my brother had been treated all these years.

To be fair I haven't heard my dad's side of the story, and that might change things. But this is believable to me, as it's a dramatic version of what I've seen for 15 years. My gut reaction has been to take my brother's side, but I want to take some time to mull it over and ask for advice.

I guess some of my options are to: confront my dad; support my brother in cutting off contact; try to mediate some sort of compromise; seek medical help for my dad as it may be depression-related. What do you think I should do?",29Dec2018,1

Tonight my family and i had a big discussion about marijuana, and I told them my stand on the matter, and that I thought it should be legal. One thing let to another and I had to ""defend"" my  stance on the matter. Well everyone went to bed now, but it was pretty clear that they all think I am a big stoner, but I have never smoked before.

 I just think it should be legal. I am meeting them tomorrow as well, and are wondering what I should do. Should I tell them I don't smoke, or should I try let it be?

166,"Current gf and I have been together for 1 year and she's the absolute best thing to ever happen to me. The day we matched on Bumble I told her she was special, she was the only one I was talking to/interested in, and if she wanted to meet up, I was totally on board and would drop what I'm doing to meet her in a heartbeat. I was absolutely mesmerized by this angel and I let her know it from Day 1. We met and it was magical. Since that day, every weekend, I drive 2 hours there and 2 hours back to see her and get a hotel to be with her (we're long distance) and hope to propose within the year. She's worth it all this and way more.  


Fast forward, we've been dating for a year and it is so much happier and healthier than any of my prior relationships (the few I've been in). A month ago, I  applied for a job out closer to her and in anticipation of an interview follow up email we were stoked about, we've been checking my emails frantically (we have an open phone policy). At one point she  googled some keywords to see if maybe it'd gone to junk/spam and while searching stumbled across an email I  sent to an ex (girl he dated right my current gf) the day right after we matched on Bumble. The message read: ""I miss you and think of you every single day. I love you with all my heart. My heart belongs to you. I hope you and the kids are doing great. I truly miss you all. I love you.""   


My gf was devastated and said this changed her perception of all our  foundation and she didn't know how to handle it. She explained she was confused and didn't know how I could say from Day 1 I wanted her and only her, meanwhile in the background saying all these emotional things to my ex. She said she believes herself to be the backup plan, and that I'm with her only because I couldn't convince my ex to work things out.   


Before I get to my reply, I should give some background:  
*I was married before to my first real gf. After some time, we discovered she had Lyme disease and I dedicated my life to healing her - went to nursing school for it and everything. We divorced when I discovered I was being cheated on. We did not have intercourse once through the marriage (though we had before) so to discover the minute she was ""in the mood"" was for her mom's pool boy killed me. I gained over 100 lbs due to stress. We divorce, I move, I get back on my feet again and lose the weight, and some time later start dating someone for a couple months, then poof - girl 2 disappears. Some background from that relationship:*   


*Girl 2 wanted to marry and for me to move in with her and her 3 kids right away while she was moving her prior boyfriend out (her neighbor said she was like Baskin Robbins with a new flavor every week). I thought this was a little forward, but considering what a fail my prior marriage was and desperation to feel loved and wanted, I figured this must be how a ""good relationship"" is. So I get a job lined up (we were over an hourish drive apart so I relocated)  and slowly start moving my stuff in.* 

*The week before I move in, she suddenly starts picking fights over the pettiest things. The day I'm due to move in, she starts saying we should see less of each other, maybe every other weekend. So with me due to move in, I start questioning what's changed? She then breaks things off altogether. I kept contacting her asking what happened? How'd this go from 100 to zero suddenly overnight? I then get a call from a detective from the police dept telling me she has requested I no longer contact her and if I do,, a restraining order will be filed. This came totally out of left field with zero explanation from her.*   
*I speculate she was on a ""break"" with the previous guy she was in the process of 'moving out'  (who never knew her dating me - she hid it saying I was just a coworker and never introduced us, saying she wanted to keep the peace), re-made up with him, and wanted to avoid the confrontation of having to explain/be the bad guy.*   


So I explained to my current gf, ""At the time of this breakup with Girl 2, I was insanely desperate to learn what happened - how did my second relationship in a row fail? What was wrong with me? Where did I go wrong? I MUST do what I can to figure this out.""  


My gf said ""Why not ask that instead of telling her you love her then?""   
I said, ""Remember? I tried that already and she had the cops call me. If I did that again she'd have me arrested."" I explained maybe if I sent an email tugging at her heartstrings, maybe that would prompt her to reply SOMEthing that would clue in on why she ended things (met someone else, I wasn't fit/rich/etc enough, etc.).  


My gf is still having a hard time grasping all this and I'm wondering if anyone has any constructive insight on this? Or been in a similar situation and have advice? I love her more than anything and want to being her clarity so we can move forward.  
TL;DR I messaged my ex the day after matching on Bumble with my current GF (before meeting officially). Current gf now feels like the backup plan.",29Dec2018,1

But I can't do anything about it.

180,"We met about a year ago and we bonded pretty fast as friends, I've always been shy and aloof and thus I never had many friends, so it was pretty great to meet someone like her. I'll admit that at the age of 25 I felt pretty bad for never having had a serious relationship and I forced things to start being official with her faster than it should've been. I really liked her but I think I wanted to have a relationship for the sake of having this experience more than because our relationship was organically growing and would've reached this point some time anyway. 

I'll also admit that I'm pretty immature, I'm an only child and my parents are the people who are closest to me, so I never had to put someone else's feelings above mine. And only after I've met my SO I started to realize how codependent my relationship with my parents (specially my mother) is. My parents always fought a lot, and specially in my teenage years I also fought a lot with them. But we developed this dynamic that when one of us is angry at something or someone this person will explode and fight with whoever is closer, then when things are calmer we just resume our normal activities, must of the times without even apologizing to each other, like nothing happened. I know it sounds crazy but I'm used to it. Our family fights are about winning the discussion and not actually solving any problems. It sucks but I never saw this as something so wrong. 

But the problem is that I'm acting the same way with my SO and she obviously gets so much more hurt than I'm used to. And I there were times that I recognized my mistakes but turned this into something that she was the one who had to comfort me for being such a bad person. I'm also very passive aggressive and this hurts her very much. After a year of this she's almost breaking up with me. She actually said she's giving me one last chance for the second time. 

I'm aware of all my flaws and I'm trying to be better. I'm not here looking for sympathy, I just want to know how other people have dealt with this moment of finding out their flaws and dealing with them in a mature way. 

I'm also very emotionally dependent on my mother, and I'm trying to let go but I have absolutely nothing right now in life that is going ok. Im almost failing my Master's and I have absolutely no plans for my life, no ambitions, if everything goes wrong I know I have my parents to support me emotionally and financially. I plan on starting therapy next week but I'd really appreciate any advice or anyone sharing their experiences. ",29Dec2018,1
182,"A little bit of backstory here: I've been living with this roommate for about 13 years. Five or so years ago, he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, and has experienced pretty severe neuropathy in his foot ever since. We're talking at least 2-3 times a day, he'd openly yelp in pain. He's also had a bad wound in his right foot for a number of years that never healed. Recently the wound got infected, and as a result he had to have a PICC line put in to try to treat the infection with antibiotics. He also had a heart attack this past spring.

Fast forward to about a month ago. I wasn't there when it happened, but my roommate spontaneously broke a bone in his heel. He was put in a cast and told to stay off his feet. Sadly, he didn't follow those orders, and as a result he aggravated the break over Christmas. As I drove him to the hospital, he relayed to me that his biggest fear is that he might lose his foot.

I visited him at the hospital, and talked to the doctor about what's happened. He gave me even worse news - thanks to the infection that was already in his foot at the time of the break, plus the neuropathy, he might end up losing his entire right *leg.*

Needless to say we're both devastated to hear this. I don't want him to lost his leg, but it's looking more likely than not that this is the road we're going to have to go down. My roommate will be the first to admit that he didn't take his health matters as seriously as he should have, but he had recently joined Weight Watchers and was losing weight at a steady clip until the break happened, and this just seems like a sucker punch. There's a part of me that wants to look on the bright side of this and think that maybe he won't have to deal with the neuropathy anymore, but I don't even know if that's true, and I don't know what to expect with regards to getting a prosthesis - if he even qualifies for one.

I'm totally lost here. I don't know if anyone here has been in a similar situation, but I could definitely use some advice on how to tackle all this, and what I can do to support him right now.",29Dec2018,1

She is kind of a shy introvert (just like myself) but she’s very nice and kind to everyone. Not to mention very pretty.

Hell I don’t even know if I should try. For starters, I don’t have her contact info although we do follow each on instagram and snapchat. I don’t think DM’ing her on both of those apps is a good idea, plus i’m putting a hiatus on social media rn for personal reasons. Plus she’s friends with this other girl i had a mega crush on with whom i used to be friends with until we had our fallout. I still have some unresolved issues with this other girl but that’s a different story. I also remember this other girl told me that she even tried to ask out this girl’s (the one i’m trying to ask out) ex boyfriend out too. So even if we do go out i’m afraid the other girl (the one i used to like) might see it as me getting back at her for rejecting me and it could cause some unneeded drama. Another reason is because i’m just simply afraid she might reject me. It’s like i can picture us together but at the same time i feel like she’s out of my league. I get the feeling that me and her might be into the same stuff but i also feel like i wouldnt be her type. What should i do? Should i try to reach out to her? Am i thinking way too much into this?

My friend, M, is one of my better friends, I guess. We have every class together except for one, so we are stuck together all day. And, I don’t mind hanging out with her. But, her personality has started to get on my nerves. I realize that sounds really mean, but hear me out: she always tries to one- up me. (Me: “I love hiking. I do it often with my dad and brothe-“ M cuts me off: “I’ve done that since I was nine. There is nothing like climbing trees and exploring nature. Sometimes, I get close to bear’s dens just to see if they’ll chase me!” Uh, ok then)
  And, she also has a temper. Now, I think this might just be me being biased as a person who hates conflict, but she’s always threatening to punch or hurt someone who does something she deems “unacceptable”. For example, recently our other friend got caught up in some drama and she made a huge deal about it. She actually bared her teeth and said “I wanna punch her teeth in! She MAKES ME SO MAD!” And I admit, it scared the crap out of me. 
  Right now, we are on break. We have a group chat with the rest of our friends and stuff. M doesn’t offer much conversation, but sometimes she chimes in with curt responses. Thats fine.

196,"So I am 32, live in a relatively small (3 bed/2 bath) rental home with my fiance (getting married Jan 22) &amp; our pets (dog &amp; 2 cats). About 6 months my little sister (27) &amp; her husband (27) were having financial trouble, there rent was close to $900 for a small one bed &amp; they both work pretty low paying retail jobs. I offered to let them stay in our guest bed for a nominal rent amount &amp; they accepted. Initially this was working well, they have a dog but he's older &amp; generally just wants to stay in bed with a toy. Then my sister tells me she is moving in with our dad.

A little backstory here - She is my half-sister, we share a father who was in &amp; out of our lives but even as a child I was extremely diligent in making sure I got to see my siblings, with or without him. I arranged sleep overs &amp; always attended anything important they did, like soccer or piano. Maybe it's a bit of guilt because my dad hurt me &amp; I always wanted them to know that their big sister loved them unconditionally. But we have been extremely close, though I am close with my family, she is not so I am really all she has. Also this is the second time they have lived with me, after he left the Army they lived in my house for about a year - rent free - while they settled back in.

Anyway, she moves in with our father &amp; both her &amp; her husband quit their jobs to ""look for new ones"" in my dad's city 2 hours away. After about 2 months she tells me it's not working at our fathers (obvious reasons including our step-mother not really wanting them there, being in a small town &amp; her reclusive nature) &amp; asks if she can move back to our place. While it has been an extremely difficult time in my life, about to get married while my fiance's mother throws a massive fit (I am not worthy) &amp; a new job, I suffering from chronic migraines &amp; we are trying to buy our first home ... It's a lot, but again I want her to know I am here for her always.

They moved back in &amp; this time brought another dog. Their older dog is now having bladder control issues &amp; despite me having offered to pay for him to see a vet, they have yet to take him. My whole house smells like musty dog pee. Then there's the new dog, a year old stray who only has shots because I took her, she's a wild animal completely devoid of any training. They keep her kenneled in the living room where she barks &amp; cries constantly or when they let her out she harrasses my pets, including biting my pitbull enough to make him bleed. It's unfair to the dogs honestly &amp; I try to help but I do not have the energy or patience for a puppy right now.

Today my fiance spent his day off driving my BIL all around Dallas after he got a flat tire &amp; then he asked my fiance to pay (which he did) &amp; said he'd pay us back. They always do pay us back but it's really inconvenient &amp; expensive. Generally they cannot even pay the full amount for rent and split it up, fine okay but I also see how much they spend on useless shit like each having an Xbox &amp; having multiple TV's or new phones &amp; fast food everyday. I should also mention that my fiance supports us both, my job is new &amp; so far I haven't gotten paid.

So how do I get her to move out without seeming like a total bitch who invited her here &amp; then went back on her word? I do care that they are financially unstable but they put themselves in that position by constantly changing jobs, staying in retail, and generally being immature with financial decisions.

TLDR; How can I ask my immature sister to move out while still being sensitive to her financial situation?

He wants me to go to a party with him tonight. H  hates going to stuff without me. Even though I don't know anyone there and no one will be conversational in English.

 He is a really sweet and understanding person, so he wouldn't be upset if I told him I don't want to go. But when we talked about it today (well yesterday now) I could see that he would be disappointed.

I try to make an effort to speak their language, the pathetic amount I know, but every time I get extremely anxious and feel a panic attack coming on. So yesterday I just sat there, blanking out trying to ignore my migraine, this newfound crippling anxiety, and my homesickness.

I need a chill pill but I just constantly feel this, ""what the fuck is going on"" feeling. I'm paranoid about whether I'm following cultural standards or if I'm too quiet.

I ask my SO if he can interpret for me since he's bilingual, but usually he says ""Ask them in English"" or encourages me to try to speak in their language. But I get so nervous because I am not used to being bad at a language. But when I try his suggestions it doesn't always go well, and I feel sick to my stomach. I don't understand what's happening to me.

TL;DR
I don't want go to a party with my s.o where I'll have a really bad language barrier that gives me really intense anxiety.

Why am I feeling so anxious and lonely? How can I make this situation less shitty? Thanks!

198,"Alright, so I have been dating my girlfriend for a bit and it always seemed like her parents liked me and then today came along and I can tell her mother hates me. My attitude around most people is pretty asshole like, but sarcastic and sometimes funny (in a mean way). So I guess making jokes that poke fun at my girlfriend or anyone in general makes her mother really mad. So today while my girlfriend went into surgery, her mother decided she wanted to have a chat with me. Im going to just say some of the things she told me.

""You better not be using my daughter for sex or to get out of your own house."" Im not i actually really love this girl.

""If you are not serious about her just break up with her"" this was said at least 5 times. (as i stated im madly in love with her and im never leaving her)

""Since you came along she has been changing"" i honestly didnt see her change at all, but i guess im doing something wrong

""She bought a gaurder belt and you have to do with it somehow"" (I didnt know she bought it and she told me she bought it for the school dances, to wear with thigh highs)

""All kids your age just want one thing""

""You don't realize how good you have it, she is so special""

""She is very naive and I feel that you can abuse that to use to your own control"" which I have never pressured her into doing anything, if we ever decided we were goinf to do something I would ask a million and one times, if she felt nervous about it we wouldnt, and if she didnt really like it or anything while we were doing it I would stop.

Then on top of it she threatened that if I ever told her daughter about this then ill never be allowed to date her again. I dont know what to do. Ive just been super depressed and anxious ever since this happened. Ive cried on multiple occassions (which is abnormal for me). I just need some help so please help me. I just dont know what ive done wrong.",29Dec2018,1

200,There's this girl I've been talking to for the past two months. We've both been dumped by our partners and so we got on really well from the beginning. We are from different countries and met online. I don't know how it happened but I started liking her which is something I didn't acknowledge before because I thought it was just because of being dumped that had created a stupid crush in my mind. The feeling didn't subside at all and instead remained so I confessed what I feel for her a few days ago. She clearly replied with the statement that she feels nothing else than a friendship with me. To which I said I have no problems with that and that I just wanted her to know how I feel about her. She thanked me for being honest and we still talk like we used to as friends. Well she still keeps sending me pictures of herself without me ever asking for them. I mean I have had female friends before none of them sent me pictures of themselves after dressing up and putting on a lot of makeup that too without asking.

201,"I use reddit mostly for a personal log but if it helps someone else or someone can provide input then that’s great. 

After a three year friendship, I think i’ve lost my best friend. Myself (16M) has called (let’s use “Jane” 16F) Jane my best friend for three years and have grown extremely close with them. Last school year we became best friends and spent so much time together. We’ve told eachother everything. If we had an issue, we came to eachother before anyone else. If we were bored, we’d hangout with eachother before anyone else.

The school-year came to an end and I became flooded with things to do over summer, I didn’t have much time to dedicate to Jane and we didn’t talk much. We saw eachother maybe once or twice towards the end of summer but that was it. She was active on social media and I got plenty of updates of her hanging out with people. 

What was strange to me is that the people she was hanging out with were people that her and I knew as awful people. Bad influences, heavy drinkers, partiers, homophobes (i’m bisexual). Her and I spent the entire previous school year talking about how awful of people these guys were, and might I mention, they were all guys. It annoyed me as I felt betrayed but I moved on and hoped for another great school year with her.

School rolled around and we once again became close, it was just as good as last year, if not better. We hadn’t seen eachother in a while and it was amazing to become so close again. But something changed. When she had an issue or needed love/support, she came to me before anyone else. but when it came to hanging out, it seemed like I was the last person she’d come to to hangout with. 

I told her how I felt and she seemed hurt, she explained that it was coming from no where and that she didn’t see this issue herself, she was sorry I felt that way but in essence, said she doesn’t think that’s the case. I believe her and pushed it under the rug. That was probably the worst decision i’ve made.

The following months included Jane walking all over me, bottling up my feelings until I couldn’t take anymore and argued with her. My anxiety/stress/depression have been at an all time high and i’ve recently been attending therapy. 

This has been an ongoing issue for the past few months and tonight I sent her a very detailed message in which I explained what makes me upset and that i’m done arguing and letter her walk all over me.

I feel like at this point I wouldn’t mind throwing this friendship away. 

Do I expect too much? Do I continue this friendship? Do I give it time? I’m at a loss reddit. ",29Dec2018,1
202,"I don't know how to properly introduce my situation, but, lately I've been thinking about it a lot, because I did a quick research 

1) I'm really averse to human touch, to the point where it's difficult for me to even greet anyone in a way different than a handshake, even though it's really common in my culture to do so with hugs and kisses, also, any kind of social interaction can be tough

2) If something truly interests me, I create a certain obsession with it until I feel like ""it's enough""

So A asked me out in the very beginning of November. And at the time I didn't k ow D liked me because I thought he liked H.  And D has just gotten out of a bad real action ship with my best friend G (g's not important). 

But then he texted me talking so much shit about A and I thought they were best friends, and I had honestly thought me and D had become pretty close. And then A was upset and I was upset and D was texting all my friends talking shit. And my friend L (also not important) took my whine and started text prancing D and he thought she was serious. 

And it gets worse because H started telling all three of us lies about each other which made them whole situation worse than it already was.  And telling people a bunch of shot that makes me sound like a hoe. But none of it happened and now whenever I ask people the story's have the same like bf of thing (I don't know how to explain it but there like about the same thing) and they all have different details. 

Btw me and H got into a HIGE fight last year because she did shit like this. I don't want to start shit like that again but I want to try and ""fix"" her or cut her off, because I don't want more toxic people. So I need advice on that too. 

I just recently brought up what happened with H to D and he said he agreed and that she was acting sketchy and that also that he doesn't hate me which I am happy about. 

But not he doesn't even look at me and avoids me at school. And when I talk to him he gives semi scared and concerned look. But I just wish things were normal again and that we were all friends. 

I know A is sad about it but he said that if D is going to be toxic then he should be friends. And he texted D about that and he talked shot right to his face and said that he doesn't want to be friends anyway. But they were friends before I came along. 

Now I feel like it's all my fault and that I broke them up and that deep down they know it. And it doesn't help that I'm bipolar and the worst thoughts possible come to mind, but I don't know what to do AT ALL. If you have any advice, ANYTHING I want to hear it. Please I'm desperate.

208,"My brother has always been a recluse, has had no friends for years and just a loner who plays games and computer 24/7. Most days he's out of room for probably a total of an hour or two. A few months ago, he decided he wanted to amplify his escapism and turned to drugs.

I first smelled pot a few months ago, actually thought it was neighbors. You need to understand, my brother is not the type you would ever expect to try drugs. A couple months ago he disappeared, walked out of the house in the early morning after trying something powerful. He got put into a nearby mental hospital for several days.

We found LSD and some other drug paraphernalia in his room but I don't know what else he had, don't want to know. Needless to say I'm been shocked by it. I don't even know who he is anymore or what could drive him to this. He betrayed our whole family, and most of the extended relatives don't know the truth of it.

On Christmas, he disappeared all morning and walked inside as if it was normal. During dinner, he had red eyes, seemed to be crying, and was acting shifty in general and saying weird shit. On the way home he stopped to look at stars randomly (obsessively even) and it one of the weirdest things I've witnessed him do.

I'm scared about the path he's on. I care less about the drugs and more about him not having anybody knowledgeable to help him be safe, besides internet strangers telling him what to do. I know nothing about this topic and it's scary for me and my parents, who it has shocked the most. He has a very weak relationship with the family and avoids us most of the time.

Im 22(m) living part time (school breaks and weekends) with my mom. Im a senior in college, 1 more semester and then im saving up and leaving the state I live in. 

I recently rekindled our relationship after having not spoken with her for around 8 years (long painful story). 

Im an uber driver, and my college is out in the country, so my mom offered to let me stay at her place in the spare room so that I can work in the big city. 

So here’s the issue. My mom literally still treats me like I’m 12 years old. She is CONSTANTLY patronizing me to the point that its driving me crazy. 

When I raise the problem, she gets extremely upset with me, saying things like “you live under my roof” but its like.. do you realize im an adult? Its a little silly. I have only been working to rebuild our relationship over the past year, so i thought that living with her would be okay, since now we’re both adults, but it feels like im living with a complete asshole. I know that “i’ll always be her baby” or whatever but cmon. 

On top of this, she is on her phone literally all of the time. I’ll be trying to have a conversation with her, and she won’t even respond, and when she does she’ll say something patronizing. She is a really bad listener, and she’ll give advice to literally everything i say.. its like hey i wasn’t asking you for advice wtf? Im just trying to have a conversation. 

I really don’t know what to do here, because it is extremely convenient to be able to have a house where I work so i don’t have to sleep in my car. also, its not like she’s a terrible person or anything, and we do have love for each other.

She's affected by everything just way more than your average kid and we try to keep her as healthy as possible because when she's sick it's just so incredibly hard on her, and us, and we have other children who need our attention as well.

So anyway, we were out to dinner earlier this evening at a nice family restaurant. Our toddler (who is two) was in a high chair at one end of the table. A woman and another toddler came walking by and at one glance I could tell this kid was miserably sick. Whining, green snot caked under his nose, wet, painful sounding cough. My initial thought was ""gee, poor baby, why would you make him come out in the cold in that kind of shape?"" And then she stops next to our toddler's high chair and pulls him over and starts telling him to talk to/play with her. Not ""say hello"" but ""oh look, another baby. Here you go, play with her!"" He looked so blatantly miserable that our toddler instinctively backed away but the mother was pushing him forward, goading him to ""give her a high five! Give her a fist bump!"" I wanted to tell her to get her sick kid the hell away from mine, but I hesitated because I work in politics and it crossed my mind that this woman might recognize me and go around raving about how rude I am. I also just didn't want to scare her kid or anything like that but I had no idea how to approach it. Luckily, she backed off after my toddler whined and asked my wife to pick her up, and we proceeded to disinfect the high chair with wipes before sitting her back down again.

First of all, what kind of monster takes their miserably sick toddler and forces him to go out in the nearly freezing weather and be in public when he's obviously feeling terrible. And who not only does that, but tries to convince her wicked violently ill kid to touch another baby who makes it clear they want nothing to do with the sick kid? Afterward we could hear the poor thing crying and sniffling and choking from a couple tables over and our toddler kept mentioning it because she was distraught just from seeing how he looked and acted.

If she catches this, whatever it was (I'm going to take a wild guess and say the flu), we are looking at it almost definitely rampaging through our entire household, traumatizing our toddler, possibly leading to an infection/pneumonia (her pediatrician said it's rampant this season), causing missed work for me and missed school for our older kids, one of whom has asthma and it could put her in danger... Why? Why would someone do this? I wish I didn't have to depend on the public for my livelihood at this moment because I would have stood up and shouted, ""TAKE THAT POOR CHILD HOME AND STOP SPREADING SICKNESS ALL OVER THIS RESTAURANT!""

&gt;  
&gt;Roommate: How are you SilentSamurai?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Pretty swell. I'm pumped to have a clean bowl for dinner in 45 minutes. How about you?

&gt;  
&gt;Me: Uh...... let's agree to disagree on that one.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Roommate: Whatever. 

  
**Background:** Prior to moving into this apartment, my roommates kept saying their number 1 peeve was dirty dishes. ""Neat! They'll be clean assholes and I'll be seen as the lazy slob."" I thought. A couple months later I found out my standard to do a load of dishes per week for 3 roommates has seemed ""excessive"" for them. (We run out of bowls and glasses by Day 6 usually).  


They are big fans of handwashing dishes. ""Ok, whatever"" I initially thought. Only later did I find out the commonly shared standard of that was to lightly rinse out with only water the pan/dish/fork you were using and put it back in the cupboard. I have now ran into multiple instances where I pull out something I need only to dried chunks of food on it.  


So I have a couple questions yall.

1. Am I overreacting?
2. Why the hell would someone get angry about using the dishwasher? Am I missing something?
3. How do I nicely convince my roommates that using the dishwasher is 100 fucking times easier and more sanitary than their poor excuse of ""handwashing""?",29Dec2018,1

I said that we had already agreed to Skype tomorrow, forgetting that previous comment.

I moved to her school about 2 and a half years ago. I became best friends with this guy (let's call him Nick) who really didn't have any other friends besides Rose. Eventually Nick and I both became good friends with another guy, who happened to have a twin sister who was one of Rose's best friends. Rose also has two other friends, the twin and another chick  who Nick started dating. The six of us have a great friend group, and we celebrated every holiday at Rose's place. I thought *Screw it, I like her, and Nick and one of her best friends are dating, I'll ask her out to a movie.* So I asked her to a movie. She said she would love to go. 

This was really the only alone time we had ever had. We had good conversation. I was getting good vibes so I even wrapped my arm around her with about 30 minutes left in the movie. She brought me in closer and rubbed my hand, even. 
I texted her that night that I had fun and she told me she did too and we both agreed that we'd like to do something else again. 

We go back to school and go back to acting like how we were before. So I ask her to go Christmas shopping the next weekend; she's busy. We make arrangements to go Christmas shopping the following weekend; she gets sick. By the next weekend Christmas is already too close. Eventually, after Christmas I ask if she'd want to just grab a bite to eat at a certain restaurant. She accepts with exclamation marks. 

So today I took her there and on the car ride back there was a bit of a pause in conversation. I took it as a chance to say, as close as word for word as I could remeber: 

""So Rose?"" 

*Yeah?*

""Feel free to shoot me down here, but I like you"" 

*Uhm*

`pause, she takes out her phone`

""It's okay, I'll give you some time.""

`long pause`

*You're a really great friend, but I'm not looking for that right now. I still really value you as a friend, though.*

""Ah, okay. Sorry for springing that upon you like that."" 

*No, it's okay. I know it takes a lot of courage for you to say that, and I respect that. Are you going to the New Year's Party, then?* (she asked that hopefully) 

""Yeah of course!"" 

`long pause and I laugh nervously`

""Well, this is awkward"" 

*I kinda just like to chill during a car ride*

`long pause and she brings up random conversation about a play we're both in and another pause`

""So... Do you like anybody, then?"" 

*No, I'm just not looking for anything. Im focusing on school and applying for all of these colleges, you know?*(She has been going on a lot of visits lately) 

""Yup.""

`She starts talking about more random stuff while I pull into her drive`

*Thanks! I had a lot of fun.*

""Bye.""

So I mean it was a pretty warm first rejection for me. I do want to stay friends with her, too because if I don't then idk what will happen to our friend group. I must have read something wrong? Why would she bring me closer in the movie and smile and wave at me in the halls? I must have misinterpreted something. How should I salvage this friendship?

When I would talk to some of them about it, they would avoid the blame and act like there was nothing wrong with it and try to say that they ""cared"" about me but didn't put in the same effort into the friendship as I did.

My aunt and uncle stopped by my house to give me a graduation present and, against my better judgment, blew them off to not have her mad at me. That was the last time I saw them. 



In 2015, my dad was quickly dying of alzheimers in a nursing home. I felt like I 100% needed to call and tell them, but I only got a few words in and was hearing sobbing in the background before my brother realized it was them and immediately hung up the call and forbade me to talk to them (he was still mad about them holding a grudge over my brother's head and falsifying info about my mom to APS). I know they had the right to know and still feel completely ashamed about it. 



I've been trying to get in touch with my cousin the past year to make amends but I think it's too late to fix. I've called her several times, all only going to voice mail. Should I try to talk to them in person or just suck it up and just realize it was too late? ",29Dec2018,1

227,"Hi all,
So here is my story:
Parents bought a 4 bedroom house in FL for entire family to move to when I was in HS (2004). Mom and dad agreed that they'd wait until retirement so I could finish school in CA...after years (around 2012)I told them I wasn't moving to FL and staying in CA.

We did a family vacation to Orlando winter 2016 and summer 2017...I loved the place so I said HELL YES and was the first one packed and coordinated the entire move. I was excited to leave CA as my job was terrible and I wanted to start fresh. My parents agreed to let me stay at their house rent free until I finished an engineering degree. (I have  a psych degree, but lost interest in the field due to cost and time for PhD).

I turned in my resignation in Nov 2017 and let my employer know I was moving at the end of January. My family and I got packed during January and then everything changed.


My employer offered to pay me to return to CA (flights, room, rental car, lodging) and write a manual for my replacement...I agreed to stay for 2 months at assist with the search and write the manual. A match for my position was not found so I started flying back and forth from April-Nov of 2018 trying to finish some large capital improvement projects I had left pending. 

I was excited to join the family in FL at the end of November and start my life in Orlando, but then my employer offered me a large pay increase and unlimited funding for certifications (however no more flights, rentals, or lodging)I decided  now to move back to CA...without a return date in mind...something that hit my folks like a ton of bricks (mom ignored my calls for a week). I plan on buying an apartment in FL with my extra income and move back to FL once my certs are done, but I dont know how soon that can happen. 

My family is very tight knit and I am the anchor and face of the household (parents are immigrants with limited English skills). Since a young age I have been assisting them with paperwork, payments, disputes, etc. My sister helps but she has her hands full with her kids.

My parents are 66, but my mom is diabetic and has high blood pressure which worries me alot as I dont know what I would do if she passes away while I'm in CA (I've always feared their death since childhood) since I feel that I should always be at their side and that I'm somehow turned my back on them.

They are supportive, but have also made some comments about how sad they are to see me move back and how hopefully this isn't our last goodbye. 

I'm honestly hurting right now and I'm unsure if I should go forward with this move....

I turn to you internet strangers...my GF and friend are not really hearing me out and just talk about the pay and training opportunities.

I've been having nightmares around these issues, I woke up to a full blown panic attack a few hours ago.

What is your opinion? I just need someone to hear/help me out objectively. ",29Dec2018,1
229,"My mom is constantly complaining about her mother-in-law (known as Mil in this post) who moved in with us a few months ago. At first I thought it was just harmless venting, but I've noticed that my mom is complaining about Mil to an almost unhealthy level. From the time she gets home from work at night, she'll begin singing songs about how much she hates Mil, even if she's just in the next room over. Her main complaints are that Mil doesn't pay rent (though my dad is fine with this, and we don't have trouble with rent), and that Mil annoys her by watching tv or talking on the phone too loudly, and now just the general sight of Mil infuriates her. Ideally, my mom wants Mil to stay in her room when my mom isn't at work, and stay out of her sight.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily like Mil either, but she does help babysit and cook for my younger siblings, and I, and other family members find her noise to be if a minor annoyance. I'm sure Mil knows my mom hates her presence, but from what I noticed she isn't deliberately trying to be annoying to my mom, and accommodates when my mom tells her to turn down the TV or something.  I feel like my mom is blowing this out of proportion, and she refuses to listen to my advice about just ignoring Mil. I think the complaining is not only disrespectful, but toxic to both parties. As much stress as my mom goes through everyday, I don't think the constant complaining is helping her mental state(and frankly, it annoys me).

230,"About five months ago I broke up with my girlfriend who has all my friends on snap. She wouldn't stop stalking my location and having her friends threaten me through Instagram and I decided it would be best to send her a message telling her to stop and to leave me alone.  She decided she would send my non erect penis to everyone I'm friends with claiming I had a small penis to embarrass me. (Maybe 4 inches flaccid) The picture was never meant in sexting purposes and only as a joke seeing as we were in the same house.

231,"Hello all!

I've been struggling my whole life with motivation issues. Ever since I was a kid I've had difficulty doing anything responsible whether it's chores, keeping myself healthy, or even just doing basic tasks. It honestly feels impossible most days to do the simplest tasks. It's not that I am incapable, but I get overwhelmed with how fruitless every effort feels. 

For a while I've thought maybe the lack of motivation was depression (currently in therapy and just ditched meds after a couple years on them with little to no help), ADHD (never been officially diagnosed), lack of health (eating nothing but junk food, little to no exercise), or maybe I'm just a lazy person.

I am mostly wondering if I'm just a lazy person by nature or is there something more going on? It feels difficult to do the smallest things and my logic/intuition tells me it shouldn't be. For those who've struggled with something similar -- does laziness always feel so involuntary? Is it really just a constant struggle, and how do you cope with that?

238,"TL;DR-- My parents are constantly fighting and driving each other crazy and it's starting to affect their physical and mental health; how do I fix a 29 year long broken marriage?  Is it possible?

My Mom \[55F\] and my Dad \[58M\] have been married for 29 years.  I have an older brother \[37M\] and myself, \[19F\].  I was adopted, and my older brother is my dad's biological son from a previous marriage.  

Throughout my entire life I can remember my parents suffering marital problems.  They have good days and bad days, but more bad days than good days.  When I was young, probably about 8 or 9, my mom told me that I was the only reason they hadn't gotten a divorce yet.  I remember from that day on, I had pretty much wished they had gotten a divorce.  It's only gotten worse in recent years.

My dad works as a welder and has for more than 20 years.  He makes decent money, more than my mom.  He works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and gets generous vacation days for holidays.  His biggest issues are that he has about a million health problems, and he's extremely lazy around the house.  

My mom works as a custodian at an elementary school, and also works in the deli of a local grocery store.  Up until May 2018, she also worked on Friday nights at a supper club.  She often works 12+ hour days, and usually works every weekend.  Her vacation days are limited.  She gets really mad really fast and blames my dad for every horrible thing that happens; she's also just generally really hard on me as far as school and making money, but she herself is horrible with money.

So why are they slowly killing each other?  It's a never-ending cycle.

My dad is extremely depressed and has horrible anger issues, amongst other problems.  He suffers from severe back pain and pains in his stomach.  He's fairly overweight and refuses to try any dieting or exercise.  He also has type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.  His dad died from a heart attack, and I'm worried the same thing will happen to him.  He's also been drinking himself to sleep nearly every night, because he claims that it's the only way he can fall asleep.  We have been telling him to seek professional help for his anger issues for years, but he refuses to go.  When he gets upset, he gets violent, although he has never laid a hand on anyone; he just throws things and breaks things, which is still scary.  He's depressed because nothing he ever does is good enough for my mom, and she's always ragging on him about his issues.  She hates that he has health problems and blames him for having them.  My mom is pretty verbally abusive and always makes my dad feel inferior.  My dad confided in me this past February, and confessed that he has frequent thoughts of suicide.  This scares me, especially because for 8 months out of the year, I'm an hour and a half away at college, and my brother doesn't really interact with the family as much as he used to.  My dad doesn't have any friends, his parents are long gone, as is his sister, and he doesn't really keep in contact with his brother.  All he has is me, and I don't know how to help him.

My mom is a workaholic, and it's draining the life out of her.  She works 12+ hours a day, and has a lot of issues with her feet.  She's had multiple back surgeries.  She also has type 2 diabetes.  When she comes home from work, she does all of the cooking and cleaning because my dad does not.  My mom used to weigh almost 300lbs when they got married back in 1989.  Today she weighs less than 150.  Most of her weight she lost in the past couple years, probably due to working so much.  She cries almost every night because she can tell that my dad just does not care about how much she works or that she has to clean all the time.  He gets offensive if she says anything to him.  There's usually always something to fight about.  My dad will often go days without talking to her.  

This is only a fraction of the problems my parents experience.  This post could go on forever if I kept going.  I don't know how to help my parents.  I suggested they go to marriage counseling, and they did, and it did not work.  My dad doesn't take any of this stuff seriously, and my mom is way too intense and makes things difficult all the time.  I just need some advice for how to help my parents.  I can't keep taking sides.  I don't want my dad to contemplate suicide and drink himself to sleep, and I don't want my mom to work to death and cry herself to sleep every night.  I don't know how to get either of them to just communicate with each other in a positive way, neither of them will listen to me.  I don't really know what kind of advice I'm expecting, but I'm at my last wit's end.  I love both of my parents very dearly and hate seeing them like this.  It's honestly hard for me to even be at home when I know my parents hate each other and are fighting all the time.  I don't want them to die at a young age, but if things continue the way they are right now, I'm not sure how long they can last.  Is there ANYTHING I can do to make things better, or are they a lost cause after 29 years?  Can things still change?  I'm so scared for their future.",29Dec2018,1
239,"I'm not sure what to say here. I'm a 34 year old male. I like to think I'm strong and I like to think I've got my shit together. But I just had a thought tonight that freaks me out. 

I've seen a fair share death in my life; my grandfather murdered my grandmother and then committed suicide, my best friend in high school was killed in a tragic car accident that I found while driving, my best friend in my early 30's randomly shot himself in his bathroom and I gutted the bathroom so his wife would never have to be in that room. Those are just the worst ones that come to mind.

You see, I'm not much of a people person and tend to avoid visiting anyone, including people I love. I don't really know why. Outside of work I keep to myself.  But now, my uncle is in terrible shape. He's been through a whole slew of medical troubles over 2018. Over the course of this, I thought he was alright. Now though, he's gone from being in a medically induced coma, to awake, to coding and being brought back.

I haven't gone to see him. I'm terrified his going to die, but I can't force myself to go see him. I've been there right after death every time I've lost someone. Just tonight I realized, I've never experienced an advancement towards death, I've only had to deal with it suddenly. It scares the shit out of me and I don't feel comfortable talking about it with anyone I know. I really love my uncle, but even though I have the chance this time, I'm too afraid to go say goodbye.",29Dec2018,1
240,"Anyways, this post is about improving a relationship with myself. I am 23 and have never had a romantic relationship. It really tears me up that it seems like I have never been good enough for anybody. Seeing ""everyone"" (I define this to be the vast majority of my friends plus the lot of strangers you see in day-to-day life) else having a partner with which to share their lives with while I don't/have never experienced that makes me feel really bitter about everything.


And I absolutely hate that. It honestly feels really disgusting when I go into that spiral of doubt and loneliness but at the same time I can't help it because it just seems like it might never happen for me. On top of that, it feels like there is a vice on my heart that I can't loosen because I keep hardening myself to try and get past these feelings.


All that being said, I know that for the most part, I am not an inherently unattractive person (as in I have seen girls taking looks from time to time as well knowing that I have solid sense of humor) but the lack of success in this facet of life makes me seriously doubt myself. As in to the point where I sometimes wonder when people compliment me or tell me that I'm a great person (this latter one often in the context of talking about my dating life) it makes me feel like they're all lying. In addition, dating apps seem to not work for me (as in I get little to no matches) so I also worry that I am just really ugly but no one has said anything to me so far.


Coupled with all of this is that if I am being completely transparent, there are only two people I have ever met that I completely could have foreseen being in relationships with but the circumstances for neither did not work out (I could expand on this if needed and yes for one of them I did ask her out, the other I couldn't). So then am I just being too picky? Or do I know what I want?


My end goal for this post is to figure out how to forget that I seem to be the only single one in my social circles and how to move on from that idea because. At this point I am worried that my loneliness/depression will lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where I truly become alone for the rest of my life. Note: I already have ideas of actively forming a social circle (I am alone in a new city) plus getting back to consistent physical activity, but please any additional self-help tips for this case are much appreciated!

In October I got in an argument with my mom because she gave a $50 mic i had to goodwill and when i asked her if she'd get me a new one or reimburse me for it she laughed at me. I got pretty offended and threatened to take $50 worth of her shit and do whatever i wanted with it cus I was mad and i saw it as a way to kind of show her how i felt i was being treated. She told me to try so i went up to her room and looked for a second before deciding i was just gonna fuck up a teddy bear i gave her a while back. I was super pissed so i cut it apart and when i tossed it to her I said ""love ya mom"" and she told me that she didnt want it and that she didn't care about any of the shit i gave her. I was already pretty fucking mad so i took that as a sort of i dont love you and i was by her door and she had just gotten down the stairs so i punched her door. She called the police and had me arrested. I was in a correctional facility for five days on a pr bond and my dad didnt wanna pick me up because he thought she'd divorce him. i was on pre trial for 2 months until i got switched to diversion which starts in about a week. looking back it definitely wasnt worth the stupid mic and if i could go back and just be like ok that sucks that would've been a lot better. My mom says that if she had to call the cops again she would do it in a second and she said that she did it in the first place because she thought i was a threat and she didnt like that i smoke weed (btw i've literally never hit her or anyone in my family, never even been in a fight im a relatively non violent guy.) in juvy i had it set in my mind i'd never forgive her but now my dad has switched to her side too and every court ordered therapist sides with her but any of my friends side with me (but of course they do theyre my friends) and their parents also think  its pretty fucked to send me to jail over a door. idk if i should just blame myself for all of this or my mom over reacting which she won't admit was an over reaction.

246,"I don’t normally turn to people for advice, but I’ve recently found myself in a tough situation and I’m not sure how to go about solving it. I’m hoping that I’ll have a little more clarity after posting here :)

So here goes the stupid teenage dating drama:

I’m 17 (f) and, up until about 4 months ago, I had been dating a guy for 4 years. I broke off the relationship for several reasons, the main ones being that I felt controlled by him and constantly felt anxious because of his mistrust/jealousy. I was also part of the issue since I had not been honest about how I felt with all of that. In addition, during the breakup, I admitted that I was not in love with him despite saying so throughout the whole relationship. Shitty, I know, but I didn’t understand love at all when I started saying “I love you” at age 13, and the habit stuck. 
Anyways, we both decided that the connection we had developed over 4 years was too good to just throw away, so we agreed to stay close friends. Since then, we have continued to talk every day, hang out once in a while, and work on fixing our toxic habits together, just without any romantic feelings. 
People say that our relationship now is weird since exes “never actually stay friends”, but I think it’s fine as long as we are happy and improving ourselves. 

Here’s where things get complicated though:
I met a guy about a month ago and really hit it off with him. We both like each other a lot and decided to stay exclusive to each other. Dating without the official title I guess? 
I told him about my past relationship and why it had its downfall. I also told him about the current relationship between my ex and me. He thought it was strange, but also said it was cool that we were able to stay good friends. At this point, I’m thinking “yes, finally a guy who doesn’t care that I’m friends with other dudes.” 

After that, though, I noticed that this guy seemed to get agitated whenever he saw me texting my ex. I would explain that my ex just doesn’t like it when I take hours to reply and that he likes to know where I am. The guy would get annoyed and say that my ex is still being controlling as if he’s still with me romantically. (I’ve talked to my ex about it and he says it’s just because he wants to make sure I’m safe)
Today, I went to the movie theater with my ex since we were free and both wanted to watch a specific movie. 
The guy I have been seeing texted me and asked who I was at the movies with, and when I replied that it was my ex, he got pissed. He said that he feels disrespected by me hanging out with him and thinks I should cut off all communication with my ex. He said that he thinks it’s wrong of me to still be friends with an ex and that he has developed trust issues with me because of this. 
This came off as a bit of a surprise to me since he knew that I still hung out with my ex occasionally, as normal friends would. 
At this point, I just don’t know who is in the wrong here. I ended my last relationship due to feeling controlled, and now I feel like I’m being controlled all over again by this new guy. I now feel both guilt and defensive. On one hand, I feel like I should do what he says to avoid the conflict. But on the other hand, I don’t want to give in to what he tells me to do since another controlling relationship is the last thing I want. 

I am afraid that it is me who’s in the wrong in this situation for still hanging out with my ex while seeing someone else, but I also can’t let myself be controlled again. 

I’m sorry for the long post, but I’ve needed to get this all off my chest. I would much appreciate hearing any advice or opinions on the situation. 

Thanks! :) ",29Dec2018,1
248,"To start this post off, I was seeing a Therapist almost 3 years ago and I felt like she was helping but at the same time there were some things that raised a few red flags when I was seeing her at the time. Personally, I really thought that the therapist that I was seeing was somewhat old like around 50 to 60 years old but man, this woman was young like around her early to mid 30s. She was attractive and I thought she was Latina or Middle Eastern but I learned that she was actually Iranian. I instantly fell for her but I didn’t trust her because I thought that she would seduce me or give me some hot tea laced with a knockout drug. Another reason I didn’t open up to her is because I have never opened up to a woman before In terms of very personal conversations and intimacy. At that time I was in High School and I was 17 at the time.

My mom was the one who forced me to go into therapy in terms of my dark past that I was going through and honestly I was seeing a different therapist that helped me with PTSD but she knew something was very odd about me and she asked if I was sexually abused and I responded with a yes for some reason. She then referred me to this social worker in San Diego. This social worker next referred me to the therapist whom I mentioned in the beginning. She started telling me about herself and to me it was just a casual conversation. I opened up to her but I would stop because I didn’t want things to get too personal. After a few sessions she would gradually ask a few personal questions like “ How do you treat women?” or “Are you very humble and generous towards women”? Some of these questions I would open up to her in detail and since I don’t have many people to talk to, I would come to a limit because I don’t know this woman very well.

A few things that was very distracting to me when I was seeing her was how she would dress because she would show off some skin regarding her legs. She was gorgeous and attractive but I had to resist looking at her legs during some sessions that I was seeing her because often times, I would stare at the ground just to continue on talking to her as usual. I would act like nothing is wrong but she did notice occasionally. When it came to other sessions with her, she would wear yoga pants which was another thing that was my fear due to her lower body and her nice legs. I would try not to think about sexual feelings towards her but I found myself trusting her more and me falling in love with her. I never told her and nor I mentioned about me having a crush on her because of course, she would lose her license to practice and for her, it can be a high price that she’s paying for because she did mention some things that made me uncomfortable after I opened up to her overtime. She then asked me if I was a virgin and I told her that it was the truth, she then proceeded to ask other sexual and uncomfortable questions but I would cut her off by changing the conversation to something different. I would come in late to her sessions on purpose due to the sexual intimate questions that she would ask and she would give me these looks that I thought were sort of flirtatious/sexual. Later on, after a year of seeing her, she would stare at my body and she started saying that I looked fit and next she gave me her personal email address because she said that she will not forget about me. She then gave me a hug as of saying goodbye.

She explained that she was going out of the country because she had to see her family for some time and she said she didn’t know how long she would be staying at her home country and when she would be coming back to the states. I thought that I would never hear from her again but next, I learned that she had a death in her family which I emailed her prior to that tragedy and next after.

EDIT: I did manage to get several replies from her and next she said that she was seeing clients in a different facility. She did want to know if I had health insurance but I didn’t reply back. Later on, I looked her up a couple of months ago this year because I found myself thinking about her even more which I never done towards a woman who is 13 years older than me. Once I found her phone number from where she was seeing clients, I decided to make a call and her voicemail was one the other line, I left a detailed message thinking it was a joke but two to three days later I got a call back that went to my voicemail. Once I heard her voice I was shocked that she was already back in the US in CA seeing clients with her own office. I noticed that the way she left me a voicemail was somewhat flirtatious and she sounded very excited and kind of sexual. I was excited to get in touch with her but the barrier was the type of health/medical insurance that I need just to go see her. Now I can’t stop thinking about her and I have been having dreams that I and her are having an intimate relationship in secret as well as having sex with her at her place. Help, please!!

I am currently 22 and I just turned 22 in October and still in community college.

I stopped seeing her in the year of 2015 about a month after I graduated high school.",29Dec2018,1
249,"So I was with one of my closest friends during a sleepover one night, and i was really comfortable, so I decided to tell her i was bi, because she was night loopy, so her response would probably be much better. It was, because that night she told me nothing would change, and the morning after, she told me she would need some space, and needed time to think.

i am well aware of the fact that this is an incredibly mature way of handling this situation for her, but for me it is torcher. Not to mention he fact that the reason we are friends is because we do cheerleading together, which is a very up close and personal sport. (or not that’s kinda controversial) 

if i’m being completely honest, it eating me alive inside worrying that she won’t except me, and that she will never want to talk to me again.  I’m terrified that she thinks i’m disgusting, because i really value our friendship.

250,"I'm in a real pickle with this one.  I recently graduated and moved into an apartment with two friends from college.  I guess it was incredibly naive of me to think that like me, they intended to leave all the debauchery in school.  I was excited to start ""disregarding females and acquiring currency"" (becoming an adult) but I guess some people really want to hang on to their immaturity.  Now it's almost like I have to look after two children.  Friend A is at least looking for full-time work while working a minimum wage job for the time being--he's also much cleaner than Friend B.


Friend B has some real problems.  I knew he was depressed but I didn't know how bad it was until we started living together (hindsight is 20/20, terrible choice for a roommate).  At the time part of me thought I could help him but I did not realize how bad the situation was until we started living together.  He's extremely high-functioning for someone with his lifestyle and he's a master at hiding his depression under a mask.  It's put me and friend A in a really awkward spot because all 3 of us hate confrontation so this elephant has been sitting in the room for months now.  I'm afraid I'm too emotionally charged now to hold a respectful, successful intervention.  Anyway, before I get ahead of myself, here's the brutal truth I want to tell him but can't (or shouldn't):

You're depressed because your parents spoiled you.
You're depressed because you're useless, and your depression is making you useless.
You're depressed because you go through 1-3 boxes of whippets per day (this is the only one on this list that's become a new problem during our time living together, and what's pushed me to write this post)
You're depressed because you go through about a six-pack of beer per day.
You're depressed because of your regular cocaine and ketamine usage (also new in these quantities).
You're depressed because of all the weed and tobacco.
You're depressed because you expect 2 hours of exercise per week and antidepressants to combat your shit lifestyle.
You're depressed because you can't get laid because of your depression.


There's definitely more to the story but that's the root of it from what I can tell.  I didn't mean for this to turn into an r/offmychest post and I know I'm coming across as an ass but it's because his depression is toxic and it's starting to rub off on me.  (I know it's partially my fault for ignoring it for so long.)  I'd left my debauchery in school but since moving in I let my guard down and let him guilt me into ""having fun.""  I keep telling him I'm not interested but he guilts me into it.  I end up going to bars with him because I feel sorry for him and it always ends up with me feeling like I'm throwing my hard-earned money into a fire.  He is (I believe) still living off his parents' dollar (They must be so clueless to think their son is spending all that money on just food).  He's got the TV on constantly while gaming on his laptop and is on Reddit (all at the same time), which I think also contributes greatly to his depression.


The most frustrating thing is his disregard for the cleanliness of the apartment.  I know it's because he grew up with a maid but it is so so frustrating to every morning wake up to empty paper bags and plastic bags laying around 3 feet from the garbage bin, beer bottles stuck to the coffee table, and crumbs all over the futon.  I clean it up before work because that kind of stuff IRKS me.  I HATE that I accumulate a serving of trail mix on my feet by walking barefoot from my room to the bathroom.  His entire life I bet he just left garbage wherever because it would later disappear from the maid.  Now I'm in the maid's role.  I'm not prepared to rewire his brain Pavlov style just to get him to throw shit out so maybe it would be easier to get to the root of the problem, his depression.  He always takes any kind of confrontation REALLY REALLY personally, starts to weasel his way out of responsibility by bringing up a bunch of nothingburger whataboutisms (""well 2 weeks ago you left a plate on the coffee table"", ""I cleaned, I took out the trash!"") and then guilts you because you made him a victim.  Honestly it's pathetic and manipulative.  

Not long ago I got guilted into apologizing to him after he drank about half a bottle of my wine after asking me for ""some wine."" I'd confronted him about it and was apparently being way too emotional about a simple miscommunication.  Somehow he became the victim for drinking half my bottle of wine.


ANYWAY, with the new year ahead I thought it would be a great opportunity to have an intervention (friend A thinks it's time for one as well).  We really want what's best for him because it hurts us to see him like this (and it just hurts us in general).  He's always been great to hang out with but his lifestyle is becoming detrimental to my own health.  I know he's got so much potential and if he could get his act together he could be a very successful writer or comic.  I want to try doing more healthy activities with him so it's not like he's ""going it alone"" but he'll never really get better unless the drug/alcohol use stops.  Recently he's been going through the whippets like candy (he says they let him see everything clearly and work through personal things, no one I know has this reaction to nitrous oxide).  I'd genuinely love to help him work through those problems while sober (I live for that kind of shit) but I don't know how to ask him to open up--I think it's a delicate situation.  I think he has a big problem with pride...


So, any advice on how to have an intervention without making him feel personally attacked?  It's not him I don't like, it's what his depression makes him do.",29Dec2018,1

However, yesterday she decided to burst into my room talking to her friend on the phone with her speaker on laughing as loud as she could possibly laugh.

252,"Earlier this year, my brother was pronounced missing, and after a search party couldn't find him he was declared dead. I'm not going to give the details of this incident because it was on the news and would be very easy to identify him and my family if I gave these details. However, his death was ruled accidental, his body was never found. The people who he was with when he died, their story has always seemed suspicious to me, never giving enough detail or avoiding speaking about it because it was ""too traumatic for them"" 

He allegedly died in a very horrific, very painful way.

Well, he's my brother, you were the last person to see him alive, you supposedly watched or heard him die, but it's too much for you to tell his own flesh and blood what happened? What his last words were? If he was in pain? If he went quickly? If he begged for his life? I don't want to sound heartless, but these guys barely knew him, they worked with him only a few months. I find it incredibly suspicious that their stories either keep changing or they absolutely will not go into ANY detail about the circumstances of his disappearance. One person says something, and another witness says another. Their time frames don't add up, their stories don't correlate. 


We had a memorial for him, and made a plaque because his body was never recovered. For months leading up to this, these men he was with were impossible to get a ahold of. They wouldn't speak on the matter, aside from their original statement to the police, but other than that they didn't speak or contact any of me or my family. They remained completely silent, and there was no getting any information from the police. We didn't know who to talk to, we weren't given a shred of help or compliance from anyone. 


Then magically, on the day of his memorial, these men showed up. They didn't speak to anyone, they didn't say any words or speeches. They hung around in the back near their trucks and refused to show any emotion or solace. Within seconds of his memorial being over, they were nowhere to be found, they were gone. My mom spoke to his ""boss"" several times on the phone, but he would always give the phone to his wife and she would speak on his behalf.

My family gets enraged with me every time I bring it up. ""He's dead, nothing will change that"" they always say, but I know in my heart there is something more going on here. I know those men know what happened to him. I _know_ they feel guilt and refuse to talk about it. The investigation into his death was a joke. No body they assumed just meant to take the witnesses stories to heart, and that's what they did. I know they know more the  they are letting on. There is a reason they feel the guilt they do. Recently, his boss just had a heart attack, his wife informed us, because of the stress and guilt he feels about my brothers death. These were her own words.

What I'm asking is basically this. Who do I call? Who do I ask to push this investigation further? There is no sign of his body, his boss never even sent us back his phone. We got his clothes and other belongings, but coincidently they lost the phone and couldn't mail it back to us, after they already supposedly had it ready to mail. There are many things off about this situation that I lose sleep every night over it. I can't escape these horrible nightmares, I know in my heart there is something hidden here.


Who do I contact? How do I pursue this? It's taking over my life. No one in my family wants to even talk about the possibility of it being anything but accidental. I don't feel that way. I know they know it too, but they are too scared to admit it, it is to painful for them to even consider. They want to believe that it was an accident but I know it wasn't. I mean, it may have been an accident but these men are hiding something deeper to protect themselves. I don't know how to investigate this further. I want to dig deeper into his disappearance and find more answers but I don't know the first steps to take. I know these men are guilty of something, and for the sake of my brother I have to know the whole truth.  I know they know exactly what happened to them, and because they refuse to give consistent answers, I feel it's far worse than I or my family even know.",29Dec2018,1

I get something called PiP which is just an amount of money per month to tide your over, for issues that  i don't want to go into. I get like 500 quid a month.

&amp;#x200B;

It goes into my mum's account, which cause i'm not living with her, she should sent it to my dad. They both fell out a few months ago, after being okay with each other. My mum tells me that she doesn't have my dad's account details, my dad says she does and so i'm in limbo with no money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even if i did get it, my dad would take like 60% of it, which is completely fair enough , cause i can't cook or clean and i don't have a job, or qualifications. I left school unofficially a few months ago and they're on my dad's ass about it.

If i did go to school, i'd get a bus there, funded by the school. There are several buses that go from different areas.

I used to get the one that goes from my dad's town, when my mother lived here. It fucking sucked, it was awful and then i moved when i was with my mother and had a better one, so i'm deffo not getting that shit bus, so i'm not going school.

My dad works nights, so he can't take me to school, he's offered, but it's just no viable.

I spent my nights up, working on a game i'm making, which... if i'm honest, sucks ass. I sleep in the day and me and my dad's relationship is deteriorating every day.

I would sleep in the night and go out in the day, however my dad is a funny soul and doesn't like me going out, because the front door is kinda broken and  i don't know how to properly unlock/lock it.

265,"So this isgoing to be a long story 
More of a long rant
But I'm curious  on other opinions  on the matter 

So to start 

I met a guy a work who at first I had no real interest in. As time went on and we got to know each other i started to like him. And based on his actions and words I suspected  he liked me as well. 

I also work with my best friend of 5 years at the time. She encouraged me to go after this guy and she was all for me going out with him.

So eventually me and this guy end up hanging out a few times and hooking up. At this point I have intense feelings  for him. 

Fast forward.. things dont last between him and I and we end up kinda staying friends. He gets drunk one day and tells me that he is madly in love with my best friend and always had been. So he essentially  only went for me as the next best option because my best friend was engaged and he couldnt have her.

I was devastated  and cried over him for a while until my feelings for him subsided over time

My bestfriend is aware of every single detail of this.

Fast forward again..now it's almost a year after things went downhill with my crush. my best friend becomes single and I suspect that shes been hanging out with this guy or possibly more 

I ask her multiple times if shes interested in him and if they have anything going on. And I assure her I dont care because I've moved on and had started seeing someone else. She denies it up and down and says shes not interested in him and would never do that to me and would at least tell me

To end my long ass story. I end up finding  out through third party that these two had been going on dates and what have you for a while. 

My best friend lied to me and I feel betrayed. I dont care that she slept with my ex crush. I'm more hurt she would lie about it and keeping it a secret with him was more important  to her than our friendship.

266,"TL;DR: My ex-best friend of 5 years doesn’t want anything to do with me because of what I did to her when I had a GF, I’m trying to fix it, and I’m not ready to let go of her. What should I do? 

So last year, I was in sort of a bad spot in life. I was in my last year of high school, I didn’t have many friends, and there were these two girls that I was sorta talking to as friends, but one of them I was only friends with for a few months, the other for a few years. We’ll call the one for a few years “School” and the other one “Work” (where I first met each one). 

So School and I had been friends for years, but my senior year, I was in a rough spot, we stopped taking, I thought she didn’t want to be friends anymore, and I was talking to Work, and she could tell I was off. She asked what was wrong, long story short I told Work I ruined my friendship with School, and Work asked if I liked School and I said yes. Work was really quiet, turns out she liked me, and I though Work was cute and all so we started dating. Fast forward a few weeks, just graduated, School and I are friends again, she said she thought I didn’t want to be friends cause I was so isolated so that’s why she didn’t try to text me, but life is good. I’m friends with School, and Work and I are in a good relationship. 

One day, Work asked me who that girl was that I was talking about that one day, and I lied and said it was some random chick I used to crush on in elementary school. She knew I texted School (I wasn’t trying to get with school or anything just as friends), and I wasn’t willing to give up my friendship with School again. 

Fast forward another few weeks, Work is off to a different state to go to school, and we’re gonna do long distance. I can’t take the weight of the fact that I lied to her about who I was talking about, so I tell her the truth. Shit goes south, she doesn’t explicitly tell me to choose, but she made it clear that I had to choose between Work, or School. I loved Work, so I chose her, but that meant I had to stop being friends with School. The next day, I text School and tell her what happened, and what I had to do, she just says she’s fine with it, she understands, acts very quiet again, but there’s nothing I can do. I’m home, my gf is a few states away, my closest friend is not my friend anymore, I cry like a bitch that night. 

FF a few months, relationship isn’t going too hot, college gets difficult, so I text School. I don’t remember exactly what was said, but she says she was very sad about what happened, I told her I was as well, so we start texting again (as friends). I don’t want GF to find out, I hide messages, I feel like shit a few weeks later and tell School that I can’t be friends yet again. 

All this time I don’t really realize how unhappy I am with the long distance relationship that I was in, it changed me, especially being in school for a difficult major, being so stressed out and not having anyone to turn to for help because GF worked and was in school as well. 

So now it’s November, 2018, and I text School because I’m thinking about switching majors, cause mine is so difficult. I talked to my parents about it, my gf, they just say they support whatever decision I make, but that I shouldn’t drop out. I’m like, “yeah that doesn’t help”, so I text School, tell her what I’m thinking, she’s like “that’s stupid you’re just gonna quit cause it’s difficult?” Basically makes me feel like a bitch for thinking like that, I’m like shit she’s right. And immediately I just feel this overwhelming urge to want to be friends with her again. 

Now it’s December, my gf and I broke up because I realized how unhappy I was in that relationship, and I’m trying my best to fix my relationship with School. I’m looking back at my relationship and I realize that I shouldn’t have chose Work over School after admitting to that lie. Yeah Work did so much for me and was so good to me, but School was just perfect. I was happy with her and I felt more full just even being friends with her than I did in the later stages of my relationship with Work. 

But School doesn’t want to have anything to do with me. She feels I just used her and that she’s not some person I can just decide when I want to and don’t want to be friends with. She says she didn’t deserve anything that happened to her and that she’s not gonna let herself get into that shit again. And I understand all of that, but there’s this urge in me and I feel every single fiber in me just wants to be with her. Not even romantically, just as a friend. I’m not gonna start dating for a while, I’m ready to put her first and to be there for her and be the friend that I should’ve been months ago, even years ago, but I just need one more chance. 

I asked if she didn’t want to be friends anymore, and she wouldn’t admit to it, which is why I kept persisting, but she won’t budge at all, and she hasn’t left my mind for weeeks. Ever since that happened in November, she hasn’t left my mind, and I don’t feel I’m ready to let go of her, even though she’s already let go of me. I’m not sure what to do.

267," I'm in desperate need of some direction. I work for a hospice company who is blatantly taking advantage of low-income individuals and insurance companies. Many of our patients are no where near the end of life, some don't even have major medical issues, and nearly all of them don't even understand what hospice care is. In fact, when I have explained that hospice is comfort care services for the dying, they usually get outraged or are in disbelief that they're supposedly dying. Clearly, no one informed them.

Many of these patients are low-income, or even homeless, and they have no understanding of the healthcare system, believing that they are receiving ""free"" medication, supplies (diapers, shampoo, etc), or even home health through our company. They do not realize that these are being paid by their insurance (usually Medicaid or IEHP, occasionally Medicare) and that they would most likely qualify for all of these things without being on our hospice services. In fact, we are reaping $**3 to 5** **thousand** a month from each patient.

Sadly, many of them have mental health issues, which makes it difficult for them to seek out help from county or state services. Our company is usually the one to sign them up for Medicaid, in the first place. Many of them also have substance abuse issues, and being hospice, we supply them with an endless amount of opioids, muscle relaxers, codeine, etc. Some of them straight up try to refuse nursing or home health services - only opioids needed.

The real downer is that, if they haven't died in 6 months, we remove them from our services, as insurance only pays for 6 months of hospice. They are left in the dark. We no longer help them with medications, home health, or supplies. Some of them are already set up with county assistance, but if they're not, they have no way of navigating the system to help themselves with medications, healthcare, etc. They're simply discarded.

Because these individuals are mostly low income/homeless, they live in ""integrated housing,"" which is, allegedly, affordable housing for those who are down and out. These houses usually consist of multiple people sharing a room, with only the basic necessities. I visit one house that currently has 8 tenants and 1 toilet. They are in the worst conditions imaginable - cockroach infestations, no hot water, no lights in the bedrooms, no washer or dryer, no heating or air conditioning, leaking pipes, etc. Most of these houses should be condemned. Yet, they are actually paying up to $700 a month, to live in squalor.

These housing organizations, particularly the one my work has ties with, disguise themselves as non-profit organizations, helping those in need. It is pure fraud. They are making huge profits off these tenants and doing almost nothing for them. Nearly every patient I have spoken to has told me the owner of these homes told them all kinds of lies, such as these houses would be providing 24 hour board and care services, private bedrooms, meals, etc. And, conveniently, this particular organization is friends with our administrator and introduce their tenants to our hospice company. Within a week of moving into these homes, we have them in our services.

I feel helpless. The county has already been informed of the condition of these homes, and did send Adult Protective Services and county social workers to investigate. They made demands and some threats to the owners of the homes, assisted some of our patients with getting Meals on Wheels - and then were never to be heard of, again. I understand they probably see this all the time, and the county is understaffed and underfunded (this county literally went bankrupt a few years ago), but it's still so unfortunate that they didn't do more.

I know there are federal Medicaid fraud tip hotlines and such, which I will be pursuing, but I'm worried that this will just be ignored, since it's so prevalent and they deal with so many complaints. I'm in Southern California. If anyone could help with a more direct route in reporting the fraud, or at least reporting the terrible housing conditions, I would be eternally grateful.

Well eventually i snapped back to reality a bit late and realized that working minimum wage felt degrading and i was unable to get a car or my own place. I decided to do something about it l.  I saved 700 for a junker car a 1990 lumina, taught myself to drive and ended up getting my license.

My next goal was to apply for college, so i did that and it started really slow. I knew what i wanted to do so i decided to go the computer science route with a focus in computer programming. 

I scored really low on the math for actuplacer so i jumped on khan academy and tried to build up my math skils while attending classes. I ended up taking 2 semesters at 12 credit hours each. I still havent took any of my math classes required.  

Fast forward a few months after that, i was kicked out of my parents home because of an arguement that i was too old for college. That and they wanted 500 in rent because (they believe i spend my money unreasonably so i didnt need it) While my gfs parents were more on the pro-education supportive side.  

Instead of trying to make up with my parents i moved in with my gfs family and my gf in hopea that things would improve.   Well it actually got somehow worse.  

  They kinda do an animal sanctuary thing so they moved to the rural and they got fucked on the mortgage for their house. With flood insurance when they dont have a flood zone and a broken septic tank.    Well this part does not impact me yet. 

  We get done unpacking and they have me make the calls to setup internet.  We are surrounded by trees, very tall trees all around the house.  So theres almost no phone reception.   Ended up having to walk to the end of the road to make some calls.  We end up with satalite internet(way more painfully slow than i imagined, but not a big deal).  

Next was transfering credits and applying for a new school in the area.  This went incredibly easy and i even scored way over what i needed for math so no premedial classes, woo . I get really giddy and sign up for classes  get everything done early.

  I come to find out im considered out of district and  becauae im in a very small county thats outside a major one. So i have to pay alot more where my pell grant used to cover everything while giving me a little extra left over.  Now i owe the school 400+ books  so i take out the student loan.
I make another mistake later and get my books early. 

Next was get a job, gfs family at first was only charging me 100 a month, i ended up finding an okay starter job part time. But im racking up 8 to 12 hours a week because my employer says  she  cant give me more unless i had more availibility.  I was making rent  but not my car insurence and barely getting by on gas. 

Fast forward 3 months later, my school advisor made a terrible mistake and the classes assigned to me wouldnt be covered by my financial aid. So i had to get atuff approved for my degree path. I couldnt wait all day to see another advisor, i did it early to wait it out. So i panic and drove to work instead of risking my job.  I forgot to return the books so i came back up a week later. And turns out the book store turned over to a new company and wouldnt take any of my books back but would buy back some of them.  I now owe the bookstore like 400 dollars.  I was told to make an appeal to get my charges dropped.  I was denied the appeal because i lacked evidence and didnt return the books the first day of class.

So fast forward a month. I was still working a shitty dollar store position and even though i explained i had more availibility. She wouldnt give me hours, instead she hires someone else and shrugged off my requests.  I tried to take charge and find a better job and i did.

I landed a job at a plastic factory,  for 10/hr im working 8 to 9 hours a night but making really good money. 1 month later my car starts acting funny. Then it starts smoking, i end up missing one day and despite the praise i got, even called in told them i didnt have a ride and couldnt make it.  They replaced me right off the bat the next day i was told to  return my safty glasses for my last check. 

I wanted to uber but i couldnt stomach the payout so i thought one day to figure out my car situation wouldnt hurt.   My gfs family is getting concerned with me. An IT student with 24 credit hours and not attempting to push into the entry level of my field. ( trust me i would but i cant afford to take my A+ cert and aside from knowing how to put mg own computer together. And tidbits of knowlede from classes Im unsure if i could pass it).  Not only is this an issue but my closest area where i could do anything IT is all the way out in flint michigan with very very few entry level IT positions around. I looked way before the plastic factory.

 My gfs family starts having financial difficulty and had to bump everyones rent to 200 to make up for the mortgage fuck up. Im jobless i find put my car is completely fried i scrapped it for rent.  Gfs parents bought a 200 dollar van but it has a tick in the engine.  They want me to help with insurance which is reasonable.  I cant get financial aid anymore because i owe my college money.  My employment history is now a mess due to rash decision making and now im having trouble findig any kind of work.

My computers motherboard also managed to die and family is super concerned IT student cant fix it and gfs dad is making fun of me and basically calling me a flake. 

My gf is semi supportive and thinks i should probably make up with my family and maybe move back if its too hard here. But my family  thinks i need to find a trade because of my age. My dad even said im too old for a computer job.  I feel like im seriously boned right now.

What do i do, reddit? 

TLDR: life is like dominos and progressive mess ups is making it impossible to for me to pursue education or even get into an entry position in my field of study. ",29Dec2018,1
269,"I'm about to turn 21, I pay for my own college, rent, food, bills, and bought my own car, but my dad still calls me a selfish child that isnt good enough...

I've never made a post before but I'm not sure where to turn...my dad has bipolar disorder and it's been very difficult on my life, especially as of late ever since I've entered college. His mood swings are unpredictable and make me feel like I have to walk on eggshells, so for the past 3 years of college I avoid him as much as I can. I was wondering if there are any adults willing to share their coping mechanisms or how their life is going after surviving being raised by a bipolar parent, or a parent with a mental illness. 

All of my friends in my life look up to me as a self-made, incredibly hard working person. I have adults in my life proud of me, from family friends to teachers. I receive a lot of praise as I still have a perfect GPA, my own job, several leadership positions, and I'm almost entirely financially independent - but my dad still calls me to tell me how selfish, mean, and awful of a daughter I am, and has even called me a b*tch for not visiting him...he says that school and work are not valid excuses and that I'm ""just after his money"" when I make the effort to visit him, which doesnt make any sense in that I pay for 90% of my living expenses myself. This year he forced me to apply for my own health insurance, saying that the 15 dollar a month co-pay was too expensive, and yet he buys several thousand dollars worth of guitars and VIP concert tickets and puts them all on his credit cards when he has manic episodes. He doesnt see anything wrong with the way he treats me and tells me that I should thank him for ""not making my life easy"" because it ""gives me life tools."" It just feels like I'm being given anxiety.

I'm almost finished with school, and I'll be applying to work overseas hopefully on a 5 year contract, so I know I have to hold out until then - but the constant insults to my character and threats of financial insecurity as he hangs my phone bill and car insurance costs over my head really wear down on me. I feel like the only thing that will make him happy is if I act like he's the world's best dad, but I dont have the will to do that. 

I'm worried that I won't be a good enough partner, friend, or parent to others in the future because of how I've been treated and how it impacts my self esteem, anxiety and depression...I was hoping that anyone with experience in this kind of situation would be willing to share advice or anyone that had some kind words in general would be able to give me their two cents on the situation. I dont talk about it with people irl often and dont know anyone else in my situation. 

Thank you.",29Dec2018,1
270,"I need some advice. Scroll down for the question, but here's the back story: 
The end of college was a whirlwind for me. Sure the usual drinking and partying happened, but major drama went down between my roommates. 
My friend's boyfriend cheated on another roommate and after my friend found out she became very hopeless and he became hostile to the point of the ladies in the house (there were 6 total, he was the only guy) felt unsafe. With some of us graduating we couldn't handle the stress the situation was causing and would spend as little time at the house as possible. 
I became very close to the girl who's boyfriend was the cheater. She confided to me that he's done this before and she was very scared. After college she shut down and moved away and wouldn't reply to anyone. 

Fast forward to the halloween after graduation. We reached out to her and invited her to a party and she was really excited to see everyone. And guess who showed up with her? Her ex. She took him back. Everything was still very fresh and we were all uncomfortable. We didnt know how to talk to her about the situation or invite her to anything without him coming. So it became awkward not much communication happened after that. 

So fast forward again to this past year. I found out I was moving out of state and asked if she wanted to reconnect and she agreed. So we're hanging out and who walks in the door of her apartment? Her ex. She was still with him. I was the only one who reached out and now she wants to rekindle a relationship with everyone, but he is why no one knew how to reach out or talk to her without her shutting down again and taking his side. He's also very charming and flirts with other girls while she's in the room. She's not a timid person either but turns a blind eye to him. They're both heavy drinkers as well and have been together since high school. We're in our mid twenties while he's in his late.

My question is: how do I tell her that her life and her choices are her own, we can respect that, but we can't accept him? Nor do we want him around? For example, I'm now engaged and I don't know how to tell her any way but bluntly that she can come to my wedding but no plus one. I'm in a pickle and the other roommates want a friendship with her again but he's holding them back. 

I've thought about being completely honest and saying basically what I said above, that we support and love her but he's the issue and we don't want him invited nor involved in our lives? I dunno I'm just afraid she'll take his side again and push us away...",29Dec2018,1
271,"My hair is thinning, so the only hairdo I can rock is a short hair cut that's thin on the sides and thicker on the top. Don't want to shave it yet until I hit 35-40. I'm only 29 now...

I also have a weird facial structure so I like to rock a beard. I also can grow a beard in nicely. 

Unfortunately, this same look now seems to be rocked by people in fringe right wing groups like The Proud Boys and people who follow Richard Spencer. I'm very progressive. I detest things like The Proud Boys and other fringe right wing racist groups. I also don't want to be randomly punched by antifa. 

As of now I've been dressing like a slob. I've let my hair grow out now I am looking weird as a guy with thin hair rocking a king hair look. I still have the beard. But I feel like I have to rock dressing like a slob and not taking care of my appearance so people won't think I'm a neonazis.

272,"Hey guys, to anyone who has younger siblings they are very close to I was hoping to ask for some words of advice about this...

basically I have a brother who is 8 years younger than me, and when he was growing up as a child/toddler i had a very mother-type relationship with him. The past few years he has been maturing very fast, especially because I am in college therefore i don’t see him very often. Now he is 12, and every time I see him I can’t help but to get overly emotional about the fact that it seems like he is growing up so fast. Like when I see pictures of him from when he was younger i can’t help but break down in tears. And even when I am not with him i will think about much he has changed (like getting taller or his personality mellowing out) and feel emotional about it. I still feel very close to him and we have a good relationship, I just hate getting really sad about this because I just want to enjoy the time I have with him now. But i am not sure what to tell myself to be okay with him maturing and becoming an individual without getting too sad and nostalgic about the past. Any advice is appreciated :)

276,"To preface this, two jobs I always aspired towards were the military and law enforcement. I was planning on joining the military right after high school but basically pussied out and opted to get an associates degree in criminal justice at my local community college so I would have a degree to get into law enforcement. My plan was to get the associates degree then join the Air national guard with a PJ (Para Rescue) contract then after a couple years of serving (and possibly getting my bachelors on the governments dime) start applying at departments. I figured this way I could have the best of both worlds and be in the military(ANG) and be a police officer. I also thought it would be easier to become a cop having a degree and being in the national guard and more specifically being a PJ. The problem is I just finished my first semester of college and I hated it. Not only do I hate college so far but I also hate working part time making no money and having to balance school, work, a social life/relationship and training for my aspiration of becoming a PJ. My main two options right now are to 1- continue college, continue working a part time job making little money and do my best to balance everything. My other option is to drop out of community college get a full time job so I can actually make money and only have to focus on that, plus my social life/relationship and training.

279,"Hey all, posting from my phone and a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I’m having nightmares nearly every time I go to sleep. They don’t start as nightmares, and are the usual wtf you usually have in dreams, (in the one I just woke up from I was working in a bar owned by Rick Sanchez...ok then brain? Lol) 

Then my normal dreams will like devolve into the nightmare. It’s always in a public place with lots of people around. And a man in my dream, a random stranger will assault me in some way. Upskirting, trying to steal my handbag, trying to drag me into a van, trying to choke me. It changes from dream to dream.

The consistent part is that no one in the public place notices or cares. I begin screaming and shouting for help, and people turn and look but with just blank looks on their faces. So I start trying to fight the attack, and in my dream I’m punching or whatever with all the strength I have, like it feels so powerful. But it just glances off the attacker, like it doesn’t even slow him down. 

At this point I usually recognise someone in the crowd, like a friend. This is random too and isn’t always the same person. Sometimes it’s someone I don’t recognise from real life but dream me is like oh it’s my friend. I scream and shout for them specifically and they agonisingly slowly come to help. But they can’t get him off me or stop what is happening. 

Then I wake up. It seems worth mentioning I’m a survivor of rape and assault. I’m also on medication for anxiety, and completed multiple rounds of various types of therapy. None of this is recent, the actual event happened many years ago, and I came out of therapy a year and a half ago.

Ive got kind of this thing going on with this girl and shes head over heels for me and I think Im starting to maybe fall in love with her too but. It just hurts? I guess? I thought waiting a month or so after splitting with my ex would be enough time and honestly it felt like it was. Because before this girl and i started dating I had no issue flirting with her and being flirted with or telling her i adored / loved her. But god now that were together it’s completely different...

Every time her and I hang out im just reminded of my ex. And its always once we get off the phone and stop hanging out that it hits me. I get so depressed and cry and I dont know what to do. I dont think im over my ex..Im pretty sure im still in love with him. But I know he doesnt want anything to do with me. I tried asking him if wed ever get back together and he said we wouldnt bc he liked how things were with us now. And he promised me wed still be best friends and talk just like before we dated but he pretty much never talks to me / is cold when he responds to my attempts at communicating. I know theres no hope for us again but I still want to be with him and I miss him so much. We spent almost two months together this summer and it made me so attached to him and I just? Dont know how to let go.

I want to know how to let go..because this girl ive got is really sweet and she treats me so well and adores me like im a goddess, shes good for me..and i care a lot about her and really do like her.

one of my best friends struggles to set a limit when it comes to drinking alcohol.

He kind of becomes ""unstoppable"" not in a way that he drinks furthers tonnes of alcohol but he gets super stubborn and does not listen to any advice anymore. 

He is totally aware of the matter when sober but since we are living a vital pub culture it occurs quiet frequently...

The solution seems easy: He should stop drinking...but I don't want to believe that that's the only way...he is totally fine with not drinking for days...and also has evenings where he is finde with 1 or 2 beers but he ""escalates"" way too often IMO.

""we should go home..."" ""No, i am gonna stay!""... like a child. next morning (after he stayed at the pub and went on to some other places) he lacks memory and often does not know how he got home.

I have an option with some people I don't know aswell but I get on incredibly well with them and I know for sure they're a really fun group. Problem is my other mates are now asking what 'the plan' is and I don't know how to tell them I don't really want to join them.

I’m a teenage boy with relatively strict parents when it comes to sex and things like that. Now I’m quite the sexual deviant and would like a pocket pussy. For anyone wondering a pocket pussy is it’s a small device (about 7 inches long) which is basically just a tube that’s supposed to simulate a vagina. Now obviously I can’t just walk into a sex store and buy one (most don’t allow under 18 for obvious reasons) now I could order it online although that can be risky. If it comes while I’m at school, parent open it, I’m screwed. None of my friends will let it be delivered to their house (for obvious reasons). 

That being said I do have two plans and I want to know your advice on said plans.

Plan 1: my friend recently had mold grow under his floor so his whole house is being remodeled and he is staying in a temporary house. I could order the stuff (using a throw away account and gift cards so it’s anonymous) and let it be delivered to his house. Then just go up there and pick up the package. PROBLEMS: if the workers remodeling his house are there I obviously won’t be able to get the package and will have to wait past dark to get it. Plus I wouldn’t be surprised if one of the workers sets the package in the house for my friends family to later get. If my friends family gets the package and opens it, it won’t be good.

Plan 2: I order the package anonymously and have it come to my house. Since it’s Christmas break and I can wait outside all day for it. Once the package come  I can get it before the ups worker rings the door bell and my parents find out. PROBLEM: if I somehow don’t get package on time (I’m in the bathroom and they come, they come late in the evening when others are around etc.) then my parents will be very pissed. Again I would have ordered the packages anonymously with gift cards although it would still be a very awkward situation. This plan is a lot more fool-proof with overall less variables to deal with, although if it does go awry then the consequences are much, much worse.

302,"My mother has delusional disorder, and she rants every day. It's haunting my mind. She is getting more aggressive, like the ones she had years ago. She has been suffering from this for a decade. The worst incident was when she attacked a neighbor in US, she got into trouble with the cops. They said that scumbag neighbor threatened to shoot her. I was terrified.

She was better once, until I messed things up. You see, I suffer from a paranoid and bipolar disorder, and I do the same thing as her. Although not as delusional as her, I rant on for nights.

I'm afraid that she might freak out at a passer-by. She thinks that everybody is trying to harm her, and she is getting defensive.

It's tough living in South Korea. I go to a college that has some intimidating professors, and my grades are failing. I'm an Asian-American from US. I did better in American colleges. I don't know why the hell I came here. The only reasons I can figure out is my parents demanded me to go to South Korea to learn the Korean language. I don't think it's useful.

I shouldn't have come here. I suffered from bipolar disorder and paranoia since childhood, and should've stayed in US.

But I had no money to find a job, shelter, and medical care. Medical care was getting expensive. Especially with Trump administration screwing things up. So I had to comply and get to South Korea.

Living in South Korea with mentally delusional mother was rough. She would rant days and nights, and it's stressful dealing with school and home. She was verbally and physically abusive. We had altercations often, and we almost got injured. Last month was the worst. She was ranting as usual. I was filled with misery and could not control my emotions. I yelled at her to stop and she went to attack me. I blacked out, and I don't remember much, but many terrifying things happened. We almost seriously got injured and I got into serious trouble. If this keeps going like this, I'm scared that we would get killed. I'm scared of jail time. I don't know about here in Korea, but in US, I'd spend the rest of my life locked up.

At least US has better medical care, although expensive. South Korea has poor medical care. I tried to tell the doctor about our situation, but he does not believe me. He thinks she is fine, and I am not. But in reality neither of us are. I'm screaming and ranting. She is delusional and and thinks people are out to get her.

I tried counselling, but they refused to help in this kind of situations. These bozos are telling me to go to a doctor or something, which it doesn't work.

There is no help. I tried everything, and nothing's working. I tried to running away, she keeps pulling me back.

I tried to ask on r/seoul and they suggested me to get to Adaptable Human Solutions (counselling service), but it is too expensive. I tried Samsung Hospital and Yonsei Severance, but it is too expensive for us. I tried to get help from the government, but they refuse to help us.

First question. Exactly what color would this trench coat be? What is it called? I've attached 4 separate pictures where the colors may be slightly different (First 3 are the most accurate, 4th one seems more yellow), but there should be 1 main  answer I believe. This would help with my searching.

Second  question. Is there a specific name for the type of trench coat that goes below the knees in length? 95% of the trench coats I find that are even slightly similar aren't long enough (that or they have shoulder-pad-type things on them), and having a good keyword apart from ""long"" may be helpful.

312,"My dad is 68(soon to be 69) years old. He was overweight most of his life. Didn't listen to his doctors and because of it has destroyed his health. He has a really bad heart condition and probably is going to die in the next year. Because of the medication and his age he is really weak(coughing all the time,can barely walk,can't do basic tasks by himself)

He has always been superstitious. Believes in psychics and has spent a lot of money on them to remove ""curses"" and other things that he thought were responsible for his bad health instead of listening to his doctors and me and changing his lifestyle. He is paranoid and thinks that everyone(especially his doctor) wants him to die. I spoke to his doctor and he seems like a cool guy, everything he said to meade sense and he didn't look like the monster my dad described. I think that he cant just understand that his bad health might have something to do with his bad lifestyle. 

Anyways for some time Jehovah's witnesses have been visiting him every weak and talking to him. I have been in the house a couple of times when they were speaking to him. At the start they just listen to him complain about his life and how everyone is out to get him. That is innocent enough but then they start telling him about their religion. Telling him that people everywhere are lying to him. Saying that the world is about to end and what horrible things are going to happen to the non believers. After they say this,they ask him if he believes in one thing or another and he says that he does.

I have come to terms with the fact that he will be the way he is for the rest of his life because my attempts to make him see reason have failed. 

I would just like some advice on what to do so people wouldn't take advantage of him in his last couple of years on this earth.

313,"so here’s the back story.

idk how much of a niche thing this is (hopefully someone on here knows the era i’m talking about), but i started browsing reddit in early middle school when i *think* r/teenagers was pretty new. anyway, the exact year is kind of fuzzy, but based off of what i can remember due to family vacations and stuff, i believe in 2012 i was really into r/teenagers tinychat. if you aren’t familiar, tinychat is a (now) semi-dated group video chatroom website. anyways, that summer, i met this guy on there a couple years older than me, and i developed an e-crush on him lol. same thing happened for him and as far as i remember, we were e-dating (or something very close to it). i live in the midwest and he lives on the east coast, and he would always talk about wanting to come visit me. it was really pure and i remember this time more vividly than a lot of things from middle school. here’s where it gets a bit fuzzy. i don’t remember why we stopped talking, but it happened. i don’t even know how long we talked for. i was extremely depressed in middle school and i have very little recollection of a lot of it. i’ve pretty much tried doxing myself to see if anything from my online footprint can give me any clues about this timeline but i’ve found jack shit because i’m pretty sure i was smart enough to delete my cringey middle school posts after a certain point. i know this boy was really important to me, but i have no idea what happened between us.

this is where i need the advice. i remember his reddit username. he’s still active on that same account after all these years. hell, he posted just the other day. i’m 18 now and i think he’s around 20-21. i value my internet friendships, especially during this adolescent period of my life, because i had trouble connecting with a lot of the people around me at school. part of me wants to get in touch with him, but i’m worried about a few things. he’s a very heavy drug user (not hard drugs afaik) according to his post history. what if he doesn’t even remember me? if he does remember me, what if i did something really fucked up and that’s why we stopped talking? i’m at a loss, and if you’re reading this you’re probably gonna think i’m being super dramatic, but idk man i feel like i’m missing a crucial piece of my younger years from my memory and it’s eating away at me. if he remembers what happened, i want closure, but even if not, i feel like there’s still a chance of us being good friends if things work out. i’m gonna cut myself off before i keep writing down every single thought i have. someone just tell me why i should/shouldn’t bite the bullet and message my old friend.

315,"Hey Reddit,

I'm not sure quite how to put this one; I need advice. My coworker has been seemingly back and fourth lately. It began as a normal coworker relationship. I think because at the time we met, we both had significant others. As about 8 months has past, things between us are more... flirtatious? About two months ago I was dumped by my girlfriend, and she was more recently dumped by her boyfriend.  


To my knowledge, she is not interested in me. I figure this because of a story she told me about having sex with another man. I treated it as if she was \[and she is\] a good friend of mine. ""Good on you,"" I replied, but she emphasized how bad the ordeal was for her. As time went on from there, she has explained to me that shes not into fucking random people because of how the last one made her feel. -- Her telling me about her personal life and sex life puts me in the friend-zone to my knowledge. I was not offended or upset by this. But if she were to present a situation where she thought of more than friendship, I would not pass it up. There was another unusual instance, where a woman who used to work with us both met us for lunch. We will name the girl in question girl X and everyone else is more or less irrelevant. So an ex-coworker met girl X and I for lunch. At a point where girl X was not paying attention, our ex-coworker looked at me and told me to have have sex with girl X. Girl X did not hear our ex-coworker from what it seemed. Ex-coworker and girl X do talk outside of work when they worked together, but only really via text. This continues to be the case to my knowledge. 

&amp;#x200B;

During our time working together, there have been occasions where people from the office have gone out for drinks and the night out. These are normal, usual occurrences. Girl X, myself, and another in the office had planned on going out tonight for drinks and a good time. After work, we both went to the local bar within walking distance of the office. I had two shots of whiskey, she had two beers; I paid for the drinks. We sat around, talked a while, and both decided to get ready at each of our own places, and we would meet up later in the night. 7:30p comes around and I had driven give or take 20 minutes to her place. As time goes on, other people (coworkers and other friends) flake on the plans. It ends up as just her and I at her place. She had recently moved in around a month ago. She had to Facetime her mother to get the Netflix password and set it up in the living room. While we were talking, it wasn't quite the same as when we were talking at the bar. She had bought us a pizza. She hadn't sat next to me, nor seemed really interested in anything in particular that I had to say. I guess it was mostly small talk anyway. There were other subjects which went more deep, yet again not as other conversations with her had gone. Following us eating a little and watching Netflix, she yawned, stretched, and exclaimed how tired she was. I did not want her to have to be tired and stay up because of my presence; so I told her I understood and would leave. I started to get my things, and she jumped to tell me that I didn't have to leave right away. In my head, I'm thinking I'm getting the most mixed signals right now, and I'll tell you Reddit, I'm the most oblivious man there has been on the planet. Following her telling me to not leave right away, I said that she should tell me when to leave, as I now had no clue if she wanted me to leave so she could sleep or not. She told me after the episode of Friends was over to leave. So, as the episode ended, I gathered my stuff and left. As I was walking out, she apologized many times, saying that we were supposed to do something fun. I told her there was no reason for apologies, I understand being extra tired. She told me to hit her up if I was bored tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon telling some of my friends about the night, they claim I missed out on an opportunity to get laid. To my knowledge, she was not interested. I didn't try to make moves on her mostly because she was not close to me, so its hard to put an arm around her or touch her given that shes a far enough distance that I would have to move to do either. I guess another reason is shes my coworker, and I wouldn't want to ruin a friendship/working relationship for awkward encounters and potentially being avoided. The list kind of ends there, but morality comes into question a bit as well. In my mind, if she wasn't into it then I wouldn't be upset or act awkward. But let's just say she will  99.999% of the time let you know when shes uncomfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, I guess my question for advice would be, should I try and put moves on her or pump the brakes on it and friend-zone her myself? What kind of advice can I get for each option? --Lastly, less advice more questions here, what's your opinion on everything you've read? Am I being played? Am I over analyzing? Based off of the information provided, rate my chances of 1) sleeping with her and 2) relationshiping her up on a scale of 0-100; 0 being no chance. I'd prefer the latter, as for her, to my knowledge she is not interested lmfao.

Hey helpers of reddit,

I’m really struggling with something and feel I need some honest perspective.

I broke up with my boyfriend of five years recently (we took a break in October, then I ended it fully maybe a couple weeks ago).  It’s been a pretty rough time, as he’s a nice guy, but has had intense jealousy issues—I’ve been in an abusive relationship before, and I couldn’t handle feeling like I had to watch my step all the time again.

So, for the past five years, I’ve had a lot of different guy friends. As I’ve slowly let our friend group know that I’ve broken up, I’ve had a few friends suddenly message me and be seeking to hook up or potentially date in the future.

This, in of itself, I’m not mad with. It’s a little early I think, but I understand shooting your shot if you like someone after they’ve been unavailable all this time.

However, almost all (four out of the five) of the people that messaged me in this way got incredibly upset when I said it was too early and that I was taking some time for myself, etc. One of them is an acquaintance, so that’s not a huge loss, but the other three I’ve been friends with for a long time, two of them longer than I dated my ex. 

One guy in particular is a guy I’ve known maybe for eight years now and used to talk to all the time,  who after I said no told me he was “disappointed” in me “for not giving a good friend a chance” and hasn’t talked to me since.

I just... I feel so lost, and I can’t tell if I’m in the wrong here. I also have this incredible anger and hurt in my chest—a lot of it feels like I was lied to, in a weird way? Like the past five years people were just holding their breath for me to break up, and our friendship has been a lie. I don’t know. 

I don’t know if I should give them some time and then reach out to them, or let them come to me, or if I should apologize for something I’m not seeing? It also makes me wonder if I was even wrong about that part of the breakup—not that his jealousy was the only reason I ended things, but it was the factor that pushed things over the edge. If so many of my guy friends were like this, was he right to be jealous?

I’m also trying to deal with this mix of hurt, anger, and gigantic space (one space from the break up, doubled after losing these friends) in my life.  

I need help sorting this out in my head, so I’d appreciate any insight you could give.

Here’s the thing, I am so used to have all the house stuff and toiletries available on demand without ever having to pay for it, so much that I can’t fathom and just straight up refuse the idea of having to buy these things on my own. I don’t want to buy toiletries for my own good and basically steal from my housemate. I am very awared that I am by no means in a condition that I am financially unable, I just avoid/deny my responsibilities on it.

My housemate eventually found out, they brought it up with me, I denied at first but then came back to admit the whole things. They confronted me with a very level-headed and calm attitude. I told them I was sorry and they just left the house after that for work. Now I am feeling so horrible /(well, I AM horrible...)/. My housemate is a very nice person. I know that an apology wouldn’t do it and I should do something more, but I don’t know what’s that I can do to make this better, for both my housemate and my reluctant to spend money on toiletries...

325,"I met my close friend in the university, we used to go out a lot, go to the movie theater, eat at random restaurant or chill at my house. All my friends graduated last year and got a job while I still had 1 more semester to finish. Ever since they got a job they started to go out more and sometimes I had to not go with them because I was short on money, sometimes they offer to pay for me and I didn't refuse when they offered. I haven't seen them for a long time now.

 I got a job and every day I ask them let's go out or do something together and they always say "" sorry I'm busy"" ""I have other plans"" and let's re schedule to another day. Things been like that for a month now. Today I had enough and I was like WTF is wrong with you Guys I asked you every day for a month and not once you agreed. They were shocked why I got mad. The past month I was very happy I got a job and actually can do many things with the money and time I got, I wanted to spend it with my friends but they're somehow busy. Later they told me re schedule to another date and I was like ""No"" I'm sick off you guys rescheduling and then re schedule again. I muted the group chat and they tried to talk to me privately but I ignored them.

I wish my friend (someone’s who’s supposed to be my bf really) would stop associating with him.

And to be honest, she’ll just CASUALLY bring him up in texts. Like “oh xxxxx is so annoying today” “xxxx did this today god” she’s never saying anything good but she brings him up and I just want to pretend he doesn’t exist lol

Anyway, I've just gotten a letter from the orthodontist after 10 years of waiting, and they want a consultation in January, a few weeks before my 18th birthday. If I say no to getting braces, then that's my last chance to get them free, and if I wanted them after my 18th I would have to pay about £2000 for them.

I used to be very nice to people now im super mean. Just an asshole. Very passive aggressive. 
I always chase others. Because i want friends. If i dont chase super hard they wont even say hello back to me.

I couldnt even try to keep a conversation going for 5 minutes. When i meet others i try my best to entertain them and tell them everything about me. Then conversations get boring as hell..

They would send nudes to other guys without them asking for it. And i had to fucking beg for it. They didnt care about me they didnt like me they didnt love me and never valued me. Its like this most of times in real life too.

Situation: just turned 24, male, I have been single for 4.5 years and have had depression, anxiety and OCD since 15/16. 

My problem is ever since about 20 years old I have felt very lonely and in need of a companion, I know this for sure. However I find that I can’t really ever get interested in a girl or have that excitement that I’d really want to be with them for pure fun and company and hanging out etc. I find that I find them sexually attractive and when I’m in a arousal state of mood I am excited and think to be with them mainly for sexual reasons, however as soon as my arousal state is gone I am left completely un-interested in them but still left in a state of loneliness and lack of company. It is if I am only interested or want to talk when I am aroused. 

In the past 4.5 years I have only had 2 sexual encounters(hookups) due to me being highly cautious of who I meet, 4 dates of which I only developed feelings for one person and even then I felt slightly uncertain if I was only interested when aroused. And I had a “relationship” 2 weeks with one girl however I never enjoyed it and was treated horribly by her. However I have spoken to a large amount of girls via texting and 98% of them I only feel interested when I’m aroused.

369,"I currently live in the US and am a US citizen. I’ve been wanting to travel and work in Australia for a while. However, I currently have a job that doesn’t pay enough for me to leave.

372,"I am 21, she is 20. We met in the spring and she is now pregnant. We had a weak relationship which lead to me cheating on her, admitting it to her, and breaking her trust. I then earned her back, only to be unkind and borderline cold in my treatment to her. She wants to go through with the pregnancy and claims she wants nothing to do with me. She is driven by the irrational desire to have a child despite not being fit to raise a malleable mind into a rational, compassionate, and caring individual capable of fitting into the larger social puzzle. My chance to think of this was obviously in bed and now it is left to her, but I cannot fathom having a fraction of me brought into this world and me not being a governing part of it.

I’m definitely the one who has to initiate conversations. If I didn’t, and just sat in silence, there would just be more silence. Sometimes I’ll try to make conversation and I get a 1 word answer or in the middle of the conversation, he’ll walk away or get in his phone. I’ve mentioned to him that I’m trying to talk to him and I feel like he has no interest. So he will stop and listen for that one conversation then it’s the same thing over and over.  I know he is capable of chatty conversations. When he’s around his dad he talks and talks but with me, it’s forced.

382,"Recently in our work we have begun to scale up and are now working in a bigger place. My brother in law was just starting to get his small firm working. In the hopes of helping their family my parents help him with clients and now they are paying us to lease him a space in our workplace, to help him get his firm to really take off. It is really no problem and we enjoy the interactions as to even consider us all one same ""office"". He's been married to my sister almost 3 years and they have a 16 month old daughter. Last month they thought they might even be pregnant with a second child.  


He has 1 assistant whom he constantly takes to work, meetings, etc. She's very much similar to him, in humour, likes, attitude and even football fandom. All great. From the start they always were staying up later than everyone. 94% of time all of my team was gone and left them to close up. Again no problem, they're starting off and they're surely hustling to make all those deals go thru and what not.   


The problem is this past couple of months I have started to stay later bc of my own bigger clients and holiday traffic, and now I've noticed weird happenings. One night I left earlier than they did but I had to go back for some papers. It was late into the nite, past nine, I've never been there past eight. So I pulled into the drive and noticed their cars were still there. I got in and as I did I heard rustling and hurried steps above me, where their office is, and went for my things. As I was picking up things I just heard them leave. Without a word, hurriedly one after the other, they left no more than 5 mins after I arrived. Strange, I thought. Both of they are well known for their politeness and chattiness, good morning this and later alligator that.  


Then another day I went up to ask them about a project and some pricing. I open the door and there was no one on sight. Called them out, no answer. Dead silence. Strange. Upstairs is just their work area and a large bathroom w/a storage space. Couple of hours later. I go up again and there they were. With no exit/entrance but our 1 set of stairs that passes thru our floor and is in plainview.  


Now last night, after 2 weeks of constantly leaving on time early and even talking about it with my BIL about the leaving on time and seeing my family, I'm staying up late closing up, my BIL apparently gone for the day. So after an impromptu post work beers with the team. I'm all alone, light's all out, and even my car is so far back in the garage that it looks deserted. The garage door opens and as my BIL truck is pulling in he hesitates. Normally he just back ups and thats it. My place has a big window were we can see the whole garage. I look at the truck and notice that the passenger door opens quickly just outside the garage door and his assistant literally runs outside of view. In the opposite direction of where her car normally his.  


I don't really know what to know. My gut feeling is to talk to my BIL, but I dunno if I should tell him about all those things I've noticed. I don't know how to approach the subject. I feel there's a lot of smoke and there might be a fire. But I know it can make damage the relationship with my BIL if it's nothing. But if it's true then my sister should know and take the decision of what to do. She and her daughter is the one I'm most worried for.

385,"So, I'm a 23 year old guy with really bad social anxiety. Maybe general anxiety too, but social interactions are the fucking worst. I have zero idea how to interact with people outside of a professional work setting, I have one friend I see on a regular basis and I'm kind of able to hold a conversation with him but I'd say he's leading the conversation 80% of the time at least if not more. I'm scared to go to the gym because I don't exactly know what I'm doing and am afraid of being judged. I'm scared to go try yoga because one of my knees is bad / won't be able to bend all the way, and I'm afraid I won't be able to do some of the poses. I'm afraid to rent a car that I'm unfamiliar with (I've only driven one car in my life, it was nice, small, and very easy to drive) and drive in downtown SF traffic (where some of the drivers are super fucking aggressive) so I can drive out and take skydiving lessons. Oddly enough, at least in my head, I'm not afraid to jump from an airplane even though I have a fear of heights. That would probably change if I find myself in the situation of skydiving, I'll probably be scared then, but in my head right now I'm not. Perhaps most crushing of all, though, is I'm afraid to go on dates with girls. I've been on a couple and they went horrible, I was nervous to the extent that I couldn't mentally process what she was saying, I probably came off as not caring about what she was saying and that makes it even worse. I don't want to be alone but every time I go on a date with a girl it scars me for months on end to where I don't want to even attempt a date again.

Anyway, tldr I find myself being scared a lot and am wanting to change, so I can do more things, learn how to date and flirt, learn how to make platonic friends with people my age outside of the workplace... So I'm wanting to change things about myself.

In 2019 (not trying to make a cliche ""new years resolution"", but in the past couple of days I've kind of had this revelation so it just so happens to align) I'm trying to correct a bunch of this stuff, here's a subset of my goals because I feel like some of them are silly and I'm ashamed to share them publicly but I still think those are good goals to have:

- I'm going to go to at least a couple yoga classes, maybe only one if I have really, really bad anxiety the first time.
- I'm going to try skydiving.
- I'm going to try to read and cook more, instead of only playing video games and getting take out.
- I'm going to try to have a more interesting wardrobe (having a bunch of tech tshirts and cargo shorts make me a very typical young male in SF).
- I'm going to try to get in better physical shape, go to a gym multiple times a week, go out jogging multiple times a week, eat healthier, etc. Not that I'm in _horrible_ shape right now, but I definitely have a bit of weight I could lose, and I have basically no muscle.
- I'm going to try to go on at least one date where I'm not having a crippling panic attack the entire time, and actually enjoy myself.
- Start regularly going to meetups or other clubs where I can meet people my age in a non-tech focussed setting (which in SF is kinda a challenge in and of itself).

Anyway, tldr: Do I need to work on improving myself before I try putting myself out there on dating apps or talking to girls IRL (let's be real, I'm only going to use the apps, striking up a convo with a girl IRL sounds fine in theory but in practice I'd be a stuttery mess when just trying to say ""hello"" much less when trying to come off as attractive)?",29Dec2018,1

388,"40ish years old, female ex coworker asked me what kind of panties I was wearing, I told her regular one. All of sudden, she put her hand inside my leggings, touched my lace thong, and she gave me a dirty look. She said they are really seamless. 
Later, I quit the job because of the attention I was getting for dating half black/Asian man. The boss (female) asked me whether I had sex with him, his penis size, and sexual stuffs.  I told her that I'm not comfortable with this kind of conversation, and she said 'im like your mother's age, be comfortable'
The day I quit, I blocked everyone's numbers and change my phone number. The same ex coworker called my bf whether I got pregnant or not and then later on, half of ex co-workers from the job, texted/called/dm'ed my boyfriend to confirm my pregnancy. Everyone, including my parents thought that I got pregnant within the first month of dating someone.

Those happened about 4 years ago and they are literally haunting me down, especially after meeting one of the ex coworkers yesterday.... first thing she asked me was whether I have a baby or not.

My bf is aware of my mental issue, so he got me a part time sales job where I work alone and make less contacts with people. And there's this full time co worker who works in the same region, he goes to my store if Im not able to complete my schedule. 
And the other day, I found out, he  told receivers that I'm married to him. And what surprised me the most was, people actually believed him. I filed a complaint to the store after their attempts to make indirect insults to me. One of the receivers actually came and apologized, but I can't get rid of the look that he gave me when he asked if (23yo)i'm married to the 50years old man. However, I confronted the co worker in a group txt with the supervisor, and he said there was a miscommunication between ""English only speakers""
I've talked to a therapist, and whenever I talked about what happened, I burst into tears, and mumbles. She said I don't have to force myself to talk about it if I'm not ready. I don't think I'll ever be ready...
I'm frustrated because I know I could have talked to the labor department, and believe it or not I'm well defensed enough to fight someone physically who is bigger than my size.... I could have done something against them but I just couldnt. I wish I could stop thinking about those situations. I cant sleep lately, I feel like my brain is going haywire...
I just couldn't make any actions against them because it'd hurt my bf' social relationship. I honestly dont want to blame my boyfriend since he made sacrifices in different way, but he is really doing well in his life unlike me..

He then comes up to me multiple times throughout my shift and tells me Im beautiful, he wants to take me out, for my number blah blah. Whenever he and his friend would talk to me, they would also stand super close and get right into my face.

391,"Here is the lowdown: 

I'm the assistant manager of a small gas station. Paperwork, employee relations, etc. About two months ago the manager and I noticed that the cash drawer was short some about of money - more than just change. Her first instinct was to blame the one employee who is a little trashy. My argument was that we couldn't just blame people. Mistakes happen. Etc. 

Now, two months later, there's a consistency that the drawer is short dollars (between $5 and $40) every shift this employee is on. I thought it might have been another person on with her, but that's really hard to believe considering I'm one of them and the other was someone I trust endlessly.

Before, I made mention to this employee that they need to be more careful when counting out change. They seemed to laugh it off. When I directly ask them about possibly stealing, this person gets super defensive. (Quoting this person: ""This is bullshit. Why do I get blamed when the drawer is short? Why not (person on shift before her that she hates)?"")

It's at the point where the manager is going to have someone's ass, and I would prefer it not be mine for sticking up for this person.

396,"I believe this happened yesterday, or at least very recently. I work at a certain Sassy Corporate Twitter Burger franchisee, having only recently been hired on to this location. Yesterday, or at least very recently, a female coworker of mine (I'll call her Amy for the sake of this post) was grabbed by the nape of the neck and pinned down by GM. I wasn't present, so I don't know the full story, but there was one other witness present at the time. What info I have was expressed openly to our closing shift crew.

This guy is very clearly a creep. He heavily favors hiring female workers; he's employed like 75% women and high school girls to our store. Since I first started many of them I've spoken to have openly expressed that he's made unwarranted sexual jokes toward them, and has touched them inappropriately on multiple occasions. Amy has experienced this harassment before, multiple times, and if I understand correctly, telling him to stop or that she's uncomfortable hasn't deterred the dude in any way.

But it gets worse. She also contacted our district manager, but he claims he doesn't believe her. DM and GM are apparently *very* buddy-buddy, so much so that they were best man at each others' weddings... making me suspect this sort of thing is not only reoccurring, but systemic and brushed aside as nothing.

My dilemma is that I want to report DM for this, but I don't know how I should approach this. I'm afraid not only of him retaliating against the victim, but that corporate ultimately won't do anything and he'll continue to be able to ogle, harass, and assault more women there in the future. Did I mention some of my coworkers are underage high schoolers? But I don't have all the information, I wasn't there first-hand, and honestly I don't even remember Amy's actual name. If I called corporate now, would it still be enough for them to look into the matter? Should I wait until I've spoken further with Amy, to get more info or even just to ask if it's appropriate for me to step in like this? Should I consider getting police involved?

Maybe my post seems calm but I'm completely terrified inside. I've never been in a position like this. I'm not trying to be a hero but I can't let myself just sit back and not do anything. But at the same time, I'm scared of making things worse. No one deserves to go through that harassment.",29Dec2018,1
398,"My English might be getting rusty, apologies in advance. My partner (M/32) and I (M/33) have been together for nine years. Our relationship has always been solid. No major disagreements that I can think of. We click very well on the personality level and have similar needs. I think that's the main reason we've never faced a hurdle we couldn't communicate our way through.

Or not until recently. I'm actually still in the dark as to why we've been quarreling over so many insignificant things in the past year. We seem to get on each other's nerves constantly, either at home or outside, which is something that's never been a problem. In the last months, my partner's even taken on the habit of not sleeping in our bed night. He just dozes off on the couch. He denies doing it on purpose, but it's happened too many times for it to be a coincidence. I'm not sure what to make of it. We've also been having meals together less often, our communication has stagnated, and our sex life is underwhelming. However, I'm as attracted to and in love with my partner as I've ever been. He tells me he loves me too, and I have no reason not to believe him. I've known him for a decade and I can tell when he's genuine.

We've talked about these problems a lot. At first, we thought the sudden changes were caused by work stress. I was jobless for a month at the beginning of the year, while he was struggling at his new post. However, the issues between us didn't stop even after we took care of our work situations. As the petty fights continued, we decided to schedule an appointment with a couples' therapist to see if they could point us in the right direction. My partner was however less open to this option and decided to stop after three sessions, because he didn't feel comfortable. I agreed with him at first, as I also felt uneasy. I think the issue was that the therapist was very direct and confrontational, and it ended up being too much for us as beginners.

However, in hindsight, I think we were getting onto something in therapy. We discussed how we were still having issues with being completely open and honest about our relationship, even among friends and family. Neither of us is out at work, either. I'll be the first to admit I keep to myself and don't like mixing the different spheres of my life. And I've had some really negative experienced related to dealing with my sexuality with family members. My partner barely speaks to his own for similar reasons. Maybe that's the reason we're reluctant to explicitly tell people we're together or publicly discuss our relationship, maybe it's something else. I also can't be sure this is the only reason for the recent tension between us, as we've always been on the reserved side, but never faced major relationship problems for it.

Because of these doubts, I suggested trying counseling again with a different therapist to my partner. He didn't welcome the idea warmly, though. He said he'd do it if I genuinely believed another counselor would make a difference, but also made it known he thought we wouldn't get our money's worth from more sessions. Obviously, I don't want to make my partner do something he's uncomfortable with. So I'm not sure how to proceed. In your opinion, would it be wise to still try a different counselor? Are there other options we haven't considered? I'd like to hear objective insight.

**TL;DR:** My partner of nine years and I have been struggling with expressing affection towards each other like we used to, and keep pulling each other into petty arguments. We recently tried couple's therapy to help us resolve this, but stopped shortly because the therapist wasn't the best fit. However, I believe we began uncovering some problems and that it'd be worth trying out a different counselor, but my partner disagrees.

On the third day of one of these sessions I woke up to one of the guys very aggressively beating his meat about 3 feet away from me, not at all subtle, but he wasn't looking at me or anything (and I don't think he realized I woke up). He never made any inappropriate comments to me before or after that (though another guy on the site did). What I'm trying to figure out is if this is beyond the pale, or just a thing thats inevitably going to happen. I don't know if I should report it, or if I'll look like a baby if I do.

406,"Two weeks ago, my boyfriend of ten months asked to meet me before our scheduled date that evening. I was leaving for Christmas break from our college, and about to join my sister in Japan for the holidays, in a trip I was very excited about. Well, guess what, he dumped me. Out of the blue. Just said nothing was wrong, I hadn’t done anything wrong, he just didn’t think we were “compatible in the long term”. I was devastated. I was going to tell him that I loved him for the first time that night. And he’d broken a promise we made to each other - to always talk about something that was bothering us on the day it bothered us. He told me he’d been thinking about this for months and just decided with zero discussion. 

Had to have a friend drive me to the airport because I was a complete wreck. I got pretty close to hurting myself and not going on my trip but I texted a self-harm hotline, and it managed to get me through that extremely difficult night. Japan was fun and all but I could barely enjoy it. Which i hated. It was the trip of my dreams and I was so depressed I could barely function. 

I asked my mom to send me home early so I could see my family before having to go back to school for January term. Also, my sister was the only person near me and in the same time zone during those really rough two weeks, but she was just about the worst at handling my grief. I felt bad for her for having to deal with it, but whenever I got sad or depressed or cried she would tell me to stop, tell me to leave her when we were in public, or accuse me of just wanting attention. 

Finally I get home, I’m with my family, and my dogs. I’m finally starting to feel a little tiny bit better about the breakup (as in I could go a day without breaking down and sobbing) and my parents inform me that Shadow, my little dog whom I love so very much, has cancer and will live three months at most. My sister reacts horribly and lashes out at me even more. 
Additionally, I’m about to head back to school where I will have to actually for real face the fact that my boyfriend left me and isn’t there for me anymore. I have wonderful friends and family, but I just want to talk to him. 

It doesn’t feel fair. My grades also dropped last semester as I had a relapse with my anxiety disorders and I’m graduating in May with no idea what I want to do, because I was going to stay and get a job at my university so I could be near my boyfriend, since he had one year left. Plus it would give me another year to figure it all out. Now, it feels like everything is crashing around me at once and my sister is belittling my feelings constantly. 

I know these things might seem trivial compared to other things in life, but I’m hurting so much. I hate it. I hate it so much. I don’t want to die, because I know I’d just be putting others in pain like I’m in, i just kinda wish I could sleep for a long long time. 

I don’t know what kind of advice I need. I guess maybe just to hear that other people have gotten through stuff like this? Broken hearts and broken promises on top of really shitty life circumstances and unsupportive family? None of my friends have ever been hurt like this before. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend dumped me out of the blue, school is stressful, family unsupportive, my dog is dying, and I feel like everything is falling apart.

408,"Hi reddit. 

I’ve been with the same girl for a bit over 5 years now. She was 21 when we met and I was 20. We always planned to get married and live our lives together. We haw pretty much always lived long distance, and for the most part even in different countries. 

In the beginning, she was quite adventurous. Pretty new at sex, although she was not a virgin. We currently have a pretty strained sex love because she has a hard time with penetration. Even my finger is kind of uncomfortable. I’m guessing it’s a form of vaginismuth. She has talked to a doctor about it (reluctantly after me pressuring her for years) and they were pretty little help. I think it’s because she is Japanese and they are just a bit behind the times. They told her I need to try harder whatever that means?. 

She said she has tried penetrating herself with varying degrees of success. Every time we visit eachother, we are reluctant to have sex. She never initiated anything and seems dissinterested. I don’t know how to say it without being rude so I’ll say it quite bluntly. Most everything she does turns me off. Like if I go in for a kiss she just limply sticks out her tongue. I try going down on her and she does not moan. She kind of grunts a bit or groans rather than moans. I still try to make it work and I was eating her out and she just farted so I ended it there. 

I’m not sure what to do. We are pretty compatible when you take sex out of the equation, but I am extremely sexual. I feel like I am not myself because my sexuality is completely muted when I’m with her. What should I do?.",29Dec2018,1

410,"I’m a graduate student living in a very small studio apartment. I’m leaving this apartment in May to do a three month internship out of state, after which I’ll probably move into another small apartment with a roommate. This year my dad noticed that I do all my reading for school on my bed (which is admittedly less than comfortable) since I have no where to sit and bought me a huge, heavy recliner for reading as a gift for Christmas. 

It’s a really nice chair and if I lived in a forever home I would love it. However, with me moving so much at this point in my life it’s more of a burden than anything, there was a good reason that I didn’t have much furniture to begin with. I’m pretty dirt poor and don’t have the funds for moving trucks or storage facilities. 

I’m also going to have to completely rearrange my apartment to even try to fit it in. I really don’t have time/energy to do this with the new semester starting and I really like my apartment how it is. 

I really wish he had asked or given me the money he spent on this chair instead because that’s what I actually need. Unfortunately I think I mistakenly gave him a hint that I might want something like this when I first moved in because I mentioned missing my fiancées recliner that we had in our shared apartment last year. I feel so bad because he probably thought he was being really thoughtful and was super excited to give it to me. 

Is there any good way to tell him that I don’t want the chair? ",29Dec2018,1
412,"My sister has joint custody of her 5 year old daughter (my niece). I’ve never said this about any child but omg her daughter is a c*nt. She's spoilt, rude, bratty, feels entitled, ... I don't even think this kid has empathy anymore. And it's just been getting worse since the joint custody started 8 months ago. 

No kidding this kid told her grandmother that her Christmas gifts suck and she doesn't want them (they were beautiful clothes), she told me she hates my face, she goes round slapping and pinching people, and thats not even going into depth yet. My sister (kids mum) is always giving excuses like ”oh she's just tired” and ”shes just young”.... But I'm not buying it. 

I don't have any kids of my own so I can't really give parenting advice. But from my point of view- my niece is spoilt by daddy who is trying to overcompensate and plays the good guy and lets her run amuck with no discipline. And then when my sister has custody she over compensates and spoils her and gives into every whim, never wanting to discipline because she's hoping to be the favourite so her daughter will want to live with her fulltime. 

This kid pretty much just gets to eat ice cream and McDonald's every day. And both my sister and the dad are refusing to discipline or take this seriously. I want to be an Auntie that is active in this kids life but right now I'm thinking i’ll just keep away until she's older? 

I even tried talking to my niece earlier today and said ”hey, that's a nice toy” and she replied ”i don't want to talk to you” and walked away. When I told her ”that hurts my feelings, come back and apologize” she replied ”good luck”. And this is how pretty much the gist of our 2 second conversations go, and my sister thinks this is ok.

I honestly just want to smack her but she'll get coddled from mum and I'll probably be banned from seeing her. 

Any way, am I just be judgemental.... Are most 5 year old girls this way????

If not, what can I do? And I didn't buy her any xmas presents, I told her that Santa told me she was a naughty girl and she was zero phased by it. ",29Dec2018,1

I sometimes cancel plans with real friends just because I'm worried they aren't really my friends. I sometimes don't shower for days because its easier to not get cold from the water. 

Idk how to get out of this loop and just feel like I'm only happy when I'm being distracted.

Obviously he isn’t a professional trainer, and he wasn’t very good at explaining what to do, I ended up for the most part just watching him and tried to recreate it. 

I ended up doing bad form and now my lower back hurts. 

Now It’s the second day since the injury and since the day of the injury it hurts for me to try to bend over. Like I have to crouch and lower my entire body to pick up something off the ground, I can’t bend over much at all. 

It also hurts to twist my torso left or right. When I walk I feel some discomfort and pain a little above the tail of the spine / in the general lower back area. 

Sitting on uneven surfaces cause discomfort

I don’t feel any numbness anywhere which is good news. 

I didn’t notice any popping sounds in my spine when I was performing the deadlifts either, I think it was overall just bad form. 

The bad thing is that I did like three or four sets of 90 lbs or so all probably wrong form. 

Overall I’d describe the feeling as extreme tightness in my lower back but I’m scared of these stories of people throwing their spinal discs out of wack.

439,"I got logged out of my google, facebook, reddit and amazon accounts. I didn't do it actively, I didn't clear my browser history or anything else which has caused stuff like that in the past.

I still know all my passwords - that's not the problem at all. I just find it weird/worrying that it happend at all.

&amp;#x200B;

insta rightly gives me a copyright warning for copyright music but thats just auto detected by their audio software

&amp;#x200B;

if I then say I have 'copyright rights for audio' even if I dont and restore it whats the chances that a massive record label will care about someone with &lt;1k followers and sue me?

&amp;#x200B;

realistically insta would have to investigate me personally/someone specifically would have to copyright flag me for me to face consequences right which seems really unlikely ? (the dance is choreo'ed to that song specifically so I really can't change the song haha)

444,"Something is really going wrong. I feel like it started a week ago. I’m having a lot of very graphic and violent intrusive thoughts about doing some of the most reprehensible things imaginable. I’ve had this issue before but it feels like it’s been almost four years since it was this bad. 

I’ve had some major fits recently of crying and I feel like I have a headache almost every day. I hate my life and everything honestly feels so unimaginable hollow and unimportant. I just want this all to stop. 

I’ve had a huge increase of hateful thoughts too. Especially racist ones. I’ve been thinking very positively on Nazi Germany. I know this is something new, I’m not a white supremacist and I’ve never been one. I’ve had a few PoC interact poorly with me and my mind instantly races to how much worse they are than me. Anytime it’s anyone poor I think about how much better of a class I’m in than they are. It’s like I’m finding the worst on anyone who slightly angers me. 

I’ve always had issues with my gender, and thoughts about that are worse than ever. I am hating myself so much and I see myself as a crazy person for wanting to change my gender. I really do hate myself. 

It honestly feels like something has screwed up my thinking big time. I feel like everything is breaking down. I haven’t been able to see my therapist over the holidays because it’s through my university. I’m making a visit as soon as I can though. 

I just don’t know where this all went wrong. It feels like it gets worse everyday. I thought I was finally on the upswing in my life and now it seems I’m spiraling out of control. ",29Dec2018,1

446,"I’m a 40 year old guy- gay- in the closet and single for a long time. Over 18 months ago, I started working along with a guy who was the same age, single, never married , no kids and only twice mentioned former gf’s. He’s very private - so in retrospect I suppose I never knew him. During the summer we appeared to become incredibly close- constant texts, laughs, in-jokes between us, retweets and twitter messages. We never socialised outside work - except for work related stuff but there was at the very least real and increasing warmth between us. 

Then  after he had a week off in August all changed- the texts dried up and became noticeably shorter- no emojis, no laughs, and a visible wall between us- he became distant and his mood was up and down like a yo-yo! More recently he announced he was bored in his job and has got a new one. 

At present he’s working his notice and is sullen, negative about everything and passive aggressive a lot of the time. He seems hostile to me and seems to be saying things or being awkward just to annoy me- as if I did or said something. I’ve repeatedly asked him if there was anything up with him but continue to meet a wall except for vague mentions of demons, personal issues and once-work boundaries. He seems to spend all his time on Twitter now- particularly over the Holidays and replying to strangers.

1.) Know that your situation is temporary 


2.) Keep applying to jobs everywhere in your community (even work a second job if you want). Keep on the lookout for ""Now hiring"" signs on the corporate &amp; small business signs in your local area. 

3.) Check back in with the workplaces you've applied to relatively quickly just days after applying to check for updates. 

4.) Find other people that make you feel good &amp; reach out to them for support.

452,"So, I’m a 23 year old female who has been having a really hard time figuring out what I want to do with my life ever since I graduated high school. 

After high school I had no idea what I wanted to do so I just started working. I briefly went to college and got a certificate but was never able to obtain a job with that certificate. After that I continued to work but did leave a full time job a couple of times to pursue some schooling but I never followed through and finished it. Last year I decided I wanted to be a hair dresser so I left my job and enrolled in beauty school. About a month in, I realized that I didn’t like it and couldn’t visualize myself doing that job for the rest of my life. So I left school (I had completed too much of the program to get a refund and now have to pay back the 10 thousand dollar loan which is pretty shitty) and once again began working a 9-5 administration job. Just this past month I have gotten a new job as an AP Clerk at a great company. 

I recognize that this new job is a good opportunity, I’ve already learnt a lot from it and I’m making good money. My issue is that I think I’ve decided I want to be a pharmacy technician and think I will start the process soon of upgrading a high school course I’ll need and then going to college for it soon.  My problem at the moment is that while doing my high school upgrading, I want to switch to working a retail job instead of this new AP Clerk job that I started this month. My reason for this is that working in retail will give me more time to actually focus on my school work. My new job is quite intense and I don’t know how well I’ll be able to handle working there and doing school work. My boyfriend thinks I should just stay at this job until I’m done my upgrading but deep down I don’t feel like I want to. I’m at this point in my life where I feel that at the very least I need to do this upgrading. 

How do I know if I’m making the right decision? 
How do I force myself to stick to something? I feel that’s my biggest issue, I never finish this and always feel like I’m sabotaging myself. How do I overcome that? 

I’m worried that I will make a whole bunch of changes in my life and then it’ll be the same situation as when I went to hair school. Deep down I feel like I want to pursue becoming a pharmacy technician but I’m worried I’m going to make the same mistake again and don’t know how to really figure out what I want in order to avoid doing so.

455,"Hey everyone. 

I don't know if this subreddit is the appropriate place for this but anyways, I'll get straight into it: How do you start standing up for yourself? Or better, how do you stop others from treating you like shit?

I grew up as an overweight kid (I'm 18 now) and used to always have other make fun of me for it. I typically never said a thing or never told them to stop and to this day I find it difficult to tell others to stop doing things that bother me. When someone disrespects me or breaks my trust, I continuously forgive them for it. This really affects my 'dating-life too'; I've been told by a girl I liked that I was a ""pussy"". Hell, she came up to me and asked why I kept letting her treat me like shit right before that - I just can't express myself honestly, and maybe that has to do with being overweight in that past. 

I eat healthy and frequently go to the gym. Still not confident with my body but I'm working on it. I didn't feel like I could talk to anyone else about this cause I wouldn't want to be judged. I'd really appreciate any advice or help I can get. ",29Dec2018,1
456,"I know the question seems weird, but let me give you some context. I'm a chinese guy born in canada who speak cantonese (not read). My parents put me in a chinese mandarin school when I was young, problem : the teacher speak mandarin and my parents speak cantonese to me at home, so I didn't understand a thing and basically drop out, cause the language is way harder than english and I was young and the teacher speak mandarin jesus and didn't practiced it a home at all, so kind of messy. Now that I'm older, I can notice that I'm attracted to traditional asian girls, who are mainly yappie since I go to an engineering school.

Now you guys are like, well then why don't you just find a girls that only speak cantonese like you duh, well from my experience, all the chinese asian girls speaks either mandarin or cantonese and mandarin, like legit even the half vietnamese speaks some mandarin damn and also I may get out of the ""competition"" if they speak more language than me.

Now you guys may say, well why don't you just learn the fcking mandarin dude, that's so simple, well the problem is, I'm not regularly speaking mandarin, actually, I never used it, and I saw somewhere that you can loose a language real fast if you don't use it often and all the yappie asian girls will probably communicate with me in english too, and it's one of the most difficult language in the world, like even the natives forget some characters, and also I'm not good at learning a new language, mainly because I have nobody to practice with and my memory is not the best and yeah I'm mainly learning the language to get status.

Btw, I'm an absolute virgin and have no life experience and I'm not even sure I'll end up with that kind of girl, actually I'm not even going for the most smart/successful girl, just going for the traditional/geeky asian girls, but my experience so far are yappie girls lol.

Unfortunately I was never successful in my goal, however, ultimately I feel this may have been a blessing in disguise as it has reengaged me in Law and I feel this has been the best thing that could have happened as looking objectively, I am quite good at Law and may have been following the wrong path by not pursuing it.

461,I’m a STAH mom with 3 kids and since my husbands infidelity I have gone downhill mentally. I need advice because I  can’t find a way to cope/overcome the circumstances. Many months have gone by and I still struggle to pick myself up and stay strong for my kids. I discovered his secret email account where he was meeting up with strangers (mostly men) for casual sex all the time. This was happening throughout the entire relationship&amp;marriage. I have already been tested twice for diseases and thankfully I’m ok. He says this is all due to a sex addiction and he claims he is a brand new person and is completely changed (I would be a fool to believe that) We live together still and I stay home with the children still. We don’t have much money and I apply to jobs often but haven’t found a good fit yet that will allow me to be home in time for my son after school and so forth. I’ve considered night shifts but I do fear I’ll be exhausted and unable to care for the children. I have been getting into better shape and truly trying to remain my happy self but I won’t lie I don’t know where to turn or how to make this situation right. I don’t think living under the same roof is healthy anymore for anyone. I don’t want to put my kids in a worse living situation either... but I know something  has to happen so I don’t end up stuck depressed. If anyone has some suggestions or advice I would love to hear it. It’s not easy to put my business out there but I do need support. I also will mention I don’t have my parents for support and any family/friends I’ve reached out to don’t really seem to want to hear it or be there for me I sense it makes them uncomfortable when I talk about it and I don’t feel really close with anyone these days.

463,"Ok, so, where to start.. My girlfriend has a younger brother, let's call him Jake. Well, three years ago when I met my girlfriend, her brother was a fairly normal 18 year old. Over the past two years, he has gotten HEAVILY involved in the Flat Earth Theory, sometimes violently yelling to get his point across.      

He lives with my girlfriends parents. Well, over time he has gotten worse. The next thing that started happening was he would misinterpret things people were saying and think they were talking about him. An example of this is one time he came to visit my girlfriend and I, we live about an hour and a half away, and we went walking and talking. We were talking about one of my friends and i said ""well at least I have someone to lay down with at night."" This was in reference to the friend we were all talking about and he left as soon as we returned home. He told everyone that we were talking about/mocking him. This has happened to a few family members. Now, it has escalated to the point of him hitting the family dogs for no reason and violently pushing them around. 
He says strange things, even about TV ads. He has gotten to a point of starting a fight with someone right before a family get together such as Thanksgiving and Christmas so he can leave. He came over to our house a couple of weekends ago and stayed all day. When he went to leave he called his mother and told her that we had keyed his car. It was ridiculous. Then he had a breakdown because he ran out of gas AT a gas station and was going to make his mom come one and a half hours to ""help"" him. Everything is a conspiracy to him. His mother and father that he lives with are very kind people who sometimes dont know how to put their foot down with him. He's grown now. 
He absolutely refuses to see a doctor and the father told my girlfriend the other day that he is scared to be in his own house. They ignore the issue though. If you tell them he has a mental illness they will change the subject, just completely refuse to acknowledge the problem or take responsibility for it. They will not give him an ultimatum of getting help or moving out. The parents are too scared of him to even say anything when he hits the dog. I guess what I'm asking is what is the best way to go about handling an issue like this? 
My girlfriend messages with him alot through Facebook messenger but she doesnt talk to him about any of it. We are just at a loss at what to do. Oh, I may want to add that he does do hallucinagens heavily sometimes, not all the time and he told my girlfriend that when he does any drug, he wants to be completely fucked up, not just a little bit. Theres so much more I could add, but it would be a book. Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",29Dec2018,1

Trust is never an issue, we always have a great time, and we’re supportive to one another. I always believed in there being some sort of higher power and it very loosely related to Christianity. My mom is gay and has suffered a lot for it in my younger years and the idea of something telling me she’s to be damned to hell isnt.. ideal. So I just liked the idea of something being there just more loving and understanding. 

Here’s the problem.
When me and my boyfriend met, I understood I’d have to compromise and step into his world some. So I did and I try to have more faith in God but I doubt a lot because I have that need to have proof or something tangible. Today he tried to tell me the world isn’t even 1000 years old in reference to the Bible. I can’t for the life of me show him how scientifically incorrect that is because I don’t even know where to start. This also makes me struggle a lot internally because now I feel like I’m set up to fail with faith because I rely on scientific facts.

I went to the bathroom and found out I started my period today (if that has anything to do with it) and was extremely nauseous and dizzy while trying to use the toilet. I go back to bed and lay down for another twenty minutes or so, and it only gets worse. I get up and tell my parents and I lay down with my mom for a half hour or so, and the nausea comes in waves. Mild, not at all, extreme. My dad said he’d run to the local drug store for some pepto bismol, and about five minutes after he left, I got the infamous in-the-back-of-your-throat throw upy feeling so I ran to the toilet and threw up.

466,"I’m really starting to reevaluate our friendship over this. We’ve been best friends for almost 6 years and we’ve been through so much together and grown together. We have so much in common and I genuinely love being around her. I was there for her when she was getting out of an abusive relationship and she was there for me when I lost my mom. 

About a year ago she moved in with her new boyfriend in a city about 45 minutes away from me. At first, I had no problem driving over there once a week to hangout because there are so many interesting restaurants and culture where she moved and I enjoyed getting away for a few hours. However it started getting to the point where I felt like it was getting unfair. She asks me to hangout and every once in a while I’ll suggest that she just comes over here and then all of a sudden she can’t hangout anymore. There’s always some excuse. When she lived in the same town as me we usually hung out at my house so I know it’s not because she doesn’t like being there.

I feel like it’s either one of two things. Either her boyfriend (who I don’t know very well) is controlling like her last douchebag and saying she can’t drive over here because I’m a guy (even tho he knows I’m gay) or she doesn’t feel like using her gas and time to come over here despite the fact that I’ve done it every single week for an entire year.

467,"It won't let me tag it, but this is my original content. 

Ok, so I am finally feeling like letting the world know what happened to my family and I towards the end of July this year. It is painful to talk about, and very anxiety-inducing, but maybe some of you can learn something from what happened to us or can give me insight if it's happened to you. So, for some backstory: My husband and I and our two children moved into this 1800's upper story brick apartment in a small town in NW Indiana. Two store spaces were vacant below, and one vacant space across the hall. Rent was cheap and the company we signed with (We will call them Rental Company A) told us that all utilities were included with the rent. Everything was fine for the first six months. There were a few minor repairs that never got fixed along with the electric in our bedroom not working, but we let it go since rent was cheap. In May, we got a notification on the internet that our rental company went out of business overnight...so we had no landlord. This went on for a month when we got an email stating that Rental Company B was taking over. We instantly worried about the utilities, since it was in the lease that they were taking care of it. After SEVERAL persistent emails to the landlord, he assured us on May 8th that utilities were ordered in his name, so that dispelled our worries about how our utilities were being taken care of.

In June, our stove went out. It didn't get fixed or replaced, so we started billing the company for a rental replacement. On July 1st of this year, our compressor on our refrigerator went out, leaving our food in the fridge and freezer both to spoil. We called maintenance, and they said that someone would not be out until the 5th because of the holiday. It indeed got replaced, along with the stove on the fifth. We had to pay for a ton of food to be replaced by the way-not happy about that.

So, now it's July 26th and my husband packed us up in the car (they are four and one now) and took us to the local county fair for the day. It was 96 degrees and sunny, and by the end of the day we were so tired and just wanted a shower and our ac unit. We arrived home to a sweltering heat, and no power. NONE. We tried flipping all the breakers, and the neighbors had power, so we instantly got concerned that the actual power was shut off. We called maintenance and they said that a guy was coming out to check on the breaker boxes and to flip them...even though we had already done that. He did. And...of course there was no power. So we called the manager again. He said he would be in contact with the power company in the morning, and that we should pay for a hotel overnight. So, we packed up the exhausted, filthy children and headed to the closest hotel and awaited his confirmation that he had ordered a room. It took an hour and 45 minutes, sitting in the dark waiting for his call back. Finally we checked in and spent the night, checking out at his direction the next day. He called us telling us that the power should be back on. It was not. Across the hall in the vacant, moldy and destroyed unit there was power, but not in our home. We made more calls. Meanwhile, we couldn't cook, clean, even have cold drinks. We had just paid rent, and my husband had JUST started a new job, so we didn't have a ton of money saved up to buy fast food (and the kids were tired of it soon anyways). A whole other day went by, and he said he would pay for one night in the hotel. So we checked in and did it all over again. By now, the food in the fridge and freezer was starting to smell horrendously, and we also had a large deep chest freezer in the spare room that was rotting by the second. We were too scared to open it and get anything out after 24 hours. The next day, my husband had to work his 12 hour shift at the steel  mill, so he left me the car. The manager assured us that the power company was coming out in person to see what the malfunction was and to hook it up. My children and I checked out at the time that we had to and headed there. Nobody showed up all day. It was hot and there was one window in the whole apartment, and no breeze. We spent most of the day in the library which was air conditioned and I could charge my phone.

The next day,  he said he would come out to investigate more. The maintenance man came out and stared at the boxes, which had red shut off tags all over them. He pretended not to know what was going on and then called the power company. I am in dirty , sweaty, clothes, pushing a stroller with my daughter in it and son following me, in the 90 degree shade with bottled Propel water and am in no mood to be jerked around. After about a half hour he got out of his air conditioned truck and said these words (that I have on video to this day) ""Well, it seems the bill never got switched over into our name. And when the bill got four months behind they shut it off. When the company came out they switched on all the units except for yours because that box is unsafe. Its hanging off the damaged brick and they cannot connect power to it until the wall is repaired."" I said ""That's your job is to fix things and pay the bills that are supposed to be paid. We are homeless right now, what are we supposed to do?"" He said ""I don't know, but we are capped out for hotel expenses and cant pay anymore, so you should just go upstairs and stay there until something can be done.""

I began crying hysterically and started walking. We ended up at the police station where I sat in the shade and asked the policeman there if there were any shelters around we could go to. We were out of money and out of options. In our area there are no shelters or anything of the sort. He suggested we stay with family. The closest we had was 500 miles away, so that wouldn't work. I called my husband and cried and cried. He immediately called the manager and he said he would put us in a hotel for 3 more days (the weekend) while he got estimates to repair the building and fix the wall so we could get back in. He accidentally ordered a king suite which had a living room and a whirlpool tub, so we took advantage of the good karma and tried our best to relax that night. It didn't work. I had already lost dozens of pounds from worry, and the kids weren't sleeping well and were frustrated and just wanted to go home. If you have never had to explain stuff like that to your kids, its harder than you think and is painful all the way around.

The next day, we got a call from the landlord. He said that there was no way the building was getting fixed, and that we had a total of THREE DAYS to vacate the premises. He would NOT pay for a hotel more than those 3 days we had, and expected us to be out and have the apartment cleaned. Now, this is without any paperwork or anything to force us out, but we couldn't stay there anyways. The rotten food and smelly septic was making it a danger zone. It was an end game. We had no other choice.

Who can realistically find, pay for, and move into a new rental in 3 days? Honestly? But we did. My husband called an old friend in real estate and she had a house come available that day for rent. It needed cleaned and was only 2 bedrooms when we needed 3, but we could have it. I called my parents and begged them for money, something I never had really done and hated to do, but we had nowhere else to come up with 1500 bucks for utility start ups, deposit, rent, and a moving truck. While my husband watched the kids in the new house, I single-handedly moved everything that was necessary out of the upstairs apartment, loaded it, moved it, and unloaded it. We left half of what we owned behind because I physically couldn't do it. There were 42 stairs on that stairwell, and I went up and down them every two minutes for almost 12 hours. I couldn't walk right the next three or four days. I was covered in bruises and my muscles felt like they were snapped rubber bands.

Once we were in the new home, my husband called the old manager and tried to get our deposit back. He said for that to happen we would need to do a walk through and if it was in perfect shape, then we would get it back. He hung up and my husband called several lawyers for advice. How can we clean in the pitch black, with rotten food and unsafe conditions? We took their advice and filed a claim in the courts. We sued for every bit of food we lost in the fridge, freezer, and deep freeze. We sued for all the months rent that they had control and never paid the utilities. We sued for hotel cost, food cost for all those days, deposit, and moving expenses along with the new deposit and rent we had to pay. The owner never showed up for court, so it defaulted in our favor. We had him served at his company by a sheriff. No replies and he has not shown in court twice now, leaving him in contempt. The judge was disgusted by his behavior, and said that if he doesn't show this next time, he WILL spend a minimum of 30 days in jail for contempt. He will have to be pulled over and have the police see his bench warrant, but with his public driving convictions, he is a crappy driver and that won't take long.

So, currently we are still waiting on our money. Our oldest son is not the same. He has panic attacks when the lights flicker or a storm blows them out. I panic in the same fashion, and believe we have a type of PTSD. I try to keep my anxiety under control but its difficult. I always have this feeling that everything stable can be ripped out from under us whenever it feels like it.

We have called and texted both him and his company to try and recoup the judgement. We have left emails. He owns over 600 properties in the city alone, so 4000 dollars should be cake to pay. We believe he is doing it just to do it. The next court date will be soon, and we are hiring a process server to track him down and serve him. The judge said we WILL be paid, he will see to it. So, anyways, we are happy now in our small house, and are under a fantastic landlord who fixes anything and everything and checks in on us all the time. I wish there was something we could do for her to repay her for all she's done. One day, we will be buying a house from her. I have finally calmed down enough that I have started writing again, and finished my first novel. My husband's job is fantastic and pays amazingly well; plus he loves it.

If there is anyone out there that can relate to this, please let me know. Thanks for reading and I hope this reaches someone who needs to hear it: Even if life seems to be impossible and there seems to be no way out, be patient and wait a little bit. You never know who or what will come along and help you when you need it. What comes after your lowest point can be absolutely beautiful.

468,"Does anyone else have this problem?

A little background. When I was with my ex,almost anytime she called me it would be bad news. My mother unfortunately did this a lot too. This was over years of this.

Now anytime the phone rings I get instant anxiety expecting something bad and even though half of them are just business related or setting up activities the initial fear generated from the phone ringing is always there.

I'm not afraid of talking on the phone I am irrationally afraid that it's going to be bad news.

Secondary bother is that face to face conversations are superior I can read and interpret messages from others much better because I can see body language, over the phone it is just voice.

I often will not answer the phone call when it first rings because of the anxiety it brings. I'll wait 5 minutes to prepare myself and then call.

I know this is completely irrational and I was wondering if there is any tips of getting over this? After all phone calls are an essential part of life these days.

Does anyone else have this irrational fear? If so any advice on how to get over it? ",29Dec2018,1

470,"(Sorry for the long post, but I have never really gotten the this off my chest before until now)

I have told precisely 3 people this, but I am pretty sure I was molested as a kid. I'm one year younger than the cousin who did this to me, and I remember being 8 or 9 when it happened. We stayed over at my grandma's house pretty often back then, especially during school holidays, and I really looked up to my male cousins. They always brought over their playstation and I was always trying to, in a way, prove my worth to them. I laughed at their jokes, fought to be in the same team as them in games, to the extent that I'd shut out, or even laugh at my own younger brother if my cousins were doing it (I have since spoken to my brother about this and apologised, and today I'd consider him to be one of my closest friends).

It got to the point that I remember asking myself if it was wrong to want to marry your own cousin. I don't know if he knew about this and deliberately took advantage of it, or if I was simply the easiest target for him to test out his curiosities. At that point in my life I was completely naive and had no clue of anything sex-related. But I remember him asking me, one day, to follow him into a room. He then shut the door and told me to lie down with him on a mattress, under a blanket, before asking me if I'd like to be his girlfriend. 8/9 year old me was thrilled and agreed immediately, to which he replied that girlfriends often take their clothes off and allowed their boyfriends to touch them. So I did. It never occurred to me over the many times it happened that something was wrong. I wouldn't until a couple of years later, and I stopped staying over.

Since my realisation I have felt this constant unease with my own body, even when I am simply showering, and subsequently harboured this hatred for the majority of my extended family. I hated that this had happened to me, and felt that I can never tell anyone in my family out of fear of people not believing me, accusing me, or even tearing the family apart. I hate that I have to maintain a polite facade in front of them, in front of my own molester, because they expected that respect from me. But slowly I began to rebel - I would ignore everyone during family meetings, or simply glare at them, or just skip out on it entirely. More than once I've gotten nagged at by my parents, about how family is the most important thing that I'll have and that I need to learn to embrace it. But I couldn't tell them. To me, all I really need is my immediate family. I don't want to think of or acknowledge my molester or the family that raised him that way. But that's okay, I'll keep this secret, I thought to myself. Over the years, however, I learned to let down (some) of my walls, and I have since told 3 people about this. My brother simply shrugged and ignored it. My best friend sympathised but quickly switched topic. My boyfriend is the only one that has been really sweet about it, and has continued to be gentle with me and my body, making sure to check in with me whenever we got intimate, in case my feelings of violation started coming back.

I don't know if I'm overthinking it, but I often think back on that interaction with my brother and my best friend, and wonder if I'm making it out to be more than it is. Is it bad that I am unwilling to forgive? Are my feelings invalid? Was it not molest simply because we were both children? Should I ever tell my parents, so that they can understand where I'm coming from? What if they tell me that it isn't relevant? What if they feel the need to tell the rest of my family?

476,"Sorry for using the word ""I"" so much. I wanted to take it all of my chest. I have nothing left to think at.

I feel like my life is made up of shards that I cannot pick up and mold together. 
It all started 6 years ago, when my parents got divorced. We just moved in with my mother in this rustic mountain town. I used to be top of my class, I was a really smart and outgoing kiddo that made everyone feel in their place. I was energetic and had an answer to everything. Unfortunately I picked on the habit of smoking weed every now and then; it was nothing serious until 9th grade.
When I got into the best high school of my city, I was so proud of myself, since it is this prestigious institution that everyone either looks up to or antagonizes. I was really popular and got invited to lots of events, I even got to go to contests and winning was never really something out of reach. It came naturally.
The following year my mother moved to another country (the one we left in the first place) because of work related reasons. This is when things got out of hand as I missed a lot of opportunities in HighSchool. I didn't get to be the pupils council president and lost my motivation to the French language(one of the fields I was excelling at). It was fun and all, yeah, so much liberty at a young age but my sleep was becoming erratic, my relationship with my younger brother got worse and worse and my dad suffered an cerebral vascular accident. We were alone. It was like we had nobody. My friends were there all for the smokes; too bad I didn't know better. Then came the harder drugs; the party drugs. I fucked up school. But we took care of ourselves.
My mom came home eventually. My dad s health got better with time. My brother moved w my dad to the capital and so my libertarian behaviour continued. I got really into psychedelics: Mushrooms, acid tabs, DMT; anything I could get my hands on. I thought I was being independent, spiritual. But the anger was still there. I started taking it out on people at my school, and went on and skipped even more classes, just to find &lt;&lt;like minded people&gt;&gt;. I became a jerk, one that is angry with himself. I stopped reciprocating. I learned to hate.
 I got surrounded by shit people, mobsters and wise guys wannabes. One night my mother caught me smoking DMT and she could tell I was doing drugs; the angrier she got the more we started insulting each other. I started crying so bad I had an emotional crysis. I still feel like something is missing inside of me since that episode. I was really high and I just exploded.
 Then it happened again; I came home fucked up on barbiturics and we started fighting. I was insisting that she won t ever have to work again, that I could make all the money we needed. It was a messed up situation. We started seeing shrinks and psychologists and eventually I got into a mental hospital for children. I stood there for 10 days; had a couple of friends who came to see me.  I got out but it wasn t the same. Everyone was looking at me weirdly. I became the bad guy, the one everyone should take as a negative example. Beware of the big bad wolf.
 Nevertheless I continued doing drugs while following the psychiatric treatment (mood stabilizer and antipsychotic). Then I suddenly stopped taking it and I fell into the blackest hole I could imagine. I stopped talking. The depression was centered around my supposed stupidity.  I spent a couple of months bedridden, afraid of people; afraid to socialize. Going out at night was the only way of avoiding people. I wanted to kill myself. I started taking a SSRI in October last year and going twice a week to therapy.
Months passed and I finally got the courage to go to school. At first it was difficult as many people were asking questions about my health, and my anxiety wasn t helping either. Slowly but steady I worked my way through 12th grade and took my  baccalaureate with a 9.50/10. I was working non stop. I even started going out with girls again and my self esteem was up and going. Keep in mind I didn't use any substances or smoked any weed in this period.
Sadly, starting July the illusion of drug abuse took hold of myself again. I remember at least 10 nights when I got as fucked up as I could just because. By October I even went as far as trying heroin and quitting the SSRI. I stole money from my father and bought drugs so that I could give them away to people at parties(also started University, moved in with my dad).
When it finally caught up to me the psychologist told me I developed a drug induced psychosis (as I was indeed very disorganized in thought) and the psychiatrist at the clinic gave me a treatment of Depakine Chrono 300 twice a day and Olanzapine 5mg at night. They told me it s very much curable since it is substance induced. They even told me they liked me.The memories since Uni started are kinda fuzzy since I was high half the time.
A month and a half passes and all is well, I ve quit drugs since (had to basically) and my mother informs me that the treatment is the same they gave me in the hospital a year and a half prior. We got scared since it may induce depression and the same toxic thinking patterns of me demonizing myself and I decided to half the doses. But it happened again. I stopped talking. I cannot form new ideas or can hardly put them into words. Basic tasks are tedious and take me a lot more to process. Basically I cannot think as fast as I used to and cannot express myself and it makes me feel miserable. I have no more friends. I am lonely and miserable. My first psychologist told me that I am one of the few that made it through the first time, but it doesn't help me atm. I am scared of being like this again. I am getting older and the kid shield is cracking. I have nobody to talk to.
I have nowhere to hide. The weird part is that I don't want to hide. I wanna be a man. I wanna be a winner. How do I become one? 
Where is the kid that used to be at the top and got to go places and have friends? He probably has his heart broken. ",29Dec2018,1
478,"To keep it short, when my boyfriend goes out with his friends I feel something like really bad anxiety. It’s like my chest starts burning but it’s not physical pain it’s just really intense emotion. It’s like a mix of anger, anxiety, and jealousy but neither of those emotions individually sufficiently describe how it feels. 

I always get really uncomfortable and anxious if he is drinking, or even if his friends are drinking and he is sober. 
I don’t have a problem with alcohol, though, as I drink, myself. And I don’t feel any negative emotions when he drinks with me. 

I have tried to make a list of what I’m worried about or why I could feel this way but I just can’t come up with anything. I’m not scared he will get hurt, I’m not scared that he will cheat, and I am not upset that he is with his friends because I don’t mind when he is out with them otherwise (without alcohol). I trust him very much and I genuinely don’t worry about these things. 

I truly can’t identify why I feel this way. 

Also, I would never tell my boyfriend not to be with his friends or not to drink or anything as he is very responsible when he does and even if he wasn’t I have no right to do so.

So, for the past 4-5~ months, my father has been very secretive and agitated towards the rest of the family.


I’ve been doing some investigating for around three weeks and through my investigation I have learned a name of what is presumably a female (let’s call her Kate).


I know very little about this Kate other than her name. But, what really is confusing to me, is that my father has been shying away from me or my mother whenever he’s texting. I got a peek at his screen and sure enough it was Kate at the top. He shut the phone off as soon as possible. He also tends to be very distracted while texting, this behavior has only been with this Kate because that’s the way he was acting when I saw her name on his screen.


Another way I know he’s been texting this Kate is whenever I checked his computer. It’s password locked (which he doesn’t disclose to any of us), but I saw an SMS notification. The notification was from Kate.


I have also seen a picture of a woman’s upper body sent from when I first started getting suspicious. I am unsure if that picture was from Kate or somebody else or if I’m reading too far into this.


Finally, last month, my father turned off his location services so my mother can no longer see where he’s at. He says that it’s messed up but I know for a fact it’s not, it’s just a simple button press and the services are back on.


The most recent nail in the coffin was when I looked over his shoulder and saw a text to Kate saying “I’m glad you got what you liked baby 😘” 


All in all, I don’t know whether to say something to my father, my mother, or to not say anything at all and get more proof. Any advice is heavily appreciated.

P.S. I am 17 years old, male.

My neighbor left yesterday morning to go on a New Year's party in Ontario with her family and friends and left her mouse here. I don't know why she didn't bring it, but I don't own pets. She didn't ask me to housesit or anything.

Last night I was very drunk and I broke into her house. Yes, stupid thing I did, but I was drunk. She didn't lock her back door, she only locked her front door, so I could go in without an issue or any locks stopping me.

For some reason while I was out of my mind, I decided to fill up her bathtub, walk into her living room, open the cage where her pet mouse was, grabbed it by the tail, walked into the bathroom, and threw it into the tub. I made the water really hot and filled it to the rim. I last remember that it was it trying to swim. I think I passed out on the couch because this morning I was confused to what had happened.

495,"Hey guys, hope your holidays are going well.   
Just looking for advice about what I should do about my family situation. We are immigrants who came here about 15 years ago. I love my father but he is is a depressed chronic alcoholic user who curses and yells at the family all the time. My brother (30 years old) was also diagnosed with mental retardation and schizophrenia. He also yells and curses and gets paranoid. Now with this mix, as you can imagine there are always fights. We tried to put my brother in home but my mother and father felt too guilty and brought him back. It's a love hate relationship my father has with my brother and when he is drunk, it gets really loud. I am 24 years old, my whole life my mother and I have been trying to maintain a balance between these two.   
With this, I don't know where to move towards my life. I just graduated, should (hopefully) have a good job soon. I have read in blogs to get out of toxic environments but the problem is that my family are immigrants so I can't really just get up and leave since they'll need my help and presence. I don't think I can continue to live with him for my own sanity but they won't be able to sustain as well without me either. How do you guys think I can have the ideal life with a wife and kids while also taking care of my family? Especially my poor mother who is so strong and been through so much...  
P.S. I know this is long, and if you don't have an answer, I totally understand, I've been trying to figure out an answer for the past 5 years. ",29Dec2018,1
496,"To preface, I'm sorry if this is pretentious or all discombobulated or triggering or anything like that. I just need to get some thoughts out to some people who are my age. I cant connect to anybody new, outside of my old friends, and I feel guilty all the time. I feel guilty especially around relationships, sex and even any sort of physical contact. I went on a date with this girl but fucked up and ghosted her a few days after for these reasons. I hate myself greatly for these things but I keep on doing them. I also never talk about any of this stuff. This reality could be the result of a traumatic event in my past. I was molested when I was 13 by one of my neighborhood ""friends"" who was 15 at the time. I didn't understand what had happened to me but I was totally paralyzed in horror while it happened. I then isolated myself and got lucky and made a few friends a few years after that incident. I feel guilt about it and think about it often, especially when something bad happens. I feel like i would violating any girl who I like because of this; I feel like I'd turn into the fucker who molested to me. It's like I'd be imposing too much, so I just keep everything on the inside. All this stuff has amounted to having suicidal thoughts all throughout my teen years. I feel unworthy and guilty to feel any new human contact, especially if its romantic and physical. I don't feel human.

498,"Sorry if there are formatting issues, on mobile. 

I’m a 19 y/o college student with 4 siblings. My brother is in the airforce atm and my sister has her own place. My dad was in the military and was wounded overseas. It’s been 10 years since his accident. My mom and dad were together for 25+ years and they just started talking about divorce after years of fighting. The thing is though, that my mom didn’t do anything wrong. My dad cheated on my mom multiple times, especially recently. My dad has been a verbally, emotionally abusive, controlling husband, always monitoring where she is. He’s also an alcoholic, a drug addict, has diagnosed bipolar disorder, diagnosed depression, and tons of other diagnoses. Last night, my mom told me they’ve decided to divorce, and that he’d been trying to kick her out. They agreed yesterday they would wait until after my sister finished her freshman year of high school, and then my mom would have enough money to get her own place. Well, this morning, my dad told my mom she had to go. He asked me for my opinion and I told him he isn’t taking any responsibility for what happened with their relationship, and he should have let my sister finish the year. All he said was, “your mother is the most stubborn person I’ve ever met and she won’t forgive me.” He doesn’t believe he’s in the wrong at all. My mom gave me photographs of him kissing another woman and I’ve hidden them in my room, so there is evidence he has cheated. 
Anyways, so I helped my mom pack all of her stuff this morning, and she left for her mom’s house with my little sister. I’m sure my dad will burn or throw away everything she left behind. My dad said my sister and I are welcome to stay here, but I don’t want to. He randomly changes his mind and I’m sure he’ll try to sell the house soon. I can couch surf until I find a place near my college to rent, but I don’t want to leave my sister alone with him. I’ve been building up my credit and now it’s average so I think I can get a place myself, but I don’t know what to do about my sister. She doesn’t want to leave her friends in this town and refuses to go with my mom. My sister also has diagnosed depression and anxiety so I don’t know if she’d cope with switching schools. I’ve also applied to transfer to a university near my grandparent’s house, but won’t receive the results for a couple of months. 
I have a part time job that pays $8/hr, and because I get military benefits I get free tuition and about $1,000/mo when I’m in school. I have about $10,000 saved. 


So, my question is: 

Should I hurry up and look for a new place to live? If I get into the University I applied to recently, I’d have to move again and I don’t think it’s worth the hassle moving from home to an apartment to college. What would you do in my situation? 

TLDR; dad kicked mom out. Mom went to her mom’s. Sister wants to stay with dad because wants to be near friends. He’s unpredictable so I’m afraid to leave her alone w/ him. Need advice on where to go from here. ",29Dec2018,1

500,"Two days ago a man a little bit older than me messaged me from my post on r/needafriend and we spoke for a while (from 8-9p to 3am). We moved to Snapchat and had a really nice conversation. We showed each other our faces and he was decent. I thought I made a good friend.

Yesterday he blocked me and I was really confused 

Today he messaged me again saying that he is super in love with me and how he had never met anyone like me. I told him no and how we had only known each other for a day, but he kept persisting and said he would do anything for me. At one point he offered to be my sugar daddy and to name my price.

Usually I would say no, but he is digital and I would be getting paid just to stick around. Another conflict for me is I am still heartbroken over my ex and have been for months. Plus, my parents would be suspicious where the surplus money is coming from.

Another thing wrong with it is how quickly he fell for me and how attached he is now. Kinda think he might be a predator.

520,"TLDR: I am emotionally overwhelmed due to the constant care I have been providing my dogs and family. 

Full situation: 
My wife and I have three older Shih Tzus (9, 11, 14) that are essentially our kids. The Friday after Thanksgiving one of them got severe pneumonia. Rapid breathing, lethargy, would not eat or drink—really scary stuff. After a three day visit to the doggie ICU, our dog was released back to us and since then I have been giving the dog medicine and watching him 24/7. Just when our fur baby starts to get to a place where I can relax and not be 24 hour doggie nurse, something else happens. Over the past month, we have taken our sick dog to the vet (or emergency room) 4 other times. All but one of those times I was fairly certain our dog was going to die. But in addition to that one of our dogs ate something he should not have which required ivernight of constant supervision, my wife got really sick over Christmas and now, just as things appeared to be getting all clear, another one of our dogs has started breathing really fast for no reason. The worst part about the lastest dog is that, I have no clue if I freaking out because I am so stressed or because there is something to freak out about.

I am emotionally at my wits end. I am doing everything I can to keep our dogs ok and our family going, but for every leak I plug another pops up. I feel overwhelmed and frankly, I think that is straining my relationship with my wife. Things have been better the last few days largely because things have been returning to normal. What I really need is emotional support, and it is tough to get it from my wife because she suffers from depression and anxiety. She does a great job of being a wonderful partner and emotional supporter most of the time, but when it comes to the stress related to the dogs, my feelings just cause even worse anxiety In her. I want to deal with my emotions in a way that protects my wife and puts me in a better headspace. What can I do to not feel so overwhelmed given the circumstances?

521,"I know that I am likely going to be poked fun at, but I am lost and need advice. Thank you if you read through this.

&amp;#x200B;

... I am quite embarrassed of my situation, but I have no one to talk to that I think would understand my circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is EXTREMELY over protective, and this caused me to become the epitome of sheltered. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes; I know that I sound ungrateful, but let me explain:

&amp;#x200B;

I was a victim to a very serious stalker case when I was 12 to the age of 14, and this stalker, and my fear of them, consumed my life.

I became TERRIFIED of people, terrified to leave my house, and I started doing ""home-schooling"" in the seventh grade, but my mother never pushed me to do my studies. If I was sad, I was coddled, but I was never taken to a therapist for some reason... and I took advantage of this as I was too young to see the detriment of me not taking my education seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, I did not have anything higher than a seventh grade education. My mom sheltered me even more, which makes sense in a way, as I had a man who was threatening my safety on a daily basis... but he is in prison now, and for the longest time (until I was 18), I had the social skills of someone who seemingly grew up on a deserted island their entire life. I'd shake like a chihuahua when people would merely look at me, and I'd be made fun of it by strangers.

&amp;#x200B;

I barely have left the house from the age of 12 to the age of 20, and it is just... fucking embarrassing and depressing. I am an ambitious person, and I want so much more for myself, but it feels as though my mom is sabotaging me because she wants to keep me at home.

&amp;#x200B;

It was acceptable for me to obtain a GED from the age of 17-18 where I live, but I had to FIGHT with my mother to get her to drive me to take the test for it! There was always an excuse as to why I shouldn't get my GED.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not have a license, as you could guess. So, I am completely reliant on my mother to get me places. I'm not ""allowed"" to have a license, and before you say that is ridiculous, I am well aware. I live in the rural south, so nothing is in walking distance. Hell, we don't even have public transportation here. I don't have a job, nor money. 

&amp;#x200B;

After fighting with my mom, crying, begging every fucking day, **she finally drove me to get my GED when I was 19**. Despite only having a seventh grade education, I obtained my GED easily within a few days because I self-educated myself (though, not in the traditional sense.)

&amp;#x200B;

My mother instills fear in me in everything I do. I am borderline paranoid because of the exaggerated tinfoil hat-esque theories of, ""SOMEONE IS GOING TO COME UP TO YOU IN WAL-MART AND TRY TO DRUG YOU, AND PUT YOU INTO SEX TRAFFICKING,"" Again, I am **20 years old**. She wants to hold hands when we walk across streets, and ... before you say, ""it means she loves you! You should be grateful."" I do know that, and I am thankful that she cares about me, but this type of behavior does more harm than good in me, I think. I love her. She loves me. I know. I am not ungrateful for that.

&amp;#x200B;

... I'm upset and seeking advice, because I'm fighting tooth and nail to try and get to college, but she demands that I go to the local college here (and even then, I'm not ""allowed"" to go for MONTHS, so I get to stay at home doing absolutely nothing for even longer), and maybe I am resembling a childlike baby throwing a tantrum because they can't get the toy they want, but I don't wanna fucking be in this town, living with my mom anymore. I want to get out, I feel as though I need to get out. I wanna move out of state, but how the fuck am I gonna afford a plane ticket? How am I going to even get to the airport? How am I gonna go about filling about my FAFSA if she won't take me? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it really more practical for me to stay here? I am not ""allowed"" to get a job (lol,) and even though this is utter bullshit, I have no way of transporting myself to and back from work because I am dirt-poor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We had a 22 year old cat that had to be put to sleep today. Over the last few months she was getting more and more senile due to her old age and she often meowed extremely loudly to get peoples attention when hungry etc, she couldn't see or hear well.

Last night at around 3am she was trying to get into my room, scratching and meowing loudly at my door she woke me up (I don't let her in my room as she tends to pee in corners, and the smell is unbearable and hard to get rid of) Anyway, she wouldn't go out, I was trying to block her from coming in while gently pushing her out with my foot, when she suddenly tried to bite me and then run past my foot, I then kind of blacked out with rage, no idea why, it's not like me at all, and I pushed her fairly hard about a 12 inches back with my foot, out of my room. After that I instantly felt awful and stroked her for a bit, I HATE myself for doing it, I don't know why I suddenly did it, I've felt awful since doing it, I love her and all animals and I feel so guilty, I truly didn't mean to harm her. 

After that and stroking her for a bit she went to sleep on the spot, which I didn't think anything of, she slept in weird places all the time, but the next morning she was acting very weird and moved into my brothers room under his desk  and didn't move the entire day, didn't eat or drink or meow, when normally she meowed multiple times a day and my family joked about her being a nuisance. Fast forward to a few hours ago she started drooling and lost all responsiveness to touch etc. so we took her to the vet and she had to be put to sleep, the vet said she had bleeding behind the eye which could be caused by all sorts such as tumors, organ failure, thyroid issues etc. but I can't help but think maybe me pushing her caused it or maybe accelerated her sickness if she was sick, does anyone know if thats possible?...I already miss her, and I feel like an awful person, I feel empty knowing that I'll never hear her meows that we all found annoying anymore.

If they dont have a switch or a ps4, they have a gaming pc with either a gtx 1050 or a 1080. I just have a dual core cpu with integrated graphics. Its a cheap but alright setup for playing roblox which is currently the only game i can really afford. Apparently im not allowed to get a job and i should stick to studying through school and getting good grades. my parents say they would fund anything i do with their own money. But usually it never happens. I dont really want to spend any money going to stuff like movies or anything most people do outside because it seems $200 wont last long for a month with those spending habits. The money i get from my bank account is $300 deposit from my mom as a christmas present 2 years ago and about $40 from mowing the lawn for a few times. Now my parents say I should be doing chores without being paid for it. Which is completely understandable. 

It feels bad with most of my friends having expensive things while i dont get anything for birthdays or for christmas. Its not like my dads exactly poor either. He has a good job which he says he gets a 6 figure salary from which i think is good in canada. And he also once spent $300 for maui jim sun glasses. I think hes good financially. After some estimation, i think hes financially better off than some of my friends. I really want a good gaming pc by using boxing day for parts, but he just laughs at me which im not really sure why. He says im an expensive kid and I dont deserve anything like that because of my behaviour. I mean, i get alright grades i think. Usually As and Bs and never Cs. I also never got detention or in any trouble whatsoever. But i dont exactly have any achievments either. Like honor roll or straight As, or joining a sports team or anything of the sort. 

Im just wondering if Im acting too ungratefull if i ask him for a good gaming pc. Am I really a spoiled child? Is it completely normal for me to act this way? I also have a history of acting entitled to things when i really am not. This is really tough for me to think about since i dont have any references to make a verdict on.

Don't have my own transport, so its difficult for me to meet my old friends and in fact rarely if ever see them these days. I'm generally shy/introverted, so I'd only made two new friends since coming here, but they were good friends - lets call them C and D. C stopped responding to my texts about a month ago, and is still active on social media so I'm pretty sure its them ghosting me and not just a personal issue. This has hit me pretty hard, since my friendship with her was one of my only close relationships. I don't even know what I did wrong - everything seemed to be going well before she cut me off, and I'm someone who is generally paranoid/worried about my interactions with other people, so for me to feel that everything was going well is a statement. Idk, the lack of closure and suddeness of it has made my social anxiety ramp up, and I feel like I've been pulling away from the other people who care about me/not reaching out to new people because of fear of this same kind of thing happening.

536,"3 years ago when she was 22, my daughter told us she was dating her supervisor, manager of a deli department (ie, no sugar daddy here). He is two years older than me, therefore twice her age. I begged her not to keep seeing him to no avail. I have refused to get to know him or even meet him for all this time, praying that the relationship would fizzle out and we could carry on as normal: a close family, sharing meals, vacations, celebrations together with her and her little sisters. Alas, things are strained and emotional and I'm filled with hatred for this man and despair for our relationship with our daughter. 

My position:

She is a beautiful, intelligent young woman about to enter a master's program with a bright future and everything going for her.   HE is a creep, who showed no moral character when he pursued a relationship with her, and isn't fit to lick her boots. He is wasting her time and youthful energy to boost his own pathetic life. I have many wonderful men his age in my world, including my husband (her father), and none of them would have acted on this impulse, for one thing because they were out making a life for themselves and their families. He is ""failure-to-launch,"" the boy who didn't grow up, again --&gt; a LOSER.

Position of every 'help' column:

Get over it, the only way to keep your daughter in your life is to suffer through this disgusting relationship, find the good in him, blah blah blah.

Recently I was turned down for a job I was promised, I had been getting strung along for a few weeks, being told by my brother in law that I was getting an interview soon and that he's given me an outstanding recommendation and the job is as good as mine. 

After I had the interview I was told by my BIL that I nailed it. However even later on, once a decision had finally been made, the manager of the store got my BIL to phone me to say that I didn't get it, purely based upon where I live, he said ""He did amazing, I would've hired him on the spot if not for where he lives."" I don't drive which I knew was a disadvantage going in, but I live on the main bus route. The exact same bus route that my BIL in on. Queue where my title comes in.

My SO, outraged by the fact that yet again I have been screwed over for a job (it's happened in the past) takes to social media to complain, she mentions no names, only the bus route and how it is unfair that I should not get the job promised to me for the reason stated above.

It now has come to light that my BIL now has to attend a meeting with the store owner, area manager and the store manger about it over something that in retrospect has almost nothing to do with the issue aside from his recommendation of myself.

With this, my father has expressed his disappointment in the situation saying how my SO should not have taken to social media about it where everyone can see. So I fear for my SO not being liked by my family anymore over something so petty that has been blown way out of proportion.

I'm not entirely sure how to go about things now, I am extremely anxious as we're supposed to be going to my parents for new years day, but now she doesn't want to come with me through fear of being snubbed.

Like how did they manage to get hold of the post to social media?
They surely can't get away with punishing my BIL because I'm pretty sure that would be illegal

540,"Hello everyone. Me and my family have been in a bad situation for a while and I would appreciate any feedback you can give me.

My parents have been married for over 30 years. They run a successful dental clinic with my dad being the dentist and my mom being the secretary. She tends to appoint too many patients and forcing my dad to overwork. This led to him to being absent during me and my brother’s childhood years. We were raised solely by my mother, who often verbally abused us (she had a rough childhood as well). This caused emotional/ self-esteem issues for both me and my brother (who is now morbidly obese and an introvert). My brother also works in the office but does not contribute much.

Our situation resembles the TV sitcom “Malcolm in the Middle. My brother, my father, and I all dislike my mother. She loves to fight and yell. We have tried therapy and counseling but she is in denial. My father is afraid to divorce her since he never got a pre-nup and knows how vengeful and vindictive she would be. He would lose the business he’s spent 30 years growing. He loves his patients and wants to work until me and my brother are financially independent. However, he is getting old but does not want to retire until he knows that we’ll be okay.

My dad is very kind and avoids confrontation. He is amazing for putting up with her B.S. to support me and my brother. Best dad in the world ☺

In 2016, I decided to move away from home to pursue a post graduate degree in a 7 year international program. While I’ve been gone, I’ve noticed that things have gotten much worse. My mother has fired all the dental assistants causing my father to work twice as hard. My brother has not changed his diet or lifestyle and continues to be an introvert and eat. He is now the heaviest he’s ever been. I feel guilty studying abroad while they both suffer.
I’ve told my dad to hire another dentist and assistant. Every time that happens, my mother suddenly stops calling patients and says “look we have no patients! Why should we keep paying them for doing nothing?” This has happened countless times throughout his career.

For my brother, my dad and I are looking for ways for him to move out. His whole life, he has been with my mother. No college, he’s just stayed at home and been abused. I was once angry and depressed like him, until I left for college and my heart healed. I read a quote the other day that said “You cannot find happiness in the same place where you lost it.” I believe that he needs to leave the house and experience life on his own. My father told him that “you can study anywhere and anything. I will support you.” My brother replied “you know I’m not a good student. I can’t do it.”

I believe the solution is to get my mom out of their lives. She does not care for either of them. She likes me and I’ve told her that what she’s doing is wrong. She just gets defensive and says “every time I’m wrong!”

What can we do?

One solution I thought of was for my father to buy another dental clinic. He works there while my mother works in the other clinic. That way, she’s not in our lives 24/7.

Do you guys have any other ideas or solutions? We’re in a bad situation and I can use some advice. Thank you

541,"This guy (20 - calling him Tom) and I (18F) met on tinder about 2 months ago. We hit it off pretty quickly and have talked every day since we matched. I made it a point early on to ask him what he wanted and he told me he didn’t want to just hook up and wanted something serious. We’ve been on 6-7 dates. He’s pretty timid in person which I don’t mind, it’s different for me. It took him until the 4th date to really make a move and I’m still the one who had to kiss him (comes across as a virgin but idk). I like him a lot and he seems to like me too but we aren’t exclusive. 

In my opinion, he’s treating me as a girlfriend. Tom recently started calling me pet names (baby, babe, etc.), he told me that he wants to go on vacation with me for my birthday during the summer, offered to give me an old flat screen for Christmas. He also told me that once I get my own apartment (May/June), he wants to help decorate and put some of his stuff in it (?!). His friends also know about me but I haven’t yet met them. He’s constantly saying he misses me and always tries to hang out. I mean, to me, this behavior sounds like he wants something more serious. 

However, he just went on a cruise to Mexico. He’s been telling me that he misses me and can’t wait to see me the whole time. Regardless, I was being insecure and checked tinder and saw that his location is updating at least once a day. As far as I know, this means he’s opening and using the app. I’m obviously hurt because I’m not talking to anyone else but I know we aren’t exclusive. 

He gets home tomorrow. 

Should I bring up the “what are we” conversation with him? Or ask him what his goals are long term for us?

Thanks for any advice.

542,"(If you don't wanna hear the backstory, skip to the third paragraph)

I live with my dad during the school year, but I am staying with my mom and grandparents during Christmas break. They live in a 2 bedroom house, and my mom takes one room, and my grandparents take the other room. So, there is a third *Area* in the house where they just plopped down a bed. It is next to the computer, and all the storage. It is open, and the only place I have any privacy is in the bathroom. There are constantly people walking in and out of the area throughout the day. Also, there is never any quiet, there is always sound or a conversation I can hear during the day. 

Getting any sleep had been tough too, I am a light sleeper, and my grandparents go to bed at like 10:00 and wake up at around 7:00. But, my mom goes to bed at like 12:00 and wakes up at 10:00. She is always making noise or watching tv until she goes to bed. So, the only time when its actually quiet it from 12:00-6:00 Plus, the bathroom hallway is nearby my bed, and my grandma and grandpa talk to eachother very loudly since they are both hearing impaired,  So usually my grandma has to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom at least once, in a wheelchair. This always wakes me up. At like 2 or 3 right after I finally can fall asleep. I have been trying to adjust all well but it has literally not improved. I am also being a bit of a dick to my family because I always lose my patience when I am this tired and that is only making everything worse. Now, I can kind of tolerate this for 2 weeks, but I will be living with them for 8 weeks in the summer, so I desperately need to find a solution

So, what I need is a room. Do any of you folks know and creative ways/places in the house I can live that would solve these problems. I can spend about $1,000 on anything. Also, there are no livable crawlspaces or attics in the house, and no closets that would work. A run down and gutted car was my first idea, there are plenty of non running minivans on craigslist for $200-$300 but there wouldn't be anywhere to park it as the HOA doesn't allow parking in the driveway overnight, and the garage is filled.

 I'm hella poor and can only afford maybe $100 dollars for this suit stuff (I already have the shirt, tie, and shoes).

So should I buy a new very cheap suit, use the gray pants and mismatch, or tailor the suit that's too large?

Any advice would be great.

552,"This situation started months back. I [F17] was in this toxic friendship with this racist girl [F17]. So awhile back she was taunting me about dating this one guy who I liked which spiraled into me all of a sudden accusing them of “fucking.” We aren’t friends anymore but until now she is trying to self victimize and demonize me telling everyone I’m spreading lies about her which I am not. Earlier this year she put this girl on blast for wanting the same powderpuff number as her while also humiliating her on social media and getting all her friends to gang up on her. Big narcissistic move. She also shit talked one of her “friends” getting everyone to cut her off. That girl is now left with no friends whatsoever. Another bitch move. And now she’s demonizing me telling everyone that I’m spreading lies about her? It’s the truth she put it out on public. I’m just telling everyone how she’s manipulative and warning them. However I found out that she has some racist videos up on her youtube channel which I should have known since she had the n-word saved on her contact list besides being asian, I was wondering should I forward it to college admissions so she has no chance. Or what should I do. She’s still demonizing me? ",29Dec2018,1
553,"I believe I have an addiction to food and its driving my life crazy. I checked by bank statement this month to see how much I spent on uberEats this month alone, just shy of a thousand dollars. I'm scared and I dont know what to do. I tried deleting the app several times but it's like I'm not in control when my hunger kicks in, and I mindlessly download the app and order food.

I cant cook for shit, but I'm willing to learn. The harder part is figuring out how to beat this addiction of food delivery. I would appreciate any advice. ",29Dec2018,1
554,"I dated this guy for most of the year. He was kind of controlling, and would yell at me to quit smoking (he never cared when we were friends, even smoked with me), make me block people, go through my phone. He’s thrown a phone at me, left me on the side of the road whilst swearing at me, drove away from my house when i took too long to get ready... just so much fighting. He was always accusing me of flirting with other guys. 

We were sort of on and off again for while. We would fight so much and then have sex and be fine for like a day. I was pretty unhappy. 

During this period, I started hanging out a lot more frequently with a guy friend of mine. Him and my ex were also friends, but I have known him 5+ years, and we have always gotten along. Well, me and my ex were fighting, and my friend was asking me to hang. Boyfriend would be mad anytime i hung out with him alone, or if i answered his texts, but would still hang out with him himself. Boyfriend got increasingly paranoid and jealous, making scenes during group hangouts and telling all of our friends how he could just tell me and my friend were ‘in love’.  I kept hanging with my friend.  Boyfriend told me I had to stop seeing him if we stayed together, and i said no. I don’t have a lot of friends, and I’ve known my friend for much longer. And to be honest, i’m way happier around him than i was around my boyfriend, just cos we would fight constantly, and the more and more he told me to stop seeing my friend, the more I did it. 

Now we have been broken up for a while, and he still texts me and a lot of our mutual friends saying things about me and my friend and telling people that we are having sex and that i cheated on him, which isn’t true. There’s a new year’s eve party that i won’t be attending, but my ex was telling one of my pals that he was planning on beating up my friend to get ‘respect back’ and because ‘all the guys wanna see it happen’. 

My friend is not a fighter, and i really don’t want to see him hurt, especially if it’s because of me. My ex has made these sort of threats before, but this time he has actually planned it. This whole situation is so awkward and bad, and I don’t know how to get my ex to leave me and my friend alone. It’s not a huge social circle, and it’s causing a lot of drama. I warned my friend that i had heard this, but I need advice on how to make my ex chill out and stay away from my friend. ",29Dec2018,1
555,"A lady (F23) who I (M21) speak to (sadly, just) at work found out I do Photoshop and Digital art as a hobby, she asked if I could remove her from a photo, and the watermark so it just has her horse remain as she loved the position of the horse, just not her in it... anyway, I took her out and touched it up and she was so happy, I printed them off at her request and she gave me money in return - she wanted photos of high quality however so she got in contact with the photographer who had taken the image, and she purchased the photo.

She emailed me the photo and I did it again with the original copy, (it took me a few weeks but she was fine with that as long as it was complete for christmas, which it was) and once it was confirmed I printed them off at the local photo lab and it cost me £15; which is about ~$22. She let me know that she'd repay me. Several weeks have passed with no sign of money - do I sound like a dick or is there a nice way of mentioning her without coming off as mean?

TL;DR - Photoshopped and printed a photo for her that cost me £15, how do I ask for the money or am I being cheap?",29Dec2018,1
556,"I'm going to try to keep this short.. My apologies for formatting. Also, a throwaway to stay as anonymous as possible. I'm not mentioning the game and age, but I think I can reveal he is below 20 and is from the EU. I'm a fairly tech savvy person and know the scene to some degree, plus I know how to set up streaming setups (hobby endeavor for me)

My brother has been playing a specific fighting game series for about 2-3 years now. About a year ago he started going to locals, and even abroad inside the EU once. He beat the then best EU player according to the tierlists at this tournament. He loves to play the game and wants to pursue streaming as well. He has been invited to crowdfunding actions to go to the States, so I think he has reached the level where he could go pro.

We would love to support this endeavor, as this is his passion and he has mentioned he only is able to do this once, but there are a few things we are struggling with. These are the following:

1: Goes to bed consistently too late and sleeps through every alarm. This causes a lot of struggle, since we all have to yell at him in the morning to wake up. He missed a lot of class and work experience days because of this, and this resulted in him getting kicked off school. He is also prone to headaches caused by tiredness that he proceeds to sleep off, further skewing his sleep schedule. He is sometimes up at 4am playing the game, or watching streams of it.

2: He has mentioned that he wants to stream, but is not willing to invest effort into it (e.g. researching, asking educated questions about it to me, etc.). This is a recurring trend. He is allowed to take driving lessons that will be paid for, but has never taken the step to even call a school. This is because he doesn't know ""how"".

3. He has trouble looking forward more them 4 hours. He can sign up for a tournament, and only realize at 0:00 that he doesn't know how to get at the spot he needs to be at 9:00. This also was a thing with his work experience. He consistently does not know what to prepare for the next day, which ended up being one of the primary reasons for him being terminated from the job. He also ""forgets"" appointments or never shows up because he didn't read his email. Etc..

4: He is not prepared to follow hard rules or make deals. He only wants 100%, all the time. Bed time rules? Does not stick to them. Study rules? He says he will do it, but after a month it turns out he did not do anything. We have hidden the powercords of his devices once since he did not keep his part of the deal, but this resulted in full blown anger.

This brings us to a split. Right now, he needs to enroll into a new study. But at the way things are going right now, he won't be able to finish this study either. He needs to be one more year on a school, then he is free to do what he wants. 

But it is not like his behavior is better when he is working on his esports career. He still oversleeps if not woken by hand and still does not take any incentive. Personally, my concern is what he will do once he is 30. I don't see him playing esports at that point and I don't think he would be able to complete a completely new study at that point and get employed.

We don't want to drown him in adult responsibilities, but at the same time we don't want him to be unprepared for it once he is older or in case things don't work out. And at this point with his behavior, we are not sure how we can help with either esports or school since he cant even wake up on his own. He is very kind and has a great personality, not bratty at all unlike how the text may sketch that. His social life is probably 75% esports buddies, and when he is at a tournament he blooms up in a completely different person. People always welcome him eagerly and seem to be very close friends, so I totally understand why he would want to do this all day.

 
It is just that he is very ""spur of the moment"" and jumps into things unprepared without a plan, and also without a plan b ladder to get out of things.

Is there anything we can do to make best of both worlds? Give him space, but at the same time make him finally aware that he atleast has some responsibility towards things? Or should we just leave him be? Or push him towards studying more, and leave esports at a lower priority risking he will miss some great opportunities? (He already missed flying to the states possibly twice because of him needing to be present at school)

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance you all :)
