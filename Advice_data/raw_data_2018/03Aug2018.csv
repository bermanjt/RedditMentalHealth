0,"When I was younger I neglected my teeth partly due to being brought up where brushing my teeth wasn’t a priority (shit parents), and my own laziness and I’m paying for the price now, I need the dentist I’ve had agonising at different points over the last 3 years but this time it’s disgusting.

I have a local anaesthetic gel that isn’t touching the pain. My teeth look good they’re naturally straight, I just have holes in 3 of them, but I’m petrified of going to the dentist due to fear of judgement, last time I went I had a woman who belittled me in front of my friend who came with me, so I need some advice on what to say/do when I go to the dentist as I really need to go.

1,"I feel a little guilty here.  My family is going above and beyond to help me out with things.  

Back in June I bought a house.  Everyone has offered me a ton of help.  There are small projects that need to be done and my father, stepfather, and grandfather have come over to help with.  My mother and grandmother have bought a ton of decorations for the house and given me a bit of money to help with furniture.  

And I'm incredibly grateful and thanked them profusely for everything....


But they won't fucking leave me alone now.  Maybe some people will disagree and call me ungrateful, but there's such a thing as too much help.  

I've been on vacation this week and I haven't had one single day where one of them hasn't shown up at my house.  

I get ONE week of vacation in the summer and ONE week of vacation at Christmas.  Outside of that I work 50-70 hours a week.  

Don't get me wrong, I know I'm an adult now and own a home, I have to spend time on my vacations catching up on things.  And I have been.  But I want to do them on *my schedule*.  And if I need help, I want to call and ask for it, not get it unsolicited.  

But everyone just keeps showing up.  9am, noon, 7pm....any hour of the day.  This whole week I've gotten a wave of anxiety anytime I hear a car door closing and run out to peak through my blinds to see if it's a family member.  I feel like Bilbo Baggins.  

I feel like *I'm* going to come off as the asshole if I say anything though, because of how much they've done for me already, and the fact I'm declining help.  

But as of tomorrow I'm down to three days left of my vacation and I just want to do nothing.  I've already gotten a lot done this week.  

My mother and stepfather just showed up at my house an hour ago, because they wanted to ""take a better look at my deck"", despite having seen it 50 times already, so that we can work on it.  My deck needs sanding and staining, but it's something I was going to put off until the cooler weather this fall.  

Yet they went out and bought like 200 dollars of primer and stain without telling me (and without consulting me about what type of stain and/or color I wanted to use for the deck), and told me that they would be by at 8am on Saturday and we would spend the day doing it (in 90 degree weather).  

I was honestly clenching my jaw and just nodding while saying ""mhmm"" to them because if I opened my mouth I was going to lose my temper and scream at them to get the hell out of my yard and leave me alone.  


Do I just let things go?  I really don't know how I can tell everyone to just leave me alone without coming off as an ungrateful asshole.  ",03Aug2018,2
2,"I am 23 and my husband is 24 we just had a baby 2 months ago. During my pregnancy up until I was 8 months everyday I was gettin up early (6am) and going to work because my husband wasn’t working and doesn’t have steady income. We have talked way before we had the baby about steady income and him getting a job. He kept saying he was going to get one. Our baby is 2 months and he still doesn’t have steady income. I am currently on disability but only have 1 more week until I have to go back to work. I’m not planning on going back to work I want to stay here with the baby and take care of her at least for the first 6 months. I also don’t have any family members to watch her and I don’t want to do daycare. I shouldn’t have to considering I have a husband who is perfectly capable of working. Now, he does have a couple side jobs but one he only makes about $200 a month the other one is one job every couple weeks or a month. Instead of getting a consistent job with steady income, he’s thinking of other ways to make money as far as selling things or making things. He has band practice once a week and considers that work, they have gigs but only $200 is split between 3 people. He’s tried all and all have been unsuccessful. I brought it up to him and told him he needed to step up for his family and we need steady income. $200 a month isn’t going to cut it, and I told him if he’s not willing to keep a promise and do so for the sake of his family, I can no longer do this. He got really defensive and told me I made a promise “for rich or for poor” and he is making money and doing what he can for us? He made me feel guilty and told me I obviously don’t love him to give up on us so quickly. He claims he’s sent in resumes but none have got back to him. It’s been 10+ months. What do I do?

10,"For almost a year and a half now my Mum has been romantically interested in someone that she met at rehab for alcohol abuse, she ended up there after a series of unfortunate events lead to her being kicked out of her house and becoming depressed. After she left rehab she didn't seem to care at all about him but when the alcohol addiction relapsed he came into the picture, cutting about a year out of constant threats towards the family and most prominently my older brother and Dad, getting my Mum addicted to prescription medication, falling back into old habits and taking money off of her even though she is getting into debt for it.   


After awhile the authorities got involved in the case as myself being 17 and my two younger siblings are classified as minors are in danger she was told to cease communication with him, he is a known criminal and user to women and frequent occupant of prisoners for a variety of crimes, knowing this there was a warning dealt to my Mum and him respectively basically stating not to talk to each other or there will be precautions.  


After that happened myself and the rest of the family believed the relationship to have ceased, but I've accidentally just discovered they are still in contact with each other. I'm in a dilemma as what to do as reporting the situation to a sibling for them to deal with it will cause a massive rift in the family and I feel like I will never be trusted again by my Mum, or should I sit idly by as my Mum continues to be in debt and is struggling to keep the roof over our heads there.  


This has be giving me severe stress and anxiety since I discovered it but I'm afraid of what to do.

11,"Hi all,

I'm writing to hope for some advice, but also as a coping mechanism, I'm hoping slamming all this down will relieve the following somewhat.

I've always known people can be two-faced, I've met a few people like this but to be honest neither face was fully ""opaque"", they'd be smarmy or passive aggressive whenever certain influencers/peers were around and it would be immediately clear to me that they weren't someone to waste my time with.

Today however, I found out that one of my extended family members has always considered myself and my immediate family ""freaks"". I always thought we got on whenever we occasionally met, but it wasn't regular at all.

I'm having a bit of a meltdown at the moment, I can't help but wonder how many people I have got on with in the past just decided to judge me as a freak. Blips in responses or rude, dismissive reactions to  things used to feel like disagreement, but now it just feels like they were holding back ridicule.

I had social anxiety for a long time, and while I feel I may still struggle at times, it's so much better than it used to be. I can spontaneously go to meet my friends when it used to need so much willpower to not just cancel any engagement presented to me.

But this for some reason has cut deep, I don't know if maybe it's because I haven't spoken to them since I was in a huge rut in my life or what, but I would be so grateful for any advice, thank you all. xxx",03Aug2018,1

16,"Late 20s.  My stable life fell apart this year- the woman I thought I would marry left me, and my department at work pretty much disintegrated, leaving me as the sole member of the department with any experience (the other guy had a literal week's experience when my boss left).  I've been struggling with what to do next with my life- I moved to a semi-rural area for work about 3 years ago, and while I have friends, most aren't my age and aren't really interested in day-to-day socializing.

Things with the ex came to a boiling point months later- we both in a wedding.  After some initial awkwardness and avoidance at the ceremony, we caught up at the reception and things were nice- not like old times exactly, but legitimately warm, friendly, and genuine.  Fast forward a couple hours, and my ex is semi-drunk and sobbing about how things ended.  Not necessarily the outcome, but how it ended, and wants to be friends.  She wouldn't rule out the possibility that we could talk about our relationship in the future, though she's seeing someone now.  We agreed to talk more about how things ended.

I'm not over my ex, at least not entirely.  I need to decide if I want my old boss's job in this semi-rural area (since I've already been more or less doing his job anyways since I'm almost a one-man department with a new hire).  I'm torn, since if things were going to work out with the ex down the road it would be a good job to continue in where I'm already established.  Without the job promotion or the ex though, I'd want to move somewhere else, but have no idea where.  I'm worried if I move back home to my helicopter parents' area I'll regress and become less independent.

In short, looking for some perspective.  I'm afraid of starting over, or if I even should.",03Aug2018,1
17,"I am 25, and I just don't know what I am doing anymore. I don't think I'm depressed, but nothing fulfills me. I'm working as a Bartender/Server full time until I return to school for my last year. After work, I get back to my apartment and kind of just sit and wait for the tonight shows come on (favourite part of my day). I have two friends but they are very busy people and I don't see them that often.

The issue that I self diagnosed is that I have few interests and no hobbies. I don't really do anything with my free time. 

I am told by many co-workers that I am great with people. I think what they mean is that I am able to talk with people easily and don't come across as timid or shy. But It doesn't translate to creating connections or new friendships. Sometimes I try but it doesn't go anywhere. I recently came out of a long term relationship. I think this is a factor in how lonely I feel. I am not that torn up about it but 3 years of always having someone to hang out with and then not is tough. I also had issues making friends before the relationship.

 One thought that keeps me going is that when I'm done school I can start fresh somewhere else, a big city like Toronto or New York(I can live in US or Canada). I do go out sometimes to an open mic near my apartment, it's a cool bar and I generally end up making conversation with complete strangers but it always ends at that.

Basically how do I go about making connections or developing hobbies? I think that connections will come out of doing things I am interested in.

Somethings I find interesting, Feel free to suggest hobbies:

\-artsy films  
\-stand up comedy  
\-street fashion   
\-day dream about living in a bigger city or somewhere in Europe.

Also I strongly believe that interests are developed, If anything in that lists makes you think I'd like something else, please say something.

Whenever I make something I can never finish it, my mind just sees so many mistakes the farther I go. It makes it hard to even start something anymore. I know most artists have trouble liking what the make, but I feel like I go a bit farther? It’s not just with my art. I can’t write, my handwriting always looks messy to me, I can’t do my makeup, everything just seems so messy, I can never go out in an outfit I put together, something just always seems so off.

I will not be able to get my mistakes out of my mind until they disappear.

28,"Reddit, I’ve been dealing with this situation for months now and any advice you have to give would help a lot.

For starters, my grandmother had a bad stroke late last year. Since then, she has made some progress, and is living at her home, but she needs 24/7 care because the stroke immobilized the right side of her body and interfered with her ability to talk. 

My mom and aunt (moms sister) (along with caregivers they are hiring out) have been taking weekly-ish shifts to stay at my grandmas house and take care of her (not even 10 minutes away from my house). We’ve recently gotten news that my aunt cannot continue to help my mom take care of her because 1) she lives ~5 hours away from us, and 2) she is the breadwinner in her family and needs to focus on her work more. They have researched many different nursing homes but my mom is SO convinced that they will not treat my grandma right because she can not communicate, therefore they will get impatient with her. Mom always says, “if we put her in a nursing home, she’ll die.” 

So, my mom has decided she wants to make an extension onto our house to move my grandma and the caregivers in. My dad does not support this at all, and rightfully so, because this is the house they worked so hard for and raised their family in. The house is almost 100 years old. It’s a small, brick house with a ton of character. But, there’s just not enough room to make an extension outwards without going into our neighbor’s yard. So, there is nowhere to go but back into our yard, and make an “L” shape. My family is trying to tell my mom that making an extension like that will de-value the house greatly because it will be unattractive to new residents when it is sold down the line. Also, my grandma is going to have to use her savings to buy it, further de-valuing the house.

Now my mom thinks that we are being selfish because we don’t want to ruin our home because of this. She says that it’s selfish because my grandma funded my dad’s business when he needed money, she funded a great portion of mine and my brother’s college, so ya not wanting to make this extension is kind of like stabbing her in the back.

Right now, I would like to move out as soon as I graduate to avoid this whole mess, but I don’t want to leave my dad to fight this battle by himself. And I was planning on saving up some money and live with my parents for a few years after college, but it’s going to be hard to live in this tiny house and share a bathroom with my parents at 22 (the other bathroom will be part of my grandmas extension). It would break my heart knowing I ran away from this and left my family out to dry... but I don’t know how to help.

I may be selfish, but I really feel like my mom is being selfish and closed-minded. My grandma wouldn’t want my mom to throw away her life like she’s doing just for her. She raised my to be independent, even when things with her health gets in the way.

I’m sorry for the lengthy post, I just had to get this out there because I just don’t know what to do... any advice would be greatly appreciated.",03Aug2018,1

She mainly would tear up the blinds and the window screen because she was eager to go outside but since she’s not spayed and doesn’t have her shots we had her stay in the house. 

But she did eventually get out the house but she came back with not only regular fleas but stick tight fleas and I had to tweeze every stick tight flea off of her. So after that we decided to never let her out the house again she would run out the house every time someone would open a door to go outside but we would always catch her and put her back inside before she can go anywhere further. 

But recently she got out the house and we decided to just leave her out there since she wants to be outside so bad and later that day I went outside looking for her calling her name jingling her favorite toy but she never showed up until 2 days later. She came back with a bunch of stick tight fleas on her face and ears since she’s not vaccinated she could have a disease and her regular fleas where starting to go away but by being outside she probably got more. Also there’s tons of stray cats in my neighborhood so since she’s not spayed she could be pregnant by now but idk. 

My mom refuses to let her back into the house because she said if the cat wants to be outside so bad then shes gonna stay outside but the cat has started crying around the house and trying to run back into the house she even try’s to get into the house from my bedroom window. I go outside twice a day to give her cat food and water but I feel bad for leaving her out there but my mom said I can’t bring her back inside. I don’t mind not keeping her anymore but I don’t want her to stay outside in this hot 100 degree weather all day she looks sad and idk what to do. Should I clean her off and bring her back inside or leave her outside? ",03Aug2018,1

36,"So I’m back home for college, and it feels like hell on earth. First off, it started out ok in the early parts of may, I hadn’t been home since January up until that point. 

I offered to help out with chores around like mowing the yard, doing dishes, etc. I thought this would keep me immune from them accusing me of not having a job over the summer. I even offered to help with my dad’s business reports and keeping his work station clean- at no cost. 

So let’s skip ahead to end of July and now: he’s been yelling at me for the smallest things. It started when he lost his “important” documents and he yelled at me in the middle of the office, and yes it was embarrassing. I decided to stick with it. Then the same thing happened again when he left documents at home the VERY NEXT DAY. I was embarrassed again, and then I realized I’m free labor, so I left the office. I didn’t even bother answering my dad’s phone calls and text messages. 

I decided to move onto other chores around the house, and did everything from gardening to cleaning the house. My dad got home and he throws his finger into my chest and screams “I EXPECT YOU AT THE OFFICE TOMORROW MORNING OR YOU’RE OUT OF THIS HOUSE!” 

This was one of those deals where I retired early for the day, I stayed in my room, and drank some Rye and smoked my juul until at least 3 am. I ended up going to help him at the office, and it was a lot less energetic than it ever has been for me. What used to be me arriving early and leaving late, turned into arriving late and leaving early. It’s still that way to this day, btw. 

Skip ahead to July 27th-ish, my dad went ahead and told me he put my name in the hat for a golf tournament, and that we’re partners for it, joyyyyy :( the next day, he invited dinner guests over, and prior he wanted me to put the food in the fridge. The fridge is stuffed with everything else, and I accidentally placed the food on a glass bowl of cucumber salad. 

When my dad was ready to fire up the grill, he tried grabbing the food out of the fridge, and he knocked the bowl over, guess who was blamed and received a major ass chewing for that? If you answered my dog, you guess wrong. I was embarrassed in front of his dinner guests. 

He even told me not to eat at the same dinner table because he can’t “stand me” right now. I was so upset with this, I lost my appetite. It was coupled with anger too, I decided to throw the entire plate of food in the trash just outside the door to the basement. I went back to smoking my juul and drinking my rye. 

It’s damn near 9 o’clock, and I packed all of my luggage, and I’m ready to book it 250 miles to my university campus to for the off campus house where me and my roommate’s will stay for this year. Moreover, I’ve drafted a letter telling my parents I’m leaving, and that my dad could forget about me golfing with him. Yes, I serve good judgement when it comes to if I’m inebriated enough, if that’s the case I’ll be out by sun up. 

I really hate how it’s gotten to this point, but I just can’t stand my dad yelling at me, and my mom being so passive about it. School starts August 20th, but I cannot stand another day here. I only owe my parents for the housing and feeding of me. Other than that, I worked for everything I have, and I’m a great worker in the eyes of my actual boss. 

I HATE IT HERE... ",03Aug2018,3

39,"Background about me:
•I’ve been an introvert my whole life, I’ve always liked a lot of alone time. I also have social anxiety disorder, they originally thought I had a heart condition because of it! 
•I only really have two close friends, Madison and Don. The rest are only
Acquaintances. I’m uncomfortable around people.
•recently Madison has been living at college, far away from my college so I’ve been hanging out with Don everyday. 
•Don died and I found him. We were supposed to hangout, he wasn’t answering any of my calls but we were close friends so I figured I should go to his house and “wake him up”... nobody ever assumes the other person is dead or something, ya know? He was only 21, not near death, no physical health problems. 
•grief has only been numbness and random crying and mood swings for me, lately. I also have never been good at expressing emotions so I prefer to do it alone.

Now I don’t want to hangout with anyone for more than a few hours at a time, days in between hang outs. I’m uncomfortable and alone, even when with company. I would rather feel these things alone otherwise I’m frustrated and mean to whoever I’m with. I can’t consider my feelings and also listen to the million things they want to tell me.
I never really get a word in, I just listen to them constantly and I just can’t anymore. My brain is so scattered, I don’t want to hear about their problems or small talk anymore. It’s been taking a lot out of me to “life”, lately.
My dad is texting me things like “you can’t be secluded here”  (“here” as in my home, which is my dad’s house. He also convinced me to live with him instead of living with my mom. Why would he say that? I’m not unpleasant to live with, I obviously keep to myself).
“You always run away when we come over” 
Blah blah blah. I understand, they want to hangout. But unfortunately my stepmom is my worst nightmare. I feel crippled when people watch me doing whatever I’m doing. I can’t remember how to walk normally or pick things up or even breathe. She is constantly doing that. She comments on my behavior out loud. I once tried to talk to her about Don and she instead tried to tell me about a friend of a friend she knew in high school who committed suicide. Okay thanks, great talk. -.-
Honestly that is the last person I want to talk to right now, and I’ve told my dad my feelings about her. I don’t mind her if she leaves me be but when she’s acting like that, I want to leave. I have even asked my dad to talk to her about it and to explain my social anxiety (which shouldn’t need explaining, she claims to have social anxiety, and she has lived with me for 6yrs....she should get it by now, I’m always home and coexisting) but he hasn’t. 

So then at my moms house, I hangout with them more often. My mother, brother and sister. 
My mom constantly wants to talk and never let me get a word in, she tries to work on it but it always ends up with me silently listening and becoming drained. My mom doesn’t understand why I’m drained.
My sister is usually in a bad mood, she is goin through puberty and is an angsty teen. She gets mad when I’m drained from socializing all day and want to go home. I tried to explain to her why I felt that way, she didn’t get it. 
My brothers fine, he mostly plays video games.

But what should I do? They obviously don’t understand grief. Even though they saw me at the police station after I got interviewed about my dead friend right after it happened. They saw him at every family event and in all of my pictures and knew I went to hang out almost everyday.... yet they are mad at me? Why? 
I don’t know how to communicate that I just need to be alone. Pushing myself is making me crazy, I’m giving up. ",03Aug2018,2

Close family friends have come to me saying they’d be more than happy to take care of me for a bit if I decided to head out there, and the truth is, I’m considering taking them up on that, at least until I could start making money, as finding work has never been an issue for me. Plus, I love San Francisco, I feel just at home as I would on the east coast, everything about just seems like I could kinda start over. I’m tired where I’m at.

43,"nooooo! I live with two other women in a shared house. One of my roommates is a pastry chef and brought home some leftover cookies from work and they've been in the fridge several days. I have a rule to only buy healthy food because I know if I buy it- I will eat it. I get pretty intense sugar cravings at night. But I KNOW this is unacceptable and I'm super embarrassed and learned my lesson. I would normally just replace them, but these were made at her work! UGH!

I want to make it up to my roommate (I'm pretty generous with her- drive her to work sometimes, also I buy most of the toilet paper for the house, plus organize all the rent stuff) but i'm just so embarrassed to admit my lack of self control. She's very into 420 so I'm tempted to say I was high because she would be pretty sympathetic to that- and do something nice for her to ease my conscience. Even if she doesn't say anything, it would just kill me to not address it at all and have the mystery of the vanished cookies. Though I gotta say, she's very talented.

Do our friends define us as a person? Or am I just using this as an excuse for my own failures? What do you do when you like the friends you have but they don’t challenge you to do more in life? I feel like the smartest guy in the room most of the time. And I’ve read that is not a good thing....

52,"I've been stressing about this and only this all day long.  

So  I accepted and started at one job. However, there were some misrepresentations by the HR lady and major red flags. Plus, I realized I genuinely didn't care for the job or the work environment. I decided it would be best for both if I left after the first day instead of leaving in a few weeks to months, especially since it was entry-level and needed training. I had discussed doubts with my boss at the end of the day and then called her to quit before the start of the next day. I ended up taking another job offer because it was a much better fit all-around and they were extremely passionate about me as a candidate.

For context, the job I left the first day was owned by a religious organization, we'll say Pastafarian. That's how the HR lady always intro'd herself. When first signing with this first job, I briefly mentioned to the HR lady that I had turned down an offer with a specific niche industry job, which I ultimately reconsidered. I'm in my first week of this new job, and I overhear one of the higher-ups in HR say in a puzzled voice, ""Some Pastafarian organization is trying to get a hold of us.""

Many of the vibes from this HR lady and reviews make me believe it's plausible she's trying to sabotage my new job out of spite. I made a huge mistake, but this seems unnecessary. It simply wasn't a good fit, although I greatly regret wasting their time as it wasn't my intent. I should have been more thorough, but the HR lady cut me off when I was asking questions during the interview and wasn't totally forthcoming until after I signed.

One thing is I have been very transparent with my current job before hiring. I didn't mention having started doing some work in the afternoon, which was unexpected and how I uncovered red flags, but I did tell her I walked in. I also told her I originally accepted the offer over the phone. However, I'm afraid of them mentioning that I did start some work there might make me look like I'm not passionate about this current job, although I am. I'm also afraid because the CEO has a scholarship fund with the sister organization of this place. I don't know what to do or say, and this has been on my mind nonstop because I couldn't be more happy and excited about my job, and I'm afraid of it being jeopardized because the HR lady took it personally.

53,"A few months ago a family member asked me to show a woman they had just met who was travelling to my country if I could show them around and have her stay for a bit. Sure not a problem. Do it all the time and it's a lot of fun.

She really enjoyed the time she spent here but it was over the holiday period, it was summer and we could do day trips and BBQ's and the odd jump around hanging out by the pool drinking and chilling etc. I also introduced her to a number of people from her country who live here and run some seriously cool businesses in an area she is extremely passionate about. 

Now she is making serious plans to move here. That's great and all and I'm happy she seems to have found a place she can pursue her interests but I'm worried she has  seriously underestimated how fricking difficult it is to build a life in a new country and that her holiday experience is the base line she is going to expect if and when she does actually get here. 

She has a business and a house she could buy here but I'm not sure what kind of arrangements she has in place for this. She has money and had a very lucrative career at home which she won't be able to fall back on here. 

Her plans are bold to say the least and I'm not sure how much she is expecting from us to help her with this. One of them involves setting up a very niche business which requires a ton of capital investment and only really works if you have a solid reputation and are extremely well known in the local market. This is very much a place where it is all about who you know and people will not deal with you if you are just some random. 

While she is very nice and a lot of fun there are some personality traits that just don't mesh with mine. She is a linear thinker and if she wants to do something she expects everyone else to get on board with it. No I don't want to go camping by the beach 15 minutes from my house and sleep in a tent. I have a house with a toilet and coffee and wifi and actual beds. Needling us for hours about how much fun it will be will not change this. I don't want to sleep in a campground with drunk 18 year olds doing donuts in their WRX's. She filmed one of our Sunday night sessions and uploaded it to FB. Nothing extreme, just a few of us with some wine and having a dance but I'm very very careful about things like that and I don't like people putting shit up on the internet without asking. You sure as hell don't tag me in anything. Her FB is heavily locked down and very carefully curated so it's not like she doesn't understand the reasons for it. 

She also ended up hooking up with one of my flatmates. All good everyone is an adult. Whatever. Then my other flatmate tells me she would regularly come and knock on his door late at night wanting to sleep in his room because it was too hot upstairs. He told her that was too bad and to go back to her room. I sleep upstairs. Yeah it does get hot, but I deal with it. Sleep in one of the lounges if it is that bad. Hell you can even sleep outside on the verhanda. It's perfectly safe. I've done it. 

The trying to sleep with my flatmates left me pretty annoyed. You are a guest in someones home and old enough to know better that this kind of thing can cause she pretty unpleasant outcomes. Thankfully my dudes are cool as shit, but if they weren't?... Neither of them are that fussed if she comes back and stays but both of them have told me they would prefer she doesn't because  it just showed a lack of judgement. So we are all on the same page with that. 

I've said I'll call her over the weekend as she wants to contact me but I'm bricking myself she is expecting a whole level of transition support which I absolutely do not have the mental of emotional energy to expend on her. I'm in short reserves as it is dealing with some serious health issues with my elderly parents and preparing a case for the High Court which could drag out for years. 

I don't think her end goal is realistic. I really don't. I'm just worried she is expecting she can just move into my house and use it as a launch pad for her 'vision'. It will do my fucking head in. It's not like I can say there isn't room. 

But I know exactly the mental processes people go through when they move to a new country. The first 4-6 weeks are wild excitement and the 6 months after that are endless complaints about how difficult it is and how awful and inept everything thing is in the new place is compared to home. I don't want to hear it.

So for the advice issue. How do I make it clear to her that I'm pleased she is following her dreams but I'm not going to be here to pick up the peices if it all turns south?  I also don't want a new flatmate and I'm pretty uncomfortable with the interactions she imposed on the guys while she was here last time. ",03Aug2018,1

Full time personnel: work 40-45 hours a week. 80-90 hours a pay period. I take home $1900 after taxes but it’s guaranteed regardless of hours. Flexible schedule. Five sick days a year and a week vacation plus paid holidays. No other benefits. 

I’m already having a hard time financially anyway because of my $690 private family insurance. I’ve applied for Medicaid for my kids and decided I will drop insurance for my husband and I, or if I don’t qualify I will just carry insurance on my kids to save some money. I knew that these hours I was working wouldn’t last forever so it was only a matter of time before I was cut in some way shape or form and part of me feels like taking this position is the safer bet even though it seems like a bullshit “promotion”. 

I just don’t know what to do. Find another job?  Maybe I’m thinking of this wrong and it’s a better deal than I think?  Stick it out for six more months and ask for a raise?  Also if I get a masters degree the salary rises to $72000.00 per year, I’m starting my masters in a week. Stick it out until then?  Another company offered me $36 for hire and I didn’t take it because they seemed in disarray. Say screw it and go over there?  Help! ",03Aug2018,2
66,"There's a huge guy who is a regular at the bar where I am also a regular. He stares, follows me around, scares off any other people around, never smiles, has uncomfortable conversations  (like tells me about pregnantion fantasties he sexts with some underage girl), and insists on hugging me as soon as he sees me and many times again before he leaves, also patting my head and back randomly when he sees that I'm ignoring him. He also hugs me and touches me as fake comfort when someone asks how my sick grandpa is. 

He's starting to get the hint that I don't enjoy his company but I'm wanting to knock these hugs off. 

How should I tell him politely to stop hugging and touching me? ",03Aug2018,1

70,"My parents are divorced. I live with my mom and older  sister. I don't know if the problem is puberty or if this is just stupid but my sister hates my mom. My mom isn't around much, working a very hard job, when she comes home she's very stressed about her work, the house, etc and normally yells at us about it. I take it and try to do better and clean up and make her life less stressed. But my sister yells back at her, saying she shouldn't use that tone and is being rude. Other times when my sister snaps at my mom, my mom yells back at her. I'm normally the one breaking it up. My mom thinks what she says is law and she doesn't have to justify anything she does. She also thinks that she is abused by us. While my sister thinks my mom should act like an adult and a mother and that she isn't emotionally stable. Both of them rant to me while I try to justify the other side's actions. I don't know why this stresses me out so much but it does and I don't know what to do, any advice you be great.

71,"To preface I've lived outside the US for the last 4 years of my live because my family was deployed, and just returned to the US to the state of Kentucky. One day I struck up a conversation with one of the homeless people in the area, his age was around 40-50 and he told me about Child Protective Services taking his kids and ruining his life. At first I thought he just couldn't afford to take care of them anymore and that's why they were removed, but he backed up his statement with this video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhIh4Tm7vWk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhIh4Tm7vWk)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HJdsOWHKYc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HJdsOWHKYc)

From what I can gather from the videos and various research I did online, it would seem his claims were legitimate and CPS is indeed abusing their power for money by maximizing adoption rates for federal bonus money. I also noticed in the interview they did with the head of CPS he said it wouldn't make sense to spend 39 mil to get 1 mil, but the 1 mil was bonus money or pocket money, and he didn't actually state how much money the department was receiving from the federal government in total, which seems very shady.

So I was wondering if this is really going on in Kentucky? Is this going on in more states? If so where can I find court documents and financial information confirming or denying it? Is there any politician running against this? ",03Aug2018,1

73,"I am a moderately tattooed female with some small facial piercings (thin nose ring and opal lip stud). I don't have a ton of tattoos, but I do have small black line work at my wrists, a large giraffe buddha on my one upper arm and a pair of punk hands holding pinkies on the other lower arm, chest pieces (that are concealed by a button-up shirt), most of my back covered, and palm sized pieces at my right knee and foot. I got several of these tattoos when I was working in the ""corporate"" world in Real Estate, placing them to be easily covered up. 

Now, having more arm tattoos and probably needing to go find a stud for my nose, I'm concerned about interviews as I move from spending the last several years teaching yoga and dance, to going back into Real Estate. I'm looking to join a team as an administrative assistant and I don't know when to broach the topic of my body art. 

I intend to go to interviews with long sleeves and pants to make a good first impression that isn't altered by my appearance (thankfully I started growing out the mohawk a few months before making this decision... I have short textured blond hair), but I don't know if I love the idea of being covered up all the time, and I hate dishonesty/deceit. 

Keeping in mind I live in Portland, Oregon, where just about everyone has body art to some extent, and my social media profiles aren't private, when is the appropriate time to mention the real me to an employer? How much do you think it's worth talking about? In a progressive, liberal town, would you employ an incredibly well qualified, experienced person with excellent social skills who just happens to have a decent amount of tasteful body art?

He choked my roommate (28f) that lives with me and my family because she told him not to talk to my mom so rudely. And now he’s chased me (24f) around my front yard, trapped me inside my barn and screamed at me to come out and that he was going to kill me because I threw a glass at the door in frustration because he was calling me a whore. I called the police that day but told them nothing because I didn’t know if could go to jail for throwing the glass. He was arrested at my grandmothers for fighting my cousin but they dismissed the case for some reason. The day he threatened my life has seriously scared me. I’ve never been so scared in my life.

She’s been talking to lots of strangers online, putting single in her bio when she wants a new boyfriend, even looking for attention by writing bomb threats on the bathroom walls. So far in the past 2 months she’s had about 3 boyfriends that her friend told me about. All of those lasted about a week or less, and the guys were all above 20. They seemed pretty creepy and knew fully that it was illegal to date her. I know I’m being sorta paranoid but I don’t want her to end up ruining her life in the future. I don’t have her parent’s phone number (they hate me anyway) and the only friend I have hasn’t been able to do much. I’ve told her several times that it isn’t safe but she just replies with some bullshit like “age doesn’t matter” or she’ll just get defensive.

We made it all through college together and everything. Many many ups and downs but she's been the love of my life. Typically I've been the one who fucks up in the relationship, the usual guy stuff. but lately she has been pushing to get married like asap. Saying that she doesn't believe in my love for her or feel any love because I don't want to get married right now. She says what difference does it make if we're married now or in 2 years?. Which to me is just complete bs. I understand we've been dating for a while but I've been put in almost like an ultimatum.  We're stuck right now. She's so set on marriage . And I just don't want it right now point blank. I've told her many times that I do want it with her. Just at a later date. It has always been in the plane with this woman. This is a massive step for a couple and not something I want to be pressured into. She comes from a very catholic family and is an incredible woman, I grew up catholic as well but not like that at all... our relationship has turned extremely toxic because of this. She's deeply hurt right now,  were barely speaking, and we've been fighting a ton whenever we do talk, and recently went on a ""break."" We don't live together. I graduated college a little late. I've been working fulltime for about 1.5 years. She's getting a new 1 year lease with a roommate and I said I'm game for moving in after your lease was done.

81,"My husband and I moved 18 months ago from the Midwest (st Louis) to the south. We’ve both always been good at moves, good at making the best of where we live and blooming where we’re planted, but this time is different. Hubs works for a major airline so we moved into his base thinking his quality of of life would be better - and by some accounts it is. He’s home a LOT more and that’s great! We also get free flights to anywhere so we’re able to travel to see family - but we fly standby and I’m finding that with two going on three kids the constant flying back and forth is wearing on me. There’s a little bit of an expectation that because our flights our free, we should be the one to come to everyone and not the other way around, which I totally get but it doesn’t make it any easier, ya know? 

We got a house quickly and it’s ended up being a total lemon - needed a ton of unexpected work and attention and money which has limited our expendable funds and made it harder to settle in and enjoy our space. Neither of us care for the bedroom community we chose AT ALL. It’s easily the most boring place we’ve ever lived, and despite its proximity to a large city (atlanta) it manages to totally lack any semblance of the culture and soul (for lack of a better word?) that St. Louis did. 

One thing we do like is the people we’ve managed to meet here. We somehow managed to be fairly isolated in St. Louis (it was one of our main reasons to leave) but I can’t shake the idea that it was because we were both working so called “alpha” 9-5 jobs. The reason we’ve met so many people here is 100% because I’m no longer working and have had time to develop our social circle. I find myself constantly wondering if we still lived there or moved back it would be different now that I have the time to reach out to people. 

We’ve started to broach the subject of moving north of atlanta because it’s got a little more culture and a better vibe but part of me wonders if we’re gonna do that - why not just move our asses back to the Midwest? I just hate feeling like I’m not home. I’m not sure how long you’re supposed to stick this sort of thing out before you throw in the towel and go with your gut. Moving again would be a huge pain in the ass, a huge expense, and yet another huge upheaval for our kids. St. Louis isn’t a base for my husbands airline and likely never will be - he’d be resigning himself to commuting forever. I’m relatively certain if we moved back we would never leave again, however.

Overall my husband is a great person, he supports me, helps around the house, the kids, loves me etc. The major thing that really bothers me is that he doesn't do enough to stick up for me against his family. Long story short, his brother's wife has been harassing me for years - both online and in person. She treats our kids horribly and constantly talks about me to other people. I have a successful holistic business and she is now trying her best to do the same, which is fine. She has come into my network of business and is just a horrible person to myself. Things got to bad that he pushed me when I was at a park with my kids and she was with hers and I ended up calling the police; She's just trouble. My husband's brother has told my husband that her life goal is ruin my life. 

Anyway, there's more details above but she is not the major issue as I can't really stop her, she hides under fake profiles online and the police said I couldn't prove the assault/slander anything she has done to me. My husband's family on the other hand of course don't approve of her behaviour but don't care to stop her. After the assault last yr, I tried to take her to court but my mil said not to to because I didn't have proof and she could sue me for deformation if I lose the case (I don't know if that was true or not). Mils way of keeping the peace was to call a family meeting and get this woman and I to come to agreements. Nothing works with this woman. I told her not to post pics of my kids because I have a public job and she still does it which shows she doesn't care about my kids. 

My in laws way of dealing with her harassing me is keeping us away from each other. So I have done nothing wrong but I'm not allowed to come to family events anymore and either is she. I told my husband this was unfair and he shouldn't bring our kids to events without me but he still does and doesn't care about my feelings. They say this isn't about me, it's about keeping a relationship between my kids and her kids (cousins) strong, which I understand but don't think it's right. 

Also when I called the police, my husband was mad and said I shouldn't have called the cops on family and should have spoken to him 1st and they would have all spoken to her. It's been 10 years of her doing horrible things to me (too many to name and many illegal that I can't prove) and every time something happens, their way of dealing with it is to tell her not to do it again, but she always does. 

I have accepted that my in laws can't help me. Recently my husband has shown even more where his loyalties lie. We had an agreement that he wouldn't take our kids to his brothers place and he broke that agreement. She also did something recently and he said he would talk to her about it but now he says theres nothing he can do. I'm pregnant with our 3rd child and though I had an idea of his past. He promised me he would take my side and stick up for me and after that agreement; I decided to have another child with him. Now I regret it. I feel like I'm trapped =(",03Aug2018,4
100,"Hey reddit, I’ll just get right to it, so there’s this girl, she’s gorgeous, funny, charming, and we get along very well with each other and she always goes out of her way to say hi to me when she comes in, the only reason I haven’t already asked her for her number is because she works for one of the grocery/liquor delivery company’s (like shipt/instacart) and she comes into the liquor store I work at all the time, and I haven’t asked her for her number because I would hate for her to either 1. Say no and then it would be weird for her every time she came in the store (I for one wouldn’t mind I completely understand not everyone is into everyone else romantically , and can go on platonically after a simple “no”) or 
2. She says yes because she feels obligated because she has already thought of scenario (1.) from above.

I said I was going to/considering to get this procedure to my mom a week before the date, she called me crazy and said it was waste of money. I’ve told my grandmother nothing as she only speaks Spanish, and I don’t. My mom speaks Spanish though, so I was hoping that I would convince her to be alright with it and then tell my grandma about it so she wouldn’t be shocked when I suddenly came home with a cast on my face. The surgery is today. (I can’t tell my mom now before I leave because I know she’ll try to follow me to the surgeons office and cause a scene).

How should I deal with my family when I return? I feel like sending a text at the last second to my mom saying “getting surgery right now just fyi xdd” would be pointless.

107,"I’m never aware of when I’m not sympathetic, I know when I’m mean and rude because I can do that on purpose

But my closest friend says I’m dick to him  and everyone else and says I need to learn to be more compassionate or else he’ll leave me. And when he said that I was dick to him I was honestly surprised because i did everything I could ever do for him and I the meanest thing I’ve ever said to him was that his face was average. 

But I’m over what he’s said and I accept the problems he has with me, while I don’t agree I know arguing would only be in vain.

So now I’m here, completely out of close friends because they side with him (everyone sees him like a god)

All my life I’ve been hearing that I need to learn sympathy and empathy. No matter how polite and nice people think I am or how reliable they know I am, in the end they always say I’m not sympathetic and compassionate 

For a couple years now I’ve been convinced that I had some sort of mental disorder like autism(it’s common in my family) or maybe im a sociopath or something like that. I’ve asked my family to get me therapist, even my school told them to get me evaluated and my parents said they would and then just forgot/ignored it later. This has happened more than three times.

I want to get better, I want to be better so I can experience things like everyone else. I can’t connect with my friends or s/o the way others can

Since it doesn’t seem like I’m going to get professional help any time soon, could you provide examples on being sympathetic/ compassionate in everyday life so I do that?

110,"I live in a big city downtown in California, but my neighborhood is 99% hispanic. And the grocery stores I frequent are not in walkable range so I sometimes go to a local 99 Cent Store right outside my apartment complex to buy some frozen produce and sauce.

I am probably the only Eastern Asian guy going to that store and I'm very easy to be spotted. So after some time ago few employees started recognizing me, and one of them would ask me personal questions a lot. But all I cared was to just gtfo after checkout. As time went on, employees will say ""Oh he's here again"" or ""Gotta find XX, he came to see her"" etc. That same female employee will try cover the cashier whenever I am awaiting to checkout. One time an employee kind of teased at me that she won't checkout my things until I go talk to XX and give my number. I felt uneasy and stopped going to that store often.

Today I ran out of some condiments and stirfry sauce, and I was too lazy to drive to the market so I just walked to the 99 Cent Store. Again, that female employee took the cashier just as I was about to checkout. I just said ""Hi"" and wanted to gtfo as soon as possible not even waiting for the receipt. 

But her and an employees followed me on the way out, asking me why I haven't been back lately and whether if I'm avoiding them. I said I go to another store for groceries and that I don't have any reasons to be related to her nor avoid her. Then they kind of pressured me to date her or be friends, but I absolutely have no intentions to do that so I kindly refused saying I am not interested in anyone and not into dating. 

I am honestly only attracted to Asians and no other ethnicities with slender physique as I grew up in Eastern Asia and that cultural aspect got engraved in me. She was nothing of that and I didn't even have any thoughts of being friends as well, I am not outgoing and careful to meet new people.

They started questioning why I don't take interest in her and raised their voices, then accused me of being a racist and a misogynist saying ""thought all Asians were nice"" ""Why do you live here if you don't accept our community"" and so on. I just wanted to be in silence and head home quick at that point but they continued to follow me and eventually made quite a scene with all the customers watching me. I did not want them to know where I live so I calmly asked them to stop and just let me be on my way and that I don't want to call the police for assistance. They said ""Okay, go"" and I walked away but I heard people talking and laughing in Spanish. I purposely walked to the opposite direction away from my place and retraced back to avoid them of seeing where I live.

I'm here now concerning what to do to keep my privacy in the neighborhood and how to avoid further complications at all cost. Even if I never go in the store again, my apartment entrance is literally 2 minutes away from the store and sometimes I see the employees on the streets. I still want to shop at that store because they carry some products exclusive to there. And if possible I would rather want to resolve things with them nicely so that I wouldn't constantly stress about it and it doesn't backfire on me someday when I encouter them.

112,"We’ve had a flirty relationship but only at work. No socializing away from work. The flirting was very basic. He is shy, a very good guy. 

We bonded about how hard it was to get to know our coworkers and chatted daily, including some texting after work.  He always initiated. 

I had told him I planned on quitting and his first reply was to shrug and laugh, “Nooo, You aren’t going anywhere. Stop it.” 

Well, he started to text more afterwards, saying it might be hard to find another job and finally saying he wanted to stay in touch if I did leave. He stressed he likes few people and thought very highly of me. 

Boom, it happened. I quit three days ago and he now ignores me completely. The only communication was a text, short in tone, asking where I was going. 

It’s so weird to me. He is acting like he is very angry at me as if it’s personal, it reminds me of my jealous ex a little bit. 

I was game to staying in touch but I’m now so baffled by his behavior. 

I tried to reach out via text  “I barely have seen you. You okay?” The response...”I’m swamped”.  

We are all swamped, nothing changed in his work.

My question....why would a close coworker cut you off if you quit? I have felt very sad when friends left but still happy for them and stayed in touch. 

He clearly wants nothing to do with me so I will let him be. He always was the initiator. Sounds like it will be a tense two weeks ahead. 

I hate to leave on such terrible terms but I am not one to ignore the hint either. Message received! I definitely won’t bother him.

I was incredibly ambitious in high school and thought I basically had my life and career mapped out. I was going to be a hair stylist/fashion photographer and I was going to live my passions. In my early 20s I was homeless but got in a program that helped me out and during that time I attended beauty school. Well, I ended up having to drop out for reasons that were beyond my control. It's been 6 years since then, I'm almost 30 years old and I'm going nowhere fast. 

I decided that I wanted to go to mortuary school instead of doing hair but that requires school that requires an internship which in turn requires your driver's license. I've never driven a day in my life. Right now I'm trying to make that   my main goal but I know I could never afford to own a car. 

I'm utterly stuck between working toward my driver's license, then going to school part time while also working part time and eventually trying to become a mortuary tech which all sounds exhausting and impossible. OR going back to beauty school if I can (which may include more student loan debt) while also working. OR I can just focus on getting a full time job so that I can afford to live better and possibly kiss school goodbye because I can't work full time and go to school.

121,"Hello.

I live in a small town in Michigan. Came to the States for grad school, found a job here less than 2 years ago. When I got hired we made a deal with my boss. I promised him I would stay with the company for a while, and in return he said the company would apply for an H1B visa for me after my first year.

I don't really have issues with work except the usual daily frustrations, but I'm having a hard time living here. I'm approaching my mid-30s. I don't have friends except my coworkers and some acquaintances; but what bothers me the most is being lonely and sexually inactive since the dating scene is practically non-existent (gay guy here), especially when I think about how little experience I have (I'm already worrying about impotence.) In general I have little experience in life; all my life I went to school and did nothing else. I feel like my time is wasting away.

I had people telling me to find another job and move, but I don't think it's a smart decision because of my visa situation. Currently I am allowed to stay in the States until early 2020, which means I have only one chance at H1B application (April 2019.) I can't afford to miss the chance my current employer is giving me.

Recently I have been thinking, maybe I could still relocate since remote work is an option at my company, but there are so many reasons it's a bad idea. I don't know how I could afford living in a bigger city. I don't earn much, living paycheck to paycheck because of bills I will have to keep paying for at least two more years (can't even buy a car.) I have established primary healthcare here and visit a therapist regularly (checked in to the psychiatric unit a bit more than a year ago because I was suicidal). He knows a lot about me and my struggles. I don't know how long it would take to get to the same point with another therapist, assuming my insurance would cover it, which is not guaranteed at all. How would I find a cheap place with access to public transportation, a gym, and a grocery store at the very least? Just the idea of it is exhausting. When I think about it, I end up telling myself, ""All that trouble just to be able to fool around and date? You don't even know if moving there will fix anything."" The whole idea sounds ridiculous until a couple of days later when I go back to feeling desperate.

122,"Hello, 

 I need advice on a tricky friend situation I am in. For my birthday, my mom gave me Beyonce concert tickets. My mom also gave me an extra ticket for me to invite a friend. Prior to my birthday, I knew about going to the concert. My mom asked me if this was a concert that I wanted to go to and of course my answer was ""YES!!"". She also told me that she would buy an extra ticket for me to bring a friend. So, I asked my friend Laura probably about a month ago if she wanted to go with me. And of course, she is very eager to go. However, in the past month, and with me strengthening and weakening other friendships, I have realized that maybe I would rather bring my friend Sidney. When I sit down and really think about it, I just met Laura about 3 months ago, we havent really hung out much just the two of us. Sidney and I, have known each other since we were very young, and we are part time neighbors. Both of the girls though have helped me so much in each of our friendships. Right now, if I had to pick between the two girls to go with me, I would pick Sidney. Its a tough choice, but i think in the long run, I would have more fun with her. With Sidney, her and I have hung out a lot together just the two of us and I know that we would have a lot of fun together. With Laura, I am scared that since we havent hung out much, it might be a bit awkward to bring her to a concert, not knowing if we will have much to talk about. What I need advice on, is which friend do I choose? I dont have much time before the concert so I need to decide soon. But the problem is that I had already asked Laura, about a month ago if she wanted to go with me. But, not thinking, I asked Sidney if she wanted to go with me as well. I cant bring both of them unfortunately, so I am in a bit of a sticky situation. My preferred friend would be Sidney, so if i were to bring her, what do i say to Laura without losing her as a friend? How can I break the news? What do I do?

He was diagnosed three or four days ago when we brought him to the vet after vomiting, and he's been deteriorating. He's eating, drinking, peeing, and cleaning himself, but he's not releasing any solid waste. She said he wasn't constipated when we brought him.

We've been giving him a medicine that apparently has a 50% chance of working from the vet. She told us we would see results in two days if it worked, and we haven't.

When he came home, he was leaking diarrhea all over for two days, so maybe that's why he hasn't released anything. According to my dad though, he's seen him stand over his litter box and try to use it but nothing comes out.

We're seriously considering putting him down if this medicine isn't working, and it seems like he's reaching the end. According to the vet, after we try this medicine, there's no more options. According to the Internet, megacolon can be easily treated in many different ways.

128,"Hi,

I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 2 years, and we're very happy together. I know that she loves me, and I trust her comppetely.

However, I'm a bit insecure and that causes me to overthink and overanalyze from time to time.

Yesterday, we were sitting outside and talking. Some random dude approaches us with his cute dog and starts talking to us after seeing we liked his dog. He started telling us how he feeds her, takes care of her, showed us his expensive phone, kept showing photos to my gf etc.

Now, I know he wasn't openly flirting with her or anything, but I kind of felt like he was imposing and that he was only trying to impress her. He was an interesting dude, but he kept talking with her on and on. She was interested in what he had to say, but I felt it was more from a friendly siđe and liking his dog.

Anyway, after we left I shut down for a few minutes to supress those primitive feelings. I know I was wrong to feel that way. Maybe he was just a friendly guy who likes to talk about his dog. I told her that he bothered me and that I think it's immature and irrational to feel this way. I kept rambling on about it and she said she was glad I opened up but that I was being too hard on myself. I realized how silly I was being and we kinda laughed it off.

She was right tho. I would never want to be a controlling, constantly jealous guy and I always try to be more ""evolved"" than that. Especially since my abusive father is like that, and I always worry that I'm going to be like him one day. He treated me and my family badly, and I don't ever want to be like him if I were to have a family with this, or any other girl.

While she seemed okay with my admittance, I sort of feel like she may have lost some respect for me deep inside. If that's the case, how should I remedy the situation ?

For future reference, I am going to deal with these things on my own from now on. I really care about her and don't want to drive her away with minor things such as these.",03Aug2018,1
129,"Hello everyone. I am simply looking for someone to talk to, or to listen to some advice. I'm a single male in my late 20s. I have no dependents, and I live in my own apartment in a very expensive Canadian city. I have a ChemE degree that I got 4 years ago, but haven't really used since then. I was lucky enough to invest early in cryptocurrency, and escaped with a few million dollars, which is how I've been surviving for the last half decade. 

As you can imagine, I have traveled extensively over the last 2 years, without once thinking about my future. However, as I have been getting older, I have come to realize that I have accomplished nothing. Currently my time is spent in front of a computer screen just wasting the day away. As surprising as it sounds, I got tired of traveling and spending money. After 5 months every 5 star hotel was the same, and almost nothing got me excited. I'm still glad I had that experience, but it has left me feeling empty. I never get excited by anything anymore, and I feel my lack of purpose is a major issue, as such I have been searching for something meaningful to do.

I should note that I have no desire to use my engineering degree, as working in the field for what would be a comparatively small sum, is quite frankly unappealing. I have also forgotten almost everything. I am interested in starting my own company, but I simply lack the skills to do so (technical skills), which has greatly discouraged me. Perhaps it's because I'm a bit of a perfectionist, but when I compare my skills and what I can accomplish to what is already out there, I just can't get motivated. I have been learning Python and SQL, and I already had a very good understanding of MATLAB and prediction models. But I can't think of anything that is both possible at my level, and ties these skills together. 

The days just go by so slowly now, and I'm constantly fighting the urge to run away and go to some far off land and dick around for a month. I have talked to a therapist, and was told that I have mild depression, and that medication is not recommended. Thank you for any advice.

130,"So about me, I’m 19 I live at home with my loving family we all get along great and it’s a good environment which I’m very thankful for. Everything in my life was very average for most of my teenage years up until about 1-2 years ago. I had a very profound spiritual awakening, I essentially went from an overweight gamer to a fit in tune hippie that loves to read books, meditate, be in nature, etc. I began to see life much differently from everyone around me I quit caring about money(still need it to survive though), material possessions, and stuff like that. For more than a year now I’ve had an overwhelming desire to sell all my stuff and escape western culture as I see that it is toxic to my being. I seek isolation and nature as that is where I thrive. I spend most of my days locked in my room working on my online business and currency trading that no one in my family knows about and I’ve been saving every dollar that I make which has now grown to a substantial amount and will continue to grow for years to come as long as I do the ground work now these will be able to pay me for most of my life if I live simply. This is where my predicament comes in. When I turned 18 I wanted to move out with some friends, but as soon as my mother heard she broke down and literally could not take it since her and I are very close. Keep in mind that I was only planning on moving 15 minutes away. I felt so bad she was pleading with me offering to pay for my living expenses and insisted I’m too young to move out I knew I could have left but I didn’t have the heart to. Well it’s been a year since then and I have changed a lot but her and my family haven’t. I’ve been actively planning for a while to sell all my stuff and move to a plot of land with a small home just outside a small town in South America (I plan of visiting soon to check it out ”for a getaway”). I have done extensive research and am very dedicated to my plan. This is what I truly want to do with my life, I want to live off the land in nature by myself. But I don’t know how to explain this to my family, the only times I have ever mentioned anything about this they think I’m joking, little do they know I’m very serious. The issue is I’m capable of processing my emotions and my mother isn’t. I also understand that this is my life and I will do what I want. I don’t feel guilty for wanting to leave I just feel empathy for the pain my mother will go through.

I just have absolutely know clue on how to break it to them as me leaving is basically just like me dying as I will be living off the grid. I don’t know if I should just leave a note and “run away” or should I hire a grief counselor and have an intervention or something? Please help me figure out what to do:( ",03Aug2018,0

132,"So my ex boyfriend and I dated for about a year and a half. I ended things with him and cut him off because I wasn’t feeling it and needed to focus on myself and the things at hand and the relationship was more of a distraction and wasn’t going so well. We didn’t talk for about two months, and then he started texting me out of the blue about once a week. Although small talk, this lasted for about three months. One day we talked, shortly, and then next day he posted a picture of other girl that was clearly a date. I haven’t heard from him since and removed him off all social media networks in hopes of getting over him while he got into another relationship. This didn’t work well, I’m still missing him months and months later and now I’m at a better place with myself to be in a relationship and give it another shot. We had a really great connection and he was honestly my best friend. I’m really not interested in anyone else and I’ve tried to find different ways to get over it. Nothing has worked. The problem is that I have no clue if they are still dating (there’s never any posts of her in over 6 months on either page of their pages which is indifferent from our relationship and I don’t have him on Snapchat) and don’t want to interfere with their relationship if there is one and cause problems. We don’t have many friends in common so I don’t have really any ways of getting any information on their current status. I find that it also may be awkward to add him back if there’s something still going on between them. What should I do? And if I reach out, what exactly should I say and go about this?",03Aug2018,0

134,"Ok not quite that simple

He and I were doing great for about a year (I thought)— like really great. I really thought he was the one— but about 4 days ago, he totally blind-sighted me and told me he couldn’t continue the relationship because he loved me, but not as much as I love him. He said I was the greatest girl he’d ever met and that he loved me and he cared about me, but he just couldn’t bring himself to match how much I love him, reasons for which he said he had thought and cried hard on, but could never actually define. So he thought the best course of action was to dump me without discussing the problem or anything beforehand. I think his exact words were “I love you and respect you too much to make you wait around for me to treat you like I should”, all of which was said with tears in his eyes. He told me how much he would miss me and how great of a person I am and how he wished he didn’t have to do this. But here’s the thing..I don’t think he did have to do this. 

After this breakup I was absolutely crushed. I’m still feeling the effect of it. I’m not eating or sleeping regularly and I miss him so much I physically ache. I’m crying pretty much all the time, and I have thought about nothing else since. Right after it happened, I tried to make logical conversation and argue what I thought was important, but I was too frazzled to make any coherent conversation, and I think so was he. So I set up a meeting with him in a few days (about a week and 2 days after said breakup) so we can make sense of it. 

What I’m asking you, dear internet, is to lay it on me: is it even worth it? Should I try and have this discussion with him that we should’ve had before he dumped me? I feel like I need to, just because his reason was just not good enough to let me sleep at night. I also have this sinking suspicion that he doesn’t actually love me or that he does, but he doesn’t want to put in the work to really fight for our relationship because he’s immature (he’s a 22 year old in a new city in a new job) if you have any thoughts on that too that would be v appreciated. ❤️",03Aug2018,1

I recently (should have) lost my insurance through an insurance provider by way of me losing my job a while back. I figured that I would still have it through the month but I still have it as of today apparently. I have NOT received any notice of the insurance ending.

Why do I care? I have had a recurring minor infection for months. I recently called the help line for my insurance agency just on whim and they let me through to talk to the nurse, who took all my information down and scheduled an appointment with a doctor a couple days from now.

141,"Hi everyone, I am currently looking at options for graduate schools because I will graduate in December with my Bachelors in Healthcare Administration with a minor in economics. I have been looking into different programs for a 1 year program for a Masters in Econometrics, however there don’t seem to be many in the United States (specifically in the NY-NJ area). I started looking into schools overseas and I stumbled upon the University of Edinburgh, University of Amsterdam and Tilburg University. Tilburg and Amsterdam cost about the same at €15,000 ($17,350), while Edinburgh costs about £21,000 ($19,520). I will have to take out a loan for my Masters, luckily I only owe $20,000 in loans that I am paying off now. (Thank you CUNY) I wanted to know if getting a degree outside of the United States is a good idea, and if anyone has ever had the experience or even goes to these schools currently. I haven’t really traveled anywhere before besides the Caribbean and the east coast, I did a study abroad program in Cuba last semester but we were only there for 11 days.

144,"I’ve got my school course selections coming up and that means I have to choose each class I want to be in next year but I’m having 1 conflict about choosing classes. I have to choose between either textiles or intermediate band since I only have 3/8 spaces where I can choose freely and 2 spaces are being held up by French and Woodwork. I’ve recently been getting really into sewing and I find it really fun, I have my own sewing machine and everything and it makes me proud to make things that I can use, like clothes, pillows and pencil cases and my mum really wants me to learn how to sew in-depth and all that, but, on the other hand there is my flute that I have been playing for 1 year and a half, I’ll say that the first year I really enjoyed the flute, it was something new and I just liked it but this year I find it just demanding, my teachers say “practise 5 times a week!” and I don’t practise at all apart from the classes, the whole band thing is just really tedious, and I don’t find it fun at all and honestly some pieces I have to learn and play are just hard and I have no motivation to practise at home and that leaves me going to school, playing the piece with the wrong notes and everything. I have one solution to avoid me not having to stop one, which is, choose band and then do textiles the next year, since I’ll be able to choose 5 things I want to do in the next grade, but, I really don’t want to skip out for a full year on textiles and learning everything, so that made me have another solution of just stopping the flute, I really don’t enjoy playing it, it won’t lead me anywhere at all, once High School is over then I’m just going to stop music, so why not just stop already and stop my own suffering? Uh... because the teachers don’t want you to quit, literally the only thing that’s holding me on to music, but I actually have passion for textiles.

So, what do I choose? Textiles or Intermediate Band? Or any other solutions? I could drop French or Woodwork but those 2 subjects are definitely things I have a high passion for and I can’t just stop doing those 2 and do it in the next year because I wouldn’t learn properly then (same as music) so it’s either out of the last 2...

I've filed a FCC report and called dozens of times to try and get them to upgrade the ""Shard"" but they plain told me several times they're not going to. I think this is completely corrupt because essentially what happened is that took on new customers without also upgrading infrastructure to deal with the higher demand, therefore severely punishing old customers like myself.

\- They charge absurd prices for slow speeds that now aren't even stable.

151,"Throwaway account because if my friends saw my name, they'd immediately know who this is.

About two years ago, I DM'd one of the best homebrews in Dungeons and Dragons in my life. The players liked me a lot that I became a good friend out of game. These guys were the BOMB. I had so much fun talking, playing games, ranting, giving advice, and so much more with them. But, around Christmas time, they started to treat me worse and worse. From calling me by my screen name to insults, always telling me to shut up even if I have something to contribute to the conversation, etc. It was as if I was getting pushed out. So, I cut all communication with them, except for one person(We'll call him Tyler). Tyler was the only nice person in the group and understood my view on the group. He wanted to stay friends, so we'd occasionally say hi and ask how's life been. 

Then, May this year, Tyler reached out to me saying that the group wanted me back. After listening to my friends irl, I decided that if I hated it, then I'd leave immediately. I got back in, and I really doubted what Tyler said. This was through Discord, so I messaged the group hi. No response. This was around 3 PM PST, so people would be on at this point. Nobody said hi back, they just ignored my message. At that point, I was reconsidering if I should have came, but I said screw it and joined a voice channel. Then I got the greetings, but this was two days after I came back.

At first, the group treated me better. Most of the problems I had with them vanished, everybody was respecting each other, and people would acknowledge my existence. Fast forward to today, and everything has changed. 

The first major problem with the group that became harder to ignore was the fact that there was ANOTHER Discord server they hung out in more than this one. I could understand this if it was for a fair reason like somebody needed comfort through a rough divorce or something. But, it wasn't for any reasonable purpose. They would go there and just hang out like they would in the original server. They'd just use the server I was in as a notification server to tell others what they said in that server. They'd constantly have inside jokes that spawn from the other server and I feel so left out seeing them.  

The second major problem with the group was the treatment I was receiving. Most of the time, I'd say hi and ask if anybody wants to play a game since I was bored. No response. A girl in the group says hi. Everybody springs online all of the sudden(and no, none of them had a crush on her). It felt like I was still blocked and people would sometimes read my message. 

Tyler is starting to even get treated like this, but it was for a kind of creepy reason(if you want a hint, he was doing some intense journaling about the girls in the server).

I'm completely and utterly confused on what to do. I know deep down I shouldn't have accepted the invite to come back and I know I should leave. But, I'm conflicted. Whenever everybody gets online and they're willing to actually talk to me, it's a pretty darn fun time. A few of them are actually nice and I'm thankful I met them. For me, leaving them would be a pretty hard door slam on them and I'd hate that. What should I do? 

Side notes: I have never met these people IRL, we just met through an online DnD game Tyler wanted me to DM.

My sister said she was hurt by the fact that my mother pushed her away when she tried calling my house when I was a young kid, and she didn't let her see me.

and we found out that he's had relations with this married lady for yeaaaaars and my mom knows her too. he spends time w her, buys her stuff, drives her around etc while he doesn't do anything for my mom. he's always been a good dad to me and my sister tho and spoils us a lot and does everything for us. mom was bit jealous of that too tbh. anyway yeah it's still q recent like up to recent he was still going out w her n stuff...

I hide it. Sometimes I forget about the moka on the table, and bam he sees the opportunity, doesn't even ask, KNOWS VERY WELL I SAID DON'T USE IT. He uses it anyway, along with other disrespect.

Yeah yeah I'm just looking how to solve this coffee thing, I had to live here because my grandpa was sick before dying, I won't be long anymore with this dumb ass. I'm sick of him.",03Aug2018,4

163,"I’ve been up all night and I can’t seem to sleep and I have work in an hour at 4:45AM. I just need some advice.

So I went with my dad to see a Air Force Reserve recruiter this morning to learn more about Air Force ROTC. I not only learned more about the ROTC program but now I’m seriously considering joining the reserves. 

I am a 18 male, in Texas. I am a senior in high school and taking 2 college classes and business classes. I’m a Eagle Scout. Currently a lifeguard and was a barista at Starbucks for 6 months. I read, write and I run long distance. I do Varsity Track and finished running cross country as well. My family is kinda poor and struggling to pay mortgage. I’ve been helping out with the bills. And I really want to be in the Air Force.

I’ve been thinking about joining the military since in read the book Unbroken back in 2014. Ever since then it’s been growing and now I’m at the point where it is my dream and I want it to be my career. 

This is my plan I’d like some advice on this.

My original plan was to do Air Force ROTC at college for 4 years then join as a officer and make it my career. I would have signed a contract after my freshmen year and had my school be paid for. My top school I want to go to is A&amp;M Corpse of Cadets because I believe they have the best program besides the Air Force Academy. I don’t have the best of grades and have a GPA if 3.25 BUT I think I can get into the Blenn college at college station and be in the Corpse of Cadets. I have a backup college if this doesn’t work at UNT to do the Air Force ROTC.

Now because of Reserves the plan is join reserves get benefits and do a delayed entry for basic training. I would graduate then a few days later leave for basic training in the summer and be back in time to leave for college. Also I would have to take the ASVAB soon if I do join. I am ready to study for to get a good score. This wouldn’t effect school because I’m only taking two hard classes. My recruiter also said because of my Eagle Scout I’m able to go into the reserves as a E3. Seriously Wow. Also I would have a more hands on experience and be a better officer by becoming an enlisted man first.

Please give me advice and give me any warnings that come up.",03Aug2018,0

Sure yeah I'm 22 I can still be a child sometimes but her reactions seem over the top. She gets depressed and asks me questions about guys she is dating or asks me to promise not to leave too soon. But then later inflicts her wrath on me for small insignificant things like leaving a cup on the counter and not washing it or something equally innocuous. I usually get around to it. She just seems to need to yell about SOMETHING. I almost fell down the stairs tonight and apparently it made enough noise to wake her up and she got upset with me and didn't even care that I almost cracked my skull open.

167,"\*\*\*I am an Asian American female engineer who works at a tech company in Silicon Valley that is widely a boys club. I recently had an upsetting experience at a company event that I've felt necessary to share with our HR department. Below is a draft of letter I've crafted but have not yet sent. I'm requesting feedback of all kinds - content, word-smithing, sensitivity, terminology, what have you. Any help is appreciated as I am still upset by this incident and may not have all my ideas straight.

Thank you for your help and stay woke!\*\*\*

Dear HR staff member,

Thank you for your continued support during our committee’s events. Your backing is part of what makes these occasions successful.

Unfortunately, I need to bring to your attention an incident that occurred during the celebration. As a member of the planning committee, I believe in pulling my own weight; no task is beneath me. During the last half hour I bussed empty tables to expedite clean up. While putting waste into a garbage can, Don approached me and thrust two folded one-dollar bills at me, smirking for ostensibly “tipping” me like paid waitstaff for my efforts. I ignored him and turned away. Undeterred, he left the singles on the table I cleaned and returned to his table of colleagues, at least some of them clearly in on what I will generously refer to as the “joke”. A few moments later, when I moved to another table, Jan approached from the same group of men, and laughing, tried to force a $20 “tip” on me. I verbally made it abundantly clear that I found no part of this amusing and again turned away. Instead of taking into stock my negative reaction, Jan behaved with annoyance and argued that the purpose of their spectacle had been to demonstrate that I should not be cleaning. I left the event soon after, with Don not far behind me, calling down the hall to let me know that I had forgotten my “tip” and so he had relinquished it to the bartending staff, the paid help. Persistence and abject stupidity often link arms and never let go. At no time did I provoke, participate in, or sanction this “joke”, actively or passively.

There are several layers to this behavior that I’d like to highlight:

1. The show of disrespect and lack of common decency in deliberately treating a fellow employee as servile or subservient rather than as a peer. It goes without saying that mutual respect is the foothold of a content workplace. These employees’ behavior was a definitive failure of basic respect on many levels. I would also be remiss to not make note of the optics of this incident as an ancillary observation. Both individuals possess significant identity privilege (Don holds a management position; both employees are also white, cis-gendered males) and acted out to ridicule an intersectional employee of lesser title to both in a highly public setting, for all cohorts to witness. That a leader at our company, one who should serve as an example for his subordinates, would not recognize, before or after the event, that treating anyone in this way could be viewed as an abuse of one’s significant privilege speaks volumes about this person’s judgment and character. How we treat others is a report card on what we have learned about compassion, humility, and good character. An A in work performance cannot eclipse these poor grades.
2. The act of casting derision on one who performs janitorial services. What is the fundamental message to the “joke” here? - that those willing to do the dirty work are relegated to a lesser status of humanity? There is an ugly underlying classism here, as if to say a few small bills is the price of condescending to a custodian or busboy.
3. That a group of employees acted out in accord, mutually and repeatedly despite consistent and unambiguously negative response every time. This is a red flag for when people with a common sense of entitlement feel emboldened and supported enough by their commonality to devolve into bullying those outside of that circle of privilege. How and why is it that two moderately intelligent people would mutually decide to behave so poorly in response to seeing someone clean in stark constrast to the several other colleagues who simply offered to help?

The bottom line is this: neither I, nor any other female in this office, should be required to tell colleagues to imagine their mothers, wives, and daughters having singles thrust at them in their places of work for them to understand the degree of disrespect and humiliation that act generates.

Allow me to be pristinely clear that this is no isolated event. It is far from the first time I have experienced or witnessed disrespect, insensitivity, and inappropriate behavior in our office. Several months back I suggested diversity education seminars to your team for exactly this reason. To the extent that this kind of incident occurs frequently enough, I have been labeled a “[social justice warrior](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Social%20Justice%20Warrior)” for being frank with my opinions when I’ve felt my boundaries were crossed and I have frequently and repeatedly been met with casual dismissals such as “I was just joking” or “you just don’t understand my intent”, as if intent supercedes impact. I reveal only a brief snapshot of a typical incident not because I feel that these people would be the better for being formally disciplined, but because they have shown time and time again that they need to be taught how their behavior is inconsistent with the values that The company purports to advocate. I don’t find this incident upsetting only because of the disrespect I was shown, but also because it is abundantly clear to me that no lesson has been learned from the ignorance that begets this kind of behavior. Please help make sure that all at The company receive the appropriate information and tools that they need to ensure that no one is treated this way again here.

Thank you for taking the time to hear out my concerns. I welcome further discussion on what we can do in the future to make our workplace a more inclusive and sensitive environment for all going forward.",03Aug2018,1

169,"For a while now I've noticed a certain behaviour from our instructor that's typical to some people in their line of work. I'm talking about people who are in the position to say anything about those below them after not liking them for petty reasons such as saying no to something, even if doing that can have real consequences in their career.

They have been very hostile to saying no to something and quickly assume that there has to be something wrong with me just because of these assumptions. I feel like over time these assumptions could become complaints and warnings about me, so I've taken some steps to talk with different levels of authorities about what to do should it ever get that bad.

Like anyone, I want a successful future but right now doesn’t look like it’s gonna happen:

I have a passion for computer science but don’t currently have the grades for post-secondary.  I’ve been studying CS related stuff for two years, and know programming langues: c++, python, c#, and also study a lot of software architecture stuff, game development, graphical math etc.

I NEED to keep learning CS stuff but if I prioritize software engineering it will hurt my GPA which I need to improve if I wanna study CS in post secondary. 

Right now I’m probably at a 2nd-3 year uni level but since I’m learning alll alone with very limited resources it’s an upward slope.

And If I go back to school this fall I’m gonna need to do 8 academics (all advanced sciences), or else I won’t be able to get into uni and whole thing is for nought.

Does anyone know of any courses that wouldn’t want a HS diploma but are still prestigious? Probably not. But my situation is rather is rather unpleasant as I don’t feel like sacrificing a year of my life to studying stuff I don’t want to learn.

173,"So my bf [21] has been in a few relationships before he and I starting going out. He had a serious relationship (or whatever was considered serious in highschool) before he was single for a long while then meeting me. In that relationship he lost his virginity. I [20] has never had a boyfriend before. Only lousy dates that ended in nothing. Now that my current bf and I have been together for a good amount of time, I do consider greater things with him. My problem is that from the beginning, I would always think to myself ""someone else was here before I was"" or ""he's been with someone else. He's ""dirty"""". Then I tell myself that it's normal and that this is just human nature. You don't always find the one the same time that other person does too. It just keeps looping in my mind over and over at random times that he's been with someone else and I can't help but feel a little sad or empty.

175,"Hello guys, I’m near to the point of desperation regarding the consideration I have about myself. 

Background:
I’m 27 and happily married, I have a dog and we are trying to have kids (with problems unfortunately). I have a good job (money wise) that let me do a decent life. I’m not that much happy with my job but nor I hate it : it’s a totally neutral position.

I will try to resume the problems I think I’ve for a better explanation :
1.	I’m not Patient 
2.	I always change what I would like to accomplish in life;
3.	When I fail, I start to hate what I started
4.	When I don’t get immediate result, I hate what I started and change to a totally different thin
5.	I tend to lose concentration very fast

Basically the thing is that I would like to have something else that can help me achieve satisfaction and maybe some money too apart from the normal job. To reach this objective I started and NOT completed MANY, MANY things:

1.	Started a youtube channel about programming, but then I started to hate programming (now a lot of people are asking for my return)
2.	Started so many programming projects that were never completed 
3.	Tried to become some kind of esports professional, but then I started to hate even gaming;
4.	Bought so many courses and books that I’ve never finished
5.	Learned so many things, but left unlearned much more
6.     Tried to do domain flipping and spending so much money in it, but without getting any ROI

So basically that’s me today. I hate the things that “yesterday” I loved. I don’t know how to change, where to put myself, what thing to start again.
I really would like to have an interest that I can pursue everyday of my life and that maybe in the future can become something. 
But I have no patient to wait for the result.  
It looks like every time I lose concentration for something after I lose interest in it or worse I hate it. 

That's why I call this an exaggerated discontinuity: I start something, I pursue it (1 day minimum to 3 months maximum), then i stop doing it and worse I hate it or lose interest.

How can I change myself?

Our friend recently got out of a bad, very abusive relationship physically and mentally. He literally has scars. Well, he needed a fresh start. He’s a really good friend and person and we’ve known him for a decade. We were happy to have him live in our house, and he’s been a great roommate so far. He does pay rent, an extremely low amount for the area.

There has been something on my mind lately, due to something that happened recently, we were in a group of friends (formed during an event, some are closer than others) and I was sitting with this girl who had a crush on me (it was slightly reciprocated), and we were discussing something, when a guy started pointing it out to the rest, saying things in order to make fun of me, and I never joked with him that way before (never made fun of him, since I don’t consider him a close friend), so I got so freaking pissed that I was one word shy of knocking him down, the thing is I’ve been told that I don’t get jokes well, and that I’m uptight.

How well do you take jokes from others who are relatively not close?

How do you deal with people trying to make fun of you? (When you don’t like it)

How do you deal with disrespect in general?

196,"ok, so I never really borrowed my game account to this person, what happened was that I were going on vacation and told him that I couldn't play for about 2 weeks, and in this game you really need to be active every day. (the game is clash of clans) So he offered to take care for the account while I was gone, so I said ok and gave him my login and every thing went fine, but when I came home I asked him if he could take care of it a while longer couse school was starting and I didn't really feel to play this game. so now about 1 year later I changed my password to something else, I then got a mail form him asking what the password was for the account wich I told him, but at the same time I got reminded about this game so I downloaded it on my Ipad and started to play for 1 week and I realized I wanted to play again so I tried to log in on my old account but he had put on 2fa on with his own mail! I spent well over 200USD on this account, but the thing is he really played a lot with my account and he kinda made it his own while I was gone, I never met this person in real life and we live on two diffrent continents but would it be wrong from me to just take it back? should I just leave it for him? or should I contact supercell and tell them some one else got my 2fa?? and him possibly being locked out of my account forever??",03Aug2018,0
197,"Okay I know the post makes me sound super ungrateful but hear me out. 

I live with my dad, I’m about to move out into my own place. That means I gotta buy a lot of stuff (furniture, dishes, etc). I’ve bought most of what I need already, there’s some odds and ends that I have to get. But most of those are already planned out with coupons and rewards points. 

My mom has a lot of pots and pans that she doesn’t use (basically an entire set). She told me she’d give me some. I was like, awesome thanks. So a week later or so I asked her what exactly she was gonna give me, cause if I needed other stuff (a frying pan for example) I wanted to know. She kept changing her answer so I dropped it. Then yesterday I was like, seriously I need to know exactly what you’re giving me so I don’t buy it. She says okay, tells me she’s gonna give me 2 pots. Okay cool thanks. 

Then she tells me she’s gonna surprise me with a bunch of stuff, along with one big expensive gift. She won’t tell me what any of it is. She wants to keep it a surprise. 

Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate that she’s helping me. But it’s driving me crazy that she won’t tell me what. Like I said, I already have most of what I need. I’m afraid I’m gonna end up with duplicates of things. 2 can openers, 2 measuring cups, etc. I asked what the big thing was, like how do you know I don’t already have it. She says I’m too cheap to buy it so she’s not worried about that. 

But what if I don’t want it?? I don’t want a desk. I don’t need it. I’d rather have more floor space. The only thing I can think of is that it’s a desk. Then I’ll be an ungrateful bitch for not wanting a desk that my mom gave me. But I’ve already got my apartment layout in my head and a desk would ruin it. And I don’t want her to waste money on stuff that I already have or just straight up don’t want. 

What do I do??

198,"Hey, so I've been working for two years since I graduated from I guess Sweden's equivalent of high school. Ever since I've started to think about what I wanted to do when growing up which I guess started when I was 14 years old I've had a hard time.  The \*only\* thing I've managed to come up with is working with film. I love movies and I love the idea of being involved in making one. My favourite parts of moviemaking is the photograhy, color grading and editing. But I've always felt that doing it is treading dangerous ground, because it's a hard business to get into, get a job in and do well in. So I've been waiting, hoping that something else peaks my interest. Now I'm 21 and I'm still as unsure as I was 7 years ago. However, after working 2 years I'm really sick of it and want to start studying, and working shitty jobs has made me realized how important it is to enjoy your job because I felt miserable when I was working full time with a job I hated. So I said fuck it and applied to a university with an education called Film and Tv Production. It's three years long and in the last weeks you get to try out an internship which I've heard some people later has landed a job at. 

I feel unsure because I'm not 100% confident that I want to do this, however I can't imagine myself being 100% confident in anything else so I figure this is as close as I'll come. I feel unsure because I'll be taking loans and if I do regret this it'll be costly for me in the long run. I feel unsure because I'm moving away from home, and I worry there'll be no one to support me if I need it. I feel unsure because I'm not really confident in my abilities. I guess I'm going into it with the wrong mindset though, I'm going there to study \*in order\* to develop my abilities.

Also, every worry I have can also be seen as a challenge for myself to overcome. I just have confidence problems and I'm better at seeing the worst part of everything.

I guess what I want to know, or get advice on is: Were you ever unsure of what you were about to study, and did that ever change when you started studying?",03Aug2018,1

I do pay towards rent and I do my fair share of cleaning and maintaining the place. I moved out with friends however that lasted less than a year and I moved home. I have since cut the vast majority of my friends out of my life as I felt they just weren't pulling there weight. ( My mother took ill and in 5 months there hasn't been a phone call or text. I was the go-to guy for their problems) I just can't afford to private rent by myself.

I have basic qualifications and some second level qualifications but no degree. I had a passion for music and music production but after I semi passed the course there hasn't been much joy or passion in it.

I think my biggest problem is cannabis. I do pay for it properly and have no debt. Though I smoke about 14 grams a month, about £130. Or am I just making excuses for my own down falls.

I took two weeks off work to try and sort my life out. In the first week, I went out of town with a friend, He used the trip to try and cheat on his partner with someone we used to work with and he still chats to. I was his excuse to go. I had a lead on a well paying job, tho it just doesn't seem to be materializing. Which is just the nature of the job. I went on a date, she didn't feel it. I started this week with such positive hope and now I am just crushed. It seems to be the same spiral for me. I'm not looking forward to the second week off. 

I am a nice guy, I get along with most people. I am a hard worker, My last two store mangers handed me over to the next manger as the best.

Recent example: I just came back yesterday from my vacation in Italy and there was this guy in the same hotel as me. He looked pretty arrogant but when we suddenly met each other by accident in the city he had that beautiful, gentle smile on him while looking at me and ever since then I was head over heels and overthinking every little think he did. I ended up putting my number on a piece of paper hoping he would find it bacause I left the same day. He did(I hope it was him, description fit him) and he basically rejected me saying I was not his type and that we don't even live in the same country so it would be hard to meet and all, he had a hard time remembering me as well, so he wasn't even paying that much attention to me and I was, again, overthinking it all. Now, others would react sad, but forget about it in a few hours because, hey, maybe they misinterpreted it? Then there's me, two days later, still having to hold back tears all day because my stupid brain wants me to believe it 'is meant to be' and that I will never meet someone so attractive and special ever again and of course it fell completely head over heels in love with him. I know I'm overreacting, I know it sounds insane. I feel like my constant search for someone is making me think everyone who even looks at me is someone I should(and usually will) fall in love with, not great since I am super shy and usually stress out so much I don't eat or drink properly for days.

207,"Wasn’t sure how to flare, sorry.

When I was 15 in was in an abusive relationship with an 18 year old that would try and force me into sex before I was ready. Everything came to a head when he pinned me down and sexually assaulted me (he was probably going to rape me but thankfully I started screaming and the neighbours heard so they basically started pounding on the front door and scared the fuck out of him). Because of this, I am very nervous about sex and sometimes I panic and shut down.

When I was 18 (I’m 21 now) I was having sex with a guy I’d met at a party, he was a friend of a friend. Everything was going okay, but suddenly something in my head just went all weird and all I was thinking about was my ex and what he did to me. I was internally panicking and I completely shut down. Stopped moving, closed my eyes, didn’t say anything, didn’t even touch the guy I was sleeping with. I just lay there. And he kept going until he finished. His eyes were open and he was staring me right in the face the entire time.

I didn’t think of it much until a few weeks ago. I figured it wasn’t a big deal and it wasn’t his fault because I never actually communicated with him or told him to stop etc. But told my friend about it and she freaked out saying he’d raped me. While I don’t think this is rape, is it sexual assault? I won’t be taking any kind of legal action or reporting it to the police so please don’t tell me to.

The stress of moving is already too much, and these little dogs have been spoiled so much and we just cannot keep that up.

No one in her family is stepping up to take care of these dogs, and we simply cannot take on the extra responsibility. I feel like my SOs brothers would be mad that we ditched them, but they also have said that they will not take them, so what the fack am I supposed to do? ",03Aug2018,1
209,"For some background:
I'm studying full time and working part time in the evenings, just moved out of home a month ago and am trying to juggle the responsibility of owning a dog.

Her name is Layla and she is adorable and hilarous and brings so much joy into my life. She is 18 months old but still a handful with quite significant separation anxiety issues.

It was my idea to get her, and after thinking about it for a few months beforehand, we all agreed that she would be all of our dog, with my parents taking more care of her while I am still trying to find my feet, before having her live with me.

My parents live in an apartment and both work full time. Because of Layla's anxiety, we can't leave her alone really for anymore than 5 hours at a time. So we have tried sharing responsibility of her certain days of the week with me having her 4 days on weekdays and them 3 days on Friday &amp; the weekend.

This arrangement started to work but my parents keep traveling away for periods of a week or more, either separately or together, which has left me to care for her 24/7. Which for the most part, would be okay if she could actually settle being at my new place, as so far she has not slept through the night and wakes up with barking repeatedly and is really starting to piss off my roommates. I have been recommended many different settling techniques, all of which have worked a little, but none quite enough.

We have a regular dog sitter we can take her too for short stays for a couple days or so, which has been good but is becoming a regular expense. We have also considered consulting a behaviourist for her anxiety, but again another expense. 

While I am able to pay for some of her care, I'm still not able to do it alone, and at the moment my parents are not willing to fork out more money as our last dog had no anxiety problems and ""didn't care how long we left him.""

My parents have been considering rehoming her now that I have moved out and it has become complicated, but I feel so responsible for her that it would break me to give her away, not to mention how much worse her anxiety would get if we just left her with someone else.

Layla is just such an important part of my world; she is family now and I want to do everything I can to try and keep her. So please, if you have experienced complications with pet responsibility and have found a way to live with them still in your life, or even can just see another solution, I'd love to know your suggestions?",03Aug2018,2

I am Kostas and I am kind of pissed off. I am an engineer but I am fully committed into turning my passion about clothes and men's style to something profitable and an actual business eventually. I created Misiu Academy ([www.misiuacademy.com](https://www.misiuacademy.com)) and I have been doing pretty ok for a new blog that is only 2 months old. In fact, one of my articles on Suitsupply's MTM tailoring program has made it to the first page of google. I Use most social networks including reddit and quora while not spamming and actually being a contributor.

I am not the kind that has 4000 friends on facebook. I have more like 350. But I do have some good friends there. They support what I do, they compliment my photos, my writing style and cheer me up but they never share my content. Nobody. They will rather share cat videos or something. Which is fine, i love cats and videos myself.

**The problem is** that ok, they are not my target audience since I hang out mostly with women and I write about men's fashion. What I don't get is why they don't give it a share or a recommendation to someone they know if they find it ""so good or informative"".

Am I asking for too much or am I being unreasonable? **Could you give me some advice** if you have been in such a situation? Should I ignore this and try on my own or ask them actively to share? I do not want to ""beg"" them.

So some backstory: I am 16 y/o male with a 16 y/o boyfriend (lets call him Person A) suffering from depression and living in another country, who has gone through years of abuse from before he even was born with his father being abusive towards his mother nearly killing Person A in the process.  


Person A's mum then decided to actually go forth and have Person A, what followed (from what I've been able to gather) is an abusive relationship between Person A and his mum, where words have been tossed about, blood spilt and threats made, where Person A has promised to move out by him turning 18.  


My real worry started recently with him telling me that she was abusing Person A again, I then when't on to try and explain how he shouldn't stand for this and to tell his friends about this. The response I got was that he'd already done that, with Person A's friends responding with something along the lines of ""We're sorry that's happening to you."".  


He told me that he's tired of fighting her, any attempts that I made to try and get him to contact the authorities where met by ""I can't be bothered."", and ""I'll be fine.""  


I have a hard time believeing that he would withstand another two years of abuse considering his mental state, I fear most of me one day not being able to try to convince him over text not to take his own life.

I'm in a long distance relationship with a girl so to speak. Knew her for a while but I decided to dm her and shoot my shot. All was well from when we began talking and trust me I was the happiest I have been in a very long time. So we have been talking for about 3 weeks and about a week ago she came to my crib and hey I'm not gonna lie, I couldn't keep it up for more than 10 minutes. Then its like every time I tried to get it up again, I just had those thought in my head telling me ""what if I don't get it up"". Every since then, this shit has not left my head man and it sucks.

While I do masturbate regularly, this has never been an issue for me. I lost my virginity when I was 14 and I'm now 21 and have had a lot of sexual experiences in between that time. I will note, however, I have abstained from sex for about 2-3 months and in between that time I have been masturbating. That being said, in the few weeks I've been talking to this girl I stopped masturbating because it's like why do it anymore. Also would like to know that I was a bit dehydrated and didn't eat until in between our sessions. Also there was some marijuana involved. I will say she was very understanding but I cant see her everyday which sucks.

This situation has just been very confusing for me. Like I had would watch porn just to see if I could still get it up and I was able to but I didn't find that same feeling from it that had even about a month ago. I remember a day where I masturbated and literally fucked a girl about a half hour later, and that was one of the last times I had sex. I thought about just going back to masturbating because when I did it regularly this was never an issue, I was more so being hit with delayed ejaculation, which in my case i don't see to be an issue at my current state (lmk if I'm wrong). I also for a while fell into the NoFap hype believing that I was following it subconsciously essentially, and in the middle of the 'flatline' as i did my research but i don't think that that is my issue either. And lastly, this summer I began working 2 jobs, one of which has extremely taxing, and prior to this summer, I could never recall myself working this much. My sex drive feels lower than it ever has ever in all honesty and I hate it. I have had weaker erections and less morning wood as well. It feels like I can't even get turned on to anything tho and I think its mental but hey this shit sucks and I don't want it to go on any longer. I never thought I'd go through something like this.

218,"So, I'm going to be a little light on details because otherwise it would be incredibly easy to find me, but I got the part as a minor role (speaking wise, stage time is pretty good) in a broadway musical. I was, and am super pumped as this is literally a life long dream come true. I get along pretty well with most of the cast, with one exception... and that would be the woman who heads the costume crew. To make a long story short I slept with a guy she was dating (I didn't know at the time) years ago. I didn't think it would be much of an issue, i mean we weren't going to be best pals or anything but it didn't seem to get in the way of either of us doing out job. That is, until the first preview we did of the show (for those who don't know, previews are public shows that precede the official opening, and are often attended by critics and bloggers and industry professionals. So... I had thought the preview went fine, until I had gotten off stage. The character that I portray wears tight, sheer pants, and the costume director had asked me to wear a white g string with the outfit, however in dressing myself in the morning I had chosen to wear a black thong with a thicker, lacy string. Sadly, it turned out that the thong was completely visible through the pants (I saw some cell phone pictures an audience member took and posted online, it wasn't a good look.)


The woman who does costume (let's call her Vanessa) was pretty pissed, and rightfully so. She put a lot of work into those outfits and me having my underwear showing distracted from all of that and made her work look like a joke. I was pretty embarrassed from the whole ordeal. When I show up to next rehearsal there is a small package waiting for me on my table. they are a 3 pack of new thongs for me. The only difference was these ones are an extra small when I usually wear a medium, and a very thin g string style. She told me that I had to wear thongs they would need to be the kind i couldn't show through fabric, so she got me something that was too small for that. It's now the only underwear that I have to wear during dress rehearsals and performance. I can feel it pretty much constantly, and it makes doing things like dancing difficult, to say the least. I've worn them the last four days and by the time I get home from work my crack is slightly red. Because the material is so small and so cheap, it becomes saturated with sweat easily, which makes it incredibly itchy. I tried to talk to her about it but she just said she was in charge of clothing and that it was in the shows best interest to have underwear that stays invisible (note, you have to wear underwear with stage outfits because gross) '


She hasn't acknowledged the fact that i have a wedgie outright, but there was a moment when she was putting the finishing touches on our outfits and she went to pull my pants up slightly (this is all very normal) however when she lifted the pants she inadvertently grabbed the waistband of my underwear. I honestly think it might have been on purpose, but there's no way to know (I mean, i've accidentally pulled my thong up when adjusting leggings just out and about a bunch of times, so it isn't like that never happens). When she lifted it up I made a grimace and attracting the attention of my cast members. I don't think they knew but I still had to stand there feeling an incredibly embarrassing area get rubbed and chafed. We were just about to go on and everyone was watching me so i couldn't adjust myself for the next half hour.


I did talk with her about the underwear, apologizing for the mishap at the preview. I explained that the thong she had me wear became saturated with sweat and was a little small. She offered to get me two to wear per day so I would have a fresh one, but maintained that she needed me to wear a thong that wouldn't show underneath the pants so it had to be a small g-string. The next rehearsal she offered to use some talcum powder to keep the moisture down.


I can't help but think that she's doing this in part to embarrasses me, and honestly it's working. At the same time, she isn't wrong that she is in charge of outfits and that I did kind of mess up with underwear before so it would make some kind of sense for her to get underwear for me. I don't know, what do you think?

219,"So, to start us off, my girlfriend (24f) and I (25m) have been having troubles with intimacy. It's gotten a lot better to where its happening ~3 times a month, but we still have a ways to go. At this age I wish it were 10 times a month, but I can only hope. After doing a lot of talking, we decided we should see someone about it. Yesterday we met with a couple's counselor for the first time. 

One thing we have talked about before and discussed in the session is about how bad my girlfriends anxiety can be and how she gets very anxious about sex in that she immediately starts freaking out about letting me down the moment I make a move on her. Her anxiety is also bad at work, she will beat herself up over the smallest of mistakes. 

The counselor said she could continue to see us, but she thought we had our relationship pretty well figured out aside from sex. She suggested we either, go to a sex therapist, or continue seeing her while my girlfriend sees an individual therapist. If we saw her we would just kinda come every week and discuss with no clear goal in mind. She had a pre marital counseling, but it covered basic things we have hammered down like communication, trust, family/friends, leisure time, etc. I see a few options, maybe those of you who have been to therapy/counseling can offer insight. 

A) continue seeing the therapist, while my girlfriend sees an individual counselor ($$$)

B) Put off any type of couples therapy and have my girlfriend just see someone alone (she's open to this). Then once that is complete we could either do some at home therapy, or see someone. 

C) just go see a sex therapist together, and forget about the other two. Or maybe see a sex therapist while she sees her own to address her anxiety 

**tl;dr:** my girlfriend and I struggle with intimacy, we want to make a change. what next step should we take? ",03Aug2018,1

222,"Ok so i am 18 years old living at home about to hit my senior year in high school. I was confirmed catholic when i was in 6/7th grade. I regret being confirmed and have not been to church (aside from funerals and my grandmothers mass) in well over 2 years. I am not so much atheist rather agnostic. My mother however is pretty solidly religious ( not creationist but definable pro life).

Now i am known for losing things (like a lot) and whenever my mother finds out she says “go say a prayer to Saint Anthony”  which is annoying and unhelpful. She does a similar thing when I ask her for advice. When my ex GF left me i told my mom that i was starting to feel really depressed and asked her if i could set up a doctors appointment to possibly get anti depressants. She told me the best thing to do would be to go pray. So i had to wait a couple of months for my annual well visit to talk to the doctor who ended up putting me on meds.

I have asked my mother multiple times to not tell me to “pray on it” or even to tell me to go pray, but she just goes on about how “cynical” I have become since I stopped coming to mass. My father understands my frustration but he cant seem to stop her. Is there anything that I can do?

224,"I had my first pre employment medical, it was for a sales position at a company, and basically I filled out the questionnaire for the medical their was two things that I checked yes to. 

The first was have you ever been to a physiologist so I clicked yes and put that when I was 9 my parents took me to see one for my OCD I wrote that it was something I had as a child and that it was no longer an issue, that this occurred back in 2004, and I can vaguely remember ever dealing with it and I haven't had any issues since.

The second one I clicked yes to was Severe Headaches cause a few months ago I went to the doctor cause I was getting severe headaches/migraines, then I started loosing weight and cutting out sugar and they went away so In the comments I wrote pretty much wrote the same thing that for a brief period I had them, don't anymore.

So the person conducting the medical was reading through my questionnaire and made a comment of ""I thought you were trying to get a job here""  and scoffed when she got to the headache section and for the Psychologist one under the comments she wrote that ""(Name) was looking forward to working"" and I was like why do you have to write that and shes like cause you have a history of mental illness, I have to put that in, which that seems like a super weird thing to say.

My question is did I just shoot myself in the foot? Should I have left them out? cause I didn't think it would be a big deal by stating either of those things, i felt like it wasn't something that you should lie on, but she made me feel like I was stupid for putting them down. and now I'm worried that I've completely ruined my chances of passing.

226,"I don't expect much from y'all, really. But I need to get out of a situation that will sound alien to many, I imagine. 

I've been working part time at a place with several departments. I got the job through recommendation from a friend of my parents (that they usually don't have much contact with). He works in another department than I did. I hated the job but needed money. 

So how the employment worked was that I generally came on a day's notice when needed. I saw an opportunity to get me-time away from my gf (yes, this sounds fucked up), by lying about going to work. I did it just a couple of times, but it evolved. I stopped replying to their messages about work, and shifted into lying about going to work like 3-4 days a week. It's been going on for like 3 months now. I know it's fucked up and I should never have done that, but there are reasons for it that I'd rather not post here.

I never met the friend at work, maybe saw him once passing in a corridor. Don't even know if he knows I worked there (he just forwarded my resume back then).

So I don't know whether or not he knows I'm not there, and if he knows anything at all. 

So a birthday is coming up in which my dad has invited this friend. Me and my gf are going, and so are obviously my parents. I don't know to handle this situation, at all. 

I'm soon to be full-time employed in a job that I'll like, and I'm going to turn around this horrible habit and be a good guy. 

You'll probably say (if you'll help me at all) I should ""come out"" to my gf and parents about the situation, but it opens a can of worms and I don't know if I'd be able to cope with life in general after that (due to other circumstances). I've been thinking of just faking sick or whatever, but my parents will likely ask him how I'm doing in the job and stuff, and I have no idea what he will reply. 

Tl;dr: faked going to work over period of time, how to prevent this from coming out. 

I'm eternally grateful for any advice. Thanks in advance.",03Aug2018,1

I feel ashamed to say this , but I have toenail fungus (BAD) on both big toes. This is haunting me for like 7 years after I got infected in a nasty Thailand swimming pool  . Has nothing to do with personal hygiene. I tried everything that is avalaible on the market. Also alternative stuff. Sprays, cremes, oils, medicine pills antibiotics, even had surgery to remove the toenails but it grew back immediately.

I recently found an salon that puts fake toenails on. I have them now, they look pretty decent but if you look close you can see they are not real. If i just put my socks off, he will probably notice they look fake since he has a great eye for detail and sees everything

For 2 years I hide my feet for my boyfriend. This means we never can go to swimming pool or beach. In summer it is really hot and I'm dying with my socks on. I want to tell my boyfriend but I don't know how. 

Can anyone give me advice? I told them I hide them because I have sweaty feet(thought that would be less worse than toenail fungus) 

My boyfriend is really grossed out by stuff like this. When theres a toenail fungus advertisement on tv he goes like eeew gross!

TLDR: my ex/best friend got upset I wasn’t gonna drop everything I was doing in the middle of the night, skip work without telling work what I was doing, drive 5 hours middle of night to see her and comfort her when she was stressed out over her grandfather and other unfortunate events happening now isn’t talking to me because I choose work over her 

My best friend and I aren’t speaking as of right now. She and I are exes we broke up roughly a month and a half ago. We still talk and we were planning seeing each other this weekend. As in I was already planning on making the 4.5 hour drive to see her and she was willing to see me. 

Well that was yesterday morning. Then she got news her grandfather is in the hospital and she became just super stressed all day yesterday and last night it got really bad. Her friends came over to cheer her up and one of them spilled wine on a white carpet. 

Also got a unsolicited dick pic from a random guy at the same time according to her! This has happened several times too both with me and away from me like random guys add her on Snapchat and send her dick pics. What is up with that!! She doesn’t have her Snapchat name posted anywhere according to her and she never lies about that stuff. 

Now last night we talked on the phone and she got mad at me for not being able to give her advice on how to stop unsolicited dick pics from getting to her and we’ve talked about it before and she got mad at me before for it because there’s like nothing I can do or she can do... 

Then she told me I should come down there keep in mind this is at midnight. I should come down there immediately and comfort her in this stressful time. She made a point of she would’ve already have left if the roles have been reversed. She doesn’t have a career either. I signed a contract to work 40 hours a week and I also don’t have contact information for my boss. Which I now have. 

I told her I have to work, I have no way of contacting my boss right now, it’s just not reasonable to drop everything at this point in my life and risk getting fired. 

Anyways she was basically like all you care about is materialistic things and you don’t see what really matters at the end of the day. I’m also just starting my career. 6th week of working with this place and we can’t take a day off unless we request a few weeks in advance. So I don’t want to get fired or a slap on the wrist right now as I need this job to live ya know. 

Well now she’s not talking to me because I choose to go to work and not get fired.

How should I handle something like this in the future?
What should I say to her in the coming days?

Upon looking into it further, I have never felt more outrage and disgust. There were stories of ongoing and horrific physical and sexual abuse that these parents were perpetrating against their children. And the comments are all cheering them on!

I realize that a lot of the members of the website are probably people getting sick kicks out of telling fabricated stories. But some of these people give their full name and shit. I know for a fact that at least some of them have to be true.

The website is affiliated with PopSugar I think. I want so badly to fight for this thread to be taken down, but I also don't want what may be the only proof of this abuse to evaporate.

Upon reflection, I realized that my answers were exaggerated as I was too focused on being honest, and I also had one genuine mistake. Not sure if it matters, but I live in the Netherlands and disclosed that it is legal there.

On the section regarding drugs I mistakenly put that the last time I smoked at 2018 instead of 2016 (this is the genuine mistake). Additionally, for the ""provide nature of use, frequency etc."" I wrote: ""I smoke cannabis very rarely as I do not enjoy it to a large extent"". Secondly, for the ""provide explanation of why you intend to use this drug"" I wrote: ""I do not explicitly intend to smoke cannabis again. However, I plan on living in the Netherlands for the foreseeable future so it is possible that I will inevitably smoke cannabis at some point again. I also do not ever plan to use it illegally should I move to a different location.""

I'm worried this implies intent to smoke in the future, when all I meant was that I do not smoke but that the possibility remains considering my surroundings etc. I got caught up in the disclosure, disclosure, disclosure talk. Now I'm panicking and am wondering if I should send an email clarifying or wait for an interview (which they might not even give me considering it's an automatic disqualification for drugs?).

long story short: my boyfriend and i are moving in with his best friend and the best friend’s girlfriend. we haven’t officially moved in with them yet, but we’ve been staying at the place and for one, neither of us like the girlfriend. she’s selfish and making everyone miserable because we don’t have money to go out. for two, the best friend recently got a ticket and has to pay it, but they’re both spending money they don’t have to go out (best friend wants girlfriend to be happy). for three, girlfriend wants to move back to her home state, but doesn’t want to leave best friend behind, so she’s looking for ways to get him to leave (he can’t cause of the lease and if he could, does not want to). 

anyway, my question is: how can my boyfriend and i separate ourselves from them without my boyfriend losing his best friend? for example, i’m thinking we get our own mini fridge because instead of buying groceries, they spend $50 on snacks. i don’t mind what they do with their own money, but i do mind that while they blew $50 on chips and ice cream, we’re expected to contribute $100 to best friend’s ticket (my boyfriend told him we would without asking me...i believe best friend should take care of it himself, or have his girlfriend help him, but whatever), as well as use our money for actual groceries, cleaning supplies, household miscellaneous, etc. 

it’s been less than a month and the situation is already driving me up the wall. especially because for awhile i thought i was being paranoid, but my boyfriend recently told me he noticed the girlfriend stares at him, a lot. it makes us both uncomfortable, but i’d never said anything cause i wasn’t completely sure. i do not like unresolved conflict, but my boyfriend doesn’t want me to say anything, despite his being fed up with the girl, too and wants me to keep quiet. i don’t think it’s fair that girlfriend is making everyone uncomfortable and no one’s allowed to say anything, but i also don’t want my boyfriend to lose his best friend.

We plan on getting married, my family knows all the details of our life. My parents and siblings love her to death, they support our life plans and have never given us any grief. 

Now her family, they are conservative Catholics, I'm agnostic/atheist/uninterested, so her parents are constantly trying to convert me. I'm generally pretty good humored about it but most recently I've just been rolling my eyes and saying sarcastic comments about at least it'll be warm in hell. Just out of frustration. I'm usually not a confrontational person, especially with her family who I dont want to offend. 

Her mother has been making comments about the military, which are ignorant and with the sole purpose of scaring my girlfriend. Or feeding misinformation, my only guess is to dissuade me from it. She doesnt know that I'll be leaving this year, only my family and my girlfriend know this. She does know it's in the works. 

My girlfriend still lives with them, I have my own place but shes not allowed to stay at my place overnight because it's a sin. We've been having sex since the first week we met, I took her to get birth control even though her parents are morally opposed to it. My girlfriend wants me to ask her parents for their blessing, I told her I wouldn't ask for permission to marry an adult woman but I'd ask for their blessing, it really doesnt matter to me because I know they wont want me to marry their daughter once her mother realizes I'm for sure joining the Air Force. 

The sister has been with the same guy [33] for 4 years, he's a loser. He works off and on, lives with his parents, he's enormously overweight. But he's a total pushover with everything, he converted to their religion, he calls their parents mom and dad. I call them Mr. and Mrs. Last name. He makes inappropriate jokes when my girlfriend and I are hanging out with her sister and him. He makes sexual comments about my girlfriend and I've made it awkward by calling it out on the spot. So he knows I dont like him. He complained to her mother and her mother has told my girlfriend that I make him uncomfortable. Now I look like a bully because I didn't allow this guy to get away with making my girlfriend uncomfortable. 

Her uncle who is a low functioning adult has recently moved into their house. He makes everyone uncomfortable, he's an alcoholic and generally disagreeable. He's been saying negative things about me to the mother (he has no Information about me whatsoever I barely know him). He gives me a glare whenever I see him, which is whatever, this 48 year old man glaring at me just seems strange. He told me that I'm going to hell, so that's nice. 

I've never dealt with so much drama, this is just the drama they have with me. But the entire house is filled with this and that. My girlfriend has anxiety and I'm convinced she will not need xanax once she's out of that house. I love her more than anything and I really want to make it as easy on her as possible.

I get along well with younger children too. Two of my best friends are a few years older than me, and they both have 11 year old sons who I can talk to nonstop for hours in a long car ride.

I know there is a lot of work and money that goes into raising a child, and it shouldn't be done to cover up loneliness or an insecurity.

I don't know what I should do. I crave deep connections and never find them. I just don't connect on that level with most people I get to know. I'll be 30 in a few years and it'll already be late to get married and such.",03Aug2018,1
247,"I’ve always been apathetic to social situations, but for my entire life I’ve always had people around me.

A couple of years ago that apathy started changing into total indifference and now to hatred of any social situation and people in public.  I literally haven’t talked to a single human in the last 6 months except for 2-3 words at stores, restaurants, etc.  I’ve deleted Facebook, WhatsApp, my email account, old reddit account, literally any way anyone had to contact me.

And I don’t want to go back.  I hate society, I just want to curl up in a corner of the world with some books, games, food, sauna, and never talk to another person again.

At the same time I’m logically not okay with this.  On the outside I’ve been fairly normal my entire life, with good jobs, relationships, etc.  And I’m sure I could be happy with that somehow, and it seems like I should keep trying to be... but I can’t find a reason

248,"I’m no Charles Dickens, but you’re about to read a novels worth of words. A little backstory:

My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months and we currently live together. 

The main issue is that he is asexual. However, he still enjoys pleasure but it’s somewhat muted because he experienced sexual abuse by someone he was supposed to trust when he was young. I genuinely believe that he considers himself asexual because of his traumatic history with sexual experiences. We’ve talked about it before and he agrees with that statement. 

Here are the things we’ve established so far:

1. He’s not really into sex because of his past
2. He doesn’t reciprocate sexual activities because he is too afraid of things like: Sexual pressure (a pressure to please me), performance anxieties, and lack of experience in that particular field.
3. And he does enjoy some sexual things like kissing, being touched, and receiving oral sex. 

I, myself, have been subject to some less than pleasant sexual experiences, being molested and even raped, so I also have things that make me uncomfortable during sex, like communicating or talking, if you will, and penetration (but we’re both on the same page as far as penetrative sex goes). 

Heres the thing, though. For the last few months, he’s been saying things like “I’ll try” or “I’ll give it a shot” when it comes to pleasuring me, but it never happens. I completely understand that patience is the key, and that these are sensitive matters, but I wish he would say things like “I’m not comfortable with that yet” or “We’ll try again soon” instead of giving me false hope. The result is increasing sexual frustration because I keep expecting it but it never actually happens. On a few occasions, he’s told me that he’s so afraid of doing anything during sex that I should just put his hand down there and he’ll go from there. But that doesn’t work for me because given his past, it makes me feel like I’m forcing him to do it and I would never ever want to make him do something for my sake that makes him uncomfortable. 

The few times that I actually took that advice, and put his hand on me, felt fantastic, but as time went on, I could tell that he didn’t really know what to do aside from moving his hand around a bit, and then we would stop because I didn’t have the courage to tell him what to do or how to do it. 

And so, folks, here’s what I’m getting at: I want to make him more comfortable pleasuring me while also not crossing any lines, but I don’t know how to do that or if it’s even possible. Does anyone have any advice on what could help ease the tension during the very few intimate moments that we have? We both know that he definitely needs therapy in order to deal with those issues but as neither of us can really afford therapy, I’ve been his surrogate therapist and he’s mentioned that I’ve helped him a whole lot more than all the therapists he’s been to combined, so that makes me feel really good about my ability to help him. And boy, do I want to help.  

As a side note, he’s also not too affectionate, again, because of his past, but that’s gotten a lot better. He kisses me more frequently now and even puts his hand on my thigh when we’re next to each other. I know that he thinks about sex a lot (he’s mentioned this) but I can’t tell if it’s because he wants to please me but doesn’t know how, or because he’s dreading having to do it. Though I’m willing to bet it’s the latter, because he does enjoy sex somewhat. Anyway, if any of you want a little more context before issuing advice, I’d be happy to answer questions you may have. Thanks in advanced!! ",03Aug2018,2

261,"Throwaway because people know my main, and it might get a bit awkward for them.

**TL;DR: I claim that I'm not bad at socializing and that I don't have trouble getting in touch with people, as it is not the issue for me. The issue is actually that I can't help but to feel apathy for people who are too fond of their comfort zone.**

Anyhow, I'm a male grad student and I love what I do. I feel very empowered by my fields of interest (maths/physics), and can get emotional about it as well as my hobbies. I can get really into it, and when I've been asked to present at a science workshop or at a seminar, I've had people come afterwards wanting to chat (some even wanted to stay in touch afterwards) because they thought I made a good impression. So, I guess I'm not boring and a failure at communicating.

Unfortunately, here comes the issue; I feel almost nothing with most people. Sure, I can develop feelings for them, but most often I don't really feel like I want to hang out or even talk to them. Sure, doing things together is fun, but I'm not craving social contact, and the more I get to know people, the less I seem to like them *except* for some cases. Show great enthusiasm or curiosity about something? BAM! I like more, and I feel some lingering emotions coming up. Somehow, it is as if their attitude toward the world is the only thing important.

Same goes for dating/relationships. It is *completely* dominated by their attitude and personality. Sure, you can be hot as fuck, funny, have the same hobbies, but if you're passive, lack passion for what you do, my feelings drop dead. No romantic feelings, no sexual desire - nothing. Of course, if you're acting like a shithead toward others' who don't share your beliefs, that's also going to sink my feeling faster than a torpedo.

I'm a bit blunt and my comfort zone is very vague. I've tried on social events I wasn't into at all just to see if I were to like it and find new people, but nope. Now I've barely got a friend and naturally no partner, but I'm happy with it, because I would not feel satisfied with these people, and I wouldn't be able to provide them the appreciation/love they deserve. Yet, I can't help but feel that I am letting people down by trying to cut/minimize contact with people.

Anything you think I should try (I'm open to anything, or else I've failed myself)? It can be an approach to making people feel more comfortable with themselves, or maybe a way of meeting new people.

262,"Hi there.  So I'll get right down to it, for the past two years I have worked in a costume shop, and it's been a love of my life of sorts.  I've grown to view the shop as a sort of second home, and on my time off from the store (because typically after Christmas, we are off season until Labor Day) I read tarot for a living, which has been remarkably slow.  

Last Halloween-Christmas season I had an incredibly fun and productive run with the shop, and made some friendships that have never run dry.  All but one.  

Since the shop is small and we truly only have about 4-5 people working when Halloween season comes around, we all became rather close rather quickly and would all hang out outside of work.  The ""manager"" (the store doesn't exactly give out official titles but he did take on all the responsibilities) eventually developed strong feelings for me, of which I did not return and was honest about.  Although it was difficult, I let him cut ties with me for the time being, as every time we tried to rekindle our friendship he would end up lashing out at me and yelling and making me feel like it was my fault I didn't return his feelings.

He was the one who gave me my hours.  He is not technically the boss nor is he the owner, but whenever I did want hours, said owner would tell me to talk to him, and he would make the schedule for me.

This is the last year that the shop, which like I said, had been a home to me for so long, will be in business.  It will truly break my heart if I'm not able to go back, especially considering all my other friends from prior years are already confirmed to be returning.

I've considered talking to the boss and telling him why I'm really not getting hours if this happens, but I don't want to resort to pettiness.  Before you say, ""oh just get another job,"" I understand that I could, but there was talk of me doing the makeup jobs we get this year and some readings outside the store and even aside from that, I do not want my last year at a place I loved so dearly snatched away from me because someone cannot handle the fact that I exist and do not want to me romantically involved with them.

But I'm worried that that's what it may come to.

So a TLDR for some of you... I may not be able to go back to the place that kept me alive, the place I so dearly love, all because the ""manager"" can't accept the fact that I don't have feelings for him and may not let me come back to work.

Please be compassionate if you can...I'm trying.  I'm trying so hard.  ",03Aug2018,2

264,"For context I’m 19F, my sister is 15 and my brother is 12. I also tried posting this in other subreddits, but didn’t get much feedback.

One thing to know is my sister is really mean. So for the last four years and counting my sister would constantly pick on me, usually it’s mental but it gets physical in those moments when I build up some courage to stand up for myself (she’s a lot taller and stronger than me so I don’t stand a chance). Usually it’s name calling, teasing, and being rude when I’m in her way. It’s gotten to the point where I avoid her and wait for her to leave the room before I freely do tasks like make lunch and do chores. It’s affected me negatively but this post is about my brother, not me.

She also picks on him. It’s the same stuff she does to me but she’s also a little more physical with him. Flicking him, punching him, shoving him out of the way, etc. I’ve noticed that it’s starting to really get to him. Just earlier today, she yelled at him for having clothes on the floor (yes, it’s annoying but could have been handled better). Then she called him “fat, ugly and smells like shit”. A few minutes after she left we were talking about something else and he repeated these things to himself. I told him that he isn’t those things but I don’t think he believes me. I felt awful because I was trying to reduce the amount of times she’s like this to him, things like taking the blame for stupid stuff and calling her out when she does it so the focus isn’t on him. A few minutes later she came back in and took the blanket he was using because she needs it to watch Love Island with her boyfriend.

She’s like this with him in school and at home. She does it out of earshot of parents and teachers. Parents don’t fully believe me when I try telling them what she does. They just say they will talk to her. No change. Around relatives she acts innocent but is silently shoving him, telling him to move rudely and doing things that bug him. I was in school with him last year, but I won’t be there for him since I’m going to community college in September.

I have a really good relationship with my brother and he tells me I’m “the closest to a brother he has” (he has three sisters including me, but I’m the only one that plays video games with him and can give him hand me downs since I’m not as girly). He also tells me everything and the last thing I want is to see him having no confidence and low self esteem like me.

What can I do for my brother? He’s going to be stuck in school with her for at least another year and I won’t be there this time to help him. I’m nearly 20 now and can just learn to ignore it while focusing on my studies. But he is only 12 and shouldn’t have to deal with this.",03Aug2018,0

268,"So I'll just give a quick rundown of how this happened. In highschool I had this best friend. I would spend weeks at a time at his house smoking weed and playing games. We were literally inseparable. For most of our friendship he had this long-term girlfriend. She was foreign, so for the first several months of their relationship she didn't seem to understand ""boundaries"" with his friends. Eventually she learned though and it was all good. Then one Christmas weekend they got in a fight and she came to my house to cool down. This was a pretty normal occurrence, mi casa su casa y'know? But we ended up spooning on a futon and then having sex... Over the next year my friendship with my friend slowly died as we communicated less, spent less time together and got less involved in each other's lives. All the while I was still sexually involved with his girlfriend. I think he suspected something but never got concrete evidence... His girlfriend and I would do on and off stuff over the course of a year until finally I got a serious girlfriend. I told her about the situation and she was high key horrified, as my girlfriend was a part of our friend group, and wasn't comfortable hanging out with them anymore. And so without a clean break or confrontation we just slowly stopped talking completely. I thought of my friend and his family as my family. They were always there for me. Now it's been almost two years since we talked but I swear I think about my friend every single day. I regret what I did so much and I just want him back in my life. I don't know what to do.

275,"Hey everyone,

I will just dive right into this. My SO has a large-breed dog (we will call him AH) and has a buddy (we will call him GB) he has been raised with for years, so they don't have a problem together. The issue is AH will try and attack ANY animal that comes around him. He is great with people and kids but no dogs in the neighborhood can be walked without him trying to get at them. The other day, he dug a hole large enough to get his face under and bite a passing dog. The first serious incident involved the neighbors dog, whos leg AH pulled THROUGH the spacing in the fenceboard. We took the dog to the emergency vet and paid a large amount for surgery, in hopes of saving her leg, but it was in vain and ended up needing amputation. We sent AH to badboye school and he has been wearing a shock collar but it is little help. It is a huge bummer because GB is a huge wuss and since the collar isn't enough for AH, GB will have to suffer as well if we do install this fence. AH has also attacked and killed 2 feral cats. In all honesty (I love animals more than people), I don't feel the dog should live with us anymore. In my professional opinion, I don't feel his breed should be allowed where we live because of how hot it is (he is half wolf, half husky) and I feel it is cruel. I would personally never own one because they are incredibly high-maintenance, aside from all else, but I don't want my SO feeling like I am trying to make him choose me over the dog.

My primary bank is USAA but I'm considering switching because they do not have any locations near me.  My biggest issue is finding a bank that has some of the tools and functions that USAA has integrated into their mobile/online banking.

I can add a projected or upcoming transaction to any checking/saving/credit card account.  Most banks allow scheduled transfers and how it impacts the balance but with USAA, I have the ability to schedule an upcoming check that I sent to someone or a pending ACH withdrawal by a utility company even if the action is not being taken by the bank itself (direct payments, account to account transfers, etc.).  Then the transaction gets matched with the projected/scheduled transaction that I had created.  Each projected/scheduled transaction shows how it will impact the current balance.  I use this to enhance my budgeting with scheduled transactions for my rent, utilities, income, etc.  It helps me to see when I'm literally going to run out of money in a given account.  I know I can use budgeting software like Mint and I'm looking into them but I'd prefer it to be organic to my bank.

287,"I noticed a few weeks ago that my sink was leaking and called a company to come out and look at it. Company A came out said it was my garbage disposal and quoted me $415 for a Badger 5 with install. The technician was a nice older gentlemen and when I asked if there was a cheaper option, he suggested going to buy the unit myself and calling him back for labor but didn’t provide the labor only quote (didn’t ask). He then charged $102 for the service call. In total, he was there for 5 minutes. 

I then buy a Badger 1 for $89 (smaller and will fit better in my cabinet and the same unit I currently have. 

A coworker then convinces me that Company A is ridiculously overpriced and that she’s never paid that type of fee and that I should call Company B which is also a fairly large business nearby. Company B would not provide a price on the phone for labor. They also advertise as a “call before noon and we’ll come out the same day or your labor is free” place. I call at 9AM on a Tuesday but they can’t come out that day (strike 1?). 

Technician comes out today and quoted the labor at $417 ($2 more than the first company that would have included the unit). I say that’s unreasonable. Then he says something about a $35 off coupon and that he’ll knock some extra off. We settle at $300. The replacement then takes 35 minutes. So effectively, does this make his hourly rate $600?? A quick google search says that the labor portion of a garbage disposal replacement should be no more than $150 with some places charging less than $100!

I also called the customer service line afterward to check the standard hourly rate and was told “we don’t have pricing information here, the plumber has the pricing book. I can have someone else call you back, but I don’t think you’ll get any money back..” I didn’t ask for money back! I just want to know if what I was charged is what everyone gets charged!

And he’s okay with me texting his friends and even flirting with them as long as it’s all for fun.
So, I started texting one of his friends... and his “friend” seemed really nice and pretty laidback. So, in order to tease this “friend” a little bit, I sent him screenshots that my cousin had sent me a very long time ago of their chat. One was a screenshot of some meme that “friend” tagged my cousin in, and the other screenshot was of the “friend” discussing me in a chat with my cousin.

I was just tryna have fun... and I sent “friend” those screenshots with a text saying, “I have these as well 🌚”... and the friend joked with me saying “So, he sends you everything?🙄” And I said, “Nah, not everything... just the stuff that seems interesting  😂😂😂 and the “friend” sent a straight face emoji (😐) and then he was like “Ttyl” and I wished him to have a good time...

So, later that day, the “friend” texted my cousin about me sending the screenshots of their chat, and my cousin got pissed off at me. He had trusted me with the screenshots and had sent those to me just because I’d have a good laugh. He said that “friend” won’t trust him again because he’ll think that my cousin screenshots everything. And also, now that “friend” knows that, he’s gonna tell all his other friends as well. I’m really, really sorry... I did not know the repercussions of this little tease with the screenshots. And now, my cousin is really pissed at me. He thinks that now his friends with gradually pull away from him. It’s all my fault, an accidental fault.

295,"So for starters this is a throw away account and sorry for the long post this has been weighing on me for a long time.

This all starts with my Sisters BD(Baby Daddy) I'd like to add him and my Sister have been together since they were in elementary school and based on what everyone I've talked to said he's been a shitty person and has always deliberately mistreated my sister

But my earliest memory is of him tormenting my Chihuahua by chasing him aggressively around my house as my whole family laughed and I, 5 at the time, tried to stop him so I already had a bad image

So for some quick context I didn't have my own room so me and my Mother shared a bed for most of my younger life, now jump to 3 years later and my whole family is going on a camping trip, my mother included which was weird since she would never go camping with us but I was a kid so I was happy

Anyways night rolls around and its fairly early but my Mother tells me to go to bed and after some arguing I do, only to be woken up in the middle of the night to my Sisters BD and my Mother having sex right next to me, as an 8 year old at the time it took me a bit to process what was going on but after I did all I could do was lie there crying and shaking until the sun rose the whole time hoping my Mother would notice and stop(I now even to this day get violent shakes anytime I'm extremely uncomfortable with anything)

So this goes on for another 3 years of him and my mother casually fooling around behind my sisters back and my Mother was convinced I had no idea what anything sexual was so she would continually do these things even when I was around(even if i was sitting right there it consisted of them making out her telling him she was gonna suck his dick then angrily telling me to go away them dry humping each other) I've blocked out so much of my childhood because of this

I also began suffering from extreme anger outburst around this time and sadly that has stuck with my for most of my life

Well all of this pretty much came to a stop when I was about 11 only because the BD got my sister pregnant and then disappeared, only to follow with years of him refusing to be apart of the kids life refusing to pay child support as well as everyone so often calling my sisters to berate her with insults and telling her that him and his wife(at the time) were going to take custody of her  child

Well he finally leaves the picture completely and around a year after I graduate I start to feel like maybe I don't have to hate my Mother as much as I do and can at least try to pretend like we're a family, and it was going surprisingly nice and I started to think maybe I could get over it

At the end of last year my Sisters BD was left by his wife and two kids, so guess who started to think he could show his face around our house?

And my sister with absolutely no morals decided that they were gonna be bang buddies and so he started to come around for the to hook up, let it be know this is in a house with my Sister her Son our Mother and myself that was Very thin walls, so I'm absolutely livid and to put a cherry on top Me my sister and her son went on a trip for a day out of town and the moment we were out of town he texted my Mother saying,"" Im Lonely I Love You Please let Me comer over!!"" thankfully she replied that she doesnt want to talk to him unless it was about his son and I thought well maybe things wont turn back to how they were

But, low and behold they kept casually texting my Mother didnt even add him as a contact keeping him as just numbers

After me and her got into an argument and I said that she actually likes Sisters BD A LOT she deleted all of her messages wih him and it ""appears"" they are no longer texting

Now things have escalated though, my family knows my hate for this guy but my sister is basically letting him stay here for DAYS at a time and slowly im seeing him and my Mother getting closer and closer again

The only thing thats been running through my head is that Im already 23 so I need to move out and cut all ties with my family

I also considered telling my sister but my Sister is connected to my Mother at the hip so revealing this is basically gonna ruin my whole family...

I dont want to keep living in Anger and Hate, but I have no idea what to do...

Thank you for actually Reading all of this and sorry for dragging on

Any and All Help is appreciated

296,"Hi,

I’ve come to the realization that I’m not pretty. I’ve been single for 2 years and not asked out since then. Men never approach me. I’ve hit on guys about 3 times of my own accord, and gotten negative responses those times (I gave them my number and they never called/texted.) Also, one time I hooked up with someone and he told me not to tell anyone (that was about the last time I tried to do the casual thing, because it just sucks.) 

Yesterday I was working at a gig for tips with this other girl, and about 5 guys came up to hit on her over the course of the night. She was getting job offers, phone numbers, asked out, and one guy even bought her a painting and left a special note. However, I was completely invisible, and at one point two guys (who were friends) came up and BOTH went for her instead of splitting up and having one hit on me. I’m thin, groomed, and fashionable, but guys just don’t give a shit about me. I’m like a plant or a piece of furniture, they don’t even see me! It has to be because I’m ugly (or maybe because I’m black, which translates to ugly for a lot of people in this country.) The experiences I had last night have gotten me a bit depressed. It’s a real possibility that I’ll never get married or have a nice relationship again. I haven’t even had sex, because for the guy I pick I want to be his first choice, but realistically I doubt that’ll ever be the case. I don’t need sex that much but it’d be nice to be able to share stories with other girls, who are always sharing outrageous and tantalizing stories about the guys who go to the ends of the earth to impress them or get their attention. That’s not my life and probably never will be. So I guess I just have to grapple with the inability to compete in an objectifying society. Beauty is social currency and I’m a broke fucker!

301,"I’m at a point in my life where I wake up some days and I am extremely depressed for no reason. My anxiety as of late has been manageable, but I’ve been having aggressive mood swings that are making me feel as though I have no control over myself. I wake up some days feeling over-the-moon happy, excited, confident, hyper, and positive, and it will suddenly switch to a depressive and anxious rock bottom. I’ve felt hopeless and suicidal lately during these depressive episodes and I can’t bring myself to tell anybody about it. I’m the kind to use a self-deprecational kind of humor and throw the “kms” and “time to suicide” around a lot as a joke. Now it isn’t a joke and it feels strange to ask people for help with it. I’m afraid they’ll think I’m joking and won’t take me seriously or think I’m dramatic. I’ve been depressed before and wished I could just disappear, but I’ve never had compulsive thoughts of suicide like this before where I’ve actually thought out what I would do, what I would write to my family, how I would obtain the drugs, etc. I currently feel as though I have very little going on for me and I contribute much less to the lives of those around me than I should. I am trying to change my habits and I’m scheduled to visit a therapist but she is going to be absent for two weeks and I have no way to get myself to an appointment before she leaves.

I cannot bring myself to tell him about my suicidal thoughts because he is the one person it is hardest to think about leaving. My parents would most likely tell me I’m being dramatic, and I have no other people to seek advice from.

That's the jist of it.

I'm the same way with my friends, but the difference is we never get mad at each other, but I'm constantly thinking about everyone else and hoping they have fun. I sacrifice myself, take fun away from myself to ensure everyone else is having fun, and in exchange for that, I have fun knowing that everyone else is happy. This is draining, and as selfish of me as it is, nobody recognizes this and it seems like my friendship isn't appreciated. I mean, we all love each other but it's draining to put forth all the effort and try to be the best friend I can. I always will want to be the best friend I can, but I want to learn to put myself first now before others. I want to do what I want to do, and if people get angry, I want to say fuck it, this doesn't change your life in the slightest, you're mad for the sake of it, it's not my problem.

303,"I have a friend who means a lot to me, so much so that I worry about what she thinks of me. I have depression, and I have attempted before, and unfortunately, I told her about it. Though she said that she is glad I told her and there was no need to apologize, I still feel guilt.

Because during that time, I had also told her that I like her. Three days later was when I told her about my suicide attempt. At the time, I didn't think the two were correlated because I was depressed for the reason of my family situation rather than the rejection. 

During my semester after the rejection, I went to therapy. My therapist wasn't in that day so she had her trainee come in and do it. It was awkward at first but after half a hour, it became almost like with my therapist and I felt like it was helping.

Then she asked if I had told anyone about my attempt to which I said I did, and I told her about the events leading to my suicide attempt with my friend. 

And she blew up on me. She called me a manipulative asshole and my trickery into getting her to like me even after she rejected me was literally the most pathetic and disgusting thing she's ever heard in her life. She called me a lonely POS. No matter how I tried to convince that that was not the case, she would just ignore me. So I left and I haven't been back to therapy there since November.

Ever since, I overthink everything I did that summer with my friend and I was fearful that she just didn't want me in her life or even just want me in general. The events of those events leading up to my attempt replay a lot in my head. But I tried not to think about it and be her friend.

Up until this summer, it was going away and at the back of my mind. We hung a few times and there were great. We had fun and we enjoyed ourselves. But one thing she did brought it back (and I don't blame her): she didn't hug me like everyone else. She would give our mutual friends like normal hug but with me, I only got the side hug or an one-armed hug. I overanalyzed that it was because of my depressive outburst that day that she hugs me this way. 

Then I got paranoid with other things. Like how when I would ask her if she wanted to hang out and she couldn't make it, and this happened week after week, and I genuinely thought that she didn't want to hang out with me. I brought it up with her and I found that that wasn't the case.

I showed her I was paranoid a lot when I was really bad in depression in the beginning, it mellowed out during college, and lately, I showed her again.

305,"Hey everyone! 
So my site is called Everyday Growth, or everydaygrowth.co

I envision it to be an online cross of Chicken Soup for the Soul and just about any self help book but targeted toward a younger audience (under 30). 

The idea is that anyone can log in and tell a story or experience that changed their life and made them wiser, leaving out no intimate detail and bearing it all. Doing this accomplishes two things: firstly it shares your wisdom to someone who may going through a similar thing; I find that as a society we’re a bit too private (though our perfectly curated lives on social media would convince us otherwise), secondly it gives the writer an opportunity to reflect on their own life and make a conscious effort to grow using their own wisdom.

The name everyday growth comes from the idea that growing into your happiest most authentic self starts with small conscious changes every day and that you don’t have to be a hyper vigilant motivational speaker type of person in order to chase your passions and be free. 

My blog will primarily deal with nonconformity, overcoming challenges, mindfulness and balance, advice, social skills, simple “adulting”, spirituality, etc

I’d say my blog niche is personal development / self help. My current tagline is “enjoy the journey of life” but I came up with it on a whim because my graphic designer needed a tagline for the logo (I can still change it).

Any ideas are appreciated!

306,"Hi everyone, I'm going to apologize in advance if any of this is confusing. This just happened today, I'm still a bit emotional, and my list of grievances with my grandfather is long.

My (20) cat Jeff (7) lives in exile in the in-law apartment of our home with my father due to behavioral issues. I don't really know what's wrong with him, but he will randomly switch on people and attack them. I can read cats pretty well so I know when it's coming, especially because he becomes a bit pensive and his eyes widen before he strikes. He's nabbed me a few times but he tends to take off once you shake or smack him away. He's a very large cat, probably a little under twenty pounds. He's still my cat though and I love him.

My grandparents (in their late fifties and mid sixties) have a different opinion. Last fall when I came home from college for winter break I found out my grandmother was giving my cat sedatives daily in attempt to placate him. That has since stopped, but I was shocked and disgusted to find this out. I only found out on the car ride back home with my father, who also objected to the cat being drugged.

Today things escalated. I came out of my bedroom to the kitchen and my grandfather brought up the cat again. He told me that he had attacked my grandmother and that she had bled from the kitchen to the bathroom. My grandmother is on blood thinners so I saw a good amount of blood in the hallway. It was shocking to me. He then told me my cat's going to have to be put down. At the time I assumed he meant the cat was already on the way to the vet because there was a car missing and the house was quiet, so I blew up.

My immediate reaction was ""What the fuck?"" and then he told me not to get angry with him, to which I replied, ""why the fuck wouldn't I? That's my cat."" He then pulled some absolute bullshit and told me he remembered me saying I was sad when we adopted him and him telling me Jeff ""wasn't my cat"", which I don't remember in the SLIGHTEST. I may have said in the past I was upset when we adopted Jeff, but I was upset because my grandmother had essentially made me adopt a new cat not even a week after my cat of only three years had to be put down very suddenly for a heart condition. I didn't even know what to say back to him because it didn't make any sense.

I've also come of sounder mind and health lately as I got treated for an autoimmune disease I had undiagnosed for at least 5 years. I've recently come to remember/recognize a lot of different ways that my grandfather has abused me in the past, and our relationship deteriorated further after he had a stroke (affected his vision and his temperament). I've been increasingly less comfortable in his presence for a plethora of reasons. I don't know whether I should list all of the ways I've suspected he's been abusive and manipulative to me in this thread, maybe in another one. This whole thing with my cat just escalated the situation. I don't even want to be around this man. I don't want to make eye contact with him, I don't want him to speak with me.

While what happened to my grandmother is horrible and I hope that she's okay (I've yet to see her) I in no way condone putting down animals if they're healthy. I am concerned for her. I don't want this thread to come off like I'm a brat who cares more about her cat than a human being.

He's knocked on my door twice now to try to talk to me. I have it locked and try to just ignore him but he continues to bang on it until I do. The first time he said he would give my cat one more chance (so generous!) and the second time he came by to say the same thing and apologized, saying ""he's sorry it has to be this way"", when IMO it doesn't. I get that the cat is a pain in the ass sometimes, but there's no need to casually tell me he's going to have him put down, when a more sensible alternative would be to bring him to a shelter, if anything.

I'm really afraid that when I go back to college in late August that something could happen again and that they will put him down without me being able to say goodbye. I'm terrified for him. Any advice for what I can do or say would be useful. thank you.",03Aug2018,1
307,"Several weeks ago my family and I were staying at a hotel room (of a very large chain) and in one of the drawers there was what was unmistakably cocaine. Before I could stop her it went all over my daughter. I grabbed it and we brought it downstairs (we were leaving anyway so all of our stuff was packed up). The front desk guy promised he would call the police and get back to us. We drove home (unplanned, was hoping to stay for the day) and I got her tested for drugs (she is 7). It came back negative. The hotel at first didn’t get back to me till I reached out to corporate. A week or so. They said the amount was inconsequential and the police said to throw it away. I talked to the officer, he stated they never said anything about a child getting exposed otherwise he would have proceeded differently. 

The hotels insurance company stated they would refund me the cost of the hotel room and thats it. Im wondering if I pursue it or just let it go with the refund. Im more just angry that they never got back to me, and that if my ex finds out I gave her a drug test it could potentially cause problems in my custody (we are currently in court for it now).

308,"I'm curious to hear everyone's take on this. 

I was raised in Appalachia and went to a decent state school all the way through to a Ph.D. I'm not a statistician/data scientist type and I work primarily in finance. Now that I am out of school, I've come to learn that all of my career options are in big cities. I don't want to live in a big city, but I'm failing to understand how anyone supports themselves and pays back student loans without living in one. 

I don't want big city problems. I didn't grow up with these problems and my goals for the future do not involve worrying about school districts, commute times, etc. Those were just not problems I came up around. I lived in the legit forest and the center of town (\~30,000 people) was a 13 minute drive. 

The only way I can see myself being able to move out of the big city is to get a remote job. I had one before, but it isn't common to keep jobs for long these days, so I worry that I'd just be delaying the inevitable and eventually have to move back to the big city when the job falls through. I don't want to uproot my kid during the middle of his schooling. 

Anyone else feel this way? Is there any solution or should I learn to like cities (fat chance)? ",03Aug2018,2
309,"I lost my virginity when I was 13 to a MUCH older man. It was  NOT rape, but peer pressure from my bad influence of a friend. She had convinced me to because he was “cute” and I should get out of my shell.

I was very insecure and shy as a 13 year old, and looked older than my age, so it was very wrong of me (and her, since she convinced guys she was older than they thought). 
I was craving attention I guess, and craved love, even though I was young and naive.

After the incident, I told the guy my real age, and he wasn’t really mad with it. I dropped him, and soon enough I dropped her too, since I finally realized she was toxic a couple months after the incident. 
The reason why I came to my senses and dropped her was because she spread the rumor in school due to the fact that she was jealous of me, and she ruined my reputation. Everyone had called me a whore and slut in my middle school, and I actually lost a lot of credibility and friends at the time, making my anxiety and depression worse.

After that, I kind of just started having sex often throughout highschool and middle school, because sex kind of just became...emotionless to me I think. I like to think it was a coping method. I thought maybe by having sex I would realize how casual it is, and maybe I wouldn’t regret anything anymore. I thought I was young and having fun I guess. I regret that so much now though, because that (obviously) had the bad rep stick to me throughout, and a lot of guys rejected me in high school due to the sole fact of what they have heard.
It even lead to rumors of other guys saying things that weren’t true, but obviously people believed it because teenagers eat those things up.

Anyway, that was a long time ago, but I can’t help but look back and regret things. Some days I don’t mind that i’m not a virgin, because I know mostly everyone loses it one day, and I know i’m not alone on losing it in a dumb way at a young age. Then some days i’m emotionally traumatized by it, and i’ll just be crying on end and wishing I never did anything in the first place.

I want to tell my mom, because she tells me she made the same mistakes when she was younger, but I just don’t have the heart, because I feel like she’ll put the guilt on herself...
I also want to tell my closest friends. For the past couple of years, i’ve been telling them I was a virgin, because I didn’t want them to get the wrong vibe from me. They talk about how people shouldn’t lose it so young, etc etc. I feel like they’d see me different. They do know I get with a lot of guys though, but I told them I never went as far as to actually have sex with one, so that if they hear anything, it was fake.

Anyway, I want to ask for advice on how I can maybe handle this emotional stress with this topic. Should I tell someone? Should I keep it in for a couple of years? Is virginity as important as people say it is? I’m just completely lost right now, and reddit seems to be the best place I can ask and relate to people online instead of personally.

310,"My best friend has been acting weird towards me. We’ve been friends for five years. We met during our freshman year of high school. We always hung out and spent a lot of time with each other. We’ve had many personal conversations and shared a lot of things with each other. I love her dearly. We were very close all throughout high school. I went off to university after high school, but she decided to stay home to go to cosmetology school. We did keep in touch during my first year of university and hung out whenever I went home.

I’m now going into my second year of university. During the past few months, my best friend is starting to become more distant towards me. I’ve tried talking to her via text and phone calls, and she ignores them or gives short replies. She’s been making a lot of excuses on why she can’t hang out with me. I notice she doesn’t like my photos on social media anymore. I’ve tried talking to her to see if anything is wrong, and she says nothing is wrong.

I don’t know why she’s becoming distant towards me all of a sudden. We didn’t have a fall out or anything. She’s the closest friend I’ve ever had. I don’t want to lose her.

318,"Is it possible to turn hetero being homosexual?

I'm a 18 years old high school student who's been struggling with his sexuality for a long time. All my crushes so far have been on males and I'm not aroused by females in porn videos. There are some exceptions to this but they are rare and short-lived, finding women sexually appealing happens sometimes when I'm not sober and I think that during the times I should be feeling emotionally attracted to a woman all I feel is fascination and nothing romantic.

This situation is bothering me because it causes me to be unable to find friends and makes me feel like I'll never be able to become happy and accepted in some circle of friends. Due to a very difficult upbringing (absence of the father since I was born and living with an abusive mother who is addicted to alcohol) I'm not good at being social and since I've started high school I've been trying to find a friend failing three times and succeeding none. The thing is, every time I meet a person who I like and who likes me back as we approach friendship I start developing a crush on them which is somewhat toxic in the terms of being friends and my behaviour pushes said person away. Seeing people whom I wanted to be friends with running away after getting to know me better is utterly soul-crushing and pushing me into the depths of depression. Even if I succeed in making friends I feel like finding a boyfriend and coming out about my sexuality would just make them abandon me (I'm from Poland and majority of the people around me are not accepting towards homosexuality). Also in the environment I live female-male friendships don't really happen so that's not an option.

Not having friends and spending every day of summer in front of a computer screen deprived of social interaction is making me want to kill myself and I'm doing the best i can ignoring these thoughts but I feel like I'm approaching the verge of not being able to take it anymore.",03Aug2018,0

.        
When I was around 14, I met a girl in an AOL chat room who was a little bit younger than me. Her name was Jackie. I didn't have much luck with girls at that time, but she and I really hit it off. Unfortunately, she lived in the southern suburbs of the City that I live in the northeast part of, and to 14 year old me, she may as well have lived in Spain. It was way too far to get to by bus, and my mom would never have driven me an hour away to go meet some random girl I met online. She also had a boyfriend, but that didn't stop her from talking to me. Every day. For hours. We really liked eachother. I'm not sure how long that lasted, but eventually she told me her boyfriend had found out that she'd been spending so much time talking to me, and she had to stop. I almost never saw her signed in after that, and we didn't talk anymore, but I still always remembered her.           
.       

Fast Forward 5-6 years, I met another girl, also through AOL, who lived in the same area that Jackie did. I was now 18 or 19 and was willing to take the 4+ hour bus ride to meet her. I ended up losing my virginity to her, but neither of us caught a lot of feelings, and it turned out to be a short fling. But as fate would have it, she was friends with Jackie, and happened to mention my name to her at school(they were seniors, I had recently graduated), and Jackie got my new contact information from her, and decided to get in touch. So one day I opened my email, and saw Jackie's screen name, and couldn't have been more excited. We exchanged a couple emails, then phone numbers, then decided to meet up. She had a car, so I bussed it down to center city, and met her there, and we went and hung out in her neighborhood. I met her friends, met her mom, things moved fast, and before I knew what happened, I was head over heels in love with this girl. I dont know how to describe those feelings, I dont think a poet could describe them, but it was the most intense thing I've ever felt in my life. Like years of failure with girls, of rejection and dissapointment was all worth it to get to experience this. I was living on a cloud. All the times my friends had girlfriends, and I didn't, felt like distant memory, I had the greatest girlfriend that had ever existed. I was elated.            
.       

We dated for about a month or two, but there were some problems. Most of it boiled down to the fact that I had no idea how to be in a relationship, and she was far more mature than I was in that regard(she had only broken up with the boyfriend that she had when we were kids about 6 months earlier, and I had just lost my virginity like 3 months earlier). The breakup was ugly, she dumped me via text half an hour after leaving my house, and then slept with another guy the same night. I. Was. **CRUSHED**.      
.       
I cried for months over Jackie, all of the intensity of how good I felt being with her seemed to pale in comparison to how awful it felt to lose her. She was the greatest thing that ever happened to me, and now she didn't want to be with me. And it was the most horrible thing I could imagine. Eventually I learned to cope with it.         
.     

Around a year later, she called me, we hung out twice. The first time, we slept together, the second time she wouldn't, and I felt rejected all over again. This time, I went from there to another girls house. Let's call this new girl Anne.           
.      

Anne and I had already had a ""booty call"" type of relationship. And we continued to have one for a few more years. Though starting that night, the last time I ever saw Jackie, we hung out a lot more frequently. And after a couple of years, we decided to actually be exclusive, and we've now been together for 9 years.    
.      
Over time, my feelings for Jackie faded, or maybe I suppressed them, but I rarely thought about her. Only when certain songs would play(you shook me all night long-AC/DC, Mr Brightside- The Killers). And only sometimes. I now loved Anne. I'm committed to Anne.    
.       
On Wednesday, I opened Facebook, and clicked on my Facebook memories, and saw an old post from 2010 that was stupid, that was liked one person, I said to myself ""oh, Anne must have been the one to like that."" I clicked, and to my surprise, the one like was from Jackie. Jackie's picture, with a new last name. This piqued curiosity enough to click on her profile. I scrolled through her most recent posts, and sure enough she was now married, with 2 kids, and still seemed like the same girl I remembered. Her background pic says ""girls twerk, women headbang"". I remember why I loved this girl, and I was happy for her. I was going to friend her again(I had removed her at some point, surely out of sheer resentment) but noticed she hadn't posted anything since 2014. I thought maybe she had a new profile, or maybe just left facebook but was on Twitter or Instagram or something. So I googled her name. And what I found was an obituary.          
.      

She died of some kind of heart disease in 2014, she was 26. She didn't do drugs, she smoked cigarettes, but she didn't have any truly awful health habits.    
Since that last time I had seen her in 06 or so, she got married, had 2 daughters, and died suddenly of a health problem that as far as I can tell, she didn't know she had.      
.       
Since finding this out, all kinds of old feelings have come rushing back, I'm in tears as I type this. I find myself questioning my relationship with Anne, because I dont think that I love her the way I loved Jackie. I'm devastated to know she's gone. It's compounded by knowing that she died loving some other guy, and that I had unfriended her. Its even worse knowing that theres no funeral to go to, it happened 4 years ago. I can't find any info about a grave to visit. The obituary said the burial would be private, and I suspect that her ashes are in someone's house, or were scattered somewhere. I have no one I can talk to about it. I can't talk to Anne, I told her I was upset, but I dont think she'd understand why I've been balling my eyes out over some girl I dated for 2 months more than 10 years ago. And I can't escape the feeling that my entire relationship with Anne has really been one long rebound from Jackie. Im not in contact with anyone who knew her. The few friends of hers i remember were not very fond of me, and i dont really want to message them out of the blue bringing up old painful memories of theirs. I dont know that it would do any good anyway.          
.      

I've lost friends before, I've lost family, I've been upset, especially when young people that I've cared about have died. But I can't ever remember being this upset, and this unable to cope, with anyone's death. I dont know what I can do to gain closure, I've been listening to that AC/DC song every time I'm alone and crying and thinking about her.           
.        

I was hoping that typing all of this out would make me feel better. So far it hasn't. They say time heals all wounds, I dont know how much time this one will take, I just hope it actually heals right this time. Because I dont know how to deal with this pain.      
 .     
Can anyone help me to figure out how to gain closure, or how to cope? Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Should I consider ending my relationship with Anne, or am I just being dramatic? Help! ",03Aug2018,1

earlier i heard him about to fight w anothee local fight so i broke it up and coerced him back to the house. acting like normal. then about half an hour later or less than that he disappears for a sec and returns and hes acting like ive never seen- hes attacking things that arent there and seems skittish and afraid. he starts itching himself a lot.

i say helloooo baby n beckon him to me n he bumps my hand affectionately n i give him a light pat, he doesnt like proper strokes or skritches.

then 5 mins later my relatives r worried his nose is bleeding so i go to look n i touch his body n idk if its normal but i havent noticed it before, its like hes vibrating? not purring. and all of a sudden he snaps his teeth at me and then warning swipes at me. never seen this before !!!

* Text conversation: Girl sends a pic of her TV screen around 5PM, she laid in bed, you can see a bit of the bed on the photo. My boyfriend reacts: also nicely cozy in bed -crying of laughter emoji-
* Text conversation: Girl talks about how she lives at her grandma for a while and that her grandma is out now. Boyfriend reaction: also nicely home alone -big smile emoji-
* My boyfriend claims he never went to her house, ever. I found a text message that follows: Girl tells that they put her dog down. Boyfriend reacts shocked. She says: you have seen her, how old she looked and such. This made me believe he went to her house and see the dog. She couldn't bring her dog to work and they don't have social media, also I did not found any pictures of the dog on his phone or conversations about the dog. I got super mad and asked if I could send the girl a message to ask how many times he visited her house, and he refused that. He said that would be a super weird question and he didn't want to involve her in the situation. He says he doesn't mind if I meet her though. He wants me to introduce to her in real life, but I am afraid I can't keep my cool and beat the girl down.
* She has called him a few times around 9/10 PM, but he never answered the calls.
* They text at least 4-5 days a week. I told him that it makes me uncomfortable and he says it's just a colleague and he is not willing to cut it down.
* Apparently a year ago they wanted to meet up to eat ice cream and play video games at her house, they made an appointment but he didn't show up. (I only know this because I've read the conversation a couple of weeks ago. He never told me this. He says he wanted to get rid of her whining about meeting up, and that's why he made the appointment )
* She came back from a 5 week holiday and he said he missed her.

**Now there are some few positive things to the situation.**

* She has send him a bunch of selfies. Some show her legs(she showed a cocktail) or her thigh.(she showed her PC) . He did not respond to these selfies, or just a very dry reaction.
* He doesn't use blush or kisses or hearteyes emoji's or something like that. He use that a lot with me and his (male)friends. He also don't call her babe, sexy, hot, or whatever.
* About a year ago he tried to bring her together with a friend of his, but his friend totally screwed up.
* She whines on WhatsApp that he never tells anything personal about himself.

**I know it's a long story. But I hope someone can give me advice about this. I feel really messed up at the moment.**

332,"So I'm on this second date with this girl I really like and I think who really likes me. The first kiss the whole date was absolutely magical. So we go back to my car at like 1030pm and makeout for like an hour and a half. She tells me to kiss her neck but not give her hickeys. She gives me a few tho. I try to be as gentle as possible so she doesn't get any I thought i was good. But I wake up the next day and she sends me snaps saying ""What the hell is this?"" and it's her neck with hickeys. Her parents are really strict. I feel like I fucked up and she won't be able to go out with me now.

338,"We used to be friends when we were younger, I’m 21 and he’s 22. 

We reconnected after I saw him in the gym about 5 months ago. We went clubbing together a lot and did double dates with girls we met on tinder. Became workout buddies again and whatnot. 

The day after I turned 21 he said we were going to go clubbing and flaked the last second saying his parents “took his keys since he was drinking” and he couldn’t go out. He didn’t seem apologetic or anything but I told him I was pissed because my other friend wanted to take me out and I said no because he made the plans first. 

Recently I’ve been preparing for a bodybuilding competition so I have a new partner who is a retired pro. I started to work out less with my buddy but still get workouts here and there. The other week he flaked on me for a workout when he said he would be there but ignored my texts after and just didn’t show up. The other day he said he wanted to go to the rap concert I was going to with some girls and my buddy Nate (even offered a ride) and then flaked last second to hang out with some girl he met at the club a few weeks ago.

There’s a big feast going on in my city and everyone is going. He said we were going to all go together but then I saw him with his friends on his snap story. I just sent him “thanks for the invite” and he just said he was going tomorrow (today) too so we’d go then. 

He texted me today asking if I was going and I asked when, to which he said he’s is getting there at 7 to meet his friends. He doesn’t want to go to the gym beforehand (said lol can’t but I’ll go tomorrow) and he’s acting incredibly flaky. Should I just show up and squad up with him and his friends anyway? 

It’s just hard for me to have friends right now because I just got back from attending college out of state and I don’t have many friends coming back three years later.",03Aug2018,2
339,"About four months ago, my wife had to be hospitalized because she was suicidal.  There was nothing specific that drove her to it, but she has had a bad year or so and things just got to be too much for her to handle.  She is doing somewhat better now and has been seeing professionals and has been on medication that has slowly helped her to be able to function much better in most areas.  She is on a good route now, thank goodness.

In recent weeks as I've slowly come off of the role of a mostly full time caregiver, I've been able to assess myself a bit better.  For a long while there, I had to force myself to put myself almost entirely aside.  We don't have any immediate family in the area and only a very few close friends we trusted with this situation, so I was mostly on my own.  


Now that I've had a few weeks to finally focus on myself again, I realize I am entirely spent and exhausted.  Not necessarily physically, but certainly emotionally.  I've spent so much time making sure that she feels cared for, loved, and valued, and never expected anything over her in return except for her to be better.  Doing this for so long has me wiped out.  I value the fact that she's functional and self-sustained now, but I am otherwise feeling really valueless and uncared for.  I've had friends check in every now and then and help out to a degree, but I am still missing the kind of intimate care that only a spousal type can provide.  


I've been seeing a therapist for about two months now who has helped equip me with ways to better handle the situation in terms of  my wife and handling myself, so I am able to categorize and understand these things a bit better.  I've also come to understand that it may be a very long time, if ever, that I can expect to see the loving wife that I'd known before her mental trauma.  


It's embarrassing to admit, but I am desperately missing the emotional and physical intimacy that I used to find from her.  Her medication has turned her into a bit of an emotional zombie, so it's extremely difficult and almost impossible to get her to really open up or be able to talk intimately.  It's also had an adverse relationship with her physicality, as it's caused some unfortunate side effects that has made that extremely difficult.  


Meanwhile, I am dying for attention, both emotional and physical.  I totally understand it is not her fault or within her control, but I feel so lonesome and isolated without anyone to talk with or be physical with.  I'm really starving for that attention, and realistically I cannot expect this from her in the near future.  


What can I do about this?  Unfortunately my therapist has not been very helpful in this area other than imploring me to be understanding.  Of course I am, but I can't ignore my own needs forever, it's starting to slowly destroy me from within. ",03Aug2018,1
340,"We’ve been together 7 years. I’m turning 25, her 26 , in a few months. We recently found out she’s pregnant (maybe 5-6 weeks) and she’s adamant on keeping it. That’s fine, I’m not going to pressure her into something she doesn’t want to do. I recently moved across the country fresh out of college for her family (and to get married as we got engaged last year). I finally got an office job making 30k a year, and she makes 40k. 
I’ve expressed to her how I think we’re too young and ill prepared for this, as we literally just got decent jobs (I worked as a server before this) and we haven’t even enjoyed married life w/o kids or even own a house. (We rent a one bedroom in a city.)

I genuinely just don’t want kids right now in life. And part of me resents her for going through with this, another part of me doesn’t know how I’ll feel when the kid is born, will I resent it too? How do I love something that I’m vehemently opposed to?

We talked about me possibly going back home and separating and she wouldn’t ask me for money, but would ask me to sign away my parental rights. but what kind of guy/father would I be to abandon my unborn child and love of the past 7 years?

I don’t want to stay if I’m going to be negative and unsupportive, I’m just not sure what to do.  ",03Aug2018,2
341,"So, I recently started a job at a grocery store. This is my first job, and being the extra person I am, I studied the handbook on dress code and policy front to back. I was sure to abide by rules and perform my best, as this is a great start at my age. They schedule me 34 hours a week on average and I’m paid $9 and hour. For a kid my age, that’s pretty good. 

Well, where I live it’s been in the mid-to-high 90’s most days. We are allowed to wear shorts from St. Patrick’s Day through Memorial Day, fitted they are longer than your fingertips when relaxed, and black. I have a pair of black shorts, in which I tried on to make sure they fit in an assortment of ways and applied to the dress code. Even when pulled up uncomfortably high, they were still past my fingertips. I was alright, and had my mom confirm they passed. 

On the first day I go to work with them on, it was a couple hours into my 8 hour shift when a female manager approached me. She says, “Your shorts.”

I said, in a respectful manner, “Oh, I’m sorry. I thought they were okay if they were fingertip length...?” She shrugged. 

“Oh, I’m not sure. Sorry, someone just told me to come say something. I’ll look into it, I’m sure they’re fine.”

That kind of ticked me off, because you’d think a manger would know their own dress code? This is from corporate, mind that, but you’d think they’d at least be *somewhat* versed. I was kind of ticked off by that— not going to lie. I couldn’t help but wonder if it was some old guy customer, or if the just claimed it was someone else because I seemingly knew what I was talking about. However, I still respected her and acted kindly, I just pretended as if nothing had happened. 

It was a couple days later when the same manager approached me. She told me I was right, and there was nothing to worry about and that I’m in the clear. I knew I was, and just smiled and nodded. I was happy, because it was absolutely dreadful wearing long, hot, thick black dress pants in 96 degree heat, while pushing and gathering carts outside. The shorts were a win for me. 

Well, about an hour afterwards, the hiring manager calls me into her office. I was still newer— I’d been there only a couple weeks before this fiasco— and so I still had some paperwork to sign and take care of, stuff like confirming I was satisfied with my training, and so on. 

During this, she says at some point,

“Hey, your shorts were alright, by the way. If Bill (fake name, obviously) says anything to you, tell him to shut up.” With a laugh following. I smiled and nodded, mildly confused. A little while later, a THIRD female manager said nearly the same thing about Bill. 

Bill? Who was that?

Come to find out, Bill was a manager. I’ve seen him a couple times, him and his bald shiny head. 

I was just weirded out... because he didn’t say anything to me...? He’s a manger, he has that power. Maybe he’d feel like he’d give the wrong message by approaching me, a girl? Either way, I was still weirded out and confused. He should say something rather than just sending another manager after me. 

So, whatever, I wear the shorts one more time between then and now, nothing said to me, even though he was there. Alright. 

Yesterday, however, he was there. I was wearing those shorts again as yesterday was exceptionally hot— humidity was very high, adding to the already present heat. It would be stupid to go out in anything that wasn’t shorts, as you’d most definitely suffer a heat stroke.

Well, I got to work ten minutes early, and you can’t clock in more than 6 before, so I buy a drink and take myself to the break room for a little bit so I can clock in after a bit. Well, between the two minutes it took to buy my drink and get to the break room, he’d noticed. Once again, he sends another manager, this time the hiring manager, after me. 

She comes in looking upset, and says, “Let me see your shorts.”

Before she even took a full glance, she says “You’re fine.”

And leaves. 

I wasn’t sure if it was him or not who’d sent her in, but I had a hunch. Right after I decide to try and clock in, and overhear her saying something like, “They’re fine. Her shorts are fine.” To the bald headed dimwit. 

It was so weird and unnerving to me. I felt uncomfortable and singled out. 

A little while later, I’m pretty sure I caught him staring at my legs, and he wouldn’t make eye contact with me the rest of the day. Maybe out of guilt? 

Any time after that, he would say “hi” or “bye” to me in particular. I don’t know what it up with him, but he really creeps me out. 

Is there anything I can do to help ease myself mentally? I’m looking for advice in general. I don’t know what to do and I’m uncomfortable and I feel targeted and ughhh. Besides this, I like my job. I don’t want to leave it unless I absolutely have to.

342,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half, we've known each other for close to 6 years. We had an extremely shaky friendship; he had a habit of going silent on me (the only person who bothered checking up on him)I figured he was a bit troubled (which was true) and decided to sort out our shit together. Needless to say, feelings happened.  

A year later, we had this huge fight and nothing has been the same. I long for days he'll go without texting because they are my most peaceful, yet once he does i find reasons to keep talking to him, despite getting more irritable the more he talks.

I love him to death. I make sure he's okay most times. I care for him deeply, he's my best friend and I'd give up my life for him if need be. But I hate him with that same intensity. I wish we never met but glad we did. I want him to fall out of love with me so we can end it, but can't imagine my life without the love we share and want it to burn infinitely . 

He knows how I feel. He knows my feelings are justified. I've asked him to let me go because I know I can't  (It's a weakness) but he says he won't because he doesn't want to.

345,"I have been taking a Business/licensing course for almost 2 years (last exam deadline is in a month) now 90% due to my parents wanting me to take it because this job (don’t want to get in depth) has really good pay and you also work when you want. I realize this and do think this is a great opportunity for me but I just can’t get myself to study to pass the exam. 

I failed the exam once pretty badly but they don’t know how bad I failed it by but do have 1 more try or I have to wait a couple months and restart the entire course and complete all the required assignments before again. 

A lot of people where we live are taking this course and getting licensed because it’s a highly popular job here with great pay as far as I heard and because of this they think the exam is easy since so many people have passed it which is another reason my parents want me to study and pass this exam. The other huge reason my parents want me to take this course is because they have always dreamt of me working in this profession (involves houses but don’t want to say much more due to privacy reasons) as it is a job that may have me good financial wise for years to come. 

However, I just can’t get myself to focus and study for this course (the course book is very big and I’m just unmotivated and lazy)  It’s been almost a year since I attempted my first exam try and since then I’ve been lying to my parents telling them I study everyday when I barely study at all and delaying booking my last exam try. 

I’m almost certain that if I do tell my parents (my dad especially) that I do not want to complete this course, they will be really mad and shattered because they have dreamt and put faith in me completing this course but I wasn’t able to do it which is really tough for me to swallow as I would never want to disappoint my parents this much.  I really do realize and regret the huge pool of lies I have been telling them but I’m too scared to tell them I simply can’t do it.

Although they have always supported everything I did/ still do and have always told me to “do what you want and the money will follow”, telling them I can’t do it will actually really disappoint them. This is the exact reason why I am unable to get myself to tell them this until I really started considering telling them a couple days ago because almost every interaction with them revolved around them asking me where I am going to take the exam. 

I do think if I try and attempt the exam but fail, they will be less disappointed because I gave it a try. If I tell them I do not want to give the exam another shot, they will be disappointed because I have lied and delayed it for months and months. The percentage to pass the exam is either 65% or 70% from either a 100 or 200 multiple choice question exam (don’t fully remember). They also do mail home the results so I don’t want them to see how bad my mark is if I end up taking it and fail.

My question to y’all is should I straight up tell them and be fully honest or just study as much of the book as I can and take the exam in a couple weeks but will 95% fail it because the book is too big to study in a couple weeks?

354,"Hi guys! I need advice on what job I should do for this coming semester during college. Recently I was hired at Ulta, a retail store, but I have been on the fence about working in retail again. For the past year I have been a babysitter and have worked with a family near my college. However, I can not stand the two children I was watching. They behave horribly even after having chats with their parents. Because of this, I chose to work at Ulta instead. However, I have not started that job yet and am considering another babysitting job as I would make a lot more money babysitting over working retail. I would also be working less hours which means more time for school. My question is, should I keep my job at Ulta and not quit before I've actually started, or should I get another babysitting job and have more money and less stress?

I ended-up dating one of the members of the group, he turned out to be emotionally abusive and dumped me when I confronted him about it, even if he doesn't go to all the Meetup get togethers he's very close with other members while I'm not (also they all saw us go from being sickeningly happy together to now wanting nothing at all to do with each other) so it makes things very awkward and I've no idea what he may have told them about me or our breakup.   


I'd decided to give-upon this group, the one member I sort of got on with I tried reaching out to but it didn't get very far (he had a crush on me, I think he was unhappy I dated this other guy), so I left the Facebook group chat that members of the meetup group ran for general chat and to arrange unofficial nights out as I was clearly not one of them.

Background: I'm a database developer for a small/medium sized company and the only employee here with substantial experience in programming. Naturally, I get clumped in with the IT department, but they're much more hardware oriented and none of them have done any programming in at least 15 years.

Situation: Earlier today, one of the company's directors approached me and told me that his 15-year-old son is a bit lost in discovering what he wants to do when he's older. The kid has a strong maths profile and is adept in everything logical (allegedly, I haven't met the kid yet). This particular director knows that I had a similar profile to his kid's when I was his age and has asked me to show him the ropes of programming for about half a day next week. 

The catch: I've been asking for a raise recently, and putting a presentation together that could really wow this kid into a new domain he was previously unfamiliar with could be my ticket to that (sending the boss's kid into a lucrative career and showing I can accomplish something out of the scope of my job should do it, right?).

I have decent grades and an okay SAT score.(4.0 gpa, and a 1220 on the SAT) I do not have any money for college so I’ll have to take out student loans and get scholarships. I know that I want a career where I can help people. But here is the problem, I’m not sure if I should get a job doing what I would love or get one that would make money but I wouldn’t love or hate it. Any advice/personal experience would be very helpful. Here are the two options:

On one hand I could try to become a doctor (diagnostic radiologist for those who are curious) which easily makes 300k. I don’t dislike the idea of going into the medical field, but I don’t think I would thoroughly enjoy it. It requires a lot of schooling and training (at least 12 years after high school) and not to mention that I would get a super late start on life compared to other people. I would also have a lot of debt from school, but I could easily pay off once I got a job as a radiologist. I’m not in love with this job but I don’t hate it either.

On the other hand I could become a police detective and only make around 60k a year. I find this to be a lot more captivating and interesting than the medical field. I’d only have to go to school for a bachelor’s degree, but I would have to become a police officer and get promoted to detective through experience.  I would still be in debt with this option as well, but at least I would enjoy doing this.

363,"So my boyfriend is a recovering addict, and he takes methadone every day. Unfortunately, he often takes extra and goes the last day of the week without it and suffers the consequences. This is a separate issue, but it's going to end up causing some problems. He's supposed to start his new job on Monday after being unemployed for several months. He needs to go in at 6:30, but the clinic doesn't open until 6. His job is half an hour away. Common sense would dictate that he should skip Saturday/Sunday and take his dose on Monday, but he is refusing to do that and I think he's going to be late to his first day, which is never looked kindly upon.

I am incredibly angry at him for most likely messing up what's been his only job opportunity in months. I don't make enough at my job to keep supporting us both. He refuses to take responsibility for his misuse of his medication and is willing to let his job go in favor of abusing methadone. 

I know most of the advice is going to be to just leave him, and I'm honestly thinking about it, even though he and I live together and I don't have anywhere else I can go and I'll likely lose everything I own. The advice I really need is just how to talk some sense into him, as I am very angry and am likely to blow up at him for being so selfish.

I'm a mess.

I'm the guy who shows up at work cleanly shaven wearing ironed shirts in a non client facing job where they only care if you don't smell.

I live in a cesspool of a place  place that's so dirty I have to watch my steps to not step on shit lying around and dirty clothes.

I'm literally (there's stats) doing twice as much work as my team's average. Looking at an internal promotion.

I spend my free-by-myself-time in a vegetal state watching series and waiting til it's an acceptable time to sleep.

My colleaguies and people who only see me in social non consequential events compliment me on how I'm always in a good mood and rarely complaining apart from some regular PC jokes about the job or politics.

I comtemplate suicide not out of sadness just cause I'm bored out of my f\*cking mind and how little I care about what's happening with my life

I watch my weight, exercise and am trying to get abs.

The only reason I want to keep smoking as nothing to so with my care health or life expectancy. I just don't like how it makes me smell if I don't wash my teeth and wash my hands witch I do.

I'm ambitious and don't want to be a fucking failure both personally and professionally.

Only my closest friends know I have cripping depression and take sleeping pills to get to sleep.

I feel like I'm putting all of my energy in the wrong places. Like I'm trying not to completely fuck my life up  in case I ever decide to unfuck it. Except I have no fucking energy to actually fix all the wrong things about me. I'm just keeping the boat afloat but not actually trying to steer it somewhere, and even if I did, I wouldn't know where to take it.

Anyt thoughts as to what to do in my position (my dirty place is a symptom, not a cause, even though I need to sort that shit out). How do I get myself to care again?

372,"Growing up, my parents always made me do everything myself. Enrolling in school, paper work, paying for doctors appointments, buying my own school clothes, etc. Anytime I need help, they’d tell me to look it up. That’s how I figured out how to chose a doctors office, set appointments, etc. But this is their go to anytime I need help. 

Right now I’m trying to get my license. I’m getting to an age where it’s unacceptable that I don’t have one. I got my adult permit as soon as I turned 18, took the driving test a couple months ago and failed. The tester told me she failed me before I even left the parking lot because “I don’t have my own car therefore I don’t have enough experience to have a license.” A friends mom taught me to drive and said I was a very good driver, and was shocked I failed (She let me use her car for the test). I asked my parents to take me driving so I can improve but they refuse to let me drive their car until I get my license. This is an issue. I have enough money to buy a car but I don’t want to until I have a license because I’d be endangering myself and everyone around me. I ask my parents for advice but I haven’t gotten any.

My parents believe if this is how they treat me I have earned everything I have in life. I understand their logic but it’s frustrating to me because I just feel so overwhelmed. I don’t know how to grow up and properly do things. I’m worried I won’t be able to make it once I move out. I’ve tried reading books on “Adulting” which have taught me some valuable things. Sometimes I’ll have immature thoughts and wish my parents were more like my friends parents in that they take an active part of their life. I know that’s childish but I feel neglected because even my friends parents have never forgotten their kids birthday.

I applied for a job working as a support worker for a charity that works with homeless youth, and they've asked me to come in for an assessment day...I'm panicking as I didn't think this would happen, I'm worried that I'll be up against people far better qualified, I'm concerned about what to wear, also the above mentioned disability is autism and ADHD which both work against me big time in interviews (body language, eye contact, role play, small talk, selling myself, etc).

Any advice? ",03Aug2018,1
376,"This might seem like an odd issue, but it bothers me a lot considering it is such a fundamental part of my lifestyle, and my huge investment. Here it goes...

""I'm always second best"". Without trying to sound too self absorbed or arrogant, I consider myself as a very talented person. Talented in anything I really set my mind to. When I pick up new hobbies, or subjects; free time or professional that I really enjoy, a huge motivation that stems from it is getting really good at it, while others might just enjoy it for what it is. I spend a lot of time trying to 'get really good at stuff'. I have spent a lot of time streamlining good work flows, healthy work ethics, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, anything the enables me to learn really quickly. Truth be told, I think I really enjoy becoming good at things.

I operate in a creative industry and still study part time in university. I work all the time on hobbies, personal projects, and career based work, and NEVER laze around. I like to think I have a good social life, great friends and family, and a loving girlfriend. But I occasionally get some real low times. Even though I consider myself incredibly lucky in general, I often feel very unfulfilled, and that my very purpose on this earth will never be met.

Being good at things means a lot to me, and I am recognised by colleagues, people I meet, friends and family as someone who is very good at what they do, and do receive praise. But as a result of my jack-of-all trades skill set, there is always someone around me who does what I do better. Sure I have a bunch of other skills, but I am not quite the 'best' at what I do in my circles or community. Always being out-shined by someone else.

As good as being a jack-of-all trades sounds, I have learned that it's not really a trait people admire as much as you'd think.

I have tried having a significant investment in one things before, but what I often find is that I 'picked the wrong thing' to be really good at, and I just feel like I am wasting my time, and that nobody is interested in it.

I can see why this happens, that is no mystery to me. But It makes me wonder why I am this way. My actions are all driven by an urge to be creative and forge great experiences for me and others, but my own projects are never enough to sate my desires. I never feel fulfilled unless I have that 1st place badge.
I can't tell you if I'd rather have 1 gold medal or a 100 silver medals. I don't know If I want them at all. All I know is that I am not at peace with myself about what I want to do.

I don't think its healthy that my motivation for my life's work is to be recognised or to feed off praise and attention.
Mostly because I don't think I'll ever get there, there will always be a goal to shoot for, a new milestone, and I can't spend my whole life chasing something that's always moving further and further away. Even if I was as successful as I think I want to be, that surely can't fix it, as I imagine I will always want more.

After that huge (and possibly unnecessary) background of my issue, I must ask: 'What can I do to find that sense of fulfilment?'

Do I need focus on a profession properly? Do I need to learn of other ways to make myself feel fulfilled? Do I need to find my inner harmony and just be happy with myself? I honestly can't figure it out on my own.

I'd love any advice, resources, or suggestions anyone would have for me. Thank you, it's really appreciated.",03Aug2018,1

383,"im going into my senior year of high school and my parents cant afford any of the top colleges i want, so my main choices are either cheaper state universities or one of the few federal maritime military academies which just so happens to be located like 30 min away from me. the ""college lifestyles"" are completely different, and the futures i get out of it are completely different.

federal maritime military academy - federally funded school. tuition, food, dorm, uniform, etc, is all free. its the only school in the US that travels the world on ship. 100 days on sea during sophmore yr, 200 days during junior yr. every privilege is earned. freshman must turn 90 degree angles on turns and corners, all males must get their heads shaved, cell phones (except emergencies), personal electronics, etc are confiscated (a laptop will be provided for schoolwork on a restricted domain). absolutely no drugs or alcohol. i dont drink, but i smoke a shit ton of bud, i enjoy psychedelics here and there, and i enjoy adderall here and there. caffeine privileges are earned. almost no social freedom. intense physical training and even more intense academics. the point of attending this school is to gain the knowledge and skills in order to gain a coast guard license. after graduation, graduates are required to serve 5 yrs on active duty on either army, marines, coast guard, air forces, or navy; or serve 8 yrs on the navy reserve. almost guaranteed 6 figure salary (about 1k per month), and the obvious retirement benefits from government for doing a public service job. 


state universities - just ur average public university funded by the state. its not free, but there more options for financial aid compared to a private school, obvious more social freedom: i could bring my own electronics and have my phone everywhere, i could develop my own schedule instead of having to be required in a set schedule with rigorous training, i very much enjoy recreational substances like bud, psychedelics occaisionally, and i see myself popping adderall to cram for tests if i attend a normal university. more girls, more friends, more social oppurtunities, overal more social freedom. i could wear whatever clothing instead of a federally required military uniform. however, i have no idea what i want to do after college, hell i dont even know what to major in. its obviously not the better option in terms of guaranteed salary and long term benefits, but i want to experience my 20s with social freedom.

tl;dr - torn between choosing a free, federally funded maritime military academy where im guaranteed a 6 figure job after i graduate and i get to travel the world, but the rigors of physical and academic training, and giving up the ""college experience"" and the social freedom of my 20s is hard for me. other option is a normal public university where it does cost money for everything (dorm, tuition, etc), with the complete social freedom and ""college experience"", but i dont know what to major in and obviously im not guaranteed a job right after.

393,"So I work in sales as an energy broker. My company helps business cut costs with electric and gas bills. It’s commission only and I’ve been doing well for the 3 years I’ve been here. Originally, the model was 2 closers and a room of originators (cold callers) who turned their warm sales apps in to be closed. I worked under this model for about a year and then started closing my own deals and handling all my contracts. My percentage went from 30% to the 60% I currently get. We implemented a team lead model for a while, where I started training and closing for newer reps and earning a percentage of those deals, but most of the reps fell off or went on to other things. Right now, I only manage one rep, and there’s two other team leads, R (whom I’ve gotten close with), and B (lazy, entitled younger guy who just happened to find this job before either of us). B has been getting some absurd special treatment as of late, with him being given half the company’s deals to manage as well as his own outside sales team that bring in a ton of business and all he has to do is write contracts. He’s knocking down about 2-3K a week and sometimes much more despite his constant absence and minimal effort. 

What’s happened in the last year or so is that my boss has completely shifted his attitude from being involved in the sales floor with weekly motivation meetings and strategies to almost entirely removing himself in lieu of bringing in this guy (call him S) to run the floor and handle most of management. S is an absolute moron with very little experience in our field and less than Zero people skills. He’s nothing but a big talker, typical sales bullshit that’s hollow and means nothing. He literally can’t interact with people without pissing them off or demanding things, yet my boss has full faith in his “ability” to run the company. I’ve come to the boss with multitudes of concrete examples of his ineptitude and horrible treatment of myself and others, but he keeps brushing it off with no reasons to explain how he adds any value. In fact, since S came into the picture, he’s run up a debt of over $60k by attempting to open a solar division and buying a CRM subscription, and various other expenses. Yet the boss still sees value in what he’s doing. 

So a little more context on B: He comes from a wealthy family and has never really been held accountable for his actions, so this translates directly into his work ethic. My boss continues to reward him although he’s shown countless times he cannot he relied upon. B has little sense of ethics, so he will look the other way when it comes to submitting questionable deals and he will kiss any ass that pays him. Which is why the boss and S are continuing to shovel every opportunity towards him while starving the other two team leads who have contributed way more new business to the company than he has (remember most of his business he manages was handed to him). 

So I’m not sure how to proceed under this emerging management structure. It seems my options are to kiss ass and hope I get rewarded for it or continue to stand for what I believe is right and be labeled as negative and not a team player. I can continue to cold call like I’ve always done and support myself decently, but the whole idea was for the three of us to move away from that into management and closer roles after having done it for so long, yet B is the only one getting rewarded. 

Anyone have experience similar to this or suggestions on how to handle myself?",03Aug2018,3

My partner has difficulty switching from work mode to home mode when he goes away, he is almost a different person, we have the opportunity to talk almost every day but whenever I speak to him he is irritable and sounds disinterested in what I have to say. I have brought this issue up during the beginning of the deployment and he has said he is aware that he is doing it but can’t help it. I’ve learnt to just deal with it since I know when he is home, everything is ok, plus he is in a much worse situation that I am over there. 
Basically I’m really looking for advice on what I can do to help myself mentally. A lot of the time, I feel like I’ve been slipping into a depressive, isolated state. There is a group of girls that I’ve been spending time with while my SO has been away and it was good hanging out with them at the start but lately I’ve felt like if I’m feeling down or if I’m struggling, they don’t want to be around me. I get where they are coming from because, let’s be real, who wants to hang around a depressed, sad person. I only feel like I’m bringing them down. This triggers a vicious cycle of isolating myself from them, then feeling more depressed and embarrassed that I’m struggling when I try to find excuses as to why I can’t hang out. 
It’s been getting worse these last few weeks, I’ve had to take time off work which is something I would never normally do. 
I have always had the mentality in where if you’re not happy about something it’s your responsibility to change it and you can’t rely on others to make you happy and to fill the voids in your life. The trouble I am having is that I can’t find the strength to get up and help myself lately. I just feel like I’m drowning and I’m so alone. I would appreciate any advice. Thanks.

395,"Posting this in multiple places to get advice from different perspectives. Throwaway account just in case.

I have been bartending at a high-end casual restaurant for the past 4 years. I'm in a pretty good spot there; I'm one of the head bartenders, have a mostly set schedule, and average about $32 per hour including my hourly wage + avg tips. I usually only work about 32 hours per week, so this comes out to about $1000/wk. 

I also recently completed an internship in Human Resources as the last requirement for my Bachelor's in Psychology. I plan on beginning a clinical psychology Master's program next year (almost exactly a year from now). Eventual goal is to work in the research sector of forensic psychology. 

I have been offered a full time job by my internship supervisor at $20/hr. In the area I live, this is an unheard of wage for the position I would be working. To begin my employment, my job title would be administrative assistant/hr admin, but she said she would eventually like to move me more towards the role of HR Generalist. This position includes some pretty competitive benefits, some of which I have never had before. I was told that I can choose the amount of hours I'd like to work per week, anywhere from 30-40 to be considered full time and possibly still work my other job. However, insurance doesn't kick in until 90 days from hire and I currently have insurance through my other position. If I were to keep bartending part-time, I would lose my insurance because you have to be considered a full-time employee (30+ hours per week) to have insurance through the company. 

For the most part, I enjoy bartending. I enjoy the job itself, getting to shoot the shit with people and get paid for it, and of course, the money. However, a few people in management/other coworkers are absolutely insufferable. A couple of my managers are literally anxiety inducing. Almost everyone I work with is younger than me, so it is sometimes difficult to answer to people above me that have no additional training and/or skillset beyond what I have. It is very challenging to deal with the lapse in maturity I have with most people there, as well as experience the terrible work ethic of the majority of younger individuals. It might not seem like a big deal to some, but an average 26 year old is much different than a 20-21 year old. Maybe I seem like the asshole here, I don't know. It's kind of hard to capture in words how I feel about the job as a whole. I would say, overall, I'm not happy, but it has very little to do with the requirements of my job and more so with the people I have to pretend to like.

I also know that I cannot and will not bartend forever. On top of it being a high-stress job, it is also unhealthy to stand for 7-8 hours straight, which I often do. 

What should I do? Should I quit now, or go down to a couple shifts a week to ease myself into the new transition? I have a large amount of bills; adjusting to being paid approximately $1500 biweekly would be definitely be difficult. However, I have done virtually nothing but work in a restaurant my entire 10-year working life. I need to do something different and get experience in a new field, but from a financial standpoint, am I making a mistake?",03Aug2018,2

397,"Whenever I’m at home, I’m lazy and I don’t feel like doing anything. I frequently play video games (No Mans Sky, Rainbow Six, PUBG) all day long and find it hard to stop sometimes. I have such a great time with my friends while playing. I never exercise, but I really should. I used to have routine that I upheld for 7 months straight and exercising made me feel amazing. I don’t mind not doing it because I have a great metabolism so I’m not fat at all, however I know I should get back to it.

 I go to sleep super late at night and wake up the next day feeling like utter shit after a night of staring at a screen (gaming). 

While I’m at work, I’m super attentive and I start having really great ideas. I really hate working so I always tell myself I’m gonna do these great things after work. Maybe I’ll visit a friend, finish my college application, read a book, or even go exercising. However, as I make my way back to my house, it seems less and less appealing to do all the other things I said I wanted to do. I almost always end up right back where I started. Playing video games. 

At work, I’ll come up with fascinating ideas for TV shows and movies and I always want to write a script for a story or research something I never found the full story on. I love listening to Vaporwave and always tell myself I’m gonna start making my own music sometimes. I never actually do it. 

It’s a cycle. I go to work and make up these fascinating plans and ideas while I’m doing something that I hate doing, but when I get home, I get on my console and play nonstop. My brain is null that entire time I’m playing. How can I stop this loop??? I’ve even missed work a couple times because I’d be too tired from gaming the night before. 

Sometimes I feel like I just want to die. Any advice please?? I’ve gone months without gaming or media before and haven’t experienced symptoms of withdraw, so I can’t be addicted. Please help me",03Aug2018,2

399,"I was recently broken up with by my partner of 4 years. We work together and sometimes its ok, but most of the time its hard as shit. I've never been depressed and am normally quite a happy person, but since the break up I've been so upset and hate myself. I just feel that my now ex finds me so annoying by the way he acts. I'm trying to be strong at work, but its so hard. Its a good job, good pay and lots of overtime but I don't think I can handle going home and being so alone. I currently live with my parents so i'm not in financial trouble if I quit, but currently I save as much money as I can so that I can get a house/mortgage in the future, so quitting would mean halting my savings and put me back a couple months.  I've never felt to sad in my life and I just can't handle it. I'm only 23 so this is my first proper break up, and as we work together I really don't know what to do.

400,"I am wondering if and how I should report a previous employer. I worked at a dog/cat kennel/ groomers/ dog daycare 3 years ago.  

An ex-employee reported them to OSHA. OSHA inspected the building, and only gave them a small fine.

I’m going to include a list of all the questionable or awful things I can recall from the time I was there. None of it is in order.

There were inside kennels the dogs stayed in all day. Each kennel was about the size of a twin mattress and had a cement floor, and cinder block wall with chipping paint. There were also outdoor potty kennels, each kennel was the same as the indoor ones. Imagine how well a large dog goes to the bathroom on cement in a mattress sized area. It was pretty common for dogs to go to the bathroom and then step or lay in it because they didn’t have enough room.

Wouldn’t use beds or blankets that people would pack sometimes for their pets when they boarded. Owner required you to take them out of their bag and make them looked used. It was also implied you were supposed to lie to the owner that their pet got to use their own bed.

Owner and someone I’ll call Brittany were the groomers and would feed toenail clippings to the owner's favorite daycare dog.  

Perpetually short staffed. Brittany's cousin Neckbeard and I worked a month straight at some points because of it. Some days I was working 3 positions, literally sprinting through the building because 2 employees wouldn’t show up on time.

An owner might feed their pet 3 times a day. The manager “Karen” and Brittany would smile to their face and then change it to 2 feedings when they left.

You know the little travel kennels you use for your dog in the car? The owner would board small dogs during busy holidays in those without telling the owner that’s what their dog was staying in. They would make you think you’re getting one of the large kennels. The dogs stayed in the little kennel ALL day, except for 2 times a day in potty kennel and if an owner paid for “playtime”.

The dogs only had 2 times to go potty per day. I always told customers this. I cannot believe the amount of people who thought this is ok for any dog. How many times a day do you go to the bathroom, and you’re a full grown adult?

Dogs had wait to go potty till 8 am Monday to Friday, and then 9 am Saturday, Sunday, and holidays.

Dogs had to wait in outdoor potty kennels in winter temperatures often an hour or more. It was often longer when we were booked full and it took longer to take care of all the animals. Owner had sense to ask that dogs only be outside a few minutes and then go back in. However, I think she only required that after I had been there quite a while. Neckbeard wouldn’t do this matter how many times he was told. Owner said to take the dogs back in after a few minutes multiple times. He would have left little dogs out in freezing weather often for hour possibly more unless I had taken them in myself. I told him he needed to, it’s part of his job. Told Brittany hoping she might convince them, she didn’t care. I ended up having to take care of it while he sat on his butt on his phone.

Dogs had the chance to go potty 8-probably 9 am and 4ish - 5pm most days. That’s it.  

All dogs got thin little blankets in their kennels over cement. Except for the dogs that chewed up blankets, they just got hard cement.

Later on when I worked there, owner bought 5 small plastic dog beds. So at least 5 small dogs got a thin blanket on hard plastic instead.

Employees didn’t bother with the cats, often would not take care of feeding, changing litter, and bedding till noon. That always meant they would not let a single cat out of its cage till noon despite being there since 6:30 am. They wouldn’t bother letting cats have turns out of their cages. One cat might have 5 hours to walk around cat room while rest stuck in cages all day. One incident resulted in cats required to stay in cages for several days straight.

I once watched the owner use bleach to clean a dog’s paws after it got scared and defecated itself. I went home and told my mom, I think she thought that it was bad but wasn’t concerned about it. I really wish I had reported the owner then, but I really don’t know what the law would have done about it.

Owner had “adopted” a cockatoo and confined him to a cage in the grooming room. It was a very loud (dogs barking, blow dryer, etc), stressful dusty environment everyday. He was essentially neglected. We gave him fresh water and food pellets every day, and cleaned the cage once a week. A Cockatoo’s diet is supposed to consist of fruit, and they live in flocks. He had none of that, no stimulation whatsoever. Later on when I worked there, the owner stopped getting the newspaper. Literally the only thing the bird liked and could do was rip up newspapers we put in his cage. Now he had maybe 1 piece to rip up. I had to start bringing what paper I had at home because no one else would. I also used to bring fruit for him because owner only every once in a while would feed him fruit.

Owners had option to purchase “playtime”, which Brittany and Karen probably lied to customers about what it really was. I think the owner probably wanted us to lie about playtime because before I started working there, someone would come in specifically for playtime, and after they quit, she never hired someone to do playtimes, and yet we were told to keep explaining that someone played with the pets. Owners would be charged for having their dog put outside for 15 minutes.

Neckbeard sometimes did playtimes, and I usually did if there were no more than 10 playtimes. We didn’t have enough staff to do more than that.  

There was a larger potty kennel about the size of a small bedroom in the potty kennel area. If they were booked enough they would consider it playtime to put your dog in there for 15 minutes. Sometimes it was during the twice daily potty break. They always would have to take the dogs out to the potty kennels at 8 am while the inside kennels were being cleaned, but they considered it ok to charge this time a dog spent in the small bedroom sized kennel as “playtime”. This was supposed to only be a time for the dogs to go potty. After the inside kennels were cleaned, the dogs went back to their kennels all day till the 2nd potty break at 4.

We weren’t to tell daycare dog customers if their dog stopped getting along with other dogs and now were being put in a pen by their self. Many times daycare consisted of a dog or two in a potty kennel stall and we would rotate the dogs out in the larger area of the potty kennel all day. By no means was that a big area. Customers likely didn’t know they were paying to have dog sit in a kennel most of the day.

The kennels got so humid after cleaning them in summer that they never dried out. Huge water droplets to an actual puddle would form on the floor of each kennel. The blanket in the kennel would soak up the water, and that’s all the dog had to sit on. Employees agreed that was pretty bad, and the kennels would have dried completely every day simply if the air conditioner was turned on for awhile or if the windows were opened. We weren’t allowed to turn on the freaking air conditioner! I know the manager told the owner MULTIPLE TIMES THAT WAS NOT OK, and I asked the manager multiple times what we could do about it, yet the owner still would not let us use air conditioner. We ended up turning it on every day behind her back, till the owner caught the manager using the air conditioner. I found some fans that made the kennels a little drier, but still would have to wipe the floors with towels in the afternoon because it was still that wet. I don’t think the other employees bothered wiping the kennels though.  

The entire time a customer boarded their dog, it got the physical exercise of a walk to and from kennel to potty kennel twice a day, maybe 20 feet, if they did not pay for playtime. That’s it. They sat in their kennel all day and night except for the time they are sitting in their potty kennel.  

Owner made us clean food bowls with some toxic rust remover like LRC without any second thoughts at a few points.

I have no idea what we would have done in a fire emergency. Was never ever talked about.

When dogs were being groomed, you were supposed to loop a leash up and around the neck and shoulder so that if it ever tried to jump from the table or bathtub it wouldn’t kill itself. Want to know why that was a rule? Because some years before a dog had died by jumping out of the tub with a leash around its neck. But even still, the owner would sometimes groom dogs with a leash around their neck and the other end of the leash tied to a ring above.

God I am so disturbed and frustrated by this to this day. I once saw a little dog jump off her table with the leash around it’s neck. She scowled and put the dog back on the table. The dog was thankfully ok, but she muttered “one of these days she’s going to kill herself”.

We had a sweet yorkie that came for daycare sometimes. His owner one morning asked for a flea bath, and the owner gave him one, but stuck him in a kennel soaking wet when she was done. Did not even towel dry him. He was shivering and I asked the owner if she wanted me to dry him off real quick, and she said no, Brittany will do it when she gets here. Brittany didn’t get there for another 30 minutes.

That was some of the bigger stuff I remember, I probably have forgotten a lot and didn’t go into how the owner treated employees. Again, I really don’t know if any of this was illegal, and if I do report them what could the police do with a report of something that happened 3 years ago. I know none of the employees work there anymore. Would reporting them do any good? And who would be best to report?",03Aug2018,1
401,"I've been drinking for several years now. I've quit before for a few months at a timebecause it had started to make me feel bad about myself and my life. Then would start again. I think it's fun and funny to take as many shots as possible in a row and suck down drinks as fast as I can. 
Well, last month I was close to blackout and I wrapped a cord around my neck in my room and tried to kill myself. I knew my depression was bad but alcohol made it so much worse. So I decided to quit drinking. 
I never thought of myself as an alcoholic. I haven't ever woken up and needed a drink. I never used alcohol to drown myself and take my mind off of whatever bad things were happening in life. I never drank by myself. I always thought it was just for fun. But when I drink, I drink A LOT. 
People have been suggesting I try AA meetings and I just need opinions. I'm not even totally sure what happens in these meetings. I'm shy and hate speaking in front of people. Is that necessary to do there or can I just listen? I want to be better and be strong on my own but knowing my friends and roommates are going to continue taking shot after shot in front of me is already causing me to struggle. I didn't realize how difficult it would be to quit because I thought I was only doing it for fun. But now I don't know what to do with myself",03Aug2018,1
402,"Hey all, I hope this is the right place to post this. I have recently turned twenty and I have never dated, made out with or had sex with a girl before (as you probably guessed, I am male). No, this is not a cringy post about how no girl wants me. In fact, I have actually gotten more than my fair share of prying, alluring eyes and wide smiles, it is just that I never acted on them. Neither am I asexual, I believe, I do have fantasies even if I prefer literotica to pornhub. Somehow though, the connection between actual girls and the possibility of sex seems to have mostly left my mind by the end of puberty and it hasn't returned since. 

I am not sure, what to make of it. Maybe I don't miss sex because I never had any? Maybe I should go out and date trying to create a connection that would turn me on?   But how do I pick girls to date if I don't find them attractive? 

Let me add that I am pretty content with the current state of my life; that I am from Europe, so religion is unconnected to this and finally that I believe to be an emotionally healthy person otherwise with a set of good, albeit mostly male friends.

404,"Never thought I would make a post like this but I really need help. I'm 19, about to be a sophomore in college, and live with my parents over the summer while I'm not in college. 

Here we go.

For the past 19 years, my parents and I have never gotten along. I can't think of a day that has passed that we haven't argued, or they haven't called me some iteration of ... loser, failure, animal, bitch, cunt, slut, worthless, I have no friends, no one will ever love me, I'll never be happy.... yeah. So my head is pretty fucked up from all the years of this. And no, I'm not perfect either, maybe sometimes I deserve it but a lot of times it is unprovoked.

So, anyway, I've pretty much been locked in my room the past 3 months, slowly going crazy as I am a prisoner in my own home. I don't have a license, and I have been begging my parents for years to help teach me how to drive, to get me lessons, or to just take me to the DMV so I can at least take the test. They got me 3 driving lessons last summer, and drove with me maybe twice down the street to Target. So I ask them to take me to the DMV to get my license and they say next summer...

Next summer comes along (this summer), and they say I need more practice. So I say, OK, drive with me to practice. They refuse because I'm a ""terrible driver"" and it ""stresses them out"" etc, Even though I truly am a pretty good driver to be honest. I'm not perfect, but should they expect me to be?

I live in a place where everything is driving distance, and knowing I would be locked in my house all summer if I didn't find a job, I scoured the internet looking for a job, and I found a perfect one for me as an office assistant to a doctor. They seemed very interested, but when I told them I didn't have a car or license they said I wouldn't be suitable for the job as I may need to run out during the job and get things or do things, etc. I understood. I told my mother and she said I was lying. Whatever.

I just stopped trying after that. 

So, I've seen a few friends, though rarely (they all have jobs, commitments, cars, etc) and can't expect them to come all the way to pick me up every time. 

So I kind of have to force myself to be okay with my parents as they are the only way I can get out of the house. However, recently, they did some shit that ended up being the straw that broke the camel's back and I couldn't reconcile myself maintaining a relationship with them.

I know this will be best long term, but now that it's been about a week, I have barely moved from my bed and I'm fucking spiraling. Staying in my room all day is not who I am and I seriously feel like I can't take it anymore but I have nothing to do and no where to go. I've been extremely suicidal and depressed, and every day just feels more unbearable. Any time I step out of my room, it is like dodging a minefield on whether or not we will fight or I will be the punching doll for their anger today. 

There are 2 more weeks until college starts but I can't see myself getting through this for the next 2 weeks I feel like I'm in solitary confinement. I've barely eaten, haven't been outside, just becoming more and more drawn into myself and I CAN'T TAKE IT. Any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated. I just can't do this shit anymore truly. ",03Aug2018,0
405,"I apologize ahead of time for this being lengthy... \[TLDR @ the bottom\]

Hey all, I have been thinking about this a lot lately and wanted to get some other opinions. I was on r/snapchat maybe a month ago, and met a girl on there, who I've been talking with from then up to now. I feel pretty strongly for her, and we've talked a lot and I feel like I've gotten to know her pretty well.

We've talked on the phone, texted, and exchanged every possible form of talking on Snapchat (snaps/texting/videos). It's not like I'm worried about cat-fishing or anything, cause the videos and phone calls pretty much cancel that out. Plus all snapchat messages are sent in real time, especially the pictures, so it's not like you can be someone you aren't.

I've grown up in a house that was plenty open to social media, but my parents were always pretty wary of the ""*If you don't know them in real life, don't add them on social media""* policy. For the most part, I lived up to that, but when I got on Reddit, I learned it's kind of fun to meet and talk to people from around the world, who I might not otherwise have the chance to meet.

So now here I am, having great conversation and a great friendship with this girl from across the country (I live in Northwest US, she lives in Southeast US), and but I'm kind of afraid of my own feelings. 

From what she's told me, the feelings are mutual, but I can't help but feel a little bit of caution. Maybe I'm crazy, maybe it's a little bit of my parent's old rule in my head. 

What do you all think?

TL;DR: I like a girl from across the country that I met on Reddit. I'm sure it's not cat-fishing because we've snapchatted and talked on the phone.  Still a little wary, asking y'alls opinions.",03Aug2018,2

I get told I'm funny.

 I'm not very funny in groups situations.. I'm just not loud enough, but I get told I'm witty, or that I tell great stories.

I wanted to write a book for awhile as a teen but I always lost interest, similar story goes to screenwriting but that idea has been far more common.. 

For a 21 year old guy I watch far too many sappy rom-coms, or just roms.. The Notebook, The Vow, About Time..

I've always admired Russell Brand, I'm told I'm very articulate, which apparently means smart talking.

But no, I find it pretty easy to get across the message I want and I tend to talk in a 'frilly' way.

I'm not sure I'm just trying to law it all out in front of me.. 

I'm looking at Comedy; stand up, skits, screenwriting etc..

Some more screenwriting/writing books but sappy stuff.

Or something like hosting, or just in that vein...

But then regarding writing books I don't know if I actually have that in me.. I have tremendous respect for writers because of how hard it is.

I really look up to people like Russell Brand and Donald Glover.

People who have so many different accreditations, who have started different projects.. People who are successful creative people basically.

I just know I'm probably forgetting something.. I'm just looking for some advice.

She's asked me to brainstorm about my self-image and, mostly, about what I don't like about myself - so that I can recognize thought patterns that match the self-deprication.  


So, mid conversation: My Therapist \[\~30F\] is asking me if I believe the good things people have said about me, citing a specific example in my life. She asked me to be honest, and so I was.  
""I hear what people are saying. But I don't believe their words. They don't know me like I do.""

And then, she cries. Not a hard, heavy sob. But an audible cry while trying to give me advice, telling me that I am worth something and that I deserve love and respect from myself, the same way I would treat others.  


  
So that's pretty much the gist of it. But something is nagging me. Was the crying unprofessional? Do I feel that it was inappropriate? Does she have some attachment towards me? Is my life that sad that I can make a professional cry?  


I felt equal parts flattered and awkward. It kind've felt like when your Mom cries in front of you. 

TL;DR  My Therapist cried when I spoke to her about my non-existant self-esteem. I feel weird when I think about it. And I feel that I am a sad-case. How can I look at this differently? ",03Aug2018,1

418,"I guess one of my friends (friend A) thinks another one (friend B) is dating a high school freahman, maybe sophomore, and he's an incoming college freshman. A said the girl told him that B got her a promise ring and whatnot, kinda wierd, but B is denying it.  Idk if that age difference is weird to you, it's pretty iffy to me, so I'm inclined to ask. But I don't think he's a bad guy, he's never allegedly done this before, so I don't wanna come out and accuse him and lose a friendship over a possible rumor. At the same time, if it's true, I don't want him to do something stupid and ruin his future.",03Aug2018,1
419,"So my dad is overall, a good person, but I hate to say it, he's a terrible father. Not terrible as in abusive, he's simply ignorant. He's selfish and entitled, and he never feels like he's responsible for all the problems he's caused. 

He doesn't do any chores and he barely talks to the rest of the family. Being the youngest, I don't even remember the last time I had a legitimate conversation with him, unrelated to ""my future job"". He always uses the excuse of being tired from work, which is understandable, but even when he's free, he takes that opportunity to get right out of the house and do his own things. He literally only comes home for a couple minutes after work, not even a fucking greeting to me, my sister, and sometimes even my mom, his own fucking wife. He just eats and heads out.

We've had the same fucking argument with him over and over again, but he continuously plays the victim. It's gotten to the point where divorcing him would make almost no fucking difference to me. I know it would tear our family apart though, so I keep quiet about it. Which is why I really need to say *something* eventually.

But I can't, I don't know this man like my sister or mother does. He's basically a stranger who so happens to be my dad. I love him though because I know once he understands everything will be better. I really want things to work out but he's so stubborn and closeminded. I don't know how to talk to him.",03Aug2018,3

422,Okay so I got a mattress in a box. I won’t name the brand but I really didn’t like it or think it was worth the $700. I emailed them to return within the 100 day trial. They said I could donate to a friend. I donated to my roommate. Well his parents just bought him a new mattress and I’m still not happy with mine. If He gave it back to me could they find out / is that illegal? I got the full refund and basically will be getting this mattress back. ,03Aug2018,1

425,"I probably, most definitely am, but just wanted to ask this here...

This is just a pure platonic friendship, no romantic stuff involved whatsoever.

My relatively new online friend has been feeling sick and I’ve only texted him once today and once yesterday to see if he was doing better. He told me how he was doing, thanked me for caring, told me I was not boring him and that he really appreciated it, since I told him that I was probably being really boring. He told me today that he’s going to take a break from his phone for a few days since his eyes hurt and he just wants to feel completely better since he’s not there yet. I told him to take care and to text me when and if he was to talk to which he replied ‘I will, thanks buddy 😃’. I have a fear I’m being clingy and that I’m scaring him away since I haven’t really had a close friend like him in a while. I really opened up to him and he’s helped me with lots of stuff. He always texts me first because of the time zones and stuff, so I suppose it’s all cool, but I don’t know... I’m just really self-concious and always bring myself down in a way, think that I’m not good enough for other people and it just gets in my head... Should I feel worried that he’s avoiding me or is it all fine? I’m probably overthinking this, right?....

Please don’t be mean for no reason... Thank you for taking the time to reply to my post if you decide to do so!",03Aug2018,1

431,"First of i wanna apologize for my grammar when it comes to the English language, since it's not my native tounge.

So, hello Reddit. 
I need some advice.

I just got a boat from one of my best friend father.
It's a rather old boat, from 1949(if i recall correctly). Made in Norway.  Lenght is 9m and side to side it's 2.5m.
It even has a mast.

I asked if I could buy it for 100 kronor (around 10$) on a facebook post, not seriously tho, but as time went and no one bought it. They kinda grew inpatience, and it was just standing there on the lawn.

So this night i got a message if I wanted to take their boat as the next proud owner of an old scandinavian piece of culture. 

I said yes. So now, we will meet up in the upcoming days to discuss what needs to be fixed.
There are a few small things that needs to be done, and a medium engine job. But luckely me, I got a couple of boat/car/engine educated people in my family. So i know that it will end up getting fixed. And i've quickly google around to get a sense of the economics that surrounds owning a boat.

But I don't know if I should take it or not. Help me fellow strangers.
What am I supposed to do, should I take the boat, or not?
Give me all you got.

Oh, and one last thing.
I am raised on a boat, i've spent alot of hours out there.",03Aug2018,1
433,"Back in May, my girlfriend and I were having troubles communicating about our emotions. We both had been going through a lot personally, which caused a lot of friction. Anxiety, lost in the world, confused what to do next. 

Then came a point where we broke up because she wanted to learn to love herself, because she didn't feel good about herself. After the initial and anger and pain from the shock of all of this (it was very sudden because otherwise we were amazing together), I started to realize that she wanted to really learn to love herself and that it's not my fault...and I get that. I get she wants to learn to love herself on her own. My issue is that I feel so alone now.

I just finished school (great program) and I have so much more free time to think about it. My confidence feels so low, and I feel like I'm nothing. While I'm so happy she recognizes that she needs to make changes in her life, I feel a bit abandoned. 

This isn't about the relationship, I know that this is for a good cause...I just don't know what to do now. She's everything to me, and now it's done.

TL:DR - Girlfriend I clashed, both of us going through things. We broke up because she wanted to focus on her mental health (which I will always support), but I feel lost, low and unsure what to do now). ",03Aug2018,1
