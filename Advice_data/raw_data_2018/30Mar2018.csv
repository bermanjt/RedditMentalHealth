0,"My wife and I are excited to be building our new home and we'll be moving in around mid August. Before filing the paperwork, we confirmed with her that we could break our lease 2 months early, to which she said was fine. After filing the paperwork, she called us back and said that if this is the case, she will sell the home now and we'd be moving out earlier so that we no longer have to be tied into a lease.

We're really on the fence about what to do now. She's a former broker and it's apparent her and her husband are ready to officially retire from all business by selling off their 3 rental homes. However, she'd like to do a for sale by owner and is asking me to do all the work for her... She's asked me to put up a sign with my number on it, take pictures for the listing on Trulia/zillow/redfin (i'm in marketing with a design/photography background), and even asking me to put it online myself and give her the password... I feel like she's gotta be breaking some laws?

We've been cooperating, because she then said that we'll be held responsible for the remainder of the lease if we move out early. Even though, by law, if we move out early she has to put her best effort into getting the house rented again before our lease is up to mitigate our losses. 

However, if we stay through the lease, we won't be able to save as much money and we'll lose our security deposit plus one months rent, roughly $2600. 

So we're not too sure what to do here...",30Mar2018,9
2,"Okay so I am a clutz and a down right moron when it comes to nearly everything. I'm incompetent as all hell.

I regularly do things like spend too much money on eating out, miss exams in college by accident, buy something on Amazon only to discover I can't use it, send out resumes or cover letters only to discover there's a typo in it, fuck ups at work.

I can't keep a decent work ethic and constantly ending up doing things at the last possible minute. I forget people's names, dates, and just generally fuck up everything I get into.

When it comes to actual application of things academically I'm a genius, I would ahve a 3.5 GPA or higher by now if I wasn't such a clutz with missing assignments, not fully reading assignment specs, etc.

How can I stop being a fucking incompetent asshole? I cause nothing but constant grief for myself on a daily basis, and it regularly hurts my self esteem, and everything else I do.

I've been like this since I was born, what the hell is wrong with me?",30Mar2018,9
3,I’ve been talking to a friend for a while trying to see if things get somewhere and I recently asked her to prom with flowers. Was not the most creative but I’m glad I grew the courage to ask at least. She said yes but Shortly after she posted “🙃🙃🙃” on Twitter. That made me feel pretty bad seeing as it most likely meant “really wtf was that/wow”. I’ve taken the hint that maybe she isn’t interested in a relationship which honestly I’d be fine with. No big deal. But I feel like she does not want to go with me at all to which I think why didn’t she just say no I would’ve been fine with it too. After that we’ve stoppedcommunicating as much. Next thing is that One of her friends is now going to prom. He 100% was not going because I asked him but listening to him talk to her right in front of me saying that “he’s only doing this for her” makes me  think that she’ll probably leave me during prom to go with her friend. I don’t know if I should ask if she still wants to go with me or I’m overreacting? Maybe I’m just being delusional or stupid but oh well. ,30Mar2018,1
4,"Any advice on how to forget about this it keeps me up at night?

To understand this story you must first hear a little backstory

It’s a long story but basically I really annoyed this kid (we will call him chad cause that’s the typical bully name) and he is friends with a lot of the, for lack of a better word “jocks”

You must also know we have a very strict PE teacher who we will call Mr Sir and that we MUST shower before PE.

We get things called strikes for misbehaving, late homework, late for class ect...

and 3 strikes equal detention and 3 detentions in a month was said to result in you getting expelled (but I later found out that was just a myth)

Long story but simply because of the people I hung about with I was two strikes away from a third detention 

Now on with the story

We were going to PE so the boys and girls went to their respective changing rooms. 

I was in getting a shower while unbeknownst to me chad was taking my stuff and hiding it.

Because I took so long (or because everyone was so fast idk) when I got out of the shower I was the only one in the room I looked for my stuff but panicked when I couldn’t see anything I must have clambered about for ten minutes because I then heard Mr Sir yell

“GET OUT HERE ANON YOU ARE TAKING TO LONG!”

I panicked and didn’t wanna say what happened so I yelled back

“Ok just a minute”

And after about literally a minute he yelled

“THATS LONG ENOUGH NOW GET OUT HERE!”

I tried to explain what had happened but he cut me off by yelling 

“GET OUT HERE NOW OR THATS A STRIKE”

I panicked but thought, well he won’t let me explain it and while it’s still super embarrassing I can’t get a strike so if I just go out to talk to him he’ll see what’s happened and I’ll be fine.

I covered myself and walked out but to my surprise the whole class was waiting for me and they burst out laughing and Mr Sir yelled

“OH DO YOU THINK YOU’RE FUNNY EH?”
I still don’t understands this statement like I get self deprecation humour but I doubt anybody would go that far with people they will know for a long time. (If anyone can try to tell me what he ment here too I’d be grateful)

But I finally explained it to him and I got my stuff and chad got in huge trouble but I still cringe thinking about it.",30Mar2018,3

10,"Hi there,

So I'm at a loss right now. I have a friend that I have been close with for years and years. This past year has been really hard and I do not want to lose her, but something needs to change. She is a one-upper and has bipolar disorder. Most of her one-ups are also lies (and she's a bad liar), which I know is common with manic-depressive individuals. I know that her one-upping stems from insecurities and dissatisfaction with where her life is at. However, it's just so exhausting. She has always acted as though she regards herself as the smartest person in a room. I have always felt like she think's she's smarter and more talented than me, but the issue is calling her out on this would only make me seem like I feel insecure or lesser than, but I really don't. I think friendships should have egalitarian respect and consideration. I think there should be a balance. It's hard for the outlandish lies not to feel like she thinks I'm stupid too. Like, you're really going to make me laugh and pretend I buy that? I feel that I understand why she is doing all of this, but I don't know what to do. I really really care about her and don't want her out of my life. I don't want to hurt her feelings. However, something's gotta give. This has been going on a long time. I have tried ignoring her lies or one-ups, but it hasn't been stopping her. She is very high energy, high emotion and if I don't match that it almost feels mean. 


Please let me know if you've dealt with anything like this or have ideas. 

Thank you, I really appreciate it. ",30Mar2018,2

16,"So I got a job offer that will involve moving to Las Vegas. I haven't accepted it just yet but I'm pretty sure I will. Before I do I want to get a few things at least mostly figured out. Maybe not the specifics but in the ball park is fine by me. I've never done anything like this before meaning I'm certain I'm forgetting some stuff, so I'm hoping some other people that have made similar moves will have some pointers and pro tip's for me.

1. It's just me moving, no SO, kids, or pets. This might not matter but I imagine it could effect some decisions in regards to some things so I think it's worth mentioning.
1. I've done the budgeting for living there and I should be fine in that regard. I'm considering car, cell phone, food, gas, figuring about $950/mo for rent/water since it's usually included and $50 for power, $80-100 for internet.
1. I drive a Scion FR-S, and I'll need to either truck it over or do the drive myself. Frankly, I'm leaning towards doing the drive almost exclusively just for ""the experience."" I have no idea if I'll actually enjoy the experience, of course, or what the cost difference of trucking it vs. the gas/hotel costs will be. I'm coming from Raleigh, NC so I expect the drive will take me about 4 days if I drive for ~9 hours a day. I'm currently looking at furkot.com as a way to plan that/book hotels, are there alternatives for something like this? Where do I even start for looking for someone that can truck my car over so I can compare the cost?
1. I don't plan on moving any furniture. What I'm thinking is going into a national furniture chain like Rooms To Go, and explicitly asking, ""I'm moving to Las Vegas in May. Can I look at things here, purchase with you, and it be delivered to my place there from a local depot or store?"" Is that dumb or a thing people do?
1. Since I'm not bringing any furniture I have very little stuff to move. A few computers (gaming desktop, couple home servers), a small-ish TV (I might sell it and buy something there since it'd be a good opportunity to upgrade to 4k), clothes, and all my junk that'll be boxed up. Way too much to fit in my tiny little sports car, but I honestly don't think it's even enough to fill one of those Pod's. I see Uhaul has a similar service to Pod now, are there similar other options? Alternatives to consider? I'm concerned about getting something that's not too big so shit's not sliding around and slamming into the more delicate things, so a company that goes out of their way to securely pack up the truck is valuable to me.
1. I've spent the last year digging myself out credit card debt, which as of now I'm done with (excluding having just purchased a new laptop that my tax refund is going towards, but otherwise yay). That means I have little saved up right now, but by the time the move comes I should have about $1500-2000 saved to go towards the move. There is a $5000 relocation bonus involved, too.  I *imagine* that'll be enough to cover things but it's dependent on expenses I'm not considering.

So yeah. I'd really appreciate any suggestions for things to consider, account for, etc. in regard to a cross country move. I'm pretty much past the ""Is this worth moving to Vegas for?"" phase and everything, I've heard both horror stories and grand overtures of Vegas living but I'm not opposed to more input on that, either.",30Mar2018,1

18,"I know, most sources will state *anything* perishable left out for more that 2 hours is now unsafe to eat. But, this was a hot and cooked and packaged rotisserie chicken that I forgot about while I took a nap. I've heard hot food must be left out for *at least* 2 hours before refrigeration, or before that ""2 hours before it's bad"" timer starts. So that would give me like 4 hours which isn't too far off from what I did.

Also, I feel like either with ordered food or being over at friends' places, people cook and leave food out all damn night before refrigerating it. And it's always fine.

Idk, please tell me I just didn't waste about $8. That's a lot of money to me. But, if it's proven to me that it's bad then it's bad and I won't risk it.

I groped someone's but at a party two years. I was honestly trying to grind and I was really drunk and didn't think about it until now.

I used to be a bit of a nice guy and was wierd to I want to say two girls (one pretty bad, other not really that bad I'm just very self critical — I've run into her and it was a nice interaction actually).

I groped someone while I was really drunk in a worse-than-just-groping way, after I started looking back at actions (all of which took place several years ago) and regretting them.

I have HFA (which I don't really think of as contributing to the above, and don't factor that in, and didn't while apologizing which I've done for the first and third) I have certainly done things and been inadvertently creepy.

I also got flashed once by some guy (he was just standing in the hallway with his whole dick and balls out) and completely forgot about it ... until recently when I realized he was in the part of my dorm hallway by the girls bathroom. Something could have happened then that I could have stopped but didn't because it was sooo late at night.

27,"Hey everyone!!
(Some background) 
I am in High School and a cis female
I’m not necessarily one to be made fun of or picked on.  I used to be but that’s in the past. 

That’s not very important^

I am DIAGNOSED with ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, and possibly a few other things. 
I go to therapy-Not often. 
I’ve never taken meds for anything. 

Lately I have been extremely stressed and depressed to the point where I’m not sleeping.  There’s always something I think I should be doing instead of sleeping or taking any form of a break(however sometimes I get so depressed that I say “fuck it” and don’t do anything).
My work ethic hasn’t been the best, I’m being a shitty girlfriend, and a shitty friend. 
PMS doesn’t help
the loss of a loved one doesn’t help
the work load from school doesn’t help
the fact that I lost two of my best friends this month doesn’t help. 
I’m at such a dead end.  Nothing feels worth it. I can’t work up the energy to be happy with my friends, my boyfriend knows everything that is happening but I feel like I’m taking it out on him?
I really need some fucking help.  
I would take meds if I wasn’t afraid of my dad mocking me. 
I’m afraid of ruining my relationship. No one will believe this but he is the one, for sure.  He claims to understand but I still always make him upset.  I’ll go into detail in a second. 
Here is what I’m doing with every different person that is negative. 
Friends:
Ignoring them, not making an effort, losing them, being ignored 
Boyfriend:
If he doesn’t answer for awhile but I see he’s online I genuinely freak out because I think he’s mad or something.  I keep randomly snapping on him.  He knows I’m going through a rough time and he’s helping for the most part but since he’s the only person I feel I can spend time with, I snap on him. 
Family:
Constantly snapping on them.

When I walked into the drying room strangely both female teachers were standing on the boys side and there were some girls on the other side changed and hanging their old stuff.

I constantly find myself worrying about what people think of me. I worry about the most littlest things like weather or not this outfit is okay, is this pimple to big, or should I do this.

There isn't a day that goes by that I don't worry about it. It's like it's as if I want ""society"" to accept or like what I do. 

I hide things that like to watch/do like collect cards, watch anime, or play video games because I know those things are looked down upon. So when I go to work its like I'm not me because I change my personality do much because I feel like I will be judged.

I don't know what to do. I've tried putting it in my mind that random people aren't going care as much I think they are going to.

We saw each other every week and instead of sex started making love... I could see it in his eyes the way he looked at me and the way he treated me hw was falling for me like I was for him... i fucked up and told him I was talking to somebody only to see if he would say don't do it I want to be with you blabla.. well he didn't he got very upset but tried to hide it. I looked at his phone on the weekend and wow so many pictures of many women naked that he has talked to.. it broke my heart, his excuse of course is that I was talking to somebody and that he told me he didn't want anything serious, but then he apologized and said that he can't control his feelings towards me.. I am so hurt though I don't think I could trust him. Should I wait a couple of days and let him realize that he actually loves me? I don't think I can cut him off forever :(",30Mar2018,2

43,"I'm 24 and live in New England where winters are seemingly never-ending. I own a 1999 Honda Accord which I've had since I was 16, and it has approx 156k miles on it.

I don't exactly have the highest paying job right now (30k a year, give or take). I only have about 8k in the bank account but I'm usually pretty good about saving money. My grandfather, who's a mechanic, brought over a used 2007 Ford Explorer Sport Trac he got from the junkyard for me to check out. It's actually pretty damn nice with a few minor fixes, and has 106k miles on it. It'd cost me around $4,500 and I'd sell my Accord for roughly $2,000 (hopefully). I'd pay the $2,500 difference.

Seems like a no-brainer, right? Well my money situation is holding me back right now. I'm still trying to save money and move out. I'm drowning in student loans. And obviously I have various other monthly expenses plus the simple expenses of day-to-day life. Plus, my car at the moment runs PERFECTLY fine. And I don't travel very often.

But I'm going to need four-wheel drive eventually living here, and this '99 Accord isn't going to last forever. Should I say screw it and just get the truck? Or should I keep saving money and hopefully another vehicle will come my way when I have more money in the bank.

45,"My wife and I have been together a little over 4 and 1/2 years, married 6 months. 2 months ago I had an anger episode where I slapped my son. After I calmed down I was scared, we argued, and that was the end of it.

My wife has been in abusive relationships in the past and said she wouldn’t live like that anymore, but she agreed that she would give me a chance to redeem myself. Fast forward to three weeks ago, she said she couldn’t be in a relationship with me because of it. We talked and said I would seek counseling and we would work it out. Then a couple days later she again said she didn’t think she could trust me, we had a bad marriage, etc. again we talked and calmed down. Then the next day she said she wondered if I would consider an open relationship, something she’s done in the past before we met. I thought about it and decided no. She had said that no she wouldn’t leave me if I said no, but now I’m looking for a place to live. We are still acting like we’re normal in front of the kids, sleep in the same bed, work at the same place, and she has said that I’m her best friend and still wants to do things with the kids after we divorce. 

I’m having issues dealing with all this. I have bad anxiety anyways, and this has made it worse. None of my usual calming methods are working. I need some ideas on how to handle this and move on. Or a friendly ear when I’m freaking out, because I have one friend that I can talk to about this but she is busy with her life, so I only have my wife to talk to.

46,"What's up reddit? I'm an idiot, here's why:

*Wall of text warning*

(I suppose I should start with a disclaimer. This in no way excuses my behavior, but it may explain it. In the past few months I've lost several family members I was quite close to (in fact my grandfather died last night) and have tried to help my sister recover from being raped by her best friend because my parents have been absolutely horrid to her about it. Along with this, I've got some emotional issues that I've recently realized probably stem from the fact that I was raised by alcoholics who emotionally abused me. Coming to terms with this has been hard, especially because I still do care about my parents. The emotional, uhhh, deficits I have basically mean that I don't know how to express my emotions and think that everything is much worse than it is. Again, this in no way excuses my behavior and I want to own up to it and make up for it if that's possible.)

Now, to the fun part.

I work in a small office, it's a very familiar, laid back atmosphere. I started about ten months ago, several weeks after one of the managers died unexpectedly. The manager who hired me, Gary [51M], was best friends with the manager who died. He was kind enough to take me under his wing and teach me about the field he works in.

Since then, a lot has happened. Gary's assistant (who was like a daughter to him) had to leave because she has a sick child. Their parting was stressful for both of them, and it hurt to see them have to go through that. Gary and his assistant, Sandra [27F], are still close(ish) and I speak to Sandra regularly as we grew close dealing with stuff at the office.

Gary has had a nasty year, and is still healing. Throughout the year, he's had ups and downs and frankly was pretty hurtful to Sandra during the time leading up to her departure. He's got a lot going on in his life, not just at work. For a while, he'd end up talking to me about some of the stuff he was dealing with over lunch. It was probably weird that we were close, in fact some of my friends thought we were having an affair(???). But after Sandra left, he's been different. Almost depressed, I guess, but not. Maybe demure is a better word for it. But I've tried to be there for him and have dealt with some hurtful stuff from him, all the while continuing to do my job to the best of my ability.

We haven't been to lunch for a while, because a new manager has taken the spot of the one who died and Gary has been going to lunch with him because they're good friends. This new manager, Charles [49M], is an abrasive personality to say the least. He was friends with the manager who died as well. Along with this, Gary has a new assistant, Amy [25F]. She's great, and we've grown close getting through Gary's weirdness together.

Amy and I have been having trouble with Charles. He's got anger issues, and along with this is at least mildly pervy. We get creeped out by him, and he's made some comments to us that have raised eyebrows. I've been talking to Sandra about this regularly, because she knows Gary much better than me, and is aware of Charles's proclivities as she knows him too. Sandra's been very disturbed by what has been going on, just as Amy and I have.

This all came to a head yesterday. Gary has been out of town, and I was helping Charles with something. While Gary was gone, I actually started sort of getting along with Charles. Don't get me wrong, both Amy and I were still scared of him. But I was able to establish a sort of banter-y rapport with him. However, when we were working together yesterday, there was a miscommunication that I only exacerbated by thinking Charles was being banter-y and playing along. (I'm going to be honest, I shouldn't have been banter-y in the first place, but this is a very casual workplace.)

This led Charles to go absolutely apoplectic. He screamed and cursed and called me useless after I apologized. He was so loud that everyone else in the building could hear him and customers were disturbed. Having a history of emotional abuse issues, this sent me into a full on panic attack. I hid in Amy's office for the remainder of my shift (~45min) because Charles was still angry.

I told Sandra about what went down, and she was super upset about it especially knowing that Amy and I were already really uncomfortable with Charles. She texted Gary and explained everything that was going on, and Gary was pretty pissed. I also sent him a message explaining what had happened and owning up to the fact that I had been playing with fire.

The fun continued this morning. Before I arrived for my shift, all of the upper management minus Charles had a meeting about what happened. The rest of the management basically said ""Gary, what Charles did was messed up. You're his business partner and friend, fix this."" When I got to work, Gary sat down with Amy and I and basically said that he's aware Charles is obnoxious, but we need to learn to deal with it. He elaborated, saying that he understands that as women we don't operate the same way him and Charles do, and since we're more sensitive he needs to try and account for that. (???) He then said that Charles isn't as nice as he is, and we need to grow thicker skins. He also explained that he hasn't put very much time in to showing me the ropes of the profession because he doesn't know if I'm worth it, which I was under the impression we had discussed several months ago and cleared up that I was in it for the long haul. Along with this, he said he'd talked to Charles about not being an asshole like he was yesterday.

I was holding back tears (mostly because I'm still coping with the loss of my grandfather but also because his words stung) and he could see that. We concluded our conversation and he went to go get lunch with Charles.

I was pissed at what he'd said (and I think I had at least some grounds to feel that way). Honestly, after having been lowkey emotionally abused by Gary the past few months, I've been considering quitting. I was talking to Amy and another one of our coworkers and texting Sandra about it because I was really upset and angry. At that moment, I realized that I didn't have to put up with this anymore, it was above my pay grade.

While Charles and Gary were at lunch, I wrote a letter of resignation and put it on Gary's desk, said my goodbyes to everyone else, and left. I will admit, I was still pretty pissed off, so my letter was harsher than it should have been. However, my coworkers were super supportive and were proud that I was standing up for myself.

I felt like a weight had been lifted off of my shoulders and I could finally breathe again. For a short while. I got a message from Amy saying that Gary was really upset (""I gave her a job two weeks after my best friend died and she up and leaves and gives me this shitty note, that's hurtful."") and that he had said some things he regrets. When he went to lunch with Charles, he had another chat with him about how he can't verbally abuse people like that.

To her credit, Amy went to bat for me and explained that I was scared it would happen again (especially because I'm super embarrassed about having a panic attack at work). Gary literally said he would kick Charles's ass if that happened.

As such, I felt super guilty about it and shot Gary a message apologizing and explaining that I do truly care about him as a person but I had had a lot going on, and wished I could have a do over because it was unfair of me to leave like that. After a while, he replied and said that he wasn't mad or upset with me at all and understood that I'm in a bad place right now. He added that it's never a good thing to make important decisions under significant stress, and that we should talk when I ""have a clear head"".

I appreciate that he's being so understanding and is willing to give me a second chance, but he made it sound like he wants me to come back to work. Frankly, I'm not so sure this is a good idea. While Gary and I may come to an understanding, that doesn't fix the fact that the office is a hostile work environment. This doesn't fix how I feel about Charles, and I have no idea how well Gary talking to him about it will help. When we do talk, I have absolutely no idea what to say. While my letter was harsh, it also was accurate (Sandra agreed and actually read the letter before I left it on Gary's desk).

What do I say to Gary when we talk? Should I even think about taking my job back (while it is an insane place, I like the people I work with and usually enjoy going to work)? How do I pick up the pieces of this mess I've made?

Anyway, my brother ends up winning two of the big-ticket items. It was pretty crazy since there was at least a thousand people crowded in a gymnasium trying to win. Anyway, we find out they're both fake within the next week but don't do anything since the fundraiser group had already left town.

They told me that ever since they were young, they always pushed their feelings aside when something bad happened, which a lot of people do. It got to a point where instead of letting everything they pushed aside out at once, they can no longer respond correctly to situations.

For example, someone they care about was recently hospitalized, and they told me they smiled, and almost laughed upon hearing the news, despite the fact that they were very concerned. They couldn't help it. They seem to think that by hiding their feelings for so long, they've developed some kind of psychological problem.

I am constantly left out and pushed to the side in conversations. When I told them about my eating disorder and came clean, I was greeted with a handful of jokes about my weight. I just feel like they drag me down to the ground into a pile of self-hatred and even depression. It's not like I can find new friends at school, everyone else is about as annoying.

Few quick identifying characteristics for us both.

Me- cis, straight male, in tune with my feminine side, autistic, codependent, emotionally expressive, empathetic and I take good care of my body.

Bri- cis, bi woman, rational, less emotionally expressive, but still affectionate, anxious, understanding, self conscious, patient, and willing to help.

None of us have any form of drug addictions or sever bad habits. We live together, and due to my job, I can only see her on weekends, but our relationship was built on long distance. We behave like we’re best friends.

I miss having sex with my partner. Both of us want to have sex, but I am completely unable to get or maintain an erection. I’ve been feeling a gradual detachment from Bri; logically I know she’s the best woman I can ask for, but I look at her and I just don’t feel as close to her as I want to, like a feeling of distance between us. I’ve been having incredibly selfish thoughts; wishing a physical attribute about Bri was different, that I’m no longer attracted to her. I haven’t told her and don’t know if I should, I don’t want to hurt her, and it may not even be the reason.

I’ve tried to be sexual with a few others with mixed results. I’ve been aroused with a woman who wasn’t my preferred body type, and I wasn’t aroused by a woman who was. So I think it could be the emotional connection. When I get in the mood, we have foreplay, but as it goes further, I’m gradually less and less in the mood.

I’m 24 and my dick doesn’t work- I don’t even masterbate that often. I’m sorry this has been so long, I’m honestly ashamed to have this problem, and I feel awful for the way I feel towards my partner. I love her to pieces and I don’t understand why my emotions aren’t cooperating or why I’ve been thinking so selfishly.

62,"My boyfriend and I had a pretty traumatic experience a couple of months ago when we lost our corgi puppy. We've healed and have decided that we're ready to get a new one. We put a deposit down on a corgi who will be ready to come home with us in a month and a half.

We started ""nesting"" for the upcoming arrival by replacing our old puppies things with new ones and buying anything we forgot the first time around. We're both pretty excited for this new addition.

Last week as I was walking home from work I met a dog on the street that just came up and started loving me. Not aggressively but very calmly. I started to walk away and she proceeded to follow me. She followed me all the way home (40 minute walk) and listened very well. After getting her home and feeding her my boyfriend and I realized that she has to be a lost dog. She's leash and harness trained, her nails are trimmed, and she's very well behaved. We put out messages and posters to try and find her owner but so far no one has come to claim her. We took her to the vet to get her checked out and she's clear of heart worm and fleas. We consider ourselves really lucky to be fostering such a well behaved and healthy dog.

Everything we were preparing to use for our new corgi has started being used by our current foster dog. And though we've had her for a while now both myself and my boyfriend are trying really hard not to get attached. One, because we don't know if her owners (if she has any) will come and get her. Two, because we're torn on giving her all of our attention knowing that we have another puppy coming home soon.

The idea of adopting her if no one claims her has crossed our minds but I'm hesitant for a number of reasons:

* She has been around other people and reacts to them very well and she's friendly with other dogs when we go on walks but I have yet to see her interact with a dog that's in her ""space.""

* She's very attached to me and I don't know if this would be a territory problem as well with the new puppy.

* The cost of two dogs. The foster dog is very small (looks like a shiba/besenji mix) and our other puppy will be a corgi. So food wise I think it'll be the same as when I had a big dog back home. But vet wise and other costs could rack up pretty quickly.

But I have been told that having an older, well behaved/trained dog can be good for a new puppy as they can be role models of what to do and help speed up training. We're going to take the foster dog back to the vets in a couple of weeks to get her vaccinated just in case she isn't and then, if we haven't heard from anyone, we have to make a decision.

We have some friends who live close to us who have shown interest in her but I don't know if staying with us would be the best choice for her or not. Does anyone have any advice on this subject?

**TL;DR** Found a lost/stray dog, well behaved and healthy. Getting a puppy soon that's already paid for. Don't know if the new dog will be a good or bad thing for the new puppy and if it's easy or hard to raise two dogs at once.",30Mar2018,2
63,"We adopted a dog from a shelter almost a year ago. All 3 of my kids wanted a dog and we finally relented. The oldest always was a little skittish around dogs but she wanted one too. She cried tears of joy when we adopted the dog. The dog was very anxious for the first couple of months and we were worried about her being aggressive towards the girls. We did training and over time she’s really improved though she’s not without her issues. As a result of all this my daughter (who has anxiety issues of her own) never really formed a bond with the dog and will sometimes work herself into a panic attack when she’s around the dog (which isn’t doing anything) convincing herself the dog is about to attack her 

 I can’t have my daughter being so uncomfortable in her own house. I’m reaching the point where I think we need to get rid of the dog though my daughter cries hysterically at the thought of this.

Getting rid of the dog is going to be catastrophic but I think it needs to be done. I need to think of the best way to go about it

Should I take her back to the shelter, giving the family one last chance to say goodbye? My other kids are going to blame my oldest for is having to give the dog up

It's not just me who hasn't been paid, but my coworkers as well. I haven't gotten an hourly paycheck since November last year. We keep track of tips with envelopes. Basically, take an envelope, see how much in tips we earned, and we put it away in the safe. What's *supposed* to happen is that if we get cash we fill the envelopes until you get however much you're owed. 

At this point, I'm owed 1,700 in tips. I've been working 400+ hours and worked 3 parties that each one we get paid 105$ but that gets included in our hourly pay... which I don't get anyways.

Calculating everything, my boss owes me 2,900. The thing that sucks is that me and my coworkers love working at this place because everyone gets along with everyone and it's a very chill environment. We all agreed that if we just got paid, we wouldn't be this unhappy.

Everyone has bills to pay and there are some people who left this job and the boss still owes them money. I'm going to be moving in less than 5 months and I don't want to have to wait that long to be getting my money - I've been working a shit ton because of the fact that I'm moving and need it for rent.

I(Ashley) had to mind these 2 kids from about 19:00 to 24:00 for my neighbours.

I’ll refer to them as Bratt 1  and bratt 2

These kids were certainly trouble makers! They pulled pranks on most baby sitters so their parents called me (thinking cuz we where both young and on the same street we’d somehow be friends?)

They were normal at first 
Almost too normal for kids with their reputation 

I went to put them to bed at around 10 but when I walked into bratt 1s room a bucket of mud spilled on me( yeah I know it sounds like it’s out of a movie but it’s true) 

I cleaned the mess up and decided to go for a shower (note: I don’t normally shower in other peoples houses but I was covered in mud) while I was in the shower I heard bratt 1 scream “bratt 2 ran away!” (Bratt 2 was only 4) so I panicked and grabbed a towel, put on my boots and went into the garden. Bratt 2 was pretty fast for a four year old as he jumped out of a bush, snatched my towel and ran in locking the door as they taunted me. I had to wear the doormat and ask a neighbour to make them let me in!

Was it my fault? (The parents say it was)
Am I a bad babysitter?

69,"This has been going on for two years now (We have been friends for over 5 years) and it has progressively become worse. My bestfriend is depressed but she refuses to try out anything I suggest, claiming that it won't work or she has to do this certain something first before doing that (Which doesn't make sense because it's usually unattainable). She struggles a lot, especially when it comes to being pressured to look beautiful, and I would like nothing more but to help her. Even if I repeat myself again and again (Which is what's technically happening right now), nothing will happen because she refuses to actually put any effort in doing what I suggest (She also finds reasons to object to what I suggest). She keeps on saying the same reasons over and over again, refusing to listen to me at all. I feel so hopeless up at this point now, what should I do? Should I just keep up what I'm doing right now? Or should I make a change? 

Note: One of the things that I suggested to her before is to look at the mirror everyday and smile but she objected to it almost immediately, saying that she cannot do that because -insert reasons-

20/F College student and part time worker 

Mom: 
40s, stay at home mom, traditional Mexican mom. 

I need someone to set me straight. If I’m fucking up here as a human, please tell me. 

My boyfriend’s sister (young mom in her 20s) found a very good deal on a flight to Orlando two weeks ago. It would be me, my boyfriend, his sister, and his sisters daughter. 

They have a cousin in Florida who is letting us borrow his place for the night, so we can go to Disney in the morning. 

We are getting the Disney tickets for free, since their cousin gets the hook-up through the company he works for. 

Well, I said yes to going. It was a quick decision that didn’t require much thinking. I thought to myself, well I have the money and the time for it. I’m off school that day, and I only had to cover one shift at work. 

All good on my part. I finished all my homework, got my shift covered, and figured out a plan for the vacation. However, my mom lost her shit over the fact that her twenty year old daughter is going to Disney with her boyfriend and his family. 

Is it that bad? 

She said that it’s “wrong” for me to go, that it “wouldn’t look good” for me to (and I still don’t know what she meant by that). When I asked her to elaborate, she would just shake her head and say that some things don’t need explaining. 

Umm... well, okay. I thought about it. I looked up the cancellation policy, and tried to see how to cancel.  Something kept stopping me

I respect my parents a lot. I depend on them for the roof over my head. They pay my phone bill. I try to adhere to their rules as much as possible. I get home before 9 PM and I never go out with strangers. I go to work and I go to school. I’d say I’m an okay kid. I stay home almost every weekend, and they know who I am involved with. 

So, this internal debate went on for days and days. I talked to everyone. My manager, my coworkers, moms I knew, my boyfriend... everyone. I asked them what do I do... As a human, I have the right to have some fun and see the world.. But as a daughter, I do have to follow the rules. 

I said fuck it, I’m going. I got my shit straight, I have the time and money for it, why not? 

Now my mom is guilt tripping me HARD, and I feel fucking terrible and have anxiety for it. 

Please tell me reddit if I fucked up

72,"Crosspost from r/JUSTNOMIL My SO’s little sister called him today asking if she could use me for a reference on a job application at my office (BTW Didn’t even ask how I’d feel about it btw.) I have not called her back and plan to speak with someone at my work tomorrow, but not sure who.

I know exactly what her plan is. Get hired at my company and move in the the same apartment complex as us since the building is across the street. She’s said multiple times she wants to move here. 

I’m on good (they believe) terms with SO’s family. So I want to do something covert actions before having to drop the truth bomb on my JNMIL, JNSIL, &amp; JNFIL.

Who do I talk to at work? What do I say? How do I keep it professional?  HOW DO I STOP THIS BEFORE IT STARTS? 

If I fail at preventing this SO swore he would drop the bomb that I would prefer she didn’t work in the same building or live in the same complex as us. 
I will also tell her I don’t think it’s a good idea, and I’d prefer she not work there. Which will open a floodgate of crazy with the whole family especially MIL who thinks the sun shines out of her daughter’s ass, but it’s better than the alternative.

I literally have to take Xanax specifically to cope with dealing with them, especially her. Since having to live with her a year, a deep disgust for her bratty immature behavior grew and I don’t ever want to share anything with her and her child abusing ass ever again. 

I’m afraid because she looks good on paper, book smart, and will be cheap straight out of college, which is appealing to a company.  

Help me please! 

Edit: If asked by HR (big if they ask), I’m going to say she’s my SO’s sister, but I cannot personally or professionally recommend her. But I’d like to be a bit more proactive as I’m not only protecting my professional space, but my home space. MIL is SIL’s best friend and she’ll be just dropping by and on the grounds a fuck ton.

86,"Hello! It's unfortunate that life is so different and you never know which path to take but maybe I'm looking from a biased perspective and I need help making a really big decision.

I apologize in advance for the long post.

A bit about me: I'm currently a 22-year old female that's going to graduate from university in May! Unfortunately, I will not be guaranteed a job as I need to continue to go to school for my masters (I'm getting a bachelors degree in Biology and my end goal is to go to a masters program (a Physician Assistant masters program). I have worked part time as a home health aide for four years (my whole college career) just to be able to get some hours in for my masters program as they require patient contact hours, but I haven't been able to apply to my masters program because applications are a few hundred so I'll be applying at a later time period while I take a year off to raise the funds.

Now I get into my actually dilemma: after I graduate I have no place to live. I made plans to live with my college roommate after we both graduated, but she unfortunately failed a class and decided to take a year off because she felt she needed it (and her home is 1,000+ miles away). A lot of my family is also far away so it's difficult graduating from college and not having a place to stay secured.

I have two decisions on the possibility of where I can live. Just so you can get an idea of where I'm from I live in Western Massachusetts.

Fortunately, I have a friend that is willing to take me in if I move to Wisconsin (except they're the only person I know in this state and I do not have a job there nor health insurance. This seems the most beneficial however because they would be willing to let me pay simply $100 a month to live with them until I get a better paying job and can afford larger payments. I'm also hesitate to move as I would have to get rid of a good portion of my belongings and repurchase many of the things I would be needing to get rid of (on top of saving money for plan tickets and luggage fees).

My other option would be to move in with a girl that is a friend of a friend and I hardly know. She lives with her mother and her mother is renting out a room for $500. Although this seems convenient because I would have a part-time job in the idea and not get rid of my belongings, $500 a month is going to be hard to pay when I do not presently have a full time job and pay for student loans until I become accepted into my masters program.

Just for clarification: moving in with family isn't really an option, my mother is dealing with my stepfather being comatose for the past two weeks after really severe traumatic brain injury caused by a motorcycle accident (removed left parietal side of his brain and we don't know if he'll live let alone survive his injuries). On top of that my mother cannot afford to help me out and I know she would want to do so much more but she's financially disadvantaged. (And she's nearly ~1,500 miles away)

I hope I described most things in detail but I'm wondering what would be the best route to take in this scenario? I obviously cannot afford to rent an apartment by myself and rooming with my roommate that was previously in the area isn't possible. Should I get rid of a majority of my belongings and move to Wisconsin where I only know one person? Or should I stay in my college town where I know a few more people in the area but move in with a girl that's practically a stranger?

If you don't know what's the best choice to make you can also offer me advice on how to quickly pay off student loans, what are the best jobs you can take that will make my resume stand out for Physician Assistant school that I can do on my year of? What's a good side job that I can possibly pick up to make a few extra hundred dollars a month? Or any jobs are well paying that I simply do with a biology degree?

I just have a lot on my mind and I'm freaking out because I don't want to live in poverty after recently graduating from my bachelors degree. I also don't want to make the wrong decision. I'm sorry for the long story!

But I hope you guys can dissect my story in a variety of ways and help me think clearly",30Mar2018,3
87,"I understand that he is in no way obligated to do anything for me. But we have been *very* close since 6th grade when he moved to my town. It's one of those friendships of spending every other weekend at each others houses for entire school years at a time haha. I just assumed that he enjoyed my company enough to invite me on a fun trip to someplace warm for a week with some other friends of ours. My only thought as to why he did this is because he and some of the people that went down there like to drink, where as I don't find much appeal to it. Ironically I am the one that is legally able to drink while he isn't. But I guess that makes me the stick in the mud for the group. And I only learned of the trip because he started talking to me about how he had everything laid out and how the cars were going to be packed full and the kind of stuff that isn't a ""hey would you like to go too?"" type of conversation.

Unbeknownst to me, he had his eye on me from the first day he walked into class. He asked me to be his girlfriend a couple months after he had been coming to class but I turned him down with a not yet and offered friendship instead because I knew that I need to find myself before entering into a relationship, which I don’t plan to do for years to come. 
I wasn’t sure how I felt about him, love is a complicated thing and from contemplating my feelings I learned that I had never felt it stronger with anyone else than with him. I know that sounds silly at my age but I’ve lived everywhere and had lots of friendships and feelings for people. 
We are good friends now, and only live a few miles away from each other but I’m moving to a different state which I will be too busy with to visit with him again before I leave, and I may not see him again for a long time. 
He’s coming over next week so we can see each other one last time. We’ll watch Netflix and hang out , talk, probably perform a scene, maybe go on a walk. I still love him and I know he feels the same way. 
I have been considering giving him a secret kiss before he leaves (my first kiss), as a way to sum up my feelings for him and how things would be if we were older, I just don’t know if I should. I wonder if it will just make us both sad because unless we stay in touch we can’t have something like that in the future. 
I want to kiss him because I know I will remember that moment forever. I know it won’t ruin the friendship that we have if we can manage to have that without seeing each other. It will hold a special place in my heart because of how much I love him. I need some helpful advice on this, I know a lot of you will probably have very strong stances on this but leave your emotions towards my thoughts out of it. He is special to me and always will be, give me input from experiences you’ve had, how things turned out for you, how you felt at the time, and how you feel about it now. As for anyone without an experience like this in their memories, just give me your thoughts on it. Thank you, K.",30Mar2018,3

Him: don't worry we gonna meet in real life and talk
Me: do you have something to tell me that you can't say here?

100,"Okay, so this is the second time I've had this happen to me almost step by step, so it feels like an actual thing, so I was hoping maybe you guys might have an idea of what's happening.

So, today I had a woman come into my workplace where we're doing a warehouse sale. She came in and immediately complimented my jacket. I said thank you, and we launched into conversation. She introduced herself by name and asked my name in return pretty much right off the bat, which is sorta weird for a customer to do, but alright. Then she ended up asking me a bunch of random things about my workplace, if I like it, how long I've worked here, what got me to stay here for so long, if I saw myself staying there long term, just a bunch of vaguely personal questions about my workplace experience. I answered, because whatever. She said she just moved here from LA, maybe she's just trying to make friends or something, I don't know. I get a lot of nosey customers, so this wouldn't be a first. 

Now, this whole time, she hasn't looked at a thing in the store. Not even a glance around, which I didn't think was too weird until the end. 

We talk about random stuff, how I'm not doing to school because debt and no future plans and whatnot, again, not too weird, whatever. As we finally get closer to closing time in the store, she says she would love to have my number to ""connect me with awesome contacts she has"". After all that, she says her husband just texted her (pretty sure that's bull, didn't notice her actually checking her phone the whole time we were talking), says it was nice to talk to me, and leaves. Again, no looking at any of the actual product. It was like she came in the store with the intention of talking to whoever worked there. She just got into her car and drove away.

This same thing happened to me last year, just with a different person who either actually had originally intended on looking around and got sidetracked talking to me, or was just better at looking like that was the case. The lady last year and I chatted about pretty much all the same subjects, and she wanted my number so she could hook me up with her connections and meet up for coffee to talk about it. Both ladies where young or youngish, clean cut, normal looking people. I have no idea what either of them actually mean by the whole ""connections"" thing.

102,"Here's my tale - thank you in advance for reading. TLDR at bottom but please read this if u can:

I want to start everything over again. I'm somewhat depressed and perhaps I need therapy, but I know myself and I know I need major career change.

I'm a 35 year old personal trainer. I am not a ""meathead"" in the typical sense. I have a master's in sports science, created my own personal training business with over 25-30 active clientele and been doing this for almost 13 years. I don't make a lot of money, but I'm no slouch either. I've paid off ALL my credit cards, life insurance loan, student loan, car payment, and mortgage on a vacation apartment-property which I lease/AirB&amp;B out to others for side income. I make $50,000 - $75,000 range (gross, before expenses) personal training and only pay rent to my apartment and the fitness gym I train my clients at. I have virtually no savings, stocks/portfolio, or anything like that. All the money I made went into my income rental property (paid off) and credit card debt (paid off), car (paid off), and loans (paid off). I'm finally at a point where any little money that does come in I either pay rent, buy grocery, or save.

But I no longer want to do what I'm doing. I hate fitness. I don't like my job. There are a myriad of variables I hate about the industry. I no longer like ""putting on a fake smile"" and motivating people day and night. I dislike getting up 5am and working both early morning and then going back to work at night for the evening clients that I train. I end up getting home around 9pm (granted, I'm free all day during typical ""work hours"") but I feel I'm missing so much in life from getting home late, sleeping early, and then waking up 5am to put on that fake smile. I don't spend time w/ what's left of my inner circle due to my mixed-schedule vs. their regular 9-to-5 schedule. I'm independent trainer so I don't have any colleague friends nor do I like being with other trainers. Again...I hate the industry now. I miss out on a lot and the only thing I have are the lunch hours when I drive around, workout, hike, or do administrative things for my business (invoices, emails, marketing, website updates, calls, etc.).

As mentioned - I've got roughly 25 active personal training clients - and as an independent trainer that's quite a lot. All of them have pre-paid in various packages (e.g. 10-week plan, 15-week plan, etc, etc.) so I'm committed to serving all these individuals for the next 10, 15, or 20 weeks.

I need help - esp those of you in my industry - in:

1. starting the process of ending/outsourcing/finishing my services with all my clients and not sign up any new ones that call me or inquire about my services. Is this a good idea for those with advice for me?

2. I also need advice in starting the process of finding a new job. And this is the hard part: I have zero experience in anything outside fitness. Zero. My resume is all fitness and a bunch of expired certifications which I've neglected to renew. I look up entry level jobs and I hardly have any experience in what they are asking for. And forget about anything beyond entry level based on my inadequate resume.

I don't want to be in anything related to fitness. Not even teaching fitness at a community college or gym teacher or anything like that. I wanna wear normal pants and have a computer and go to work and drink coffee at an office.....as funny as that sounds. I really want a stable job that doesn't require me marketing myself daily. Or asking people if they wanna sign up. Or putting on a fake smile to ""motivate"" people at 5am. I wanna job that I don't interact much after being in a crazy busy gym atmosphere for 13 years. I just want some peace and quiet and come home by 5pm and enjoy with life and travel without having to worry about getting to bed early, being there to service 25 other people that rely on me being there regularly EVERY WEEK to train them (remember, I can't take vacations much cause of this).

...But most importantly I want a normal paycheck. A regularly scheduled pay where I know I'm getting the same $$$ every 2 weeks rather than trying to cross my fingers on if clients will be re-signing with me or not. Not to mention employee benefits, healthcare, etc and other perks that come from your typical jobs. I got none of this.

If you guys have any advice for me in how to go about transitioning into a new career in the safest way possible it would be much appreciated. I know I need to begin therapy first to unravel all in my brain and/or seek advice for as many people as I can in person from my closer friends. But so far it's been cliche answers and ""you'll figure it out"" or ""you just depressed you'll snap out of it"" stuff.

TLDR: I'm a 35 year old personal trainer who doesn't wanna do this anymore. I'm sick of the industry and want no part of it. I'm tired of marketing myself, trying to hustle and sign clients like a door-to-door salesman, and finally at a point where all my debit is paid off and I can afford starting to save money. I have no savings, but everything in my life is paid off. I am ready for a totally new career because I want steady paycheck, benefits, vacations, etc but am left with ZERO experience in anything outside fitness. My resume stinks and I need advice on how to transition as a 35 yo into a new career without taking on more loans or going back home to live w/ parents while starting school all over again. That would be a nightmare scenario. I want to enjoy life again and feel I've trapped myself in a corner and cannot be happy unless I get a new career &amp; don't even know how to begin this process esp with so many existing clients committed/paid thru for next 10-15 weeks that I'm obligated to be there daily. I need a systematic plan...an exit strategy of sorts in how to transition. Please help. Thank you.",30Mar2018,5
103,"Hey everyone, I know I might get a little backlash about this.. I’m sorry.


I am an on and off smoker of cannabis. The past couple months I tried to quit because I really wanted to find employment. My significant other is a heavy smoker and medicates daily, sometimes I get tempted, other times not. I guess I hemmed and hawed about how badly I wanted to smoke too much, so they just started offering hits to calm me down (I often get panic attacks or bouts of depression) and I accepted. 

I guess after that I smoked maybe about a week and then got a call for an interview. I knew this position drug tested, kind of had my little break down dramatic scene for a lil. My SO was so adamant about how I could just flush it out of my system just by diet and exercise. (We can’t afford those drinks to help you pass drug testing sadly) I guess I was just like sure, ok. 

I have a medical condition that makes it really hard to lose weight, so I guess the reality hit me after just eating broccoli and carrots all day. I know cannabinoids store in fat. My SO has high metabolism, and they only buy junk food. I can buy some stuff because I have foodstamps, but I’m mostly urged to get junk any way. So yeah, I have that foundation of eating very terribly and not being in shape. 

I went to the interview, and literally hours later got a call back that they wanted to hire me. I accepted. 

I am now doubting this decision.. i would have to walk across town to get there, I’m worried my test is going to fail.. they just finished my background check, so now all I have left is the medical tests they have to run. This position pays more than I’ve ever made, and if I had a car and I was clean I would literally be jumping for joy about how lucky I am to be offered this position. 

But I am now realizing I could not handle 8 hour shifts and walking back and forth across town almost every day. The last job I had, I had to do this as well and it was exhausting coming home and having to clean up after my SO, and do all the household chores too.

So I guess I am asking, would it be stupid to go in knowing I will fail a drug test, or possibly just take on too much without having proper transportation? How do I decline this offer professionally? I feel like such an idiot for accepting without fully considering these things. I half expected them not to hire me, and figured I would use the interview to hype me up for another job closer or something..  I know this sounds dumb. I just need a second opinion.",30Mar2018,3
104,"Before I get into the problem itself, I first need to explain a couple of details, mainly for context.
My best friend (let's call him A) and I befriended this cute girl (let's call her B) earlier this school year, and in the time until now the three of us have gotten very close. About three months or so into our union of sorts, I admitted to A that I was developing feelings for B (yes, the romantic kind) and I did this hoping for advice, support, etc. You know, the things that are commonly given and taken between two good buddies, right? Well, I ended up telling him the day before a very important event for him. The next day came and I texted him regarding the said event after it had ended, and he seemed a bit upset. He told me that the event did not go as planned, and I assumed that this was the only reason for his temperament. I was wrong.
Later that night, A and I were talking and he seemed even more depressed than earlier. Our conversation went on for a long time, and by the end he was basically telling me that there's no point in living and that no one would care if he died. This was all obviously not true and I reassured him so but the entire conversation kind of spooked me.
So I did a great deal of thinking and I realized that it may have been what I had said that night before, about liking B and all, that was causing A distress. It was a shot in the dark but it hit its mark, and A admitted it was so when I confronted him over text.
It was at this point the dilemma first poked its head out. At the time, I was more afraid of A possibly being suicidal than losing out on love with B, so I was willing to jump through some hoops to get my best friend back in his usual chipper mood. I told him that I had been kidding, that I wasn't really interested in her, that I was only testing the waters... idk really but it seemed to improve his mood significantly. Turns out that A also had feelings for B, and was afraid to hear that I did too. So yeah I kind of lied about not liking B but it ended up patching up most of A's depressed state.
Fast forward to now, a month before prom. Promposals are happening left and right, and neither A nor I have done anything remotely similar to that haha. Obviously we both have our eyes on B, except that I can't admit that I still do. We have a third best friend (we'll call him C for now) who knows that A is interested in B but not that I am the same and he's been asking me if I could help him get A to man up and prompose to B. Which is sort of the problem.
I still like B, and because I do I can't really see myself going to prom with any other girl. Sure, I can go with some other friend (that's what C suggested to me after I told him that I was gonna stag to prom if I even went at all) but I am not the smoothest fellow and am also not exactly close enough to anyone else to the point where going to prom with them wouldn't be awkward at all.
I really don't want to stag/not go to prom, but it's not like I can just go with the girl I want to go with. I care about A and I really don't want to hurt his feelings, but this is coming at the expense of my own. What should I do?
I came here because I had no one else to talk to about this (I usually go to A or C for advice but I obviously can't do that in this situation) and it's been concerning me a bit too much lately.",30Mar2018,2

112,"Ok, I seriously know someone has hacked my dads computer. However it’s extremely hard to prove. As of this moment.

This story all starts 1 year ago when I was at my dads house alone and looking at porn. Now I look at some pretty strange shit for some (Gilfs, milfs and beyond) #noshame.

Now one day I’m using my dads 27 in Retina display to wack off and after 10 or 15 min in my screen starts to freeze and scroll to the bottom. And I scroll back up. Then it does the same thing the page goes to the bottom and I scroll back up. Then the text box in xhamster starts typing by it self.

SOMEONE WAS LITERALLY TYPING ON MY DADS SCREEN!

“This computer is mine you sick fuck”

Scares the living shit out of me an I close the window instinctively. One because I had my dick in my hand an I panicked that some one around the world could see me shaking hands with the unemployed. (I Still finished)

My dad is 73 years old and a Vietnam war veteran. He’s pretty good with tech but he could easily click on malware. He doesn’t even really understand private browsing (I checked)

I told my brother about it but he was couldn’t stop laughing because the only way I could prove my dads computer has been hacked is to expose my self looking at porn on his desktop... And I’m willing to do that to keep my fathers money/ internet security safe.

If some one is already in your machine. Or you know your being watched how do protect your self from getting your data stolen. (If it has not already been at this point)

I’m willing to repeat the process and get a cell phone video of my dads screen being hacked for proof if need be.

Would a VPN solve this or do I need to call a security expert. I’m worried that some one is going to screw my 73 year old dad over via fraud and I’m going to be left with out and inheritance.

115,"I'm 17, bored and somewhat lonely. I don't want to spend all day typing, but here's a summary of my situation:

Dropped out of Middle School, never returned to school.

I don't ever have money, and if I do it's something small like $10 or $20. I know *how* to make money, but 'It costs money to make money'.

My life consists of: 

Wake up 8-10 hours after whatever time I go to sleep, wake up, Play some video games, smoke some weed, eat some lunch, smoke some more weed, spend a few hours on reddit, smoke some more weed, watch some youtube, netflix, get bored and bounce around the internet for entertainment, smoking more weed doesn't seem to really get me high, just keep me from coming down fully. By this time it's about midnight,
listen to some music, and the cycle goes on.

My life is pretty damn boring, I'm somewhat sure I have ADHD (from the symptoms that made me drop out of school, of which those traits still exist today, to a slightly less extent though.)

If I'm not high enough, i'll abuse xanax, I have it in the first place for (self medicated) anxiety. Mostly for lying to people, it makes it extremely easy. I don't like the idea of being a pill addict, I resist most times but, sometimes it's just tempting.

At this point I don't have a drive to do anything. I probably won't be able to get a job (no high school, or HS equivalent). 

I don't have many friends, basically 3 IRL and about the same online.

I can't envision myself living much past 25 at this rate, I couldn't take another decade of nothingness, I may literally go insane.

If anyone has got any advice for me, sound it off, I'm in a hole and I can't get out.

I'm only writing this because I'm out of weed, I don't want to abuse xanax by itself really.

A new season of a favorite TV show just got released. I'm gonna go get drunk as fuck and watch it.

120,"Hi guys, 
I’m an ex mechanical engineering student. I’m thinking of  switching to manufacturing engineering technology. I was only a semester away from becoming a junior. However, there’s that physicsII professor who has no heart or been through some bullying during his childhood he’s giving some of it now. I failed his PhysicsI class before and was a semester behind for that. 

I was always an A student during high school. I remember getting a full grade on one of my physics final exams. 

I was at good at math too. But I never liked engineering, disliked it actually. Went for mechanical engineering as that what my mom urged me to do. I lover her but I regret the time wasted of my life doing something I don’t like. Yes, I have done little or actually no effort on any year, but that’s who I’m  and it’s hard to change it. 

I have never studied in my life, not a single day have I opened a book to read for the purpose of understanding. I understand whatever the teacher teaches in class and it just sticks to my head and that’s it. That’s how I got my A’s in high school. I know that things are different in college, but I just never liked engineering. 

I swear sometimes it was as if I’m cutting my hand while opening a book to try to study. I tried studying, I just don’t know how people do it. How do people understand something they don’t know by just reading it? Sometimes I just think I have some dyslexia for not understanding anything from books. But then I open and read an aviation book and oh my god I have a feeling of lust. A feeling of wanting to read even more about it. I wanted to be a pilot ever since I was a kid. I have more than 500+ flight hours logged in Microsoft flights simulator and IVAO. I swear to god the only reading and studying I can tolerate is when reading and exploring aviation. Aviation is like my mother I will always love no matter what. 

First year of my mechanical engineering I had countless crying hours thinking that I’m destined to be something I dislike. Watching the mentally ill professors talking to you as you’re their lab rat and trying to socialize with students who are abnormally weird make me question my existence. I’m nothing without aviation. Almost all of my friends talk about their achievements in college for majors they like or excel at and the only thing I share is how good I’m at flying that pmdg B777 aircraft. 

When I was just almost at the tip of being a junior ME student. I was happy, not because yay I will get learn thermodynamics, but because I’m just a step closer from graduating and joining an aviation academy as my mother promised me. But when that professor I hate was the only one teaching physicsII, I knew that this semester will be a turning point for good or bad. 

When I got my scores, I called my mom while crying I’m sorry for letting you down but I can’t take it anymore, this professor is just an obstacle, I just can’t be like the others spending countless hours studying something that I don’t even like but dislike. And it’s not my problem, there’s only 3 students left in his class who haven’t dropped yet. Down from 23 students. I don’t know why does the university still hold him. 

As much as I was happy switching from mechanical to manufacturing, I felt that I was, for the first time, defeated. I felt that I was under a challenge I failed. Or just gave up for something easier. It was like a confession that I’m not a smart kid as I thought, even worse, as my mom thought. 

Her voice telling me okay do whatever you want and if you want to study aviation just have a degree with it was as if she was telling me I’m sorry I thought you’re smart enough to do ME. 
The reason I’m not doing aviation while doing manufacturing is that I won’t be able to balance my time between them. Aviation must and will be my priority and I will fail MET that way. 

I’m really undecided wether I drop physics and take it next semester and lose another full year by doing that or switching to MET and graduate within my scheduled plan and do aviation after that. Put into mind that in both cases I will not use my degree as I hate engineering + I will work as a pilot. 
Thank you all. ",30Mar2018,2

123,"We've recently moved into a rural property. Our neighbours are all generally friendly, helpful people and we have few complaints. But we're city people and I am starting to gather that the culture and etiquette around social visits and unannounced visits is VERY different here.

We live in a small valley and only have a handful of neighbours. We are on 200acres, but our houses are pretty close together. I'm a young woman, pregnant with our first child and I'm often alone at the property while my fella goes away for work. I've already had words with one neighbour, a macho, rarely sober older man, about turning up unannounced when my fella is away. He made me feel uncomfortable in that he'd let himself into the house yard and make for the house instead of coming to the gates and waiting for us to come out like our other neighbours. Luckily he seems to have taken the hint after I said that if he was looking for my husband and his car wasn't on the property, our neighbour could call him on the mobile instead of visiting.

Now I've landed myself in another sticky situation. Right now it's 6:31 and I'm ""resting"" while I can still hear my fella talking to our neighbour on the other side, a lonely young woman farmhand who lives with her employers (our neighbours). She turned up unannounced and uninvited over 3hrs ago. She is very sweet, but she has now done this a few times in the past week. She had offered to lend us her ride-on and so I thought it would be kind to invite her to dinner - the first time she'd visited she'd been eager to stay and talk for hours and I had gathered that she was lonely.

Since that night on Sunday, she has visited on Monday and then Wednesday again. When she left on Wednesday night after we were very clear that she had overstayed her welcome (ie it was time for bed), my fella said to come over on the weekend. Well it's Easter Friday and at 2:30pm she was here again. 

I eventually said I needed a rest - being pregnant I've had trouble with insomnia and was up from 3am - and then wanted to get back to housework. She was obliging, but this was an hour ago. She is still in the yard talking to my fella. I want to start making dinner, but I'm afraid she'll see me and come in to talk.

I should explain that I am friendly and enjoy the unexpected visits when they are infrequent and relatively brief, but I also value my privacy and that's part of why we're here. Since becoming pregnant, I've struggled with mood shifts and teariness and just feeling plain tired from the insomnia, which adds to my desire for privacy.

Our house has no curtains on the south side, where she and my fella are standing and where the kitchen is. I want to start preparing dinner without wondering if she'll come in and end up sticking around to join us. I am tired and just want to have a quiet dinner with my partner, but he is not good at setting boundaries. I even went as far as to say will you come in after I've napped for a while to help with something, but it feels like he hasn't taken the hint that I was calling for back up, either!

We haven't been friendly with this particular neighbour for long and I am starting to get a strong feeling that we need to set boundaries to make sure we get the privacy we want. She has even said that she climbs the ridge and looks to see what we're doing on our property and checks to see if our cars are there. It's not exactly feeling like the private hideaway I was anticipating when we moved.

I know we're probably missing some important country etiquette lessons, being from the city where neighbours are often too private. We like this woman and would like to set boundaries without damaging our new friendship. I'd really appreciate some advice on how to politely set boundaries around unannounced visits, their frequency and length and some friendly ways to enforce these when we find ourselves stuck in lengthy, dull, silence-punctuated and repetitive conversations that have long grown tiring.

Thanks everyone!",30Mar2018,2

129,"I am constantly overheated and I'm convinced that I'm possibly the most disgusting person on the planet. Everyone knows me as that person wearing shorts during winter. I actually moved further north to a cooler city. However, it turns out I am capable of being sweaty and overheated in any city. What a talent.  

For reference, I am 100 lbs and have had these problems my entire life. It's getting hotter out and I'm fucking miserable. 

Some situations: 

1. I have IBS. My biggest trigger is overheating. I can't walk outside in the sun for 15 minutes without the next hour being like I just ate super mega spicy Indian food plus a bowl of laxatives. It's semi-handled by medical professionals, but they can only mitigate the symptoms, rather than prevent me from overheating. 

2. I frequently wake up DRENCHED in sweat. Like, you could ring the blankets out into a bucket and make ramen. 

3. When I hold hands with my boyfriend, we have to wipe our palms off every 10 minutes because my palms are so sweaty. He's cool about it, but it's not ideal.

4. My hair is super extra oily/sweaty. I shower at night, and by the next afternoon people literally ask if my hair is WET. I just tell them yes . . . 

5. I'm sweaty in all the standard places as well. In the morning I put deodorant on my armpits, buttcrack, etc, cover myself in body spray, and then top it off with some strong perfume. You'd think this is all too much, and yet unfortunately, I don't know how else to counter the Sweat TM. 

6. I don't wear makeup because I sweat all of it off and the extra layer makes my face feel disgusting. I've tried ""oil free"" and ""waterproof"" stuff. No luck. 

Help. I am miserable. I will try anything. I just created an amazon wishlist with $500 worth of cooling products for my house (blackout curtains &amp; portable air conditioner &amp; accessories). I will gladly add more. I'm seriously considering Botox to reduce sweating, but where would I even get it? All over my entire body? Please help this hot and sweaty mess. ",30Mar2018,2

I moved to Australia this year and am moving to New Zealand in a month because apparently when your country makes visas harder to get those same people make it difficult for your children to get visas.

143,"So I just found out my father has been seeing prostitues. I was trying to show him something on his phone and a text message came in about sexual offers from some woman and her services she provided, I don't think he knew that I saw the message as by the time I handed it back to him, the notification bar had already scrolled back up.

To put some context into the situation at home, I still live with my parents and am semi-disabled; I have coliacs disease, severe muscle atrophy and massive anxiety issues, and finding this out has pretty much left me shaken and angry, I've locked myself in my room since I found out about an hour ago.

My dad is the sole breadwinner of the house, and my mum is currently going through severe back pain issues and is due for surgery sometime soon, I don't really know how she'd react if I told her what I know, but I can see a big fight happening and I'm scared of that too.

Right now I just want to be as far away from him as possible, ideally I'd like to leave the house and move, but in my current phyisical and mental condition, I don't know if I can, not to mention I'm financially incapable of doing so, and I don't want to leave my mum with him.

I don't really know what I'm looking for here, just any advice on the situation as a whole, how I can help dig myself out of this rut I'm in, if there's any work I could do from home (I can type fast, and I'm fairly good with computers, and I love helping people) so I can save up and maybe find a way to leave this place and have my own place, advice about what I should do with this information I have, do I avoid him now? I feel like I want to.

I live in Brighton in England if that is of any help, I guess right now I just don't want to be anywhere near him, I would go out if I could, but I rarely even leave the house to be honest.

Think I'm going to go lay down for a bit.
",30Mar2018,5
144,"Obviously I don't mean meet them and straight away be in a relationship, but I mean how do you go down that path instead of a path to become friends? Just a little before some of my examples, I am a guy, I am 17 years old, senior year of highschool, had one girlfriend, whom even that doesn't really count(will explain in a second), do not make almost any physical contact with people, and never kissed or anything like that.

* A first example would be with my first and only ""girlfriend"", a year or two ago, while out with friends we met a couple of girls, and one of the girls and I really hit it off, I mean talked a ton, and really just didn't need to even think about anything, we just naturally easily hit it off, we later that week texted a lot, met once again alone, and continued to text a lot for a couple of weeks, and meet a lot(mostly with more friends too, but also a couple of times alone), now after a month or so she straight up asked me(on text :I) If I was interested in her, I mean she said that it was obvious I was interested, and that I am not actually interested, I just has a small crush on her that would pass, anyway things got a little serious we talked about it, I told her I am not sure, I never did anything like that etc, and asked her if she would be interested. She said she didn't really have the same feelings for me and would think about it, and after thinking about it for a while she told me we can be in a relationship, but she doesn't want to take things fast, and she doesn't want us to tell anyone yet. I was fine with that, and actually pretty happy since I never was in a relationship so taking it slow was good. we were together for about a month and half, a couple of days before we broke up went camping in the beach with friends, where we basically smuggled together in our sleep(wouldn't call it spooning just hugging in sleep and stuff), but nothing more(not that I mind), although a few days later she did start apologizing about it saying it was too much and stuff. By then we still hadn't done anything, and almost never had any physical contact when we met(not talking about kissing, talking about hugging/holding hands etc, but as I said, I am not a very physical person, just explaining), and by then I also started losing interest in her, since she was not showing a lot of interest and I felt like I was the only one trying to initiate conversations/meeting up, so I asked her if she still feels the same way, and she told me in a nice way that she is sorry, but she still doesn't really have feelings for me and doesn't think we should stay together. This is why I said It doesn't really count. Not cause of not doing anything, but because it was just one sided, as if it was a ""favor"".

* Another example a year and half ago a friend of mine bought some of his girlfriends friends into our group of friends, and we hit it off nicely, me and one of the girls talked a lot and became good friends, and after a couple of months she was probably the person I trusted the most, a real friend I could have conversations with and stuff like that, it was nice. On the other hand another friend of mine who met her when I did became her boyfriend after a couple of weeks(which kinda sucked cause when they split we kinda drifted apart), anyway, I don't know what separates the two ""paths"" of going to become friends, or going towards a relationship.

* One more example is more recent, about 2 months ago or so a friend of mine had his friend(girl) ask to find someone for her friend to meet(for a relationship) since she asked her, anyway he gave me her number and we hit it off a little, decided to go on a date, then she got shy and decided we will go the 4 of us for the first time we meet, we met and talked a lot, had a nice time and continued to text after that, and she wanted to meet alone, and met again a week~ later alone, we didn't really have and ideas so just went to a park and talked, had a nice time again, then after a couple of days she was talking less, and when trying to meet up for a third time it was really hard to come up with a date for us to meet(She said she wanted, but every date I offered she couldn't meet, and didn't counteroffer, so it ended up being me shooting one day after another(sunday?, monday? etc) In the end I just told her to tell me when she finds a suitable time, and after a day or so I decided to ask her what she thinks, since we already met a couple of times, and I already felt that its not gonna go anywere so asked her to be honest since I don't want to feel like I am being a nuisance and such, and she said that she feels like were going down a path to be friends, and are not really suitable to be together since If I knew her better I would know she isn't the right type for me(In my perspective was just a nice way to say she doesn't want us to be together), but still wants to hang out, and we still set a date for us to see a movie and such. Now I didn't mind it, I am not looking to just get a girlfriend, I want someone that actually wants it, and someone that I will enjoy being with.

**Anyway**, Those are just my examples, and one common thing between the first and third example is that I was almost always the one trying to talk, trying to meet up, it felt as if I am the only one trying to keep some sort of communication going on between us, which really made me feel pretty sad tbh. All of them together got me wondering, ""What If I am approaching it wrong?"" I mean friends and people who are together act differently, They do give off a different vibe, and I got wondering about how do I go down that path, rather than just be a nice friend like I would be with a guy I just met? Or even more simply, Do I need to act differently than If I would meet a new guy and act nicely to him and get friendly with him? And If I do act differently then how do I get something ""Real"" I mean get someone who actually likes you, someone who can listen and you can talk to, but also offer help to you, someone who just enjoys being with you, someone you don't need to be on guard with, or be embarrassed with.

**TL;DR** Never had a real relationship, and am not very physical with people, and don't hang out with girls much. But when I meet a new girl and feel like I want to try be in a relationship with her it ends up that I give off a friendly vibe rather than a ""boyfriend"" vibe, how do I give a ""boyfriend"" vibe without treating her as a lesser and making her ""earn"" it as I see most people my age do...?

145,"Because the internet is saturated with questions about how to get *actual* weed smell out of clothes, I haven’t yet found a solution to this problem. 

 I have a nice jacket (100% wool according to the label) that I wear for job interviews. Recently, there has been an incredibly strong weed-like smell in my flat, friends visiting keep commenting on it, and I’ve quickly figured out that it’s the jacket! I don’t know what’s causing it, there is nothing in the pockets (not that I’d carry anything that remotely smells like weed) and I’ve worn it very rarely outside so I don’t think it could have soaked in the smell of weed from anywhere.

The girl that I liked the most was my neighbor. I introduced myself, got rejected at first, but then she started approaching me. Over the next weeks we flirted, turns out she broke up with her boyfriend. I made a crochet star for her since I really felt something. 

Finally asked her out she said next time and got her number, we texted a bit but she haven't replied since. Texted her 3 times but she haven't replied. I think I fucked it up by looking like a needy man. I haven't seen her since.

157,"I'm 17. Since I'd say about middleschool I have been randomly getting super light headed randomly, sometimes just walking, sometimes stretching, sometimes standing up, and sometimes just sitting down. 

Well it's been something I've been dealing with on my own, haven't really told anyone, and the thing is.. I get so light headed so quickly that I temporarily can't function. I usually do a semi-controlled fall when it happens if I'm standing up. I'm. I'm gonna be honest I got quite accustomed to the feeling and I kinda like it, it makes me feel very different and not necessarily in a bad way. My vision gets very dark and hazy while it's happening and I kinda just roll with it. 

However today I was visiting a relative in the hospital and as I was leaving I got that feeling. I felt like hey I feel like I don't have to fall over on this one Ima just act normal and let it pass. 

Next thing I know is I'm in the floor feeling as if I am waking up after a long night of sleep, with nurses surrounding me and looking worried. I just moved to turkey so I couldn't understand what they were saying but I quickly stood up and said ""don't worry I'm fine."" But I'm going to be honest losing total consciousness for the first time scared me pretty bad. 

Apparently I just fell straight down and hit my head and hurt my knee when I fell over it. It's not like a serious hurt my face was just red and I wasn't looking straight when I stood up. I don't remember falling and I had no idea that I was out for around 15 seconds.

160,"So the local newspaper just ran a really nice article about me because of good I'm trying to do in the community.  Someone posted in the comments section that the newspaper shouldn't have written the article, because I have a reputation of harassing women and being ""overly aggressive"" when dating.

The newspaper deleted the comments because they violated the policy (I didn't ask them to), but someone else reposted something else along the same lines. There have been 3 comments posted so far from different accounts (could be all the same person but I have no way of knowing, they were all brand new anonymous accounts).

So here's the thing -- I really have no idea what they're talking about. I've been on a lot of dates, it wouldn't surprise me if someone had a bad experience with me, though I always try to be very respectful (I never open with inappropriate comments, never send any sort of pictures, if a woman indicates she isn't interested, I back off quickly, etc.) So, if I *did* do something bad, I'd like to know about it so I can apologize and try to do better in the future. Also, I believe that if a woman makes an accusation against a man, the default should be to believe her, but in this instance I honestly don't know what I did, or that I had this reputation.

Also, there's this article out there about me that's really nice, followed by these comments saying I'm really shitty, and that feels really shitty.

So far people have told me to ignore it, that anything I say will make it worse and draw more attention to it. That's probably true, but it sucks that one or more people are trying to smear me -- I've always tried to do good and I've always valued having a reputation as an honest person who tried to do the right thing. So should I just continue to do nothing? And if so, how to cope with these shitty feelings?

161,"Me and my female friend (let’s call her Taylor) have been friends since high school. We’ve always been close and have never moved beyond just being friends. 

A few months ago, she confessed that she had been starting to develop feelings for me but I told her that I’m sorry but I don’t feel the same way about her but that I hope we can still be close friends. 

She agreed but said that she needed some time to herself to process her feelings. I agreed and left her alone and eventually she said that she was ready to try and be friends again and we slowly got back to where we were. 

Flash forward to last weekend and me, her and a bunch of other friends all ended up getting pretty drunk. Nothing unusual, we usually all get together a few weekends a month. 

Throughout the night I was continually pacing myself as I didn’t want to get too drunk too fast. At one point, I noticed that I was a lot more drunk than I meant to and I was basically tripping and falling over. 

Taylor offered to take me home and I agreed as I knew I needed to go home at this point. We ended up getting a cab to my place. 

She laid me down in bed finally and immediately got on top of me. I was too tired (I had worked late the night before) and drunk to realize what was going on. Before I knew it she was giving me a blowjob (and other things? But idk I don’t remember it all) and she was having sex with me before I could react. 

I think I passed out pretty soon and when I woke up I immediately felt weird and remember bits and pieces of the night before. I left her in bed and went to sit in the living room. She came out an hour later and said bye and all I said was a cold goodbye. 

She texted me the next day asking me what was wrong and I told her nothing. But honestly I feel taken advantage of but I’m not sure what to do about it. She has always been my best friend but I don’t know what to do anymore.

As an individual who cares about my personal information, infringements upon it, and who may be benefitting from it, is deleting my account the only possibility for protecting myself?

Perhaps the removal of Facebook and messenger from my phone would be sufficient, leaving my account intact but only accessible through a pc? Or does this allow for other privacy violations?

Except for all the corporate nonsense.  As with most companies nowadays, there is a lot of frivolous bullshit that comes down from the main office that is really hard to swallow.   I can give examples, but the examples are really just anecdotal, with the reality being that the bullshit policies are mostly just crap the higher ups institute so they can look like they are doing their jobs and don't have much, if any, positive impact on performance.

Fair warning: I'm using mobile so the format might suck and it might be a little messy in terms of grammar. 

Okay, to give you guys some context. I had to do an interview assignment for my speech class. So I decided to ask one of my professors if I can Interview them. He agreed and asked if we can go to a restaurant to conduct the interview. I didn't really think much of it at the time mostly because I figured this happens to most professors when students ask for help for an assignment or whatever the case may be. However, I've been thinking this whole thing through and I realized that I don't know if this is appropriate or not. I feel like it would be different if I was a male graduate/undergrad student but I'm a female undergrad student. Don't get me wrong, his a pretty stand up guy and I don't think he would ever hurt me or any other student quite frankly! 

During the interview, he was very kind and respectful and never made any advances towards me throughout the interview. I just want to make sure that conducting this interview in general and meeting in a restaurant alone is appropriate or not. 

Given the circumstances, I would think it is appropriate but I would like to get a second opinion. 

Thanks!

187,"(PRE NOTE: I have not been in a relationship in 2 years and I am awkward and struggle with self esteem issues and moderate depression. I am focusing a lot on school and I am an ultra introvert. Only saying this so there is a bit of context to my side)

Recently my closest friend became my boyfriend. We have been close friends for 3 years now and he confessed he liked me. There is no way I would friendzone a guy like him because he is always there for me and he puts up with my drama. 

 Here is my little issue, he only said he liked me after we had a conversation about things we would want to try in a relationship (Sexual things) but we were only having an awkward little conversation about it so it wasnt so deep. This was about a week prior to him confessing. 

  Anyway, he was all lovey-dovey the first day after we were official, and it was nice. It was kind of weird at first bc he was my close friend but I got used to it quick. 

The second day he didn’t talk to me until night time for some reason and when we did talk, it was only sexual stuff. I was uncomfortable just going right into talking about things like that but I went with it because I didnt want to let him down. I didn’t fake anything though, as in I didn’t pretend to enjoy it and I hoped he got the hint. He didnt.

 The next day was the same as the last, not alot of contact but he is just oh-so poetic at night. That night I told him I was uncomfortable talking about things like that already (3 days into the relationship). He said he would stop, and he did for 2 days. We just talked like normal people except with hearts. 
  
 After those 2 days was over he just want back to being dirty at night (only talking about it over snapchat or text messages). He knows what I am into and it is not the same thing as his, but I chime in to the conversation about my things occasionally, and I try to make it clear that I am not comfortable. 

  I get that he likes to talk about stuff like that but it’s real upsetting that he only wants to talk about things like that every night. And our friendship is kind if a void now because talking to him isnt really the same as before. There is no romance or the same care and love he had when we were just friends. I am always anxious and afraid that I will make a wrong move and make things awkward between us. 

  We have only been a thing for a week and a half now. I don’t want break up with him because I will lose a close friend, and I don’t know how he will handle it. (He gets mad alot and he shuts people out really easily..) I really don’t like where we are going and I have already told him once that I don’t like having only the dirty side of the relationship to be so bold. I am uncomfortable and don’t know what to do. I don’t know if this is normal in a relationship either and if I am the weird one.

He raised me since infancy and I was always really close to him, I really loved him. But as he became more involved with drugs he seemed to act more inappropriately to me. It culminated in him basically coming on to me when my mother wasn't around. I don't really have any words to express how deeply this traumatized me, because to me he is my dad. I stopped talking to him and he moved away. I didn't realize it then, but my personality completely changed (for the worse) and over the next few years I semi-repressed all the memories of him being inappropriate. I have a lot of issues from this whole part of my life that I have spent years trying to understand and get over. I finally am feeling like I've come to terms with everything, and out of the blue, my mom (who I never told any of this) tells me she has been in contact with him and he is in the hospital very sick-- like probably going to die in the next few weeks.

I don't think he ever would have acted that way if he were in his right mind, and I might never have another chance to have closure. But I'm also afraid I'm going to re-traumatize myself, or that it will go badly, or somehow my mom will find out, which I know would devastate her.

Her parents, on the other hand, are super catholic people, 100% sure that their way is the ‘correct’ way, whatever that is. 

I have my own strong convictions too, but I have been finding them along the way, learning about different ways of thinking and different ideologies. And I have a really hard time pretending otherwise.

Me and my gf want to start a life together, so we moved in together. But when we came to tell her parents, well, I guess we got the reaction we were expecting, and she briefly got kicked out of the family. I say briefly because she and I talked it over, and decided that her breaking up with her parents was not worth it, so we would lie, pretend, ask for forgiveness and do this ‘the right way’, whatever that is.

So, bottom line, I love my gf and we will be marrying soon (If we did it our way, it wouldn’t be a catholic marriage, but...), and I don’t want to have her decide between me and her parents.

218,"I'd just gotten her almost completely out of my head when out of the blue she asks me to be her friend.

I'm 19 years old now, we were together in HS and from what I remember I made many many mistakes. I was vain and emotionally closed off occasionally, but we got along well enough to where my flaws didn't really affect her that much. She was my first real relationship and I lost my virginity to her, while she lost her virginity to me (a long, honestly pretty funny story surrounding that even; don't mind sharing in the comments if people are interested) but near the end of my senior year I broke up with her for selfish reasons; I wanted to meet other people but I never told her it was a break, it seemed more final than that. I made the mistake of feeling secure enough to where I may be able to come back to her if nothing worked out. Well obviously i didn't do that and she started dating someone else, someone that I've known for a long time. At first I was fine with it but my anger/jealousy came in waves I didn't intend on undermining their relationship at any point but i won't lie I thought about it a few times, I even went on a trip with some friends and invited them to come along. We rented an air bnb and I won't get into details but I'll say that I heard some shit in the middle of the night before I told everyone to stop talking, her new bf was crying in the bathroom and throwing up (we were all pretty plastered) and I couldn't help but over hear it in the small house through the walls. He was crying about feeling like less of a man because he'd thrown up, at least that's what I got out of it seemed to me like he had emotional issues that I've never had. My ex has a comforting spirit and she was there the entire time helping him through it, this was the first moment that I couldn't help but wish she was still mine, it made me realize that I may have made a pretty massive mistake, it was like all of the good times came rushing back to me.

Flash forward to now and we talk occasionally, I'm still single, nothing more than one night stands have happened to me since. I invite her over to my place to hang out, ( it may sound weird but it was more of a friendly gesture) she doesn't have many close friends and I was willing to try and create a situation where she could talk to me about her problems and I could finally get some emotional support from a female that I know well. We stay up literally all night laughing and having deep conversations, this was the moment I started to miss her again and she mentioned flaws in her relationship giving me the idea in my head that maybe she'd come back to me, I don't ever learn apparently. So two days later we're texting and she just told me that she wishes I was a girl and that we never dated so that we could be friends without any roadblocks. This hurt me guys, I told her that i'm not interested in disregarding a time of my life that was special to me so that she can have a close friend who's not her boyfriend. What should I do, I know I should probably leave for my sake and stop talking to her altogether but I still care about her and I know me being around is something she enjoys and maybe even needs in order to keep her on track. She used to tell me about all of the places that she wanted to go and the stuff that she wanted to do, but now she's disregarding a good portion of her education and freedom in order to become what seems like a stay at home wife for her bf I can't help but feel that his background can only equal a situation where he grooms her for that purpose. I feel like brain drugs (dopamine) have got her in a stranglehold and I've been nothing but supportive (the last thing I want is to become completely bitter and completely cut ties with her) of her relationship. But it's really hard when you still have feelings for someone and they're completely invested elsewhere. I never should have invited her over. I've been depressed before for this reason and I'm afraid that it will come back if I don't act fast.

220,"My situation is complicated, so I’m going to try and lay out the pros/cons as objectively as I can. All costs have been converted to USD for simplicity.


Tl;dr: logic says one thing, heart says another. Advice?


I recently got a job offer in another country. The job pays well and has pretty good benefits (paid leave, paid sick leave, health insurance, etc). I speak the language fluently and I have several years of experience living there already. On paper, this is one of the better jobs I could have. It isn’t what I want to be doing with my life, but it could be a stepping stone to something better down the line.


However, I will go into debt to make this work. This job is not paying for my relocation expenses, which are quite high. Between flight cost ($1500), apartment lease fees (usually at least $2000 upfront in this country, plus first month’s rent), and basic needs/commuting expenses (around $500) until my first paycheck, I’ll be somewhat deep. Worse, because my visa paperwork was delayed, I’ll be coming in mid pay period and my first paycheck will be half or less of a typical paycheck. This country has monthly pay periods with a several week delay, so I likely wouldn’t see my first full paycheck until late June for a mid-April start. There’s also a wedding in August that I feel obligated to attend because I was asked to be a bridesmaid, but I’ll still be in substantial debt and flying home will be another high expense…but this is a minor detail in the grand scheme of things.


I’m also in a long distance, international relationship. My partner and I have different nationalities. We had talked about trying to figure out how to live together, but my partner worries it would be a burden on me as he cannot relocate until September 2020. We have two languages in common, but I don’t know the language of this specific country. I’ve only been there once for three weeks. I likely wouldn’t be able to find a full time job, so while I’m positive I can find supplementary income, I probably wouldn’t be able to live on my own (and therefore I’d be somewhat dependent on him). 


If I were to accept the job in the other country, I would basically be committing to at least 2.5 years apart from my partner. He thinks I should do it because it’s the best choice for me as an individual, but I’m not sure it’s the best decision for us as a couple. The time difference would make things even harder on us. Currently we have overlap in our days when we’re both not working, but the new time difference would swap things to where my entire day would be when he’s sleeping or at work. Visiting each other would be even more expensive than it already is (currently $300-$600 for a round trip ticket, going to go up to $800-$1200 for a ticket). Even with both of our leave programs, we’d only be able to see each other for a few weeks out of the year due to the cost. The other issue is visas – it is incredibly unlikely for me to be able to get a work visa to his country because his is part of the EU and mine is not...and as someone who currently does freelance work, I find it incredibly unlikely that an application would be approved. The easiest visa to get would be a spouse visa, but we’re not sure if we’re ready for that level of commitment.


I feel lost because while this job offer I have is great, it’s not what I want to do and I’d be giving up a lot in terms of my relationship. But I can’t stay where I’m at – I live with my father and unfortunately, his girlfriend makes it psychologically taxing to live at home. I do not make enough working freelance to live entirely on my own either. Honestly, I'd prefer to just say screw it and live with my partner until he finishes his current position, but I have the impression he doesn't feel the same. If we had been able to figure out a way to live together where I could stand completely on my own, he'd be on board without question, but I don't think he wants to get married to do it. But we haven't actually talked about it directly either. 


I think I hit all the major points, but I can summarize them below:


Job Offer
- Good benefits, good pay
- Involves debt to get started
- Committing to 2.5 years of relationship stress

Living with partner
- Basically have to get married to make it legally feasible
- Don’t know the language
- Can find plenty of freelance/temp work

Current Position:
- Rough situation at home
- Already living apart


Thanks for any advice you can give.

221,"My best friend does a lot of drugs, at times to an extreme I think. I’m a sophomore and he’s a junior, although we are the same age since they recently moved here from CT which had a different age cutoff. Actually, I’m about a week older. 

Anyway, most kids are pretty crazy here when it comes to drugs, like him. He drinks, juuls, smokes, has a dab pen, and even once took acid like it was no big deal! I have not done any of those things, except I was drinking at a party for the first time last weekend, which I had a lot of fun at. but when we were talking about it, he was said that I shouldn’t be drinking, because it’s dangerous. Mind you, I was being very careful and didn’t get sloppy, yet he was criticizing me for it. HOWEVER about a week ago he went out and was throwing up from alcohol poisoning for hours. 

He is for some reason really annoyed that I drink at times and it’s so weird. I made a joke about my giant water bottle being vodka and he told me to “NEVER drink alone” as if I had no idea what was good for me. I said that no way I would never drink that much, or alone, but he was super sassy and replied “well, you’re always talking about how you want to get sooooo drunk... so whatever.” 

Our mutual friend also told me that he was texting her, saying that I only drink so that I seem “cool” and I’m just trying to get popular, which is not at all true.

He’s being super hypocritical, and thinks that I’m uneducated and don’t know what I’m doing, yet goes to the extremes himself. It’s really annoying me and I don’t know what he’s acting like this or what to do, or how to respond him.",30Mar2018,2

224,"over the past 3-4 months i’ve developed a strange aversion to spending time with someone who is supposed to be my best friend. whenever she asks to hang out i’ve blown her off, and if i try to force myself to hang out with her i just feel really anxious and impatient, like i can’t wait for it to be over. 

she hasn’t *done* anything differently to account for my change in attitude, though i do feel like i’m noticing things about her that i’ve always known about and no longer like. for example, she lies a lot. she lies to other friends, her parents, and me. she lies to me about small things that don’t even need to be lied about. and she’s lonely because she’s losing friends but i know that’s only happening because she continues to be dishonest and take advantage of people. 

whenever we hang out, we end up doing what she wants and that only. i find myself catering to her whenever we’re together, and in the past i was okay with it, but now i’m not. i’ve come to realize the only thing we do nowadays is smoke weed, and i hate it. i hate the smell and the paranoia and i hate that it seems like we don’t know how to talk to each other without weed. i hate it. 

i’ve begun to branch out and i have two really close friends i see everyday, and i appreciate them even more because we always have such a great time without the aid of weed. i’m starting to feel like i’m growing away from my best friend. 

it’s gotten to the point where i feel no emotional connection to her at all, i’ve become completely apathetic, and the only reason it’s bothering me so much is because i know it’s one sided. she truly loves me a lot, she always has. i just can’t be down with it the way i used to. every friendship has its flaws, i know. but as i said, her decisions/condescension toward others are what’s caused previous friendships to deteriorate, and the consistent lying is so trite i can’t listen to it anymore. i feel like i’m always doing what she wants, because *she* wants this that or the other thing, and i don’t think i want anything to do with her at this point.

225,"Sorry for the long post. 
TL;DR: My supervisor thinks I'm racist. How should I handle this? Should I ignore this issue?

My supervisor at work will sometimes make jokes to me about being racist. I grew up in California, and in the environment I grew up in, I never really experienced anything blatantly discriminatory or anything, I was just brought up to have respect for anyone, any age, gender, race, etc. I honestly think California is the safest place to be in terms of culture/gender/what have you. My supervisor, on the other hand, was brought up in the south, where the culture there talks about races constantly, and there's an obvious undertone of black vs. white in any social issue. I'm not from there, but from what I've gathered (correct me if I'm wrong), people in the south were born and raised with this mentality. 

My supervisor will sometimes make jokes to me about vastly preferring white people or wanting to exclude black people. My sexual/dating preference leans toward white guys although I am not closed off to other races. I myself am not white, I have brown skin (southeast Asian).

He follows me on twitter, and with the new twitter interface, you can see who others follow and what tweets they like. I follow a few alt-right youtubers, and I think he has seen that on my twitter and gathered that I'm racist because of that. The people whose media I listen to for the most part are centrist, and I would identify politically as being somewhere in the middle as well. I believe in morals from both left-wing and right-wing sides.

He called me racist today as a joke, but I honestly cringed and think he truly believes that about me. There are other instances aside from this one I've experienced that leads me to believe he thinks I'm racist.

For the most part, when he makes those jokes about me being racist, I just laugh at him because I know it's not true, but I always cringe and can't help but feel like I need to prove to him that I'm not. I don't think there's any way I could actually prove this to him, as I believe the mentality he has is, ""you're either for us or against us"".

Should I just brush these off and continue to ignore his cringe-worthy jokes? The way I see it, if we all just treated humans with respect and forget that skin color exists, racism wouldn't be an issue.",30Mar2018,1

230,"I don't believe this post breaks any rules, but I'm just asking here for some quick answers as I couldn't find an appropriate subreddit I'd get quick replies on.

I know it might come as a stupid question to some, but I'm genuinely curious. Normally we're good at tossing stuff out when it expires just to be safe, but we noticed a totally unopened tub of sour cream in our fridge that expired back in October. So it's nearly 6 months expired, and upon opening it I expected it to smell and look awful, but it actually looked 110% okay. No funky smells, as it smelled identical to the fresh tub we got today. I mixed it around and it had the same texture and consistency, no visible signs of mold, not even in little specks. Put a tiny dot on my finger and gave it a quick taste and the taste was also identical to the new one we just opened.

I'm use to things like yogurt going visibly bad after just a week after expiration, but I'm curious why something as prone to mold as sour cream by all means appears to be totally fine for consumption 6 months after the expiry date. We're more than likely going to toss it, but would it really be safe to consume in full at this point considering all this?",30Mar2018,3
231,"Hello, I am a mid-20s, disabled college student struggling with a prostitute/escort addiction. I have a form of muscular dystrophy and have never walked. I am now on my last year of uni in a STEM field where I hope I can earn financial independence, as I currently rely one hundred percent on family for my daily life needs.

I live in a US border-town with Mexico. I have been seeing Mexican sex-workers since I was 19. I have never been in a real relationship nor have I had sex with a ""normal""(I don't like that word but nothing else comes to mind) woman. 

At first I justified my actions as fulfilling a bodily need, and it was easy to divorce my emotion from it all. As the years went on, that became increasingly difficult. I think my issue is that I am starved of intimacy and love, and I am seeking to fill that void by seeing prostitutes. I truly believe at times that someone in my position will never find real love or companionship. I only have one true friend that treats/sees me as an equal peer. I feel like everyone else I encounter looks down on me because of my disability. Peers speak to me with a patronizing tone or don't even acknowledge my presence. The escorts I see have this sympathetic/understanding attitude as to why I need to see them. Even my father, who lives in Mexico and takes me to see the escorts, believes that seeing prostitutes is my only option and has almost a sense of pride about it. He to has a problem with prostitutes but that's a whole different story. I just feel like society is against me.

I am just starting to despise the person I am becoming. Most of my time is dedicated to either planning trips down to Mexico, or browsing prostitute forums. I used to be a pretty optimistic dude despite my obstacles but now I just feel worn down. 

I know I need to get help, but I don't know where to begin. Whether I should consider SAA (which I have horrible social anxiety even thinking about) or start with a psychologist? How do I even address these issues with a therapist? I honestly don't know if I ever will stop seeing prostitutes. Writing this alone has lifted a bit of weight off my shoulders. I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to proceed. ",30Mar2018,4

235,"So I am moving out of the house I've lived in for the past two something years, which is bittersweet but needed to happen. I am in a curious predicament because my soon to be former roommate has asked me to assist in the hiring of a cleaning company and I feel hesitant to do so.

A few months ago, our landlord was doing some tiling in our shoebox of a kitchen and I was instructed to remove all things from the counter. I (stupidly) put a plastic cutting board in what I have learned is a warming tray in the bottom of the oven. (When I was a kid our stove used this for storage). I'm sure you can see where this is going, but my roommate and her friend cooked a pizza a few days later and the oven caught fire and had to be replaced. When they inspected the interior of the original oven and found the charred remains of the cutting board all fingers pointed to me. My landlord replaced the stove and informed us she would just take the 800$ deposit to cover the cost. Fine.

Obviously my roommate was unhappy and asked me to pay her the 400$ deposit she lost in the ordeal. So I essentially just paid 800$ in deposit money which is a really big chunk of change for me. The question now is, should I pay for a cleaning service to come to the house when the deposit has been wiped out and I feel like I have burdened a little too much responsibility in the loss of the deposit?",30Mar2018,1
236,"**tldr; Moved to a new apartment, been sick for 5 months, I think there's mold, landlord won't do anything.**

I moved into a new place in Baltimore City during the last week of October. Two weeks later I get sick. Then sick again. And again. I'm now coming up on 5 months, and 7 colds. The time in between the colds, I still don't feel all that great (stuffy nose, sinus pressure).

There have been two times in my life where I was chronically sick like this:

1. When I developed an allergy to my pet rats. I had them for a year. 6 months in I started getting sick. I was sick almost 24/7. Took me 6 months to realize it was them.  

2. When I unknowingly lived with a trash hoarder. I lived on the first floor, and he was upstairs. he kept his door closed and locked all the time. When I finally saw it, trash was piled up 3+ feet high, bottles full of piss, etc. Once we cleaned the room up, there was mold and stuff on the floor. This house had Central Air, and I was sick roughly once a month, sometimes more. I lived in that house for another 2 years or so, and only got sick once. 
 
So around the 2nd cold, I told my landlord. I told her that hopefully this was just bad luck from moving etc, but I'd let he know if I got sick again. Cold #3 rolled around, and I told her all of this, and that my best guess was that there was mold in the house. She said no other tenants ever had any issues, and there was no way to search for anything, especially if she didn't know what I was allergic to? So I said fine, and that I'd try to get in to see an allergist. 

Well because of my health insurance, I can either see someone in network or pay 100% out of pocket, and the in network docs couldn't see me until June. I made an appointment anyway just to have it. I told my landlord, and she pretty much shrugged. I eventually noticed an area in the ceiling of my room that looked like it had water damage and some discoloration, as well as  big crack running through it. I showed her in person, and she finally agreed to have a roofer come out to take a look. 

About a month later (or more, my memory is fuzzy) the roofer finally comes out. He looks at the ceiling and goes ""Yea that definitely looks like water damage, and yea, there could be mold up there"" I was ecstatic. I thought finally this would all get sorted out. He said he had to talk to my landlord to see how she wants to move forward. Almost 2 weeks later, and nothing. I ask my landlord, and she said the roofer didn't see any evidence of mold, so she won't be doing anything. 

Also, someone happened to cancel their allergy appointment, so I got in early. The only thing I'm allergic to is rats, which I knew. The doc said that just cause I'm not allergic to mold, doesn't mean it isn't making me sick.  I haven't told this to my landlord yet.

I'm not sure how to move forward with this. I'm 100% certain that there is something in this house that is making me sick, but I don't know how to get my landlord to actually do anything. If this doesn't get fixed, then I can't stay here. But I don't know how to get out of my lease.

I saw that you can get home mold testing kits for $7 at homedepot. But they charge another $40 to send in the sample and have it tested. And since there's no visible mold, I'd have to do an air test. And an air test reacquires two tests, one for the air inside, and one for outside. And I really don't have $100 to throw at this.

Cleaning the walls with a vinegar solution, and then re-painting with special paint is also an option, but Very costly. 

My parents did buy me a really nice air purifier for my b-day cause of this, which is right next to my bed. 

The house is very old, and hasn't been updated in a long time. There's no central air, just baseboard heaters. I have the entire top floor to myself. There's two apartments downstairs with a 3-4 people. Anytime the cook, smoke cigs, or pot I smell it in my house.  One of the tenants downstairs, that isn't on the lease said they have mold in the bathroom, but asked me not to say anything out of respect for his roommate that is on the lease. 

Side note, I don't have the best relationship with my landlord at this point. I had been having serious issues with the hot water in the shower too. It would completely run out in under 10 minutes. She sent her plumber out, I explained what was happening. He told me I should shower earlier (since there's 3-4 other people who live in the 1st floor apartments). To which I said that that isn't something that can be asked of me. I should be able to shower whenever and expect hot water. It would be different if I signed the lease with the knowledge that the hot water tank can't support that many people and we'd need to have shower schedules. Also, I'm unemployed right now, and don't shower early in the AM when everyone else does, so that doesn't seem like the issue. So the plumber said the only solution would be for my landlord to install another water heater. When I circled back around to my landlord about this, she said I need to stop all these false-alarms, that they're costing her money. She said she had just put that new water heater in and no one else had said there were any issues until me. And that she wouldn't be doing anything about it. So I gave up on her, and I ended up solving the problem on my own. The shower head that came with the apartment had extremely high water pressure. I thought that might be why it was running out of the water so fast. I put a new shower head on, and boom, problem fixed. I told her about it and she just said ""ok""

237,"Yeah. So my problem is that I have bad social anxiety, so I often avoid taking to attractive women because of nervousness. Sometimes when I try to talk, I freeze up and it goes nowhere. But there have been a couple times, where I got over my anxiety in the beginning, and things went well.

One time I started talking to a random girl. I was a little anxious at first. But I calmed down after 10 minutes, I was relaxed, and I started talking about whatever came to mind. And she laughed genuinely, she made direct eye contact, and we had flirty banter for like an hour. She said she appreciated my creativity, and I got her number.

Another time I talked to another girl, and the same thing: I was nervous at first. But then I got over it, and we had this amazing banter/conversation for 4 whole hours continuously! And she was laughing the whole time, and was acting flirty and interested. We had this rapport. She said I'm smart/funny and even gave me a nickname about how I'm apparently clever.

In 2016, i graduated as an Electrical Engineer from my homeland Pakistan. Shortly after, got infected by drug induced hepatitis (wrong diagnosis lead to wrong drugs which lead to Drug Induced Hepatitis ). Afterwards, when i got healthy, my uncle sponsored me a visa for engineer in Saudi Arabia. That was in 2016, and i was 22. Since then, i have been to countless hurdles for getting into kingdom. After finally getting into Saudi Arabia in November 2017, after year and a half of struggle of getting the documents right to waiting endlessly for visa to problem this to problem that, i started to officially get myself registered as an engineer here in saudia. To my luck, things didnt go well here either. The engineering council rejected my application here, at first, got my 3 months visa expired, the Local who sponsored (my uncle bought the visa from a local) coulnt get my work permit because he was already in RED Category and i am living in a foreign land illegally, on hope of my relatives that i will get the work permit eventually. And rules here are getting stricter every day. Cant go out except for Mosque and a gaming cafe near the place i live ( because if the local police catches me without work permit, i would be in an ACTUAL TROUBLE). One good thing is that i am living with the family of another uncle of mine, so it feels like living at home. But other than that,i have had no professional development for 2 years. The people who graduated with me are either professionally stable or ended their masters or running a business and/or happily married and i am in neither of the category.

I am having severe emotional meltdowns. Today, i finally decided to not listen to my family and to go back. For that, i need to get my sponsor file my exit, pay some penalty and i will be going back to my country. But now my family is pressurizing me to stay a few more days. If i look back, the last 2 years i see are nothing but false hopes. The situation in my country about getting jobs aint that good either. My mother asked me that what will i do once i will get back..... Frankly speaking, i dont know what would i do. I applied for masters in Norway but they aren't replying either. 

But one thing for sure is that i can't live here ,on a foreign land, and do nothing. I think once i get back to my country,i will look for a proper job. Plus i will start doing masters in Embedded system design in August as well. 

But my family is insisting me to stay more. I cant live here anymore. I dont have any financial problems here, as my uncle covers all my expenses, but i miss the freedom i had back in my country.

So my fellow redditers, suggest me what should i do? TY

242,"I’ve been sick lately. Like the kind of sick that doesn’t go away. I’m always tired and even start to ache or hurt sometimes. If I let myself get too tired I can barely move and can’t think. Sometimes I get nauseous and it makes eating difficult.

I have these online classes and they take me 3 hours apiece. I’m not allowed to opt out of them.

I’m really depressed. It’s aggravating the sickness. Eating is even more difficult. Sleeping is difficult despite the fact I’m so, so tired. The aches get way, way worse if I get too depressed. I have no motivation to do anything and nothing is enjoyable anymore.

I have ADHD. That makes things take a bit longer for me. But honestly at this point I think my ADHD symptoms are drowned out by the depression and sickness.

I feel like I have to reserve all my energy and emotional stability for work being doing anything lately feels like a chore and is so, so difficult. Doing anything that isn’t 100% necessary feels like a risk because if I use up too much of my energy or fragile and finite emotional stability then I risk having no energy or being visibly depressed and overwhelmed.

I also have a volunteer job. Not too big of an issue as it’s only two days a week and gets me out of the house, but once again, that’s another thing I have to reserve physical and emotional energy for.

To understand this story you must first hear a little backstory

It’s a long story but basically I really annoyed this kid (we will call him chad cause that’s the typical bully name) and he is friends with a lot of the, for lack of a better word “jocks”

You must also know we have a very strict PE teacher who we will call Mr Sir and that we MUST shower before PE. (It’s a private school)

We get things called strikes for misbehaving, late homework, late for class ect...

and 3 strikes equal detention and 3 detentions in a month was said to result in you getting expelled (but I later found out that was just a myth)

Long story but simply because of the people I hung about with I was two strikes away from a third detention

We were going to PE so the boys and girls went to their respective changing rooms. 

I was in getting a shower while unbeknownst to me chad was taking my stuff and hiding it.

Because I took so long (or because everyone was so fast idk) when I got out of the shower I was the only one in the room I looked for my stuff but panicked when I couldn’t see anything I must have clambered about for ten minutes because I then heard Mr Sir yell

“GET OUT HERE ANON YOU ARE TAKING TO LONG!”

I panicked and didn’t wanna say what happened so I yelled back

“Ok just a minute”

And after about literally a minute he yelled

“THATS LONG ENOUGH NOW GET OUT HERE!”

I tried to explain what had happened but he cut me off by yelling 

“GET OUT HERE NOW OR THATS A STRIKE”

I panicked but thought, well he won’t let me explain it but If i get a strike I’m dead. so even though it’s super embarrassing ill have to just go out to talk to him and he’ll see what’s happened and I’ll be fine.

I used my hands to cover myself and I walked out but to my surprise the whole class was waiting for me and they burst out laughing and Mr Sir yelled

“OH DO YOU THINK YOU’RE FUNNY EH?”
I still don’t understands this statement like I get self deprecation humour but I doubt anybody would go that far with people they will know for a long time. (If anyone can try to tell me what he ment here  I’d be grateful)

I told him what had happened and he asked if anyone knew where they went. To make me look even more like an idiot somehow chad managed to sneak (or have someone else sneak) in through the back entrance to the changing room and put my stuff there  making it look like I couldn’t find them when they were very visible.

249,"Hi!

Just as the title says, I’m looking for advice on my accent. I just moved from the USA to Canada and I’m trying to fit in in this new place. I’m from Washington and have an almost identical accent, but I can’t seem to get a hang of that Canadian Raising.

For those unfamiliar, Canadian raising is the little nuance that changes _abowt_ to _aboat_ and _owt_ to _oat_.

I’ve noticed that all of my friends who were raised in Canada, the cashiers, the radio announcers, news anchors, local TV actors, fishermen, mall-goers and really anyone you meet around here has that Canadian Raising in the accent. And that’s what separates us.

I live in a touristy city with lots of souvenir shops and a bunch of people stopping by on cruise ships every day. Without the Canadian raising, I keep getting mistaken for a tourist fresh off the cruise ship. Prices go up, waitresses explain customs to me when I’m ordering food, and people ask me if I need directions to the main souvenir streets.

I’m working on changing my accent ever so slightly to fit in better, but it’s hard. With something like “Sorry” (_sorey_), it’s easy. “Sorry” requires a bit more thought before you say it, allowing that change.

But with “about,” “out,” “doubt,” “shout,” and so on, you just say it withoat very much thought. Especially when it’s with other words like “outstanding,” “roundabout,” “without,” and “throughout.”

I’m really focusing on this accent because I know slang comes very easily (new words as opposed to changing what you already know.)

I’m looking for advice on changing the small little ways I speak, getting into the habit of saying “aboat” and “oat” in a normal sentence as opposed to what I say normally. Please, I’ll take any advice you’ve got!

Thank you so much!",30Mar2018,1
250,"So I met some girl on Discord four days ago in a language exchange server. She's 17 and I'm 16. I live in Asia and she lives in Spain and we are having our conversations which have been in DMs only, me trying to speak Spanish.

I think we get along pretty well. I invited her to my Discord server and we've just been chilling, she's been talking to the other folk there (a drug dealer, a communist and a rad bro, so it's been interesting).

Now all of a sudden I'm getting really attached to her. She doesn't even know what I look like yet but her profile picture is herself and I've seen pictures of her on Instagram and stuff so I can tell she's really attractive like an 8 or a 9. I'm not that attractive personally, like a 6 at most... But more than that I just really like her personality and the way she talks and whatnot.

We haven't even actually voice chatted yet.

She uses a lot of blushing emojis and she seems really friendly.

One of my friends tells me that from talking to her, he can tell she's quite lonely and he thinks that she may like me a bit already.

I know internet relationships like this don't always turn out so well but the fact of the matter is I'm pretty attached to her and I don't feel that going away soon.

She gave me her Instagram and I'm following her on that.

Point is, it might be too early for me to confess my feelings considering we've literally just talked for a few hours (and last girl I had talked to for like 15 hours in total and I basically had to tell her eventually what was up because a situation called for it) but if I don't I'm gonna be in this weird obsession with her.

How do I proceed from hereon?

I understand if I come off as weird but I'm quite immature with this sort of thing so thanks for understanding.",30Mar2018,1
251,"My husband will be deploying and sadly will be missing Christmas this year. My in-laws recently visited and offered for me to come with our 2 year old and future six month old baby to stay with them for the holiday and I have till October to decide as they will make other plans otherwise.
My dilemma: I love them because they’re my husbands parents, but I probably wouldn’t hang out with them if they weren’t family by marriage if you get my drift. We have zero things in common. I have never spent any time alone with them before and now it’ll be with the two youngins. 
They also live kind of in middle of nowhere and navigating the back roads is hell. 
And they live six hours away. My MIL offered to either drive to me or meet half way then drive together, but even that sounds exhausting. Two little ones, dog and cat. 
We don’t live anywhere near other family (mine is in Alaska and we’re in Florida, tickets are far too expensive, even this far out) and even if I had friends around here, they would be with their own families.
On one hand, I wouldn’t be alone for Christmas, which admittedly isn’t my favorite holiday but I make an effort for my LO, soon to be two LO’s. On the other, I would be with people who I don’t think I can handle for even a few days without my husband as a buffer. 
Any advice is welcomed. My husband says that it’s entirely up to me. I know he feels guilty (he shouldn’t) for leaving me alone with the kiddos for Christmas, but he’s also aware of how difficult his parents (family in general) can be.

I played videogames all my life. I'm now 24 and enrolled in my masters degree. I learned how to shuffle my time over the years (in high school I used to play all game and never study, now I balance it better), so that's not the problem.

The problem is that I mainly play competitive online games (Starcraft 2, League of Legends, Overwatch, to give you a feeling) and I'm almost sure over those 6-7 years they made me a worse person: I'm bitter, and always looking for verbal and mental confrontation. That's kind of ""expected"" online but what I realized is that this attitude is showing up more and more in ""real life"" as well. My own mother says that she hates when I'm not doing exams (when I don't really play much) because that's when I'm the best version of me, more gentle and kind-hearted.

Now quitting videogames is something that I would prefer not to do. Mostly because I wouldn't know how to fill the time...! So I'm asking advice maybe by someone who's gone through the same thing. How to not let the bitterness and hate get to your head and leave it in the game? Or eventually make it disappear at all? (even though, I think that'd be harder to accomplish).

257,"**Long post; Tldr at bottom**

I currently reside with my boyfriend about 45 minutes from my parents house. I am a full time college student who pays all of my bills myself and worked at waffle house for a year and a half in high school. I am currently unemployed but have been living off of student loans in order to keep my academic performance high (I currently have all As compared to my last 2 semesters when I had a job). My father did not pay for any of my senior year expenses, and he has contributed less than $1000 to me since I have been out of the house (June 2017). He canceled my car insurance in January, and so I currently have to rely on my boyfriend to take me to school 4 days a week because I don't have a car or insurance. I am currently attending counseling for childhood trauma caused by him as well as being a rape victim. 


This all to say, I had planned on filing as an independent for my taxes in order to receive my $1000 student tax credit. My dad, however, OFFERED to give me $1,000 in exchange for letting him claim me to get the larger sum tax credit. I agreed, thinking it would benefit both of us. This conversation was in January, and I had forgotten by mid-March when I was filing taxes that I was supposed to file as a dependent. Therefore, I truthfully filed as independent, and I was supposed to get back over $1000 dollars. Instead, my father had already submitted his taxes where he claimed me and I was rejected. 


I called him in response to this, and he said that if he needs the money more than I do, and if he gives me $1000 he's not going to help me with anything at all for the rest of the year. The caveat is the fact that he doesn't help me financially anyway. My boyfriend and I were struggling for 2 months waiting for student loans, but every time I thought about asking him for help, he made up excuses about his own financial troubles. Keep in mind, this is a grown man who is constantly getting new stuff. He doesn't know how to manage his money. 


I have been short with my father since I had to refile taxes, and I had to come to his house to pick up my replacement debit card which had come in the maill. I did this specifically when no one was home, but my dad's bedroom was such a mess that I had to call him to ask where my card was. 


He then begins to interrogate me telling me there is no possible way I forgot that I was supposed to file as a dependent and that I was intentionally trying to get him audited. I tried to explain to him that I had planned on using that money to either not have to work for another month or to put towards getting some mode of transportation so I could get a job. I told him I felt he was taking my resources away and not supporting me. He then brought up how he pays for my phone bill ($15 a month on family plan) and health insurance, and that if I don't feel like he's supporting me, then he's going to cancel my health insurance. I replied,  saying ""I don't think you can do that."" And he said ""check your facts honey--sounds like you haven't done your research.


The call ended shortly after, but since then, my dad has texted me trying to manipulate me into apologizing and accepting what he's doing to me. This is infuriating because I know I am in the right, and he is being an asshole. My father makes over $60,000 a year. My dad can easily spend $1000 in a week, whereas for me, that is 4 months rent. I don't see how he possibly thinks that money can do more for him than me. Additionally, I have lived until now consistently paying for his bad decisions.


He is the one who lied on his taxes, and I am the one who is losing from it. I don't want to get him audited, but I am not letting this go until I get the money I deserve. I don't want us to have a bad relationship, I just want to receive the money I earned and deserve.


Additionally, I now have to resubmit my fafsa for next year, but I can't get his financial information and he's refusing to talk to me in a civil manner. 


My father is currently having a birthday dinner on wednesday, and my boyfriend and I were planning on attending regardless of whether or not I talk to my dad before then. I refuse to let the situation appear as if I am the one being unreasonable. I love my father. I just want him to stop being an asshole to me.


Thank you so much for reading this far, and I would thoroughly appreciate any advice on how to progress.


Tldr: Father claimed me on taxes despite the fact I have lived away from home since June. He promised to give me $1000 that I was supposed to receive for being a full-time student, and when I held him accountable, he threatened to cancel my health insurance.

261,"So, A while back I had an argument with my friend. Now to give a bit of backstory as to why we argued, this is what happened before...

So, I have this friend (Friend 1) that I play video games with on steam a lot, well used to, so, what happened was I introduced him to another one of my friends (Friend 2), and they found out they had a lot of games in common. So, Friend 1 at first was playing games with me and him, sometimes both of us and some times one of us, but it didn't get that bad. That was about a year ago. Now, what happens is Friend 1 plays a game with me for like 5 minutes and then notices that Friend 2 goes online and just says, ""Goodbye, i'm going to play a game with him"". Normally i respond with something along the lines of ""Can I play with you guys"" and they always respond with ""Oh, we are playing [game that i dont have] so you cant play with us"" Now this wouldn't be an issue except this has been going on for a month and i never get to play video games with my friends anymore.

Now to the argument,
 I start talking to them and say something like It's not cool when your friends randomly just leave and don't play games with you.

And they respond with, well we are just playing games.

and i go back with the, Fine, but we have like 40+ games that are the same, why are you never playing any of those.

and it goes on with that for like 15 minutes, until i just leave our call because i'm getting annoyed.

and Friend 2 says ""its important to know you cant control your friends""

then they both block me.

267,"During a family gathering, I involved myself in some very nasty bickering with my uncle. Essentially, my uncle has gained notoriety in my extended family for his extremely homophobic views. Knowing that I am a strong supporter of the LGBT community, he once again brought up the subject of homosexuality at the dinner table. But this time, he said things that were so disgusting, it pushed me over the edge. His description of homosexuals was very sexually explicit and involved over-the-top violence and cruelty. When I attempted to defend them, he laughed and called be a Democrat (Which is not offensive to me, but wrong since I'm generally conservative). Eventually I snapped, yelled at him and called him a b*tch, and went to my room. Now my uncle and his family refuses to talk to my family, and my parents are very upset with me. They say that even though my uncle was wrong, I had no right to use such language with him (I agree with them). Furthermore, they believe that since I'm straight, I have no business passionately defending homosexuals. I feel guilty that I destroyed my dad's relationship with his brother (my uncle). I know that I shouldn't have cursed out a relative (especially an older relative) but I was so upset I couldn't hold it.
For context, I am a 19 year old male and never excessively cursed at the dinner table, nor had outbursts.

In the near future--hopefully within a year or two--I would like to move to California, but for now it's simply not an option for me financially.

I have a good job (earning well above average) and I spend most of my time practicing some hobbies and going to meetups. While I do meet 'friends' at these activities, being a small society and becoming older (25), everyone seems to keep their comfortable distance. Thus my social relationships are very unfulfilling, I am able to surround myself with some people but I still feel very alone. Moreover, everyone here knows each other... so when you meet someone ""new"" they're not really new.

To give you an idea - if I drop dead tomorrow, there are few people who would actually care outside of my direct family. I know it sounds nasty but it's true. 

Coming home to my parents every day is getting exhausting and sad, so I have concluded that I should at least move out to try keep my life moving forward. I think some form of independence will keep me healthy mentally and  if I do remain here, being a guy who has his own place is generally attractive to women.

I feel like I've exhausted all options where I live and am contemplating between the two options:


* Buy a place and settle down alone. This makes most sense financially since I can afford it and getting on the property ladder is generally a good thing. I am lucky to have a good job and to be 'rooted' in a place where owning a home is very achievable for now. 

* Move away to a big city where there are more people and thus more possibilities to live a more socially fulfilling life. However, I am worried that if I establish myself abroad I will never be as 'safe' as I can potentially be here.

282,"Hello,

So I'm male, currently in college and I've started to notice that I have some severe engagement issues. At least in my opinion and this has been since forever, although I've gotten better in some things about engagement, for example, last year if I ever got invited to go out I would always say ""We'll see"" in fear of saying yes but then letting them down because I wouldn't want to go. Of course the people around me found this annoying, but I barely do that anymore.
What still lingers is an engagement issue with girls. I would always flirt, start a spark or just add a chick I'm interested in on social media, but I would NEVER go further, regardless of if those girls were interested or not. I just wouldn't try.

Well after exams I got drunk, added a chick I've been exchanging stares with in class, and messaged her to hang out to which she told me she was away during the break after-exams. Not trying to insist too much, I just told her I'd ask her out again once classes start. Said sure. Genius me deleted her from the social media we were using the day before.

Since then she's been giving me stares (and so did I) and I tried to convince myself that she wasn't interested in me, but a girl friend of mine said I could've gone further. It's been 2 months and it's awkward because we dont talk to each other, just stare since we always sit more or less at the same place.

At home I'm like ""Yeah, I really want to get to know her and maybe get in a relationship"" but when I'm in class I'm like ""Nah, I'm not really interested in her, I'll wait to see if another girl catches my interest"" and at this point I don't know which version of me to follow, what I want. 

I believe I've fucked up as I've waited too long to fix it, but my girl friend says I could still try talking to her. Another obstacle is that she's always around friends, she seems very popular, and I'm easily intimidated by groups.

TL;DR I flirt but I chicken out at the last moment because of engagement issues I believe, any advice?

I opened the windows and turned fans on to make sure she wasn’t hot , I let her take a drink but making sure she drank it properly making sure she didn’t choke or anything , I tried to get her to take my inhaler even tho she doesn’t have asthma just to try and open her airways up as much as I can . 
After around 10mins she seemed like nothing happened but at the time I was so scared I hurt her , obviously I did which is why I’ve told her as much as she likes it I’m not doing it again because it was the scariest thing I’ve seen even if it doesn’t seem it. 
It’s been 9hrs and she says she’s fine every time I ask her but idk if she’s just saying that. 
I’m here for advice to check if I need to take her to hospital or if I need to do anything during the night or keep special eye for certain symptoms. I have no clue what to do I just want to make sure she’s ok. 
Thankyou for anyone who can help me

I am not that good looking of a guy. I'm average height for a FEMALE (5'4). I'm also about 30lbs overweight for a guy my height. My issue is that I'm obsessed with finding a perfect girlfriend. 

I've had girlfriends that are decently cute and fun to hang out with, but they weren't what I wish for. They dumped me for the record, I would never dump a girl because I thought she ""wasn't good enough"" for me. I don't think that highly of myself at all. I think both my exes were amazing girls.

The thing is I want a girl that looks like the Top/All Time on /r/adorableporn or /r/realgirls. I want a physically *PERFECT* girlfriend, but I also want them to be a good match for my personality. I'm obsessed with the thought of the girl I end up with. I feel sick in the head for thinking this way, but it's true.

I actually have panic attacks thinking about how it could never happen because most of those girls want PERFECT guys. I'm far far far from perfect. I'm a really nice person but I feel awful when my mind wanders to this thought.

I get really depressed thinking about how there are guys that get to be with these perfect women and just because of the way I was born I won't have the chance.

298,"Short Version: 

(Before I start this post... age doesn't matter to me, but I feel like when it comes to things like this, people need to/want to know. I'm 21, and he's 40.) 

The more I spend time with him, the more I like him... and I don't know how push this in the right direction. My problem is, I'm really shy... Through email, however, I always say things like ""You're a great person,"" or ""I care about you,"" or ""I enjoyed spending time with you,"" to at least let him know that I'm interested in him...

We've met up a few times already over the course of about 5 weeks. He always asks why I would even be interested in listening to him talk, or how I could even be interested. So I sent him an email saying, ""I love to listen to you talk, even if you're just rambling about nonsense (And honestly, I think it's very cute)."" He said something along the lines of ""It shouldn't surprise you, then, that I also like to listen."" I feel like maybe saying ""you're great"" or ""I care"" is not really something that shows romantic interest, but saying that I think it's cute, might be a bit more, expressive? I hope, anyways...

I guess what I want is to be able to act on my feelings... I want to kiss him... I don't know how to increase the likelihood of that happening... And, quite honestly, I don't even care about being in a relationship... If I could have what I have with him now, plus be able to kiss him and be touchy-feely (in a romantic way, not sexual), then I think that would be fine with me... The question is, what do I do to make that possible... 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Long Version (The details and events leading up to now, essentially).

After the semester was over, I sent him an email and said something along the lines of ""I know this is a long shot, but would you be willing to meet up with me sometime soon""? I'm not one to take risks like that, or to even say things like that, but I really thought about it and decided that it was better that I at least knew there was a sliver of a chance than not having a chance at all. He responded and said he'd love to, so you could imagine that I was thrilled.

So we met up the first time and I was definitely nervous about it. I wore a dress, and he said something like ""That looks really nice. I never saw you dressed like that when you had my class."" And that made me nervous too. The entire time I was just completely nervous and I hardly said anything, I just listened to him talk for hours.  

So then the following week, I asked him again if he'd see me, and so we saw each other again. I'm bad at reading into people, so I have no idea what he thought of me, but he asked me like three different times what was the reason for me asking him to see me again... and I kind of felt like I was supposed to say ""Because I'm interested in you,"" but of course I never did. He kept saying ""There must be a reason..."" So I kind of felt like he knew why, but again, I was just too afraid to say it. He then said he was meeting with his close friend and I thought that he was going to leave and go with his friend, but what he meant was that WE were meeting with his friend. Again, being the shy person I am, I said ""Wait, so your friend is coming here... I'm not really comfortable with meeting new people..."" and he was very understanding and said something like ""I'm sorry, I'm glad you told me, I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable."" And then I left. But when I got home, I was thinking, wait a second... he was going to introduce to his close friend? That has to mean something... At the very least, to me, that meant that he planned on keeping me around.

So then the third week, school started again. New semester, new classes. Obviously, the first two times we met outside of school, but the third week, we met in school. I met him at his ""office"" (he's an adjunct, so all he has is a tiny cubicle). So I went there, sat there for like 10 minutes, then we just went to the school cafeteria. Then, there was the awkward moment when three of his current students were sitting at the table next to us and they're just like ""Oh hey Professor!"" and I was just sitting there thinking, it's the first week of classes, I wonder what is going through those student's minds when they see me sitting there with their professor... Also, this was a day where we had a major snow storm as well, and he taught night classes on that day, so he was hoping that they would be canceled. We sat there making stupid jokes about what if the school closes and we just get locked in there and stupid places to hide, it was just really a fun time. School did end up closing early, so we had to leave, we were the only ones sitting in the cafeteria and we sat there until they closed the school. 
 
Fourth week, we hung out again. This time he had an event that he was going to, but told me I could come too if I wanted to, and of course I did. After that, he had some work stuff to do, but again, dragged me along. I was surprised, honestly, because he had to go to two different departments to fill out paperwork for his paycheck, and I just tagged along. I was wondering what the people in his departments would have thought of that, because I would imagine that they would wonder who the heck am I and why am I with him. But after that, it took him about an hour to get all that work done, he was apologizing to me saying he was sorry for wasting so much of our time and that it wasn't nice of him to drag me around like that. And I told him it was okay. We hung out for about an hour after that, and then he had to go teach his night class. 

Fifth week we hung again yet again. This was a few days ago. I just told him meet me in the cafeteria just to make things easier for both of us. So we hung out and again and obviously by now, I'm a bit more comfortable than I was five weeks ago, but I'm still pretty quiet. This time for some reason, there was a lot of awkward silence, and a lot of awkward staring and smiling. Actually, it's always awkward when neither of us has anything to say because then I look away because I'm nervous and when I look back I realize that he's looking at me, so then I just end up smiling.

306,"My husband and I currently work crap entry level jobs in PA.  A storage company is really interested in interviewing and possibly hiring us to work for them in MD.  The job is live on-site, as we have done previously we would trade off the kids when needed and still be able to easily fulfill duties that the company would need.  However the company needs mandatory 3 week training where we would have no choice but to have childcare for that time.  I have two kids.  One is 5 and moderate to severe autism.  The other is 13 months and neuro-typical.  The 5 year old should be in school pretty quickly if I move fast.  But I am not sure if he will be immediately.  


So my question becomes.  Is it reasonable to find childcare for around $400 a week in the Washington DC area that can handle them both if need be?

My best friend in the world just left today for a job in another state that isn't close by. We'll go from seeing each other every few days to every few months. I'm having a hard time with this and already things seem really bleak for the upcoming summer.

 I also am going through a breakup . My relationship ended about a month ago with someone who I really loved that hurt me pretty badly. I'm still tempted to contact him but I know it will only set me back. I just long for the validation that our love was real. He will likely never give me that and I'm starting to try and accept that.

I also have another close friend leaving for home Tuesday across the country to South Dakota after a few years of being here on the east coast. Sounds crazy but ANOTHER close friend is heading to South Carolina to scope it out to maybe move soon.

Long story short, thinking of all these people leaving is giving me MAJOR anxiety. For the first time I feel like I don't have a close person to turn to to help me with these feelings. Part of me wants to move as well but I don't wanna just move because everyone else is, although I would like to live somewhere else at some point in my life.

Idk what direction to go in. I know I have to readjust and grieve all these losses but I also want to start over myself, or meet someone when I'm ready and have a relationship. Settle down. I guess I thought that would've happened for me already (26 F).

Apparently, I confided that I was scared of my dad, specifically referencing this one time my mom and I were forced to hide in a closet and call the police out of fear. She said I told this to a group of guys about 4 years ago (~senior yr of high school), and one of them went and told their parent(s). The parent(s) then contacted Mrs. A, telling her about what I had revealed. She was apparently kicking herself for years over doing nothing about it, and it took a literal nightmare about it to text my mom. I couldn't have fabricated this ""coming out"" story if I tried, as no aspect of it is anything close to true. My dad is an introverted doctor and a total nerd who spends his offtime either napping or reading books, so people don't know him as much as they know my mom, but I've never met a more supporting and loving guy. My mom still hasn't told my dad about it, not out of fear of him flipping out, rather it being a sincerely hurtful thing to hear. As much as my mom has tried, Mrs. A won't reveal who it was that told her, only that she knows my mom, thinking it'll break some ""confidentiality"" between my ""friend"" and his parent(s). We don't want to know whom it was for revenge or anything of that nature, but just for closure, and more importantly to get help for whoever they might be confusing me for (I have a pretty common name, so I get mixed up with others a bit). My mom, who's in a pretty rough patch of her life, is now paranoid about a lot of people in town, thinking they were either the source, or spread of the rumor. I'm not sure if as many people have heard as she thinks, but I still hate seeing her feel this way. Should I keep pushing Mrs. A to tell me and/or my mom where this came from? It'd let us clear things up with at least the source. Should we just drop it? My mom, and importantly my dad's, reputation could possibly be hurt.

318,"Hi everyone,

I've lived in this apartment for about a year and a half (deep south of the US, so very hot and humid) and I am about to lose my damn mind with these roaches. 

The first year or so that I lived here, I saw a couple roaches (German roaches). Once every few months. Each time I saw one, pest control would come and leave bait behind and that was it.

The last two months, they've been a lot more frequent. I saw a couple in my kitchen. Then pest control treated. Then I saw one in my bathroom. They treated the bathroom. I didn't see any for a month, then yesterday I saw a dead on in the bathroom and one in my bedroom, then two live this morning (one in the hall outside the kitchen and one ON THE WALL in my bedroom). 

The weird thing is that every single time I've seen a roach, it's been in the morning. Typically, I walk into whatever room, turn the light on, and the roach runs out. I stay up pretty late at night and frequently return to the kitchen/bathroom after turning the lights out and I have not once seen roaches out or running to hide at night. 

I keep my place fairly clean, but not impeccably. That's another weird thing--if I leave dishes in the sink overnight (with food on them) I never see roaches in or near the kitchen. You'd think they would be around the food, right? Never seen them in the cabinets where food is actually stored either.

Every time I see a roach, I tear my apartment apart looking for more of them or signs of roach droppings. I never see anything. I never find more bugs, I've never found droppings. 

So what are the odds that I don't actually have a problem and I just have a filthy neighbor and roaches from them are visiting me? This place is very old and has a lot of random holes in walls where vents/other fixtures have been installed so it would be easy for them to travel. 

Oh, the other thing I've done is put down glue traps in places I've seen roaches and left the lights out as much as possible to see if I can find them. Zip. Zada. No roaches. So there must not be tons of them wandering around at night.

I've put down combat bait stations and pest control is coming (again) to treat next week. I'm moving away in a month but I'm stressed as hell about the bugs and worried that there's a hidden infestation that I'm going to carry with me. So I'm looking for some reassurance and advice.

I got eyes drops, I'm so afraid to have new friends, or even to reconnect with my old friends, I'm being so isolated and don't know what to do, almost everyday I wake up saying why I'm not dead yet. And I even don't have money to go to a doctor. So any advice? ",30Mar2018,2
321,"TLDR; I have been in a relationship with my 23 year old girlfriend for 4 years now, and we have been living together for a little over a year. We really do love each other and are very happy together, but last week she kissed an ex coworker, and I don't know how to respond. What would you do?

A more detailed background:

My GF started working for a company 6 months ago and it immediately became clear her 38 year old coworker had a crush on her. About a month ago he moved to a different part of the business in the neighbouring premises and they still see each other in work, but a lot less. Around the same time, on a work night out he kissed her when she wasn't expecting it. She told him several times over the next week that she loves me very much and what he did was completely unacceptable and not to be done again  (mutual friends have confirmed this).

Last week my girlfriend went on another night work night out. She came home black out drunk, to an extent I have never seen her before. She has since shown me that she spent £200 on £1 shots for her and her small group of friends, if that helps give an idea of how drunk she was. 

Two days later before leaving to go on a 4-day business trip she confessed to kissing him. I could tell something had been really troubling her, but she kept saying everything was okay. She didn't tell me how long the kiss lasted. She then told me that immediately after the kiss she started crying about how much she loves me, so he put her in a taxi home. It is unlikely I would have found out if she didn't tell me so I believe she genuinely told me out of guilt, and not the fear of me finding out elsewhere. She seems genuinely distraught about the whole thing.

(Last part I promise). When she told me, I immediately said that many people do stupid things when drunk that they would never ever do sober, and therefore it was fine as long as it NEVER EVER happened again. She promised that she feels absolutely nothing for this guy, would never go on a night out with him again, and would do her best to avoid him from now on at work. However, I now can't get the image of her kissing him out of my head, or the fact she will still see him from time to time at work. Furthermore, Ive been reading forums where people are in the same situation as me, and almost all the replies say to break up. So in my situation,  what would you really do?

324,"So me and this guy dated for a while. He was so kind and he made me really happy. Then that’s when one of his friends told me he was cheating on me. I didn’t break up with him because I loved him even though I never told him. We ended up breaking up because we went to different schools and it was complicated. He told me that he never cheated on me which made me really happy. We talked everyday for like 2 months afterward and one day he said he loved me. I replied with “I hate you too” because I thought he was messing with me. Me being me started to say that I didn’t like him. Then he kind of stopped talking to me or I would start the conversation and he’d reply with “k” or the thumbs up emoji. So I blocked him because I felt like he didn’t want to talk to me and I knew that I wouldn’t be able to, so I just made it easier and blocked him. Now we haven’t talked for like 2 months.For a while I lost feelings for him. But now I feel like I don’t feel anything for anyone anymore. Except him I think

Should I talk to him or should I just try to get over him?

Please help",30Mar2018,1
326,Me and this girl are really close and there are rumours we like each other but idk. Most people tell you you have nothing to lose asking her out but I do. If she says no it’ll be awkward and certainly mess up our friendship. What do I do?,30Mar2018,2
328,"So yesterday I was at work and my boss brought her 11 year old kid and I let her play on my phone so she would leave me alone. She then asked me to log into my Instagram account on her phone and I told her I didn’t remember my password. She said she would reset my password for me and I was like “sure whatever” because I had to work. After she came to me and said it didn’t work and I didn’t think anything of it. 

Later when I tried to use Instagram it said I was logged out so I used Facebook to log in. Then at around 9:30 my phone was blowing up and I saw that there was a topless photo of me posted on my feed that I totally did not put up myself. I freaked out and deleted it, but I also noticed that there was a caption and it said “bare”. Also the photo was old and I had never sent it to anyone.  

After I deleted the photo my boss’s daughter messaged me asking me why I would post that. She also asked me to take a “reaction photo” of my face to the photo being posted. So now I was like really suspicious of her because why would she want a reaction photo? Plus she had my phone for like 1 hr at work and had access to all of my stuff.  

To make things even more complicated she mentions that there is another account using my photos but it was private. So I get a friend to follow it and see what kind of photos they posted...lo and behold it’s the tiddy pic again! Plus 2 other photos from my own personal Instagram. The photos were posted 30 mins ago so it was a new account. And somehow this little girl knew about it. So at this point I think it’s her. She’s the one who sent a copy of my explicit photo to herself and posted it. But I don’t know what I should do...should I tell my boss her daughter is doing this or should I just stay quiet about it? Or should I just confront her daughter? Because I don’t have concrete proof it’s her. But there are definitely signs that she did this stuff.

Also after I explained to her I will try to go to the police the account was deleted. I think she was trying to cover her tracks cause I mentioned a police report. 

TL;DR my boss’s daughter may have a tiddy pic of me and she posted it on my own Instagram account cause she had access to it. She also may have created a fake account to post it. ",30Mar2018,1

332,"Hi there, 26 year old female Schizophrenic here. Overdosed on Klonopin Tuesday morning at college cuz I didn't want to do it at home and have my family find my body.

Anyways, I was taken to the hospital because I stumbled into a counselors office and passed out on an off- and (shockingly) only spent the night at the Psych ER and they let me out Wednesday afternoon.

I had called my boss who knows about my diagnosis and that I occasionally need hospitalzation and I told him that I'd likely be gone at least 2 weeks. For sure I'm going to be out of work Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday for doctors visits and emergency therapy since I just got out of the hospital. 

But Monday I don't have things to do. Should I just stay home and take it easy since my boss isn't expecting me anyways? I could just take it to rest and go back to work Friday.

What do you think?",30Mar2018,3
333,"For reference, we are both 17 years old. 
My boyfriend likes anime. He's not a weird obsessive fan or anything, but he was at Anime Boston today cosplaying. He bought himself a body pillow with a girl on it. It shocked me because I didn't take him for the type to buy an item like that. Being a drawing she's obviously much more attractive than I am. I don't know what he's going to do with the pillow but I just feel weird that he got one with a girl in lingerie on it.

I sleep over at his house about once a week and I don't want that THING in his bed with me. Even if he puts it somewhere else I don't want to look at it across the room. Should I be ashamed to be jealous of a body pillow? Should I just ignore it because it's his item and I shouldn't have a decision over it? We've been together for a long time, and I don't want to break up with him or get in a fight over this. How should I handle it? He spent $45 on it, and I don't want to be a Crazy Girlfriend and make him get rid of it. ",30Mar2018,1
335,"So I’m 19 years old, and I don’t know how to drive. My mom is leaving for the week with my sister for spring break and she is leaving the car keys home. 

My uncle taught me a bit a few months ago, but my foot was on the break pedal the whole time and I was going really slow. My turning was ok, but we never went on the street. He  went back to work so he can’t teach me anymore and classes are expensive, and money is pretty tight,  My mom doesn’t have time, my friends are scared to teach me, I literally have no one to teach me, so I turned to Youtube videos. 

So what I’m trying to ask here is could I learn how to drive from watching videos? A lot of you might find the question dumb, I’m sorry but I have no where else to turn. ",30Mar2018,1
336,"My boyfriend (29) and I (27) are nine months into our relationship but it feels like years. We hit it off very well when we met and have spent virtually every day together since we started dating, with him moving in with me just a few months later and we are now in a great place. We hang out and laugh all the time, hold absolute respect for each other, and seriously have the HEALTHIEST relationship I've been in or witnessed. He is hands down my best friend and we are both head over heels.

In January I went to use our tablet and log into gmail, the account logged in I've never seen and was full of online dating site emails and emails that suggested he posted something on craigslist. There was no evidence of him replying but it really freaked me out, I would have never expected that from him. I've never gone through his phone or email at that point because I never ever felt a need to or even thought about it so of course at this point I looked into it more...It seemed like he was checking out a bunch of dating sites and CL posts while I was gone (in Alaska for the month of November for my newborn nephew). 

I immediately approached him about it. I've been cheated on many times and know the signs very well. He did not get defensive and solidly told me he had no idea what that was about. We ended up just talking it out and leaving it at that. I checked his browsing history and he was definitely on dating sites while I was gone, but I felt ashamed to admit I snooped (that is NOT what I'm about typically) so I decided even though he was lying, he was probably just embarassed and bored/curious/horny because I was gone for so long. I was ok with that, sort of, because I definitely did not think he met up with anyone. It wasn't too hard to get over it because we went back to just being awesome and happy.

It started to really bother me the more I thought about it. I looked into his email again and there was a password reset request for IAmNaughty from AFTER I'd come back from my trip. Now I feel super insecure and paranoid in what should otherwise be an awesome relationship. I put it in the back of my mind most the time, but every few weeks I find myself obsessing over it.

I logged into his dating sites and since we'd started dating he didn't have any activity. He truly does not seem like someone who would cheat. I feel like maybe he's just curious and checking out sites from time to time which I honestly don't give a fuck about. I don't care about strippers, I don't care about porn, so I don't really care if he's just bored checking out dating sites. But what if it's more? We spend almost all our time together, it would be hard for him to find a window to cheat. 

Any advice on how to put my mind at ease on this? I don't want to necessarily ""just talk to him about it"" because last time I tried he was not honest, and I don't want him to know I looked into his shit again. That would just cause unneccessary trust issues.

Anyone else happy in a relationship randomly browse dating sites out of boredom? I'll admit I've watched a webcam show while in this relationship but I did not consider it cheating. Just for you guys to understand my boundaries/thoughts, I'm a pretty open minded person, I simply don't want my amazing man to be fucking another person. Hopefully this is just a weird, private kink type thing and I can just let it be?",30Mar2018,1

339,"I'm not the guy who ask these kinda questions. But I woke up the other night and my head was boggling about some thing. There were many questions, what am I good at? , what am I interested in? What am I even doing?....... and many more. 
I never spoke about how my life was, but I don't know today I'm talking about it.
I grew up in a lower middle class Indian family, where my parents struggled a lot to educate me. I completed my schooling, I was not the brightest student but was good at studies and very consistent. when I was pursuing my undergrad my financial conditions were critical. So I started tutoring and this helped me pay my college fee. After graduating I landed in a job. The pay I get is insufficient, After paying my house rent and all my bills I will be left with hardly any cash. And I'm the only constant source of income to my family.
This leads to another problem, getting my Master's degree abroad. I have a huge dream of pursuing Master degree. but I have no financial aid (No savings, no property). 
When I look around, my friends, who where with me the whole time are reaching heights, earning more way more than me. And now I'm confronted with a scaring question, when am I going to be successful in life? 
I have made a decision to write GRE, but I still have no idea about how am I going to arrange that huge amount of money.",30Mar2018,2
