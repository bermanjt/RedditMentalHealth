1,"One of my best friends is absolutely in love with this girl in our grade. He doesn’t talk about her a lot but he has told me that he’s in love with her. Thing is, she’s already in a relationship (or at least likes another guy) and I don’t want him to end up getting hurt. 

I have already hinted at the fact that she’s with someone already, mainly aimed at the guy she’s into. (The guy she likes said something rude to me in front of my best friend, and I asked his opinion on him, then I mentioned that “he just got out of a relationship, and now he’s in another one” - I missed my chance to say that he was with the girl he likes. 

We have a dance coming up in about two weeks, so this is what I think I’m going to do. Since we eat lunch together almost every day, I can ask him to talk. I’ve already asked him if he’s going to the dance, so it wouldn’t be awkward, but I was thinking of asking him if he’s planning to ask anyone to the dance. If he says the girl he likes, I can say something along the lines of “but she’s already with so and so...”

That’s my first option; my second is this. At lunch I can ask him to talk and just say something like “I really care for you, and I don’t want you to get your feelings hurt, so this is why I’m telling you this. The girl you like is into someone else. I’m not sure if they’re in a relationship yet, but I wanted to tell you this before you get to caught up.” 

I’m not sure how to tell him this, but I really don’t want him to get hurt in the end of this. I’ve already convinced myself that I’m going to tell him, so don’t try and talk me out of it, but I’d appreciate any advice you have for bringing the subject up to him",30Sep2018,1
2,"Where do I start... I am 28 and I have been a Christian all my life. I come from a religious family and I had a very religious upbringing. I’ve never questioned my faith as hard as I am now. My grandad passed away last week and he was an atheist. My mum told me that the day he died, the minister of the home he lived at told her he found grandad in the chapel twice that day. Now, this was very comforting for my mother to hear and she is convinced that somehow grandad knew that he was going to die and went to the chapel to give his life to Jesus. She now says she feels at peace because she knows he is in heaven. I don’t know how I feel about this. I mean is she saying that you can spend all your life not believing in god and as long as you go to church before you die, you are guaranteed you will go to heaven? It just doesn’t make sense to me. His death has greeted me with so many questions about my faith and if I am only believing in god because it’s all I know. I mean if I grew up in another country where Christianity wasn’t the dominant religion, wouldn’t I grow up believing that another religion is the right religion. From his death I now have so many questions about my faith. I don’t know what to do. A part of me likes the idea of believing in something bigger than me and trusting and praying to a god but questions about Christianity are not making sense, the answers I am receiving aren’t making sense. I have a fear in me that I will go to hell if I am not a Christian. Does anyone have any advice with this?",30Sep2018,3
3,"I'm having some issues. I'm constantly exhausted and tired, yet sleeping is hard for me. I've recently tried exercising and found that it is the only way i can just fall asleep easy. but its not a good feeling. it's as if my body couldn't handle that short 15 min jog. after the jog I'm left extremely exhausted and forced to lay down and sleep. I'm not sure why I'm constantly fatigued. also its important to note I get headaches often and my bowel movements cycle between dihariah and constipation. this has been going on for a while. I'm not in the position to pay for medical attention. Any suggestions of what this is and some natural remedies?",30Sep2018,2
4,"Hello! Sorry for the wall of text, but I really need some input from anyone. 

For some background, I turned 19 a few days ago and currently enrolled in university.

So I've been working at this restaurant for two and a half years. I'm a hostess/busser/food-runner/clean-up/take-out person. At first I was working under some family friends but now, since September of last year, my mom acquired ownership. 

It's been awful. My mom is a strict, Asian woman and has worked as a waitress for 15 years. She runs and manages the restaurant with her sister, who is also strict and condescending. They've never owned a business, and it shows with how they talk to employees sometimes.

My mom being my boss has constituted a lot of fights. She has always undermined me and never trusts my judgement. If I'm not quick enough, if I'm not smiling enough, if I'm not cleaning enough, her or her sister will yell and berate me in front of customers. I understand if my performance needs to be improved, but her or my aunt are never not rude about it. They'll make it personal, and never see it as you as their employee, but rather, someone trying to sabotage their business.

Often, my mom will tell me to go home and that 'they don't need someone like me' here. It's so hard to feel wanted or in a good mood at work because of how she talks to me sometimes. I've also struggled with depression for several years because of how she raises me, and now she's my boss. She's made me cry at work a few times also. 

I feel like I work really hard. I have to clean tables, sit people down, answer the phone, run food, do refills, sweep and mop at the end of the night, get ice, refill napkin dispensers, etc. It's slow when it's slow and it's awful when it's busy. I feel like our pay is fine and the servers tip us anywhere from $5-$15 each a night (there's usually 3-4 servers). There's the occasional $20 from a server, but most of the time, most of them will keep it under $15. 

But here's where a potential issue with my pay will come in.

So my mom just had a meeting with her bussers. I work with another guy and another girl. 

She had instigated a new rule: if you aren't working hard enough, you will get a write up. Three write ups constitute being fired. 

So basically, if my mom has to tell us to do refills instead of us doing it in the moment, it's a write up. If we are sitting down and ice needs to be filled, it's a write up. She also said that the servers will tell her if we aren't doing something we need to be doing, it will be a write up. And if my mom believes we aren't working hard enough that day, she will tell the servers to not tip us at all.

This irked me because we have been doing our jobs but apparently, it's not enough and now we need a penalty system. Knowing my mom, who is very short tempered and a perfectionist, this system could be very easily abused by her. 

And she said that it doesn't matter if we get fired because according to her, ""I have lots of kids wanting to work here"". Which is true, but that made me feel like shit. 

At any work place, you want to KEEP your employees, right? Whether I'm her daughter or not, the last thing you would want is to have your employees feel like you don't want them. I feel like a work place shouldn't be a battle ground, worried if you'll get fired tonight based on how others view your performance. 

In a bigger sense, this IS how a business works, but my mom and aunt in particular have yelled at me for petty things. For example, I was yelled at last week because the paper on the table wasn't ripped straight enough.  

Should I leave this job? With college, my expenses have increased and I'm simply barely making enough working here to cover that. My car insurance survives off what the servers tip me, and I can't lose that. Especially if my mom wants to tell the servers to not tip me for something she thinks is not right. 

On one hand, my mom has flexible hours and is more understanding than other bosses would be, but I don't know if how she runs the place is worth it. She can't constructively tell you how to do something better, only knows how to yell and insult you. And now I gotta worry about doing more than the exception so I won't get fired that night? 

But also, my boyfriend works with me and I never get to see him because of college and work. 

I turned 19 so I can be a server elsewhere, but what do you guys think? Any suggestions or criticisms? If you worked in a restaurant, what do you think? 

Thanks!

5,"I need advice on how to: 

1) get my mindset right for the sake of my family/children (I am extremely sad and down lately)

and 

2) improve my/our financial situation 

Yesterday I received my new monthly amount due for my repayment of my federal student loan. $1,100/month for the next 12 months. I was in so much shock when I saw the new monthly amount due. I called Fed Loan immediately and explained that there was no way I could repay that amount (we have daycare costs for an infant and toddler, as well as our southern California rent) there must be a mistake! Nope, they explained that they took both my husband's and my gross income from our recent tax return (we filed jointly) and that is the amount I'm expected to pay, under IBR, even with a family of 4. 

I also explained to the student loan rep that I was on maternity leave for the past 5 months (been back at work for about 2 weeks now) and was getting paid only 60% from the state for only 10 weeks out of the 5 months. But she said that I should have checked the box that indicated I had a change in pay since my last tax return, and that it was too late to do so now because I already submitted my recertification application with my 2017 tax returns. I'm beyond frustrated with myself and my stupidity. 

My husband and I are in our mid 30's and were hoping to start saving for a home purchase soon. We live in southern Ca (Los Angeles area). But now, home ownership no longer seems possible. Retirement goals are shattered. And forget about saving for our children's education funds. I feel like a complete idiot. I hate myself for making such an idiotic and life-changing decision of attending grad school. Instead of getting ahead in life, I've set my family and our life goals back - in a major way!  These loans are hefty!

We did the calculations and after our monthly bills (daycare, rent, groceries, health insurance, car insurance, utilities, student loans), we're left with almost nothing. We don't have car payments (our cars are over 12 years old). We aren't brand-wearing people. We don't go on trips or travel abroad and we don't use credit cards. We were just hoping to start saving for a house purchase soon. We were also planning on putting a larger % of income into our retirement. Now none of this seems possible. I'm beyond frustrated.

Any advice on how to handle this? Was/is anybody in a similar situation that could give me some advice?

And please, PLEASE no rude or mean comments. I'm already feeling very down, depressed and anxious about the negative financial situation I put myself in. Not only does it affect me and my husband, but our two little ones as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

\*We live in southern California and moving out of the area or state is not an option.

\*We are renting a 2bd for $2,100/month (not a nice area either).

\*Neither of us has family in the area who could watch our children in lieu of daycare.

\*The only pro that I could come up with: I work for a non-profit...so there is PSLF (I need to do more research on this)",30Sep2018,0
6,"Dear reddit community, how does one proceed with this situation: I have a friend, who’ve I’ve know for 4 years now, and have had feelings for since the day I have met her. I’ve confronted my feelings towards her on multiple occasions, and her response has either been that she doesn’t want to ruin our friendship or she asks me if she would be the one that I would marry down the line. I’m still friends with her now, but I know that it can be toxic to just be “friends” with someone you have feelings for. We also differ on some very serious topics: 
She’s a hardcore republican and trump supporter, which I am not 
She’s sex after marriage, I am not 
She’s against alcohol, I being a 21 year old curious male, am not 
She lives 1 minute away from me, so I have no escape 

How do I proceed with our “friendship” if these feelings are still present?

7,"so like always there's a girl I used to go to School with but I was taken out of School at an early grade and homeschooled for the rest of my school years. anyway through the years I've thought of my old classmates and there was always this girl she always stuck out in my mind. well around 2011 I found out she got married I was happy for her, now in this same year I actually saw her in person for the first time since school a good 15 years later

 well after that event I friended her on Facebook and we even started talking for a while she even gave me good advice on how to overcome anxiety but soon after we stopped talking because I was afraid I'd interfere in the marriage  and I didn't want to be responsible for that. Well ever since then I've seen them around town every once in a while she's had two kids since then they're cute as heck but I haven't spoken to her again. I'm not even sure if she remembers me.

Here's the thing I think I've developed a crush on her isn't that weird? I hardly know anything about her, whenever I see her now I get real depressed I'm not sure why I do is it because I love her? or is it the thought of what might have been had I not been taken out of school would we have gotten married and had a couple of kids am I in love with that whole fantasy cause our lives did turn out quite different she went on and did the family thing and has a great job and I've basically done nothing, 

So what should I do? I don't want to be with her I would never want to ruin that marriage but I still want to talk to her and get to know her better I'm just afraid to",30Sep2018,1
8,"I fell really fuckin hard for this girl back home (she's 17, I just turned 19 a couple months ago) And there's a couple things I'm worried about. 

1. She's.. actually pregnant with her ex's bfs kid (He cheated on her so they broke up but he's gonna take the kid I guess)

2. She's really fucking far away. I'm gonna go visit her in a couple months so like it's not gonna be an issue for long but anything could happen in 3 motnths..

The first one worries me because there's the possibility that they get back together to try and make it work for the kid, but in the same vein she says stuff like ""I wanna spend the rest of my life with you"". Is this worth worrying about if she says she loves me as much as I do? ",30Sep2018,1

10,"There’s this whole connotation that everyone you meet online is not who they put themselves out to be. My mom strongly believes in this. 

A while ago, I mentioned having internet friends and she then proceeded to get really concerned with who I would talk to (at the time) over Skype.  Eventually, she stopped because I kind of stopped talking to my internet friends as often because of it. Recently though, I’ve made more internet friends and she’s getting suspicious again. 

For reference, I’ve had internet friends for the past four years. She first became suspicious two years ago, but two years later, she’s become suspicious again. She’s been asking why I’m laughing really loud or who am I talking to. I’m usually on discord with friends playing overwatch or some sort of video game. Sometimes I tell her that I’m just taking to real life friends that she knows plays video games with me. Then sometimes I just play it off as me getting mad at the game, and I’m just talking to myself. 

The thing is, I’m afraid she’ll get really suspicious and I’m getting tired of hiding it. The thing is, I know I can trust these people, like they’re definitely not catfish trying to bait me or anything. None of them have ever shown red flags, and if they did, I would have immediately dropped them. 

I guess what I’m asking is, how do I prove to my mom that they’re not a bunch of catfish I’m talking to and genuine people around my age who all have the same hobby of gaming? Please share any stories, I’m just looking for any advice/ insight. ",30Sep2018,3
11,"I had met this guy in one of my after school clubs, I was attracted to him and we soon exchanged socials. We began talking to each other for a few weeks and my simple attraction started turning into a crush. 

Then in one of my club meetings, he holds my hand, which I thought was cute at first - I’d like to mention that he never asked me to be his girlfriend and we haven’t gone on a date. 

It had felt unnatural to me and I didn’t know what to do, but I just assumed that’s what you do if you like someone. But then he let go of my hand and started caressing my thigh, it shocked me and it made me uncomfortable, but I didn’t say to stop because I didn’t want to cause a scene and I thought “most girls would be happy if their crush did this to them right?” Throughout that whole meeting, he touched my hands and thighs more and still I never told him to stop. As we were parting ways at the end of that day, he had said he loved me and I didn’t say it back. After that day I had a panic attack and body felt dirty and wrong, soon I started to rethink about that day and cursed myself for not saying no.

I’ve been avoiding the club meeting ever since, but it was something I truly enjoyed.

12,"This guy has taken advantage of me multiple times, and has said over and over again he just wants to fuck and doesn't want a relationship (just sex and dates...) Last time I contacted him, he asked me to send him a nude pic. He wouldn't video chat with me unless I did that. The whole thing was miserable the whole time, but he had some sweet moments when we were just starting to get to know each other, and was the first guy to ever ask me out on an official date, even though we never kissed or held hands. I feel like I'm going  crazy. He was actually rude on the first date and condescending, but we used to text a lot. I did text him quite a bit (once a week to maybe once a month, but never more than that). He hasn't talked to me since that last time or texted or anything. I didn't send him the pictures, and I had told him online that if he couldn't respect my boundaries, I was going to block him. I did this. Am I crazy? Because I still think about him every single day. I blame myself for everything. I keep thinking maybe it will be better and he'll treat me better, because we used to be friends, sort of, when I had allowed him to take almost all of my notes for class, and we hung out for a whole semester which was really great when he didn't take advantage, until he asked me to bring beer to his dorm room (illegal) multiple times because he wanted to hookup, and then he cancelled on me each time. He actually was really patient with me texting him a lot and seemed fine with it, even when I get nervous and texted hi 4-5 times in a row in a day sometimes, but he said he was done when I told him we needed to actually have sex after six months because I wasn't just going to sit around being available to fuck if he was preoccupied with hunting trips that were obviously a bigger priority for him. I just feel so sad and confused. I still think I screwed up and he was the person for me. I still contact him sometimes and think it could work out. I feel totally crazy.

So, I finally kicked my toxic ex bf out of my life, He mentally and sexually abused me, he ruined my mental health and my relationship with my peers: essentially this man ruined my life.

He works as a truck driver for a local company. He's usually home on the weekends and a few times throughout the week. But whenever he's home, he's playing Fortnite. I love gaming myself, but for him, this is different. Ever since he's started playing this game, his attitude has changed dramatically, turning him into a real asshole. Neglecting the family and work that needs to be done around the house that falls into my to-do list. When my family goes to bed throughout the week or the weekends, he's still playing. And not silently either. When he's pissed at the game you can hear him stomping on the ground, throwing his controller on the ground, and raising his voice for a short period of time. We have a pretty small house so everything can be heard throughout it. My mom has tried to confront him about it and he gets defensive and ultimately leads to neither of them talking for the rest of the day/evening. My mom gets frustrated and annoyed by him playing very easily, causing her to make shitty comments to him, and then he screams throughout the house, cussing her out because he can't have time to himself. But that's the only time he ever does anything when he's home. And when he does have to do chores such as mowing (when I'm not at the house on the weekend), he throws a fit and claims me and my brother don't do anything around the house when all of us but him are picking up the slack.

I asked if there was a problem and he said no and mumbled something in “tech speak” that I didn’t understand and asked if I’d been having trouble with my service... I said no. 

The tech then offered to come inside of my house and replace my modem... which, of course, I had to decline based on the peculiar circumstances. Tech seemed in a hurry to leave so I obliged without asking many questions. 

I only have Comcast internet. I do not have cable television. There have been no outages. My bill is autopay so there’s no billing issue. 

I have two young girls who often run back and forth from my back yard to the neighbors who have 5 little girls... 

The more I think about it, the more I don’t understand why he was in that particular part of my yard... it’s covered in trees and shrubs... but then I also have a totally clear 1/2 acre of land out front. The utility box is on the opposite side of the house from where the tech came from. (Not that he would have needed the box for anything because we don’t have cable TV and no cable lines). 

Is this creepy? Is this something I should report? I do know very vaguely know the guy from high school... When Comcast is open I plan on calling them to ask if there was a service issue but should I take it a step further? Am I being a crazy overprotective parent and there’s a logical explanation that he didn’t give me?

33,"So I love film. I grew up watching tons of tv and movies, became a pretty big movie buff in high school, and studied film at USC. While I was there I worked on several student films and had three film internships. 

After I graduated I moved back home. In Florida it has been difficult to find jobs with a film degree, right now I’m working at a cool historic independent movie theater, but I’m only making $10 an hour.

My parents want me to go back to school in Florida and study something more practical like business, but I’m not really that interested in the subject matter.

What I want to do is save up my money for a year or two, move back to LA, and try to find work as a set PA or an office PA. I know that it’s risky, but I want to follow my passion.

What I’m wondering is how realistic would it be for me to get a film job? How hard is it to get these jobs? Be honest with me. I really don’t want to try to pursue film, not find any work, have to move back home, and be stuck working in low paying retail/food jobs. What should I do should I get a business degree that I’m not interested in? 

Really stressed about this, need advice, thanks

TLDR want to pursue film, worried I won’t find jobs. Should I get a degree in business instead? :(",30Sep2018,1
34,"20 y/o female; its been 2 years out of highschool i was in a relationship with only one guy (from 14-18 only go i have had sex with); but everyone calls me a slut and looks down on me. i dont know why, i truly dont mean to come off cocky in any kind of way but i changed highschools regularly because people would take off guard pictures of me etc and even going as far as following me home, trying to fight me etc and i was always to myself yet somehow always ended up ""popular"". I swear i was never the mean girl, i truly never go out my way to do bad or say bad, but i dont understand why people are so rude to me, it truly breaks my heart. I worry a lot because at 15 (me and my ex broke up for a bit), i did sent explicit pics to few guys via snap but they were from a whole other country and there is no way anyone would know (i worry till this day because in a way that would ""prove"" the rumours about me ""right""), but im truly not the person i was at 15 at 20. i dont have a easy life outside, i grew up in foster and quite honestly i have been suicidal since i was 14. people make fun of my self harm marks and anytime i try to talk to someone their answer is ""your pretty you have nothing to worry about"", 1) im very insecure because people made me feel guy by always trying to take off guard pics of me i swear i dont even leave my house anymore 2) being ""attractive"", which is subjective, does not change how i feel or make me any more than anyone else. i feel very torn i regret all my past mistakes i really do i worry a lot about that but i also feel so bad stepping out all the attention and negatives get to your head. im truly not strong enough for this anymore, i have no one to turn to no one i trust.

Fast forward I got to leave work early and she was busy and we usually say goodbye to each other but I just wanted to go. So I leave assuming it’s all good and then I get a text “so you’re gone” and I reply no and turn back around. She then proceeds to being petty and saying “bye” calling me a liar when it’s simple as just turning around to see her which I did. She doesn’t come out to see me says “leave me alone. Calls me moments later to scream at the top of her voice that I’m not “communicating” and I’m a “liar”. This starts to get to me. I have no idea how someone freaks out like that over something so small. She starts to call me names and literally screaming hysterically and doing this psychotic laugh which really freaked me out. It’s been a little over 2 years and after experiencing that I don’t even know how to feel it was just sooo intense over something as simple as saying bye. Knowing damn well I’m sick and just wanted to go home asap. I don’t understand how that puts the relationship in jeopardy.

45,"So long story short. Transition period of my life, have always been kind of a solo person, not social, don't enjoy social situations, never fit in any social circles in my life anyway. One of the few friends I have is very, ah, excitable in any situation. If the tiniest thing goes wrong, flies off the handle, swearing up a storm. Never physical. Was looking for a place to stay to get out of a kind of rough home environment, found a few places but this friend said over and over - 'hang on, my parents are moving and renting out their old place, we can get in for cheap'. Cool. Held on for a while, his rents finally moved out, we got set up in the place.

Now this is the house he grew up in. Both of us are in our early 20's and have grown up in drastically different households, so obviously we handle things vastly differently. That's fine, different life experiences shape us all differently, that's cool. But it's to the point where if I do any tiny thing out of line with what his expectations are, I can hear him half-yelling across the house 'I fucking told him to do x/y/z', definitely with the intent of me hearing this. Wifi is slow for some reason, even if he's the only one using anything? 'I don't do this shit to you.' etc, it's just no matter what I do, despite trying to stay as out of the way as possible, I apparently can't do anything right / get blamed for everything wrong.

I will say this guy is one of the only people I can be open with and/or be honest with in my entire life, and is the only good friend I've ever realistically had, but I don't know how to approach the situation and try to diffuse it without potentially making it worse. He's been through some really rough shit that I'd never want to wish on my worst enemy, so I don't blame him for having some reflexes that come to that. Doesn't mean I don't personally want to try to find a solution, though.

If anyone has any advice on maybe how to approach this to help cool things down, or at least realistically do something that'll help along the way of getting him help or something in a way that doesn't seem patronizing, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm godawful at confrontations so I don't know the best way to approach this. ",30Sep2018,1

She has hardly been responsive through this and I found out that she WENT ON A TINDER DATE LAST. NIGHT.

I never really could tell if a girl had fake hair and I didn't like to assume every black girl had bundles. 

I hate that she won't wear her hair out because ""its too short""and she doesn't want to wear an afro or little ponytails. She says she wears weave to protect her hair and she wont wear her hair out until it reaches her shoulders. It bothers me that she's willing to go her whole life wearing some fake hair and wasting money on it month after month instead of wearing her own hair which I always try to convince her to do.

49,"My brother (currently my roommate) has never been really close with me but I’m worried about him. I didn’t know till about a year ago that he battled severe depression his entire life but I knew he had problems(don’t we all though?). He has his life more together than anyone I know he’s an entrepreneur and never has had problems with being successful. He dated this girl for 5 years on and off and finally after a rocky ending of her being a full time partier they ended it. My brother would spend days and hours crying and telling me that he wanted to kill himself and what’s the point of life ect ect. I thought this was normal you know but it didn’t last just a month it lasted almost a year and I still don’t think he’s over it. During this time my mother told me about his condition about how he’s been dealing with this his whole life. I guess this sparked his depression off to a severe degree. Well fast forward a year and a few months his (sort of loser buddy who parties way too much) introduces him to this girl. I thought this might help make him happy to get some rebound chick to help him get through this, well that is what happened but he started falling for her. She has no college education currently, has no job now, I just found out she quit and is somehow paying bills? (Maybe my brother is forking over cash?) I wasn’t too concerned until I found out the real her. She leaves her trash everywhere around the house, trashed our balcony with cigarettes and lighters, leaves food everywhere, currently there is a bowl with food floating in it for 2 weeks now with mold coming out of the bowl I refused to wash and her car looks like my trash can. I know people can be lazy but come on don’t trash my apartment if you aren’t paying the bills here! Also to add she’s a full time alcoholic and I have never seen her not one day not drinking in my apartment, she leaves cans of beer everywhere and fills my trash can plus never helps with taking the trash out. I seen her drink almost a full bottle of vodka on a weekday and then continued to brag about it. Like wtf?? She even tried to dance on my brothers friend one night at a club. Then one night I seen her doing coke plus drinking and sitting in my brothers bed just wondering like uh is this your sleep routine? My brother proceeds to wake me up on a week night freaking out because she’s having a seizure in our floor (actually this is her second one this night) he proceeds to tell me “I don’t know why I’m with this loser she’s going to die here.” I found out the next day she had been binge drinking for 2 days and haven’t had any water or food at all. I was sort of joyed that this happened cause I figured my brother would wise up and get rid of this liability. After a week of her staying here I finally got fed up and confronted my brother. I know he has feelings for her but won’t admit it. I told him she is a big problem and that successful people don’t hang around losers, he then tells me he doesn’t care about her and it’s just someone to party with ect. Ect. I am bewildered at how stupid he is he literally left his last relationship because the girl had the same problem (not near the degree as bad though) and now he’s back in this trap with a girl who is ever worse. How do I go about this? I don’t trust her or like her and she’s in my apartment everyday. I am also concerned for my brothers well being too. ",30Sep2018,1

4) she puts me down a bunch and honestly, I don't know why I still keep in contact with her or call her my friend.

Second, since I'm shy, I don't know what to do to occupy myself! I want to meet new friends, but doing that in public is very hard. Also, she has not yet moved her stuff, so it's that much harder.

This was important to me because as a woman, I believe that a mother's role in your life is so important. This is not always a healthy choice, I know, but in his particular case, she made mistakes, but ones that more negatively affected his dad (they're now divorced) than him. It was hard for me to fully understand why a complete severing of the relationship was nessesary.

So now we have spent time with her and I have learned that she is difficult to be around. She is a nice lady, but she clearly has racists, conspiratorial, and self centered views. Most of these are not different from his fathers, but I am more close with him than her so I feel more comfortable expressing my discontent.

73,"Hi. I'm a student and trying to get a small job. I commute to my university's campus from a different town and so I'm looking for a job in the town I live in. Medium-ish size town, southern US.

I've applied to upwards of 20 entry-level part-time customer service jobs by now, and landed 0 interviews. I have no experience aside from a seasonal internship I completed at a biological research facility. I don't think I have any issues with the resume I submit; I cite my internship, only mention skills/experiences that are relevant and applicable to the job, I put down my student information (my major, my high GPA, etc). I personalize it to the position if I take a special interest in whatever the company is about, to demonstrate my enthusiasm.

In some cases, I've visited places I've applied to and asked to speak to managers to introduce myself, again express enthusiasm, and I've definitely made good impressions every time I've done this - but in these cases, I was told to contact HR and ask about my application status, and it went nowhere because I'd call so many times and be told to leave a number because so-and-so isn't available. Then I never hear back. I've gotten no response at all from most applications though!

I know I lack prior experience, but what's the deal?! Is it really just that I need to keep submitting apps? I am so confused that I'm having this much trouble. I do always list my availability, so maybe this is a factor? I'm a full-time student and have classes Monday through Thursday, with different times of availability those days, and full availability the others. Is this a huge issue??

Also, I've been told to submit applications online when possible.. But I know that I tend to make a good impression on people and come off as a competent, intelligent, friendly person. Is it okay to still go in-person to places I'm interested in, even typical chains, and directly ask about openings?

No idea what I'm doing wrong here. I iust want to land a single interview!!!! Advice or kind words would be so appreciated. I'm so frustrated with where I'm at and want to feel like I'm making more progress with my life, gain complete financial independence for myself, etc. Ugh",30Sep2018,2

78,"I’m not one for asking for help but I’m stuck and can’t seem to find help anywhere I don’t like talking about my problems, because that’s just how I am. But I feel like I should provide some backstory, I currently live with my best friend who is also my landlord (it’s his house) and I’m practically just paying for utilities. We have a lot of fun together and I don’t want to be seem selfish or whatever but I know he needs me, we need each other, he has been battling with a horrible drug addiction and he has said to me that “I’m the reason he is alive.” And that kind of sucks, I know I don’t owe him anything. 
But I am forced to move out as I got my hours significantly cut at my job because of it being “slow season,” so I am unable to afford to live there. But my other best friend told me that I can move in with him and his fiancée, and not pay rent until I have money to pay them. I like the guy and I don’t mind his fiancée but she is just too much sometimes, but I digress, for lack of a better word they are very very dirty people, not outwardly, but there house which holds two dogs is covered in there stuff everywhere and literal shot from the dogs they refuse to clean up afterwards. 
Another thing I would like to point out that my best friend’s Dad has been contacting me about putting up my portion of the rent and utilities for his son while I get back on my feet, but I can’t do that from a pride stand point and my friend would never forgive me for doing that. I’m lost and don’t know what to do, I’m sorry if this is a mess I just have a lot on my mind, and I also have half of my stuff at each house...I know moving in with my friend and his fiancée would be more financially responsible given that I get to save money but they are also very overtly affectionate and very judgmental.

79,"I recently moved away from home, leaving my single parent mom all alone. I've always been her only friend, as all her other friends leave her or use her. We don't have any other family besides my sister who refuses to speak to our mom. My mother has always had a dependency on me, and there was abuse and manipulation going on (hence why I moved away). She recently sent me this text that said, ""I'm really lonely and sad because nobody ever calls me and talks to me and I don't have any friends and I feel like I'm going to go out into the streets and stuff and find me friends that aren't real friends because they're not real friends you know what I mean saying I just need somebody in my life I can't handle this alone this anymore."" .... Reading this breaks my heart. I feel shattered and I don't know what to do. She's talked about how she feels like dying because she has nobody and her life has no meaning. She keeps getting worse and worse and I feel completely stunned on how to help. I can't be her only source of companionship and communication. Due to her abuse towards me it's hard for me to talk to her much, but I still love her and want her to be happy. I'm scared she might hurt herself or just live a sad life which breaks my heart.

82,"I have known this girl for about 5 years now. Technically, we became friends over a mutual dislike of another girl who manipulated us for years. Over the years, I had shared many of my first experiences with her such as first sleepover, amusement park, concert, etc. When we reached high school, we remained as friends, still frequently talking over FaceTime and such, but I realized that she was rekindling friendships with people who had bullied me in the past including the girl who was the reason why we had become friends in the first place. Despite this, we continued our friendship. Slowly, hanging out with her felt more and more toxic for my mental health. Now after the summer of sophomore year (Junior year), she Unfriended me on Snapchat. When I found this out, I tried to call her, quickly finding out that she had also blocked my phone number.

On top of all the pain, he seems so happy. He still wants to play and for an old man, he's a puppy at heart. He's lived 6 months passed the point where the doctor said he couldn't survive past.

86,"So, this is gonna be a long one guys. 

So back in middle school days I has strictly a religious Muslim. My parents were strict and I followed my religious teacher and my parents' teachings. ""dating/relationships"" was forbidden and so I created a disgust towards it. That all changed when I had to swap middle schools. This new middle school was different from my previous one. This new one was a public school (diverse) and wasn't full of 99% Muslims. And it was only for the latter half of my 8th grade year. And in that time I had multiple classes with a certain girl. Let's just call her 'H'. 'H' was definitely attractive to me. But, it was rather her intelligence and personality that I liked most. We spoke a few times. But I was nervous around girls because I was never allowed to do so. In the last day of 8th grade, in the last hour of class I had built up enough courage to talk to her. But she was no where to be found. I couldn't tell anyone else about my feelings as I saw them as wrong. The irony, I know. But the the first 2 years of my high school I went to a different school. But because I was overseas in the summer of my 9-11th year, I was forced to go to another school. And that school was the one H attended. I rarely saw her because she was never in my classes and only one time we ever. But in my senior year, I got one class with her and I guess I fell in love. It was not her body I craved, it was to be with that person. In that year alone I learned a lot about H, she was a Muslim as well, just not as practicing, she shared similar interests as me. I delusionally thought it was fate. I told my feeling to her as soon as they developed. I should have suppressed that and labeled as lust. I didn't ask her out, I just said to not tell anyone(I still thought it was wrong). And here comes that part where you wanna smack me. I couldn't find the courage to tell her, why I liked her and it was long anyways. So, I sent her an email... Through school email. I wanna punch myself for that. Ah and so she did reject me say saying ""I'm just not interested"", even when I only wanted to express my feelings. But I thought was was cool, I can get over it. Apparently not. That person's smile always captivated me and having her in class made it harder. She smiled a lot. I sent a couple more here and there and even talked to her in real life but, near the end of the school year she simply said ""please stop"" and ""I don't like you and it's because of your personality..."", those words alone had my eyes tearing and just tearing. I'm even crying reflecting on this. I guess it's my fault for being so pathetic and ignorant. I never took her perspective and didn't know what to do or how to. After school was over I finally convinced myself that I was over her. But that's where I was wrong. 

We somehow ended up at the same college and we share a class and a club as well. So that's 3 hours she and I are in the same room. And that's when I realized I'm not over her. I still seek the days where I see here. I get up early just to see her in class. I take care of my physical appearance a bit more...

I can't quit the class because I need it for my minor( and I'm poor). The club I can, but I feel like if I do my friends at the same club would question why. 


 I know she's too good for me. I know that. I know she hates me. I know that she's not attracted to me,( she seems to be attracted to hot Asians an I'm a fat, nerdy brown boy.

88,"Last week on Saturday LTR (3 years) broke up with me during a minuscule argument and I accepted it, and decided the relationship wasn't worth fighting for at that moment. Between then and Wednesday I sent her probably 2 messages and ignored all of her cries for attention. Wednesday night she blows up my phone at like 3:30 am so I decide to answer and I tell her what's truly on my mind, basically that her breaking up with me is a mistake that realistically I will be the best she ever gets. She then turns what I said against me into ""So our relationship was a mistake to you?"" so she gets more upset and hangs up after almost an 40 minutes of what I said above along with ""I expected you to fight for me"" and still at this point I am still done with this girl. Fast forward to Thursday morning and she calls me and asks if i could go to her house within 10 minutes of when she called me, and here is where I think I made the mistake. I told her yes and thought it would be more angry yelling at me and blaming me for her breaking up with me but no, she has the biggest panic attack i have ever seen while begging me to stay with her  and saying she is sorry and broke up with me out of anger and that she didn't mean it. I told her that we can be together but that we have to work some things out and have that talk later. I thought maybe some feelings would come back but while she's saying ""I love you"" and starting to plan out things for her birthday in November I can't help but feel in the back of my mind that I have to hurt her to the point of breaking down like how she did a few days ago. I really don't think I love her like how I used to and she is acting like everything is back to normal before we've even had the talk yet.

My boss basically wants to train me AGAIN after all this time while all the new people who came after me are doing perfect. I keep making small mistakes somehow and its brought my attention to how even outside of work I'm so dumb. It's really hard because all my self-worth came from me receiving good grades and thinking I was smart and doing well in school and university, but now I doubt that really means anything and is probably just because I work so long on my assignments etc. No matter how hard I try, I just can't fix that I'm not smart. How do I stop feeling so humiliated at work by needing training again after all this time and still not being as good as everyone else (which is the case as my boss has told me that I'm not), and accept my stupidity?

90,"My girlfriend of 2 years goes out every Friday or Saturday with her friend to a local club/bar.

My girlfriend is an angel, she lost both of her parents, her mum when she was 4 and her dad less than a year ago, in what world is this okay, and also she and her friend say this is “normal” but I refuse to believe that.

91,"My father had me when he was 45, so yea he's old enough to be my grandfather. He is now 78 and had a couple heart attacks, but he's still managing on his own. Who knows for how long.

My brother is only a year younger. He's always been a scumbag. In his childhood he would commit theft (which included stealing my money and ""borrowing"" my license without permission), he would constantly pick fights with me and tried to kill me on a couple occasions, he would torture animals, he would spend a couple stints in jail, he would lie whenever he opened his mouth, he shot me in the lip with a BB gun once, and he bullied me for several years, taking advantage of my severe depression brought on by my tumultuous upbringing, long story. He had always been nasty and horrible to me and just about everyone he came in contact with, and had a knack for getting under my nerves (I'm a very hard person to piss off)..

He joined the military and came back. He is slightly more mature. On the surface devious, and puts on an act. He puts on a charm although I think he's really bad at it. But beneath it, he is incredibly arrogant, bitter, angry, insecure, and jealous of others especially me (I've earned a college degree, bought a house, earn six figures, etc while he's basically a deadbeat). He had ADHD all throughout his childhood and always got straight Fs. When he left the military, he tried his hand at growing medical marijuana in Washington State but his ego, his procrastination, and so forth prevented it from taking off.

For the last few years he had been pretending to have changed and had been nice to me. But two nights prior to last thanksgiving he bought us pizza for dinner. I thought that was nice of him, so the next night I went in to town for a job interview and brought back a bunch of food from whole foods, some of it was to complement thanksgiving and some of which was intended for consumption that night. He took it as showing off and stormed out of the house and hasn't spoken to me since, he also insulted my dad on the way out and my dad was furious with him.

Anyway I'm not asking for advice on how to mend fences with my brother. The thing is, he has a marijuana operation the garage. When my dad passes away, me and him will jointly inherit the house, which is worth over a million (my dad owns about half, the bank the other half). Selling the place will be impossible with that shit going on in the garage. What do I do? My dad agrees this is a problem but avoids the subject. So my asshole brother, who has been one of the banes of my existence since he was shat out of our mother is probably going to go to court with me when my dad passes away and things could get real ugly. What the hell do I do? The thought of my dad passing away makes me sick, but then immediately afterwards having to go to court against my brother. I don't even want to think about it, but I have to. Ugh. ",30Sep2018,1

It has been a month since we started this and she had made it clear to me that she has sex with other guys. I had to pick her up from a guy's house in the middle of night recently, she was drunker than I have ever seen anyone before and I just took her home and didn't say anything about it.

93,"This is pretty long so sorry. Not only do I need advice, I need to vent. So basically for some background advice, I(20F) live with my mom. I told her i’d only be living with her for a couple months since i lost my job. I’ll be leaving soon to move in with my girlfriend. She agreed to help me out and let me stay with her. I have been applying &amp; working at staffing agencies. They’re not always super reliable but at least some income. My mother told me that if I don’t move out by the end of September that I had to pay her rent. I don’t mind that’s very helpful.


As of lately, I’ve been stressing about a lot because of my situation and had to pay off a few tickets and an accident i recently was in.  Today, after paying everything off, I was left with only money for gas to work until i get paid again. I get paid in two weeks and told my mom that. She then decided that that wasn’t good enough and said she was cutting the internet (which i use to contact work when they have available positions) and pack my things while i wasn’t there. I was confused but it was very typical of my mom to do. We never were close because she’s very harsh and we have a rocky history. But, i was still upset that she acted so heartless without allowing me to pay her rent in two weeks. I decided i wanted to involve the police before she touched my things because I had no other options. I would have no where to go. I knew she couldn’t kick me out on the street without an eviction so I went back home. I asked my girlfriend to record the situation because my mom has got physical with me and lies a lot about things i say.  So when i got inside, sure enough she was packing my things. I told her i was going to call them if she did and she started coming at my girlfriend for recording. calling her names. She even went as far as saying i was going to beat her one day. I never put my hands on my girlfriend our entire relationship. It was wrong. I didn’t understand why she was being this way. My poor tia who also lives with us was telling us to stop arguing and at this point i was crying frustrated with the fact that my mother was doing this to me.  We were very heated and honestly we called each other a few harsh names. It was too much to handle so I called the police.

When they came, i explained the situation and told them i just wanted to be evicted the right way so I have time to figure out where I’m going to go. They understood, and went inside to talk to my mom. When they came back outside they told my girlfriend it was rude to come into her house to record. I explained i told her to do it but the officer was being rude at this point. They lectured me about being nice to or mothers while they’re still alive. (because my mother has lupus) and i just stood quiet. I felt betrayed a little because although I understand she’s sick, I didn’t understand why she was being unfair and not understanding me as well. So i just left. Tonight i’m sleeping in the car. I can’t stay with my girlfriend because her mother has 5 kids to worry about as well. not a big deal.

After all this I wanted to talk to my two older sisters. I knew my mom was going to tell them what happened and everytime me and my mom have a situation, she twists the story and lies. I messaged them and asked if they can call me. One of my sisters was at a school event she teaches at and hasn’t reached out to me yet. My oldest sister however messaged me back saying fuck me. That my girlfriend fucked up for recording, and that my mom was going to toss my things and file a restraining order on me. I never thought she’d go this far. I called my sister so i can explain myself but my sister attacked me and my girlfriend and said that i shouldn’t have paid for my other bills because i had to pay my mom. I get that and i told her that. Honestly i was just trying to me deadlines that can land on records. I thought that maybe a week extension wasn’t going to be a big deal. She then kept on telling me that my girlfriend was wrong which again i explained i told her to do that. she was being rude and calling her names saying she’s dumb for listening to me. It was just breaking my heart to know that my sister was doing this to me. Saying she’s not the bitch to fuck with and she doesn’t play about her mom. she told my other sister in the group message to not listen to me and don’t get involved but I have no one else. She’s always been more understanding and calm so i know she’s still going to reach out to me. At this point i’m sleeping in the car, waiting on my sister to call me.

97,"TL;DR At bottom, but I urge you to read it please

So I don’t really know what to do at this point or if I have any right to say anything or what. Just kind of looking for stuff to kind of aid my situation because this has kind of gotten out of hand.

I met this new gaming friend like 5 months ago and she was really nice. We would chill on discord all the time, talk a bunch, just normal friend stuff and nothing more. The big kicker her is that she’s only 16 so I always kind of watched what I said and what not, as a normal person would do. Skip ahead till about two weeks ago where just randomly I guess she met this other guy who is 27. Now I know age isn’t everything, blah, blah, blah, but literally EVERY other person I have talked to about this has said that this guy should not be talking to her at all really, let alone saying the stuff he actually says. They’ve known each other for such a short period of time and since they pretty much started talking he’s been being super sexual and flirty to the point that it makes others around him uncomfortable and just super creepy in general honestly. Like the dude is fricken 27 and he’s constantly talking to this 16 year old about god knows what. I’m mainly just concerned about my friend because she trusts people a little bit too easily sometimes and always, always disregards their age. I’ve tried talking to her before about the whole situation but she just got mad at me. I used to talk to her usually once a day and we’d play video games and what not while on discord but now I’ve pretty much gotten replaced by this other guy. Maybe that’s why I’m so salty because I’ve now become a second tier friend and she only has time to be my friend when this other guy isn’t around.

Anyways, I just don’t know what to do. At this point I’m concerned for this girls safety because this 27 year old guy has just been way too forward and careless with what he’s been saying since day 1, but at the same time I just want to stop talking to my friend all together because I do not want to go down with this sinking ship what so ever. Whether this whole things come crashing down or not I just want to steer clear of this whole thing. So the debate is, the safety of my friend versus my own sanity/morals/ I don’t really know what to call this option.

TL;DR This 27 year old guy is flirting and being overly sexual with my friend who is only 16 and I’m concerned about her safety because to me at least this is not at all socially acceptable and the 27 year old should know better than to be doing this shit.",30Sep2018,2

Well, I'm Colombian and finishing last year of high school. Through my studies I've been an excellent student with a very good califications average, however, there are missing two months for graduation and this is not helping me.

I like to write and I think I'm good doing it, I've won some contests relate with this, but studying literature will no help me at laboral area.

What should I do? Do you think can I apply for a scholarship in another country? How to choose this country?

101,"Hiya guys so I (17 soon to be 18 F) wanted to ask for some advice in regards to some events that occurred some months ago that I can't stop thinking about.
So background info: I recently started to go to college. While there I joined a team and made great friends. One being a guy (20). We grew close over the year to the point, where to no ones surprise, i began to have a crush on him. Now i knew nothing would come out of it for various reasons, mainly the age difference. Eventually as we hung out more we began to get more touchy with one another. We would hold hands, cuddle, pet one another, flirt, even come close to kissing. When I asked around about how he acted towards some shared friends they would say he was always polite and nice. Not overly touchy at all. I didn't mind this behavior cause I liked the guy. He was always sweet with me, yet when I asked him later on if he could see us ever becoming more than friends, he said probably not. While I am cool with just being friends, sometimes while we hang out some of the previously stated actions start to happen again.

She has voiced directly that she has never been in a relatonship. Just the other day, she texted me saying she was bored and to enertain her. She laughs at all the funny stuff I do.

103,"Okay so just a little backstory: I started a few months ago at a new job that I really do like. It’s a small local bar that recently expanded and I’ve done everything I can to help with that. I’ve been constantly on call and busting my ass helping the owner and I’ve had little to no free time because of it, which isn’t a problem because I knew what I signed up for but it’s important later. 

I was originally given a pay rate that I did not end up getting. I ended up accepting a pay that was two dollars less than I was first told (the owner is struggling financially with the business and I understood and wanted to work there anyway).  I made it clear I wanted as many hours as I could get, at the time I was working at two other places that I quit for this job. We came to the agreement that I would work mornings at the new store and nights at the first location, with weekends off so I would be getting around 60-70 hours a week. 

A few days ago I met a new employee and was told his hourly rate, the same amount I was originally quoted and ended up not getting because the owner couldn’t afford it. AND on top of that he’s hiring this guys friend, both of which aren’t really needed at either store in the first place. I’m concerned I’m not going to be getting the hours I was promised and now I kind of feel taken advantage of. I really want to bring up how I feel with the owner but I don’t want to come across as ungrateful or shitty, because I do like this place and I don’t want to piss off the boss. 

Am I going to be an asshole for bringing it up or am I being petty and just let it go?",30Sep2018,2
104,"This situation might sound stupid, but its resulting in a lot of anxiety. 

I started working at a fast food joint about 3 months ago, and I chose to work there because my friends mom is the general manager. When I first started out, it was great. I got along with everyone well, and it was awesome. But as time went on, I started feeling unwelcome there. Besides, the pay isnt too great either. I could tell I was being treated differently there, and I was unsure why. Co-workers wouldnt be friendly like they used to, and they started acting cold. My suspicions were confirmed this morning when I called in to ask whether or not I worked tomorrow. Usually when other employees do this, they get told their hours with no problem or hassle, but for some reason, I was given a hard time. I was told I had to come in to get my schedule by my friend, who picked up the phone, even though the manager knew I couldn't today due to personal reasons. While my friend was trying to find out my hours, the manager (her mom) must've told her not to tell me, which I have no idea why. 

Now, here comes the hard part. I've already secured a job somewhere else, and they're just waiting for me to get my schedule from my current workplace so they can work around it. I'm tired of going into a passive-aggressive work environment, which constantly worsens my anxiety. I'm having a hard time deciding whether or not I should just quit with no notice and start at the new workplace immediately, or put in a two weeks notice and tough it out. I'm also terrified that my friend will no longer want to be my friend because I quit, or that her mom will tell her to stay away from me. I genuinely don't know what to do here. ",30Sep2018,2

I think thats a good decent backstory if this even qualifies as one lol.

I’ve been recently talking to girls again (I took a break cause college) and its been very miss wit a few hits. Recently though I met this girl, and its going ok. We took the same class together one time(ah geology) so i kind of knew of her. I did like her when I saw her though but previous experience with talking to girls while at school is a No, cause it never worked out for me.  Well i got a new job and low and behold I see her there cause she works there too. Now fast forward a lil, I’ve been talking to her every chance i get and so far I’ve made good progress. Now i came up with a genius plan to get the number. I needed this book and she had an old copy, so i asked for the copy + her number to remind her. she gave me her number, and today i got the book n stuff.
Now that I have the number, where do i go from here. I have a tendency to talk myself out of a W so what do i start to text her about? I don’t wanna dive straight into relationship talk with her, but i don’t wanna talk to her with hope that we may be together, and it doesn’t go that way and now I’m hurt and im tired of being hurt bruh I just want to love someone who loves me like I love them.

Me, 14M, entered a new high school.

I met a 14F there, and we really hit it off. We would chat all the time on Snapchat, talking about ourselves, and life.

Recently, she really opened up about herself. I found out that she has anxiety issues and panic attacks. I don’t know how to talk to her now, every conversation seems awkward and forced. When I asked her whether she was taking antidepressants or any meds, she kinda avoided the subject. I am worried that she’s using substances. I really want to help, but don’t know how. I would consider myself a normal person with a little drop on social skills, but normal. I haven’t ever known anyone with anxiety issues. I don’t know her too well, we’ve only been friends for a month or so, but she has other friends she’s known for years. I can’t stand sitting to the side knowing I can help. She doesn’t really want to talk about this to anyone, because she wants to deal with this herself (she doesn’t, she just thinks that others helping will make her situation theirs). As I said before, I don’t know her as well as some other of her friends do. How do I help her? Or is it just “None of my business?”

112,"Alright, I’m a 16 yo straight male. This question has a bit of a story (not too long).

The story: I am in a high school marching band. We had just won and we’re getting back on the buses to go home. One of my friends asked to use my phone to text his mom and his ride. I of course said sure. When I got my phone back, I had realized that my friend’s ride had just so happened to be my crush, and I just got her number. Without doing anything. I was celebrating a bit in my head, but then I realized that she only has my phone number because my friend texted her from my phone (aka I hadn’t texted her as me yet, my friend had texted her as my phone, if that makes sense). I told my other friend about this, and this friend knows more about the girl than I do. We start talking and he tells me that she is 100% single and knows I exist at least. He also told me that he would be my “wingman” (I assume he meant that he would tell me more about her).

TLDR: Friend 1 texts my crush with my phone. I get her number without asking. Problem is, I think it would be weird to text her because she may think that I asked for her number or strictly “stole” it from Friend 1. Friend 2 claims he wants to help, but I don’t know how.

I’m scared that if I get too hung up on her or become obsessed with her that I won’t be able to meet anyone else.

I’m not really sure how I feel about her still after all this time. It feels weird even being so hung up on it because I know logically we couldn’t really be together and I am also fully aware that I was never even dating her

I would like to speak to her again but I’m afraid it would bring up old feelings that I’m trying to get over, make things complicated with her boyfriend and I’m worried I may still have feelings for her and that I’m not sure how things will work out based on everything that happened between us

132,"Before you get up in arms, I've never cheated on my husband. 

History: Over ten years ago, I dated this guy briefly but fell hard for him. We had a natural chemistry and I knew we'd be together,  I just knew it. Then he broke up with me to get back with an ex and I sucked it up. Such is life. 

Like a year later we became friends again and hung out. We never had sex or anything,  but we made out after we explicitly talked about us not have feelings for each other. That is was just a friends with benefits situation.  We agreed. No strings attached. 

I decided to move and he acted like I broke his heart. He said he'd been trying to repair our relationship because he regretted what happened between us more than anything in the world. I couldn't deal, so I ran.  (I moved out of state. )

We continued to talk, had long chats, discussed a long distance relationship,  but then he brought up a conversation he had with the ex he had previously left me for.  I panicked, so I ran and got in a relationship with the first guy that was nice to me. 

He was hurt, I was hurt.  It was a shitstorm. I was in that abusive relationship for a year. He was always supportive. We stopped talking for a while. I left abusive guy, and my other guy was there to help and be supportive. 

We started talking again about the possibility of a relationship and I panicked again and ran again to a much nicer bloke. 

When I met my future husband,  I knew I was going to marry him.  Nice, simple, loyal, and trustworthy. I knew he would never hurt me, never cheat on me, never leave me.  Great father, doting husband, and a solid provider.  I hit the jack pot. (Other than the fact that he barely touches me sexually. That's a whole other issue though.)

Two years later, I reconnected to my old flame through gaming. Harmless talking, gaming, and advice giving followed by some intense conversations about what all happened between us. It was good for a while. But now it's been two more years and he's engaged and getting married soon seems he's cut me out. Which I get.  I want him to get over me and be happy. 


The current situation:  My dark secret is that I'm still in love with him.  I never stopped. I know he is still in love with me, he's told me as much but I turned him down repeatedly because of my unflinching loyalty to my husband (or my morals), who I don't love nearly as much but I made vows damnit. I think about my old flame every day  night, day dream, driving in the car, ect. I want it to stop.  I want more than anything to be rid of him and focus in my marriage and my life. I don't want to think of him. We feel the same way about each other, as well. Like a drug we can't quit. 

I haven't really spoken to him in over a year because I'm pretty sure he knows and he can't handle me with someone else. I also know he started dating some girl and wanted that to work out,  which I respected whole heartedly. And i've dealt with it,  but he's getting married now and I can't handle it. It's killing me inside. 

I have no right to it, as he has no right to me. But he's in my soul and sometimes I can't breathe when I think about it. 

He hurt me once and I've ran away from him consistently for over a decade because I'm not sure if I could handle the heart break again, but now I can't handle it anyway because it literally feels like I'm choking whenever I think about it. 

And I have a husband and two beautiful children and a house and a dog and literally everything I should ever want and all I can think about is that he's marrying someone. I don't know if I have it in me too divorce my husband, but I don't know if I can go on living like this. No one knows (though i'm sure my old flame does because he knows me better than i know myself.) I don't have anyone to talk to because of the guilt I feel. It's literally choking me. 

So, what should I do? See him, talk to him, get this all out? Or bottle it up for another decade and be in a marriage that lacks any form of intimacy but be with someone safe?  Or divorce and be on my own which I'd also terrifying because of my two small children? All I want to do is talk to him. And I think it's the last thing I should do. 

I have several friends closer to the situation that say he's just settling for the girl he's going to marry because they both want the same thing, not out of love or commitment. If I stay quiet, will I doom us both to just settling? 

tldr: i'm in love with an old flame and he's in love with me,  but i'm married to a decent guy that shows me no intimacy and he's about to marry a girl because he wants to settle down and I don't know if I should try and reach out to him because it's killing me inside. ",30Sep2018,1

134,"     I (18F) broke up with my boyfriend (20M) about two months ago because he changed emotionally, mentally, and physically in various drastic ways over the course of our 11 month relationship. To be honest, for the last 4 or so months I was just sticking it out in hopes that something would give. He became extremely depressed for the last month or so and refused to get help. It started to interfere with my school as he wouldn’t leave me alone due to his severe emotional dependence. I had ran into some serious issues of my own, and I wasn’t feeling absolutely anything for him anymore. I knew that staying would only be more damaging to him in the long run. 

      He disappeared for about two weeks a couple days after I ended things because he was in a psychiatric hospital. He now sends me huge paragraphs about how he still has hopes about when we’re getting married and how he constantly thinks about our kids. He sends me messages like “I saw you today ☺️❤️❤️” with some seemingly forced overwhelming positive tone.

We will lose good people because of terrible decisions.  However I have people close to me who believe that this will lead to retaliation. They fear that I will get a demotion, or moved to a different position, or given a large work load all in an effort to force me to quit.  I have also considered typing it out and leaving it on my supervisors and/or the CEO’s desk who has an open door policy (truly, I’ve gone to him many times, even for personal issues) 

Looking for any advice people may have.  Thank you all for your time. ",30Sep2018,1

I want to work somewhere that feels like a family.  I want to move up to bartender which isn't happening here.  I was in training for 6 months because I'd get paid less.

139,"Hello, I'm a 23 year old gay woman. I recently got out of a long term relationship. I was with my ex girlfriend for almost three years. We went through College together, moved to a new city together and then broke up six months later. We had planned to get married and were very in love for a while, went through a lot together and were very committed but things fell apart in a pretty disastrous way. 

I fully recognize that the relationship was unhealthy and I'm happy to be single. My life is going really well. I have a career I love, I'm getting my Masters degree, I have friends and a puppy and I'm healthy and happy with generally good self esteem. However, I'm plagued with this deep omnipresent anxiety about not finding a good relationship. I've always wanted to be in a happy, committed relationship and to have a family at some point. I really thought my ex would be that person, and now that I realize she isn't, I can't stop obsessing over when/how/if I will ever meet the right person. It's not that I'm uncomfortable being alone - right now it's fine. I just want to badly to know that I'll meet someone I can be happy with at some point not too long from now.

Is it unreasonable to have this high anxiety about it at a relatively young age? Does anyone else have experience with this? I find myself thinking about my good times with my ex, and even though so much of it was fucked up, we also had a ton in common and a really special connection. I feel like I rarely meet people I'm genuinely attracted to, let alone people who meet my criteria for a relationship. (Gay, single, smart, good chemistry, similar values, etc.) All around me I see people getting married and coupling off, but I also see plenty of cool women in their twenties and thirties who still haven't met the right person. 

It fills me with so much fear. Any advise welcome. ",30Sep2018,1
140,"So there’s a coworker we’ll call A. Him and I aren’t super close but a few months ago, he said some really nice things when he found out that my ex and I broke up. 

I think he’s really sweet and kinda cute. Today is his birthday, I Facebook messaged him “hey A, happy birthday! Just wanted to wish a great person a great day” 

And he said “aww thanks X, I really appreciate it! I didn’t do much I just went to the bar after work with B (another coworker) :) Here’s my number if you ever need to reach me (xxx)xxx-xxxx” 

I don’t know if I respond through fb or through text. I was thinking either:

Thru fb: I’m glad you did something to celebrate! Mines (xxx)xxx-xxxx, if I have yours you should have mine :) 

Or thru text: hey A, it’s X. Glad you did something to celebrate! Also I figured if I have your number you should have mine :) 

I really hate small talk through text and don’t wanna initiate a conversation with asking more questions or saying something to elicit a conversation.

We ended up dating for a year and it was the hardest but best year of my life
I could feel he loved me and cared about me because of the way he treated me

Couple weeks before the relationship ended we stopped getting along.
I think it’s because we spent so much time together we never gave time to cater to our own needs 

I love him so much and even after we broke up I screwed up big time by yelling at him and constantly texting him.

The only reasoning I know for this behavior is that he hurt someone in the past (he is in highschool which makes this strange) and apparently never wants to hurt anyone again (never stated whether he meant to hurt that person or if it was an accident).

148,"So about a month ago, I noticed that my girl - We've liked eachother since we met and have acted like a couple for a long time. I had planned to ask her aunt for permision to date her the weekend after it all happened - had posted a GIF on her twitter that said something in fhe lines of, ""It reminds me of him, but without the happily ever after."" I though it was directed towards me and it instantly ruined my day. Later that night, I started putting pieces together and came to the conclusion that it couldn't have possibly have been directed towards me. I had a bitter feeling about the situation and signed into her Instagram. (We had eachothers names as our passwords) I went to her DM's and saw that that same day she had messaged her ex. She had sent him a picture and he replied with ""I promise :)"" according to her, she had told him to watch a movie. I scrolled up and saw that she had exchanged short conversations with him and they had been planning to meet up for months! I was so upset and I was going to ask her what all of that was about. 

Well after seeing that, I asked her if she followed him on ig. She me told me that she did. Just a couple of months before, She found out that I was following my ex. She didn't tell me to unfollow her but I could tell that it made her uncomfortable so I immediately unfollowed her out of love for my girl. Well I asked her if she had talked to him recently and she told me that they hadn't talked in months (lie). I asked if he would ever swipe up on her story and she told me that he would but that she would never reply. (which was a lie too) I was hurt because I knew that she wasn't telling me the truth but I didn't make a big deal out of it and told her I was going to sleep.

As I was going to sleep, I got a notification from instagram on my iPad. I had forgotten to sign out and it was a message from her ex. I opened it and he had just swiped up on her story. He said ""You never tell me when you're in town."" I waited and she replied ""For why?"" He said ""nvm"" what she said next through me off. She said ""You have a whip"" he said ""yeah why?"" She said ""Let's go visit my mom."" To the cemetery, she lost her mom two years ago. At that moment I was torn. We have a long distant relationship and have been talking for 9 months. She had just told me that she never replied when she swiped up. She asked him if he had a car and if they could go pay a visit to her mom, something that I hadn't even had an honor to do.

I confronted her about it, we argued back and fourth over text for about an hour and it was her just defending herself and trying to minimize the situation as if it were no big deal. I didn't get an apology until I asked her if she even felt bad.

Her reason for wanting to meet up with him was because she wanted to have closure with him. To my knowledge, he left her without a reason last summer. They never dated but definitely acted as a couple from what I know kind of like how things are with her and I right now.

I agreed to being okay with her having closure because I believe everyone deserves to know why things happened the way they happened. She never told me she was doing it though. It was always me asking, ""Hey so are you gonna have closure with him?"" ""When?""  Etc. She didn't communicate any of it to me. It was always me fishing the information out.

Just last week, we talked. We both said that ever since that day everything had started going downhill. I told her what I felt. I asked her if she was still texting him. She told me that she was. I was done. After everything that had happened, after telling her countless times how I felt about her having contact with him, she could not let him go. I told her how much it all hurt, but how I was still willing to put it aside. All I asked was that she stop talking to him. She told me how it's hard for her because they were bestfriends and a bunch of other stuff that didn't make sense. She says that they're acquaintances. That she has no feelings towards him. But it's hard to trust her. She tell's me that she loves, but she isn't willing to let him go. Does she really love me? I'm stuck, I need advice, and I don't know what to do. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!",30Sep2018,1

We click so well, love family, go on vacations together, support eachother like crazy and talk about serious issues and how to resolve them with eachother.

Here’s the problem: he broke up with me once and almost again about three months ago because of personal issues he was dealing with. He tried to push me out of the picture like one more tick of his to-do list. A month after he tried to break up with me, I felt extremely insecure in our relationship; like he could have done it again at any moment. I was ok for the other two months after getting some couples counseling. Randomly, all day today, I felt so insecure. I felt like he was going to leave me, like he wasn’t interested anymore, and I was sick to my stomach. I had no reason to feel this way, but I did. 

I hate this so much because our relationship is truly kick-ass and he is truly the most special person in my life (I have a shit family). It’s annoying and makes me feel even worse because it isn’t fair to him at all that I feel like this.

Me: this nba player is not playing basketball as well as he should  
Friend: shut up man, you got a credit union instead of a regular bank.

I try to apologize and explain what I meant and he just looks pissrd off. Not even an hour later I shake it off and try to approach him now that everyones calm. I say that id appreciate not being yelled at when I am willing to hear him out about anything, especially if something I'm doing or saying huts him.

I say I just would prefer not to be snapped at, and he says ""yeah I could be much worse"".

It would be different if he was being sexiled, or are serious issues with his room/bed, but as far as i know there are no issues with his respective room and roommate (i live in the opposite room not with him). 

This in most circumstances wouldn't be an issue, except at night. He tends to fall asleep to documentaries without headphones on full blast. On top of this, the man snores like a bear. Both combined make it hard to sleep at night since the couch is just a few feet and a thin wall away from my bed. This also translated to the morning yesterday where he also blasted videos at 9 am, coincidentally waking me up too. I usually don't care about waking up early and such, but i like doing that by my own choice not by a roommate

Some more background here, this roommate I've only lived with for a week and i find that he doesn't listen well to others and has a general sense of laziness. He hasn't made the bed in his own room (no sheets or nothing) and hasn't unpacked a majority of his stuff from move in day. These rooms are expensive (800+) so idk why he even would want to choose the couch. 

He has a small mental problem which i do not know what it is. He is a larger guy and i don't want to get extremely upset over this and make situations worst. I just want him to sleep in his own room.

I'm currently trying to see if i keep my LED lights on in my room to see if that makes him reconsider sleeping in his own room opposed to the bright lights. Please let me know what would be the best way to go about this from here on, or what else to say/do? Thank you!",30Sep2018,1

I've never been in a genuine relationship.

160,"Background story: This is going to be long. 

I was engaged to my girlfriend of 3 years about 4 years ago. Up until this point, things had been going great. We were both happy, looking forward to the wedding, talking about kids; really nothing dramatic or crazy. Then we went to a bible conference and she really had the desire to go on a mission trip. This particular mission trip would only send you to places in the US. We had talked about it but wanted to do it together after we were married. After this event though, she decided to go a different route. It devastated me. After some thought that night, I decided I would do it too (I had wanted to do it anyway.) So we decided to end it a month before we would leave. I went to Arizona and she to Tennessee. 

Jump forward to the next year. We have the option of doing another two year commitment where we would be in a seminary type thing for a year, and then lead a group the second year. That first year we lived together with about 3 other people and things were fine. But it quickly made me realize that I was not over her. We talked about it several times and I could see that she was not interested. It was very hard for me since I was still in love with her though and having to see her every day was very hard. 

Jump forward another year. We are getting our assignments for our final year and all of us that had decided to go were all sent to Oklahoma. Herself and I included. We just finished up that final year and now I feel like we can finally be together, at least that's my mindset. I see her fairly often, all of our same friends hang out. From what I know, she is dating a guy right now long distance and I cannot see it working out because he has another 3 years in the military; they haven't been together long. And I know it must be hard for her. 

What I am trying to get at is these past for years have been hard for me because I have yet to find another girl who I can see myself spending the rest of my life with. I know the process takes time and I have dated other girls since then, but it always comes back to her. She was the woman of my dreams. I don't need a tactic of how to win her back because I feel that will (if even available) happen naturally. But I can't keep living in this fantasy of a future with her if she's moved on beyond anything involving us. I will tie myself in knots for years. If you guys have any advice on how to move on or what I can do I would appreciate it.

I got a message from an unknown account after that saying sorry. For the several months following, it was quiet.

166,"This is more for me than anything, i just want to write this down somewhere.

This is an extremely scattered and dumb rant. If you want to be entertained, i suggest you just read another post on this sub

Ok so im a sophmore in highschool, and ive basically known almost everyone in my grade since middle school, and I'm pretty close to a lot of the guys. Dare i even say, popular.

However, girls are a different story. It's not like they hate me or anything, we get along absoloutely swell in a group setting. But when it comes to speaking to them 1-1 i freeze up and i completely have no words to carry on the conversation.

I'm not the most conventionally attractive guy (one of the only asians in my grade and im pretty short 5,5) 

Regardless, when i freak out i just seem to spit out things that i probably shouldnt be saying, just in a desperate attempt to keep the conversation going. Example, making a joke about some guy in our year, which gets laughs but i dont feel like thats something healthy to do. 

When im in a group setting, there are other people i can fall back on, but 1on1 i cant.

Im also told im pretty funny, but my humour mostly leans towards the very dark themes  which a lot of girls are less a fan of.


The second thing is, i have absoloutely no sense of what girls are feeling or thinking. 'Do they like me? Hate me? Neutral? Am i getting friendzoned now? ' these questions constantly boggle my mind after ive finished speaking to a girl.
 I always try to think pesimistically to try and reduce the pain if or when i find out something negative but i always tend to lean to the optimistic side and build this stupid fantasy in my mind and get incredibly dissappointed

Examples of this. A gorgoues girl in my grade (9/10) began talking to her friends about how hot i was, and soon the news spread to me. I wasnt extremely fond of her personality so i didnt really have any feelings for her before. But i my mind was in absoloute chaos, i couldnt believe what these people were telling me, as ive never had a boyfriend. I was in complete denial, yet so optimistic at the same time. To the point where she came up to me and told me she found me attractive. But im shorter than her. So theres a sort of wall there( from her point, not mine, i was completely fine with it)

Long story short: i didnt do anything , i could hardly maintain a 1 to 1 conversation with her, so a date wouldntve worked out either way. Few  days pass and she dates one of my friends.

This doesnt really kill me. I dont really care now looking back at it, it wouldve never worked out. I only found her looks as a positive quality.



Tldr; never had a girlfriend. i suck at talking to girls 1on1 and my brain overthinks every situation.

167,"Not really sure what to do about this, and freaking out a little bit. 

So I live in a one story house with my parents, and right outside my window are the garbage cans. Usually it’s not an issue because I keep my window closed most of the time so the smell doesn’t bother me. 

For whatever reason there are almost always fruit flies around the bins because my family composts a lot of fruits and veggies. This does not usually bother me either. 

HOWEVER, I left my window open one day while I was at work because I was starting to notice that because my window was always closed and the curtain always drawn that my room was starting to feel a little musty. So I open the window, fresh air, no big deal right? 

Well a few fruit flies got into my room, which I figured wasn’t an issue because I keep my door open usually and I don’t keep food in my room so I thought they’d venture off eventually, however, that hasn’t happened, and a few fruit flies has turned into a lot of fruit flies just hanging out in my room. It’s gotten to a point where I can hear them buzzing if I stay quiet. 

I have done everything I can think of, I’ve emptied the garbage cans both in my room and outside, I’ve moved the outside cans away from my window, I’ve sprayed bug spray, I’ve left the window and door open so they can leave, and they are still there! 

Any advice on how to get fruit flies out of my bedroom would be awesome so I don’t have to keep sleeping in my guest bedroom, I miss my bed. ",30Sep2018,0

I was hoping to just grab some help and/or advice on what to do and im really sorry this is long..... ive been interested in being a military pilot since i was 10 years old here in Australia. I didnt do well in school and had some home problems that made me drift off and look for something easier to do in life like business and such.

I studied business for a while and i really didnt like it and then foubd myself interested in engineering which i really like but not something i see myself doing for the rest of my life. I only came back from a trip down to melbourne (i flew there) recently and just relised how much i loved flying and my passion resurfaced again. I recently did an hour flight lesson kind of thing and just fell in love with it even more..... 

I have decided to go back and do my HSC (Highschool certificate) so that i am eligable to be a pilot for the RAAF but ive hit abit of a speed bump.... all around me i hear people say is ""ooh wow well good luck alot of people go for that and alot of people fail"" or ""thats going to be really hard are you sure you can do it?"" So my question is what can i do?

 I spoke to the recruitment agency and they said get references and a hsc other then that there is nothing you can do and i have very good references (CEO,Managing directors and managers from our international company) but if i dont get through as a pilot for the RAAF what other options can i take to become a pilot? I have the passion and the determination to become one but i know there are hundreds of other people out there like me. (I dont really care what it is, i just want to fly and be in command of a helicopter or plane.)

I am a mature student applying to university for the same program I dropped out of previously in 2013.
Since that time I have had two children and completed one certificate college course as well as one year of a bachelor of science in nursing.
I failed one class in nursing and the rest of my marks were the bare minimum to pass.
In my first round of university in 2013 I failed some classes as well, but my grades were not bad across the board and I was achieving 80% in some classes.

My transcripts make me look horribly inconsistent and I want to express in an admissions letter that my circumstances outside of school greatly affected my performance and that I am in a better place now and finally on track to be successful.
I lost two friends to suicide during my initial university attempt and spiralled into depression during that time, i had a history of ill managed depression and anxiety, and I was also living five hours away from my family and friends so I had to deal with my grief alone.
I dropped out at the end of second year after missing two final exams because I was in what I believe was a marijuana induced state of psychosis and I was in the first trimester of a pregnancy without realizing it. If you’ve ever been pregnant you understand that that first trimester kicks your ass; I was exhausted and emotional and violently ill. Days blended together, I showed up for exams a day late, therefore missing them entirely, I was a mess.
(For the record, the moment I found out I was pregnant I stopped smoking weed and my son was born healthy and happy).

When I returned to (a different) school to get my pre health certificate I was in an emotionally and financially abusive relationship with the my sons father  who had a substance abuse problem. During the course of the certificate program and the first year of nursing I took my son and left his father, moved back in with my parents, and gained sole custody. This meant moving my belongings by myself, struggling to find child care because I couldn’t afford daycare, meetings with my lawyer constantly, harassment from my ex, depression and anxiety, financial crisis as my ex had risen my credit card debt to 10k and while we were still together I had to use my student loan to pay our rent because he was not contributing.
The list of drama goes on, it was a bad time, and on top of all of that I was still attending 5am clinicals at the hospital and staying for 8pm biology labs.
Although my transcript doesn’t reflect it,  I worked my ass off and I’m proud of passing all of my classes (except one) despite the bullshit I was going through.

I am applying for a BA program in psychology with intent to complete a masters and eventually a PhD. My experience as a student nurse affirmed that the mental health aspect of health care is my passion and I am certain that I have more to offer in that field.

So I used to hang out with this girl I met where I was working as an intern. Initially she was the one who contacted me on Facebook and so we began to talk more and more eventually hanging out a couple of times (going on hikes, going to the movies). At first I didn't think much of it but after awhile I started to have feelings for her. The problem is that I never made a move and I think she became disinterested in me. She eventually ghosted me for a while until we hung out again at a museum. I wanted to tell her that I had feelings for her but she brought up how she was seeing someone and then proceeded to ask me if I was too. I told her no and just enjoyed the rest of the day hanging out with her kinda bummed out . After that I never heard from her again. I tried texting her once but she never replied. 

So after a while I decided I was going to do something to get her attention or at least hint that I liked her. It was ""f it"" kind of thing where I made the decision to send her flowers with a gift to her house (Hindsight probably not the best idea). Even then, I never heard back from her. 

I know that maybe I made the mistake of not making a move. I actually regret this big time. Should I try to see if I have another chance by contacting her or is it just too late? 

Honestly, its been on my mind a lot to the point in which it keeps me up at night making me feel like a failure or idk maybe im being dramatic or I need to get over the whole thing and move on. What do you think? Sorry for the long post and for the writing style. Thanks everyone. ",30Sep2018,4
183,"She was always a role model to me growing up. She was the star of family gatherings, very talented and passionate person. Long story short, after she peaked in HS, she got accepted into a great college in Chicago. She met a guy, moved in with him in DC, he the got deployed leaving her with two kids to never come back. Ever since then, she’s been downhill.

 She was so close to getting her bachelors but never went back because she owed about $900 for whatever. My parents spared her the cash but apparently she never paid it. It’s important that she finishes school because my wonderful mother, with not a lot of money, is a co-signer on her student loans and there is no indication that she even wants to finish school. She’s a lazy mess, holding down a job she despises, and gaining a large amount of weight as she often spends her free time scrolling through Instagram and Snapchat. She’s not dumb and she’s doing a great job raising the boys, but it’s such a shame what life reduced her to. Like, she just moved out of my parents home at 28 after absolutely destroying it. They were blind to the chaos but I noticed the wear on everybody’s psyche when I was back from school. It was crazy when I left and why I was so eager to leave, and it only got worse.

I know that I should love her unconditionally but I want the best for my whole family. 

I’ve only tried to help her change her negative thought patterns, recommending yoga and meditation. She’s reluctant for yoga but I’ll get her to start doing it with me. Ive tried to get her in the gym with me but I feel that I scared her off with my intensity and lack of patience.

Can you offer any advice? Is it even my place to get involved or should I let her live and learn?

That year I decided to just go to school the year after. Which is now this year. I am currently studying in my local city, where my parents live. But for some reason, some how, I also just don't like it here. The thing is in the gap year that I took, I discovered that I really wanted to study an International Bachelor in a different city.

The thing is, I want to go try apply for the International Bachelor in the different city again. And I'm not sure what to do right now, it is the same studies, but in a different city and in English. I don't know why, but my hearts tells me to do it. And lately I've also been thinking of dropping out now. I don't know why, but in my mind suddenly an idea popped out of dropping out now to follow an extra English course and get my driver's license (my grandma really wants me to). This idea kinda frightened me, because I didn't want to be left with no studies again, for the second time! And also afraid for what other people might think, especially my grandma or my family. But my heart just tells me to drop out now, I really don't know why. Because I like it, I like the courses. But the main important thing is, I think it is better for me to study in a different city in English, because my dream is to go to America and study/work there. And I think the International Bachelor will prepare me for that. I know a lot of people might probably think I'm stupid or that I'm a failure. But I know what I want, I know what I truly desire.

187,"Hello,

I've been having a bit of dilemma so I thought I might share my situation and ask for advice/opinions on how you guys would handle this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in February, my ex and I split. We split pretty amicably, and lived together for a couple weeks before she moved out. Since we were under a lease together, she paid for rent as much as she could, but I was still left paying for bills (including her phone) and a couple months of rent. Sucks but oh well.

We had three cats, one aged 6, the other two were brothers and 1 1/2. We ended up agreeing that she would take the two brothers, and I would keep the older one. I tentatively agreed to keep the cats for up to 3 months after February while she got situated, but 3 months came and went and she hasn't been able to afford them; she struggles with working anything over 20 hrs a week at minimum wage (7.25 here). Recently, my parents were willing to take care of the two younger ones for a bit while I switched apartments, and it dawned on me just how much emotional and financial stress the other two are causing me.

I texted her last week about possibly re-homing them; she was surprisingly OK with it, but then hit me later with it ""feeling like when her dog died all over again."" She thinks it'll be 3-5 more years until she can afford to move somewhere that would allow pets (her current apartment doesn't). I've felt horribly conflicted since. I'm about to graduate college in May and hopefully start a career that I'm really excited for, but it'll have to be in a bigger city. Which means living options that support that many cats might be more expensive and rare.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** I'm taking care of my ex's cats. I made verbal promise to keep them for her for up to 3 months, but it's looking like I'm stuck with them for several years.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see it, I only have a few options:

\- Start trying to rehome the cats now

\- Try to rehome the cats sometime between April and May, giving her as much time to scrap something together

\- Keep the cats until she's able to take them

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys have any advice for how to proceed I'd appreciate it. I care about these cats, but it's getting tough to keep taking care of them.

196,"Hi, I'm a 20 year old Male &amp; this is gonna go a bit long. (I would really be grateful if you could go through this fully, and give me some advice. Thanks in advance) 

First, About Me,
I'm really tall, my height being 6'5, but I'm somewhat skinny when related to my height. I have a very fair skin tone. (Mentioning these just to give a picture of myself) But I've always had this inferior thought process that I'm not attractive to any one from my childhood. And to back this up, I've never been that good at making friends irrespective of gender. I do have my fair share of friends, but all of them are guys and in almost all the circumstances, they were the ones to start the conversation or initiate the effort to start the friendship. I don't feel free with people that I'm not close with. But as time passes and I start to feel comfortable with people, and then they see the real me. It's not like I'll ignore those I'm not close with or disrespect them, but I know that I'm a different person entirely when I feel comfortable with someone. 

As I've never been good at initiating conversations or making the first move, I've not been able to make female friends. (Can't even talk to them, other than when it's an absolute necessity) 

Just like any normal person do, I've had girls in my life, whom I've been crushing on, but I don't speak to them, though I really want to. I don't even see them when they see me (I get caught easily as I'm tall). It gives me a thought as if they'll think I'm stalking them. If they find my eyes searching for them, maybe they'll misjudge me for it. I don't want people to think of me as intimidating. I just want to be friendly, but I don't know how to express it. When I want to approach a girl in a friendly way too, my mind goes like, ""What if she thinks I'm hitting on her? What if she makes wrong conclusions about me? What if she finds my gigantic presence intimidating? What if she feels insecure or uncomfortable in my presence?"" and then I end up not making a move.

The things I've mentioned above could have given you a thought that I'm a complete introvert nerd whose life is adventureless and boring, but It's in this social phase of my life that my mind goes into an awfully overthinking mode. 

In the rest I feel completely normal, like I have my career goals and I focus on them and have achieved it (this far) without any issues. I have a balanced relationship with my parents. I am really happy and comfortable with my close friends. I don't freak out when I have to attend an interview or something like that. I'm not someone who spends his free time simply sitting home. I love travelling and having some adventures. I'm actually over talkative with the people I'm closer to. So I don't have many issues in the other phases of my life. In otherwords, I'm pretty satisfied with the other phases of my life.

But the overall issue is my social phase of life, particularly in initiating relationships or making friends, more particularly with women. I want to change this, but I don't know how to. 

Am I overly overthinking? If that's the case any suggestions to change it? 

Is it wrong to expect girls or anyone for that matter to always make the first move? 
Am I over concerned about what others think about me? 
Am I underestimating myself? 
Or is this perfectly alright?

(Thank you so much, if you read it this far with patience. I would be grateful for any advice that could direct me towards a balanced social life.)

201,"Sorry for the long text, but here goes...

As a young male adult, I find it extremely difficult to make friends.

Am I just a boring person? People tell me I’m a bit quiet/reserved, but when they get to know me, they laugh saying “I’m too much,” in a lighthearted tone. I’ve baked things like muffins, cookies, cupcakes, cheesecake, etc for family, neighbors, and coworkers, ALL FOR FREE. Several have told me that it’s all delicious and some family members have told me to open a bakery.

The handful of people I’ve hung out with don’t really seem to care about me, which sounds narcissistic, but the rare occasions I happen to hang out with someone, I try to listen to their stories and let them talk, and try to ask them interesting questions. Also, 100% of the time I’ve hung out with others, I was the person that initiated plans. I asked them if they wanted to do this, or do that. Most disagreed, others flaked on me, and the times they agreed, I rearranged my schedule to work under theirs.

I’m scared that this desperation is becoming obvious when I’m lucky enough to have lunch with a coworker or whomever. I know you can’t force people to like you, but I’ve spent several nights crying my eyes out, not being able to sleep over this. I just want to feel wanted, and not for giving away free food, or busting my ass off at work.

My heart would melt if a coworker or stranger simply asked me to grab a cheep coffee at some mediocre cafe/bakery. And I’d probably bawl my eyes out if someone baked something for me, even if it was burnt or tasted bad.

Having zero friends is taking its toll on me.

Every time that happens I go down a path of self destruction. I whore around going to gay sex clubs, bath houses or some random guy's home.

Almost every time they offer me drugs before sex and I can never say no because I'm already high on something when I go out and they give it to me for free. I've been given almost every hard drug in the book, cocaine, GHB, meth, XTC, Speed, Pep, Ketamine etc. and often many of them at the same time.

One time I got so high during a threesome in a bath house I could just lay there half-conscious. I know it sounds bad but I'm not an addict or anything. The thing is when I am in these situations highly inebriated I lose my common sense and almost say yes to anything so I've often had sex without condoms, even with HIV-positive guys because I just trust them when they tell me they're undetectable.

Over the years - whenever I have been stressed - I have had the bad habit of picking at it. Where I have picked most hair loss has occured which looks to be permanent. It's asymmetric, and does not look good.

I'd like to be able to shave my head to hide the asymmetry of my hair loss, but of course then the flakey inflamed scalp is visible.

Another option I've been considering is a hair transplant. But I am only 23, so I might perhaps be too young for that considering my natural pattern balding may continue.

I used to confidently own my hair loss, until just a few months ago when my hair loss accelerated and the flakey scalp became visible all the time. At the same time I've balded quite a bit on my right side, and significantly less on my left side. So now I cover up, and I am less confident.

I mostly wear a caps now. But it's not always possible. I'd like to be able to not cover up - particularly in a professional setting where a caps may not be appropriate - but I know that awful hair and a flakey scalp is also not particularly professional.

The room is crowded with two cribs and a bunch of clothes theown about. My boyfriend sleeps next door in his brothers room. In total, there are four boys that ahare that room. His parents sleep in the LR. 

We moved in here after being scammed out of an apartment. I am the one with the job.

I appreciate the kindness of his parents for hosting us. This stay comes with a lot of pain. There are a few fights in this home per day. His sister that lives down tbe street is constantly starting arguments when she visits. Mind you, I watch her three children all the time. They actually come to me when upset. They call me mom. 

I am multiethnic from a well to do family. Yet, I constantly hear his mom and sister put Black people down. This family is on welfare. Yet, they paraphrase negative things with black. For example, the black ghetto. Microaggressions. I hold my breath. 
The mother frequently loses her mind and screams randomly at the top of her lungs when upset. She pays all her boys( not the girls) phone bills. My boyfriend is 32. I have to send out resumes for him because he does not know how to look for a job. I have to look for rhe apartment because he does not know how to look for an apartment. 

My manoves me and wants me to stay in a relationship with him. I do because finding a man rbat wants to commit nowadays is hard. Despite all the necessary things that he and I lack right now, he wants me to get pregnant. 

Still, a major reason for the fights is him. He wants me to do nothing wirhout him. This means that I miss out on yoga. I miss out on going to classes led by my favorite Rabbi.  And, if a man shows a y interest in me, he will tbrow a temper tantrum for two days straight. In these tantrums, he insults and threatens  his oarents and siblings. Essentially, I. am allowed no life without him. 

What brought me to write this is this. Last night I sent him info about two hiring events.  I wanted to attend. I need a second gig. He threw a fit for four hours. Post fit, he wanted to sneak sex in. I was not turned on. 

I stay because commitments are hard to come by. He is loving. I do love him.  Yet, I can't stand his tantrums. It is also difficult to deal with the daily screaming matches in his home that sometimes become physical. And....these Microaggressions. I can't. This blessing feels more like a curse.

Also, I like to look very put together all the time and some of my friends have told me that that + the combination of the things I mentioned before can make it seem like I'm either mean/disinterest in people/think too highly of myself... Which isn't the case at all.

So my question is: how to appear more approachable? Or maybe even more importantly - how to get rid of the fear that people don't like me or think I'm weird?

I don't have any of those issues after I get really close with someone. But I would love to be able to just be overall social, be my true me around others from the start and not worry about what they might be thinking about me.

Toffee


Dear toffee, 

Some things in life are inexpressible, not to yourself, your friends, your mum, dad, or siblings; a sparce, rarely sighted feeling and that cannot be explained or spoken. Many have not felt it or can understand, but the people in this house have all been touched by it. We did not choose to have it, we did not ask for it, look for it, or exepect it. It followed us all through the most important and difficult years of each of our lives, even if we couldnt see it at the time, in the end it was still there. 

You carried the weight of childhood, adolescence, adulthood on your back, but you had time for each of us however much we disagreed. You blessed us all with your curiosity, spontinuity, tranquility, and affection. You gave us the most wonderful and humbling gift we will come to cherish; the memories we shared with you. You will not be forgotten.

I was not there when it happened. I dont like how i said my goodbye, and i wont forget that. But we shared a bond that could not be broken, and it will not brake. You will always be my friend, and i will take you with me in my memory.

You aren't here anymore. But the inexpressible relationship we all have with you will remain with us as if you were still tugging on your lead next to us. The feeling stays here forever in your name. The feeling will be remembered as love.
  We love you.",30Sep2018,1

238,"so I’m stuck and I need some advice. I’ve been having personal issues for a long time, and they’ve gradually become worse with the years and as school is now more demeaning than ever it feels like I can barely go through it. I’m home at about 6 every day, and I have homework that needs to be done, food that needs to be cooked, and then I also need to take care of myself. I find it very hard to keep everything together, and I feel that I am failing at all of those things. I have no time over to relax and be with myself, and constantly being surrounded by people makes everything much worse in my case since I’m a true introvert and socially anxious. at school I have to juggle effort to be attentive, learn and do well and be productive as well as keep myself acting and looking like the idea of who I am, presenting an image to my friend and class companion that can’t be broken. I need to listen to her, to the teachers, as well as I’m struggling to keep the outside and inside noise out, and besides this there’s too many impressions to take in and so I tire myself just on the day to day with things that shouldn’t be tiresome. then there’s the train, and the process of getting home, and as I explained I can’t relax at home either. I feel that I’m falling apart literally, and that there’s nothing I can do about it because the things that are exhausting me are things I can’t escape. I feel that I am sick, but that I could never explain to anyone how, or that nobody would even understand it correctly if I tried because I’m the worst at expressing myself. ",30Sep2018,1
239,"Hey everybody. I know the title might sound alarming - it's not as serious as it might sound. 

I'm a student, and my program requires a good deal of self-motivation. An issue I've grappled with, however, relates to sleep. In the morning, when I wake up, I usually just don't feel like getting up. But I'm not tired, and I usually can't fall back asleep. Still, I'll stay in bed for much longer than necessary. Once I wake up, I can stay awake and generally focused, but by the afternoon I'd rather just take a nap. I'm never hungry in the morning, either, so I can't really incentivize myself with breakfast. 

I can continue like this, it isn't a massive issue. But I think I'd probably benefit from a little more will to get up in the morning. I was thinking about trying to go to bed earlier, or something like that. Maybe that would help. 

Have you experienced something similar? If so, what did you do to address this issue? What worked/didn't?",30Sep2018,1
240,"My 18th birthday just passed and on Wednesday I will be moving out and into a friends house that lives a few hours away because I’m unwanted in my house. I don’t live with my parents, I live with my aunt. I’ve been with her for about a year and a half so it’s not like she raised me.

But I still don’t know how to tell her. She is super, super irrational and will resort to cursing you out over any little thing. I never backtalk her because I’m scared to. But she still acts like I’m the worst person alive because I spend a lot of time in my room and now she’s talking about how it makes her super uncomfortable to have me in the house.

I’m always in my room because she treats me like shit. I get treated differently than her kids, but she says I’m just crazy and need therapy even though EVERYONE can see it. One time she kicked me out for 6 months for no reason other than she could. She obsesses over my finances even though she herself hasn’t had a job for a year. I worked 39 and a half hours a week all summer and saved up about 1200$ but somehow I’m lazy and irresponsible 

Wednesday night my friends mom is coming to get me and I’ll be living with them. I have until tonight to tell her bc I spoke with my guidance counselor to get my transcript and such to switch schools (I’m a senior) and she said she’s giving me until Monday to tell her or she’s gonna call and tell. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve been so stressed I’ve been breaking out. I get one pimple like once a year. My stomach is always upset. I can feel the stress affecting me.

I’m just scared to tell her bc she’s super irrational. Any advice would be appreciated.",30Sep2018,0

243,"Bit of backstory first.
I've struggled with depression for years, but never sought help, I used crossdressing as an escape and then started to get attention from people so carried it on. I never enjoyed it, it was never really ""a part of me"".

Anyway, right. So, last May I lost a job I enjoyed as I had a mental breakdown in the shop and tried to slit my wrists in front of 2 customers and the store owner. I went off the rails with heavy drinking and drugs. I ended all that pretty soon, and then in October last year, I crossdressed for the final time.

I met an amazing woman back in November of last year, we hit it off straight away and have been inseparable ever since. She knew about everything from the get go. I crossdressed infront of her ONCE, just to see what she was like with it, hoping she'd hate it and that would be the final catalyst to chuck it all out rather than have it around the house. That was true, it happened. We fell madly in love, and I helped her with her flat, got her a microwave, kettle, toaster and a fair bit of other stuff so she could have some standard of living. Then, in August this year, I felt my depression coming back, but ignored it. And then on Friday 21st September me and my girlfriend were looking at houses, planning on moving in together. That night, after she went bed, I started to get the crossdressing feelings come back, so I went and told her. We were fine Saturday, she went to a family event, we were fine when she got up Sunday, and then we split up, out of the blue. All she can tell me is ""It's because of the crossdressing"" and she won't even reply to any messages now. I've got nearly a full flat worth of stuff at hers, and she won't talk to me to sort it out. I'm not a crossdresser, it isn't a part of me.

Anyway, this has caused me to spiral and on Friday 28th September I ended up at hospital in fear of killing myself. She still won't talk to me, and I really don't know what to do. I love this woman more than I've ever loved anything before. If I send her a message, she just reads it, same with Snapchat. She never deleted me off Facebook either, so I don't even know whether to think it's truly over and to move on, or to think she's shut down and doesn't know what to do herself.

This woman, she has her own mental health issues, and I've been there for her through them. She was previously sectioned due to how bad her Psychosis was.

In regards to my mental health, I'm on some tablets now, and awaiting counseling.

I really don't know what to do anymore...",30Sep2018,1

247,"I’m planning on starting college next fall since I took off two years after graduating high school. I would like to start sooner than that but I just don’t really have the money to. 

I’ve been researching Zoology and teaching degrees(specially History) and it just seems like the job market really isn’t that great for them. 

Those are my two passions in life. However, I have to look at it with a realistic approach. Mommy and Daddy aren’t paying for my college, at this point I’ve applied to over 100 scholarships to no avail, I don’t get any grants from FASFA due to my parents earning “too” much even though they have to ask my grandmother for rent money every month. 

Even with going to a community college for my first two years and then transferring to a four year university I will still be around 20-30k in debt. I live paycheck to paycheck already, I can’t afford to put student loans on top of that. Not to mention, where I live I don’t have a university near me and the university I’d be attending has inflated housing costs in that area and the dorms are more expensive than the apartments surrounding it. A Zoology degree pretty much requires unpaid internships or volunteer work but I can’t do that because I will have to work every minute I’m not in class to not be homeless. 

This sounds cliche but I have always loved education and animals. I’d love to either work in a classroom or work with animals. The job market for these jobs however, is extremely competitive, low paying and, or, horrendous (teaching.) 

Earlier this year, I was almost homeless following a car accident. It happened 7 months ago and I am only now bouncing back financially. This has left me with an extreme fear of spending money and trying to save every penny I can. I can’t even go see a $10 movie with my boyfriend without feeling guilty and feeling like i’m going to be homeless again for spending ten dollars. 

I wish I could just be normal and get a degree in nursing but I just don’t think it’s worth the money to spend on school when I know I won’t ever enjoy my job.  

I was on the college websites and looking at all the classes you have to take for either history or zoology and I got so excited. I almost started to research those topics on my own! 

Do you think these degrees are worth it in the long run? ",30Sep2018,2

251,"Thank you in advance for any nuggets of wisdom. I’ll supply a little background so you know my situation:

I know this is whack since it’s more about money than having an open, honest conversation, but I feel a bit desperate and probably need help paying for therapy, and I don’t know how to ask him. He’s normally a real tight-ass about money.

I probably already have imbedded issues about rejection due to the way he’s been in the past. I’ve been kinda okay about this tbf, but putting myself out there to get rejected is another level, and I’m scared. We get on well and he’s pretty easy to talk to and emotionally intelligent.

I’m going to ask him not to tell my mum (they’re divorced so I wouldn’t be negatively impacting their non-existent relationship by asking him to keep something from her, imo). She’s a bit of a toxic presence in my life who will not empathise, though I don’t think he knows how much she affects and drains me. She’s very very good in other ways, since, y’know, she raised me without much help from my dad, and probably wouldn’t think twice about helping me pay. She’s just not very good on the emotional side of things and I honestly can’t deal with her right now. Or probably ever to do with mental health stuff, sadly.

252,"Hi Reddit, I’ve been contemplating on what to do for a while now about college and getting a job. Here’s the thing. I really want to become an animator or an illustrator and one day make my own cartoon or comic for the whole world to see. It’s my dream. But here’s the thing, my local college offer an animation and illustration course, but to get on it, you need a level 2 qualification in Art and Design. This could be a GCSE, IGCSE, BTEC or whatever as long as it’s a good pass, you’ll get onto the course. However, I really don’t like the class that I’m currently in. I’m currently doing a level 2 Art and Design qualification at the moment, but have had a few incidents at college already.

The first incident happened BEFORE college even started. It was an introduction/taster day. To cut a long story short. We had to ‘interview’ the people we were grouped with. This one boy didn’t have anyone to go with, so I kindly let him in my group. So we were the only group of three. We had a drawing task and I didn’t know what to draw, so I drew the girl next to me in a cartoony way. He decided to copy my idea of drawing someone. But instead he drew me… in a really ugly way. I knew he was only doing this to make the girls around us laugh. Of course he didn’t consider my feelings and thought it was great to make some people laugh. I found it funny at first, but then he took it way too far. 

The other incident that happened the other day, it was partially my fault. I realise it now that I shouldn’t have asked the question, but I did. I honestly didn’t think it would offend someone so badly. I asked if this person was a girl or a boy. Now before you have a dig at me, this person looked very androgynous. I honestly couldn’t tell if they were a girl or a boy, so I asked. They looked more like a girl, but apparently they were a boy. They had a unisex name and sounded like a girl too. (Well, at least in my opinion) This person got offended afterwards. They told off of me. Again I honestly didn’t think. So then the teacher of the class wanted to speak to me after class. I knew what it was about right away. I think the teacher was a bit too harsh on me though. I did end up crying. She was bringing up stuff about the past (what that boy did) and my weight. I don’t think the teacher particularly likes me anyways. I only have until June to endure it. Should I stick to it or do the next thing?

So I’ve been thinking about dropping out of college and doing a IGCSE in London, but it’s far too expensive for me to keep traveling to London every day and I simply don’t have the money. Also people have told me that London is dangerous and full of pick pockets. I’m also considered a vulnerable person because I have mental health issues and I personally wouldn’t feel safe in London alone. Like what if I was to get my phone out and check on the maps where the location is and then someone snatches my phone? I can’t exactly run after them because of my weight. (Gosh that’s so embarrassing to say) 

So I’m thinking about dropping out of college and giving up on my dream and just getting a retail job or apprenticeship.",30Sep2018,2
253,Hello- Any advice on how to overcome feeling embarrassed (so much so that I have started avoiding social situations) by weight gain?

263,"Hi guys,

Been thinking to seek for advice anonymously for a long time as I worry for both my parents and for myself. Basically what's going is that the past few years me and my family have been on a rough patch with money and not being able to cover our expenses. I am 19 years old working and studying and living with my parents. I make around 400$ a month which is average in my country. Both my parents work, with my dad making a salary double of mine, however they both have huge loans they need to pay out which takes more than half of their salaries a month. My mom works as her own company and her pay varies each month. My dad gives the rest of his salary to her so she can atleast cover most of the monthly expenses such as our apartment which is still being paid off, two loans at the bank that they have a few years left in, rent for moms office room, electricity water and food. On food we cut back a lot with me being the main source for that part. We eat with around 150-200 dollars a month for three adults. We also have two dogs and we get food for them too. 

Now that you know all of that, my parents constantly fight about money and it's really stressing and unhealthy. Everytime I hear them argue I just go away and try not to listen. I'm a second year in Uni and my plans are to get my masters abroad which im trying to save money for but failing miserably due to my home's state. I don't know what to do, I hate seeing my parents being sad and always talking about how we're short of money, even though my mom is sometimes hopefull, but recently is very gloomy about everything. I really need advice on how to help them more than I do now with also trying to save money for my education. This whole thing is having a toll on me and i'm considering stopping school just to work more and help my parents.

Most of the people at this hour are Tweakers, Old gambling addicts,  and prostitute tweakers.  A big part of my job is to be a friendly presence and make every guest feel comfortable and happy. 
A lot of associates on grave shift can be grumpy because of the hours. I believe that smiling can improve my attitude and the attitude around me. I stay really upbeat and dance to the music when I walk and smile  smile smile at everyone I see. From janitor to high roller.
Anyway, the issue... guests and some associates take my small talk, jokes, and positive attitude as a love interest. Mind you my husband also works here and I always am talking about him. I have a few people who don't work in my department but I see every shift that have called me babe and even have asked me out. It makes me really uncomfortable. 
This though,  is worse. The guests. I am a young girl working late at night in a casino I understand that there WILL be old men making crude jokes or drunk people making inappropriate remarks. This is usually okay though,  I expect it but also have boundries. But it's my job. It's my job that I love.
However, what about when they go to far? There is one guest who I see every shift. 40-50's maybe  He never leaves the casino. And always says hello to me and has remarked that my attitude always makes him happy because I'm so positive. However, lately he has been touching me when he greets me. Holding his arm on my shoulder and just being...cringey.

“Dude, there’s a someone fucking standing right behind the glass door outside”

“You better not be messing with me..” 

“I swear dude he’s right outside” 

“fuck ok just call the police go into my room and lock the door”

So I did but when I was about to call I looked outside and he wasn’t there. I disobeyed what she had told me and looked out every window very quietly and turned off all the lights instead. She came out in her robe and she got kinda mad at me for not listening to her cause I could’ve gotten myself hurt. 

She goes on to say that she’s had a stalker for a solid 7 months or so and it’s always off and on. She’s been trying to catch him but couldn’t. I suggested to install cameras or hire security but she just said that it’s too expensive and she won’t be able to pay some bills if she does so. What are her best course of actions about this ? She has called the police on numerous occasions but they couldn’t do anything. She t of me not come over at night anymore cause she doesn’t want me to put myself in danger again. She got me a uber ride home cause she didn’t want me walking out in the dark alone like always. ",30Sep2018,3
271,"I'll start from the beginning, just some context. 

So my mom moved to NC from CT for a man, at the time I was 14 years old. There's complications the moment we moved here, we were living with his mom, they were fighting and it was help the first few months.
We moved into our actual house and at this time I was 15 when my brother(22M) moved in with us. There was a fight btwn them (brother-22, him 35). My mom took the side of him and my brother moved out. During this time he was cheating on my mother and apparently has a kid by another woman DURING the time he impregnated my mother. 

So NOW senior year of high school was awful arguing, yelling, scream just all the time. I graduated and I was going to a College  in NY however my father did not want to help with my education and thus I had to come back to NC. Since I've been back there's still the same shit I'm tired of; arguing, yelling, and ridiculous amount of negativity. I start working for BOA in a month and it pays well 16.59 an hour so I can move out. However I know I'll need a car for sure. Overall my relationship with my mom is shit, awful, we barely talk and there's no support. I feel like she has chosen her boyfriend and I'm sick of it.

**[So what do I do, do I save up for the car first and then move out or move out and then the car.]**

277,"I am female and this post is about my female neighbor.  We are both married, no children, and we both have three dogs.  Also, we are both plus size. I was closer to her size when I met her but recently over the last year I’ve dropped quite a bit of weight and sizes. We have some similarities but more differences. My husband and I get along with her husband, no questions asked. A lot of the times when she is out of town her husband will come over here and have dinner with us, have some beers with us, watch a movie, just hang out. Other times when she has been out of town he invites us over to do the same at his house or some other activity. We have gone out as a couple a few times but I feel like there’s a big elephant in the room. She is a very different person than I’m used to dealing with on a personal level. I wouldn’t pick her to be my friend but I try to stay as neighborly friendly as possible but she is always acting annoyed, or makes gestures at her husband like “I’m over this. Let’s go”.  &lt;—- mid sentence while I’m talking. Something I feel like saying something like “do you realize I can see you? That’s rude”. I don’t say anything because I don’t wanna start any drama. If it wasn’t for her nice husband, I couldn’t care less if we ever interacted with them. I tried talking to her on personal level one on one and it went south quickly. She was on her phone 97% of the time I was talking to her. Fast forward to the next week, I texted her and she never ever responded. I asked her a question about the dates she needed me to watch her dogs. Nothing.  I ended up asking her husband to get me the information and you better believe maybe five minutes after he got home I got a response from her.  Her husband hangs out with us alone pretty often. My husband and I privately talk about how she’s always gone, how he complains about her, and we wonder what’s really going on next-door. We don’t really ask any questions when my neighbor is telling us stuff, we just listen and give advice where it fits. Personally, I feel like she is selfish, and just needed financial assistance in order to live in a beautiful brand new home.  She’s constantly interrupting him when he speaks, she can’t ever be wrong, she has an Instagram account as a blogger and fashionista 😳. She brags about being sponsored by companies and all the perks from being a “public figure”. I sit back and observe her and I’m trying to figure out why all of that is so important to her instead of her husband. I would never put social media, sponsorship, driving 7 hours to meet a celebrity, or anything of that matter in front of my husband. I would like to know how you all would handle this situation. Should I say something to her about her rude and dismissive behavior when I’m speaking or should I just keep the interaction to a minimum and leave it awkward? ",30Sep2018,5
278,"I'll try make this brief as there's some context involved here... My partner (21F) has had a dog named Mollie for the last two years, which her mother agreed to at the time. Mollie is 3 but has always had anxiety and behavioural issues possibly as a result of having 3 different owners already. When she's with people in the house she's generally well behaved but has always been excitable.

She lived in a house with my partner, my partner's mother, brother and her brothers partner too (I live with my own parents separately), and frequently we'd come back to the house to find that Mollie had been chewing on things like the blinds or had been going through the bins and strewn trash everywhere. This was manageable until my partner's mother decided to move away, leaving my partner and her brother and his girlfriend to wholly pay for her mortgage/bills/tax/ etc, but didn't take the dog with her. Despite my partner's brother and his partner saying they would stay at the house, they came home one night to tell my partner that they were moving out the next week, effectively leaving my partner too pay for a 3 bedroom house and care for a dog whilst working as well. 

Luckily however, my partner was able to move to her older brother's house, and his wife convinced him to allow Mollie to follow also. She now lives in a small box room but unfortunately again everybody works the same hours and Mollie is left for 8 hours a day; time she uses to scratch at the kitchen door, which has been shredded at the bottom. She has also had the occasional bathroom accident on the carpet and the couch which has meant my partner has now been forced to give the dog up by her older brother. 

Mollie has had to wear a muzzle now which has hurt her nose, but there's seemingly no other way to stop her biting and clawing at the door, and she constantly whimpers and cries when she's about to be left on her own. When we returned to the house she's incredibly affectionate- licking and jumping up at us, however she's usually also affected the house in some negative way. This has led to my partner's brothers constantly pressuring my partner into giving Mollie up. He's messaging her and asking her every day to find someone to give Mollie to or to give her to a shelter. 

My partner has found someone she works with to take Mollie, and Mollie appears to get along with their dog but needs to hold onto Mollie for another week, which isn't good enough for her brother. 

I don't want her to give Mollie up. I've suggested taking Mollie to a behavioural specialist to try and combat the destructive and anxious behaviour, because I just don't want her to go to a shelter. I'm even willing to rent a place with my partner that allows dogs as we work shifts that mean Mollie would only be alpine for 4 hours a day as opposed to 8 hours) but this just seems like a mega costly alternative. I think my partner has become depressed with all the pressure that's been put on her recently, and she seems to have given up on Mollie, which kills me because I know how much she loves this dog. 

What can we do? I've been sat on this for weeks. Maybe an outside perspective would help. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

294,"Hey all, 

thanks for taking the time to read this.

&amp;#x200B;

Sketch of the situation: two couples moved into my then-current building a few months ago. Since then I've moved to another city to be closer to my job (as I was only really staying because of my then-girlfriend and flatmate).

One of the couples turned out to have similar interests as me so we started stalking, getting along, hanging out, going out.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me get this out there already: I've had a sort of a crush on the girlfriend since I saw her sitting in the front porch of the building having a smoke after just having moved in. 

I've started to develop quite a fancy for this girl over the following few weeks/months, as is obvious - I wouldn't be writing this if I hadn't.

&amp;#x200B;

That couple and me started hanging out more and more, sitting in the flat talking and drinking, watching movies, shows, going out clubbing, ... . Since I've moved halfway across the country, we're not spending that much time together anymore but I occasionally head over to my old city (nightlife \_is\_ better there) and go out clubbing.

And I couldn't help but be under the impression that my feelings for her might be reciprocated. Over the past few months, she's usually been the one asking me if I'm coming over for a night out. She shares her work schedule (works in a bar, so weekend-night shifts) with me pretty much as soon as she gets it to tell me when she can go out and when not.

She's texted me in the middle of the night on some occasions, boyfriend being asleep (dayjob), with the possible selfie. Saying things like she doesn't want to ""smoke (weed) alone"", how she misses the time when we were all sitting in my flat, boyfriend being too zoned out (she literally said that) and the two of us talking. Which is always fun,flirty banter (without me overstepping boundaries - He's right there)

When we're going out, she walks next to me, not next to her significant other. She follows my lead, not boyfriend's (crossing streets, places to go). When we're sitting down at the bar, she doesn't jump straight to the seat that'd put her next to bae. Bae also doesn't move much when clubbing, but crush does not hesitate following in my footsteps if I take off to the dancefloor.

There's been times when she's by herself in the evening (bf working late, for example, or like this week, when he's abroad for a week), and the times I've gone over she's endured wind, rain and darkness to meet me at the train station.

She's been very keen to go for a drink together on these 'alone' occasions, having shown genuine and obvious frustration  when boyfriend called to say he was oscar mike from work, or when we walked into her living room recently and her flatmates were in there (other than in their bedroom as is their usual behaviour).

&amp;#x200B;

Now last week we were in her room sitting on the edge of the bed, having a smoke after she'd cooked for me (didn't even ask, but there was wine as well) (as her flatmates don't want smoke in the living room/kitchen - that's fair) - and at a certain moment she turned herself to me and kept herself there for longer than what could've been comfortable.. and I started leaning in briefly before quickly pulling back - knowing perfectly well that this wouldn't get me what I want, long term. However, she didn't pull away, didn't flinch, and in general seemed a bit confused and off-balance after. She walked me to the bus station to see me off, as I thought that'd be the best call to make at that moment.

Now I'm very well aware that because I am indeed biased, I might be reading too much into this and I might be hoping a bit too much for positive reception.

And the decent thing to do would be not pursuing, I know. Tell that to the boyfriend - swiping on Tinder like there's no tomorrow, and asking me to go out with his girl so he can 'make a proper mess'. I keep pushing \_him\_ to make up his mind and do the right thing (which is breaking up with his girl and then he's free to do whatever without anyone judging) , essentially getting himself out of my way. Mean, backstabbing, but effective.

She, on the other hand, has not always been very positive about boyfriend, either.  Not to the extent where I'm her therapist or something, though.

But she fits my type like she was made-to-order, so I'm motivated. I tend to go for what I want and I'm a firm believer in ""attraction and emotions aren't conscious choices"".

However, diving in and disrupting a relationship will make me look like the bad guy so my intention is to handle this cleanly. Or as clean as possible.

I should stop seeing them, is what some people might say - don't want to hear it. Relationships, friendships, ... are not forever. I'd consider her a far better friend than him, too. Wouldn't be a huge loss if we didn't hang out anymore.

Sure, we might not work out - at least I'd have tried, and I'd know, instead of wondering for a few years and then finding out I should've taken my shot (tally is at 6 currently :P)

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm not alone with this - this place is full of these kinda questions. 

What would you do? How would you? Why?

The title of my post might be misleading, as I'm 100% sure I want to go for this girl, so I probably will. I guess I'd be more interested in how you'd play it out? Or, if you could shed light on the contested party's perspective, how'd you like it to play out if you were the girl in that situation? Like, I understand that if I'd just grab her and kiss her, even if she's very receptive to it and has similar feelings and interest in me, she might (probably \_will\_ ) see me as an invader, a bad guy.

However, with my male brain I'm not going to place myself in her shoes as that'll only confuse me more.",30Sep2018,0

299,"Its been my girlfriend's child hood dream to get married at 18. She's been depressed and crying herself to sleep because both of us are eighteen and not going to be married soon. 

Dont get me wrong I really feel loved to know she wants to marry me that much but this isn't something she should be depressed about. I really want to marry her too but I know where not ready, we're still young. I dont feel comfortable proposing yet, but it's not something im going to hold off for long, I dont want to wait any more than a year or two at the most. Im happy with her in the present and im exited for our future together.

Before we where together her (now ex) proposed to her. The main reason she is depressed now, more than ever, is because her wedding was scheduled for this November. Before that could happen she was forced to realize she would not be happy with him. She doesn't regret the break up but she's still mournful about how close she was to her dream. 

---help---

How can I help her resolve her depression and be happy  with our relationship status before we are married? Or if this wont go away how can I comfort her?

Mabye this will go away after November?

---more background info---

We have an LDR thats one reson I want to wait to propose. I want to be there if my fiance needs me. Its painfull when I cant be there. We have a plan to get an appartment together when we both graduate in May 2019.

We met online but I've visited her before and where plaing to have her visit me in late october or November hopefully.

We talk alot on the phone and with video calls, we talk more than many couples do that aren't in an LDR but its still not the same. Most days my only desire is to hug her.

I do my best to comfort her at night. I stay up late into the night to ensure she falls alseep. If she does start crying I sing to her, wich usually works.
We are very commited to each other, neither of us want to ever break up. 

This issue isn't that serious for us, but it does make life a little more difficult and I want to help her.

Her whole family marries young her parents married at 18.

Both of us really want children too.

We're very intimate, we have a relationship where it feels like its us against the world, we've been thorough alot together in a short time. We often act similar to how a married couple, wich probably makes it more painfull for her she is reminded we're nit married yet.

Sometimes I feel like im holding her back, I feel like I did this to her, I feel so gulty about it sometimes.

Honestly this makes me very depressed too, sometimes I tell myself she would be happier with her abusive ex, simply because she would be married. That's just a depressed thought though.

Im hard on myself and I try to be the best boyfriend I can, I feel like im not enough sometimes. If I was a better man she would be happy. But that's also a depressed thought

When her mother found out she was pregnant, she sent her $100 to a Wal-Mart in Florida (we had no idea where exactly she was living, a goddamned truck for all we know.) and hadn't heard from her since.

Her mother was understandably upset. She does not necessarily want to go to friends of hers for advice on this, so she turned to Reddit as a seemingly viable option for legal help, thanks to her daughter ""suggesting"" it. Here is the link to that: user/APonderedDemand

I had thought this problem minor. People have been attacking her for being a poor mother, a felon, and numerous other deplorable and despicable statements.  
She has made it clear repeatedly, and is obviously very upset and having a hard time. My niece is NOT an easy child to get along with, and her contacting us just recently... I honestly thought she would let it go, as we clearly told her she was not processing the situation correctly. Since her legal attorney never contacted me, I had initially thought this matter through, but it appears I have been mistaken.

I am also worried about her knowing where I live, as apparently my full address was on the IRS printout they ""gave"" to her.

This morning my sister was surprised at her front door by a Barbershop Quartet who sang ""You've been served, Have a fucking nice day!."" and then left, leaving her with a cakebox full of court-documents. I fear someone might try to get in touch with me soon, but if I speak with an attorney immediately, can I still legally be sued?  
Tzbhis is all very new to me.  
I'm a doctor, and when I'm not working or commuting, I spend time with my family. I am not a felon, and certainly not prepared to go to court with some halfwit schizophrenic who has repeatedly been incarcerated and does drugs on the street

&amp;nbsp;

Here is the email she sent earlier last week:

Hi (name), how've you been? I hope you and your family are well. As you probably have heard, I am expecting our second child soon, and if parenting has taught me one thing, it's responsibility.

It was recently brought to my attention that I needed to have reported my dividend income to the IRS on my tax return, and I didn't file a 1040 form in (year), and bc it was more than $1,500 I also need a Schedule B and a 1099 or whatever it is.  
The money counts as transferred assets or income, and the IRS Criminal Investigation Division and Social Security takes this stuff kinda seriously.

Since it is identity theft, I needed to report it to SS. But this can qualify as a potential problem, and not actual fraud.  
It's familiar fraud, and I'm sure she's been doing it[robbery] for years.  
There's a reason this crime is underreported, but it needs to stop now.  
I can and will press charges if need be because I don't want to be accountable for your irresponsible actions, and sacrifice.

And if you think I owe her money, I'm sure we more than break even through all the money she's lifted from me over the years. As curious as I am as to the actual amount, I'm willing to let it all go and not involve lawyers or the govt more than necessary. It can get very messy and time-consuming for all involved.  
But I'm not some money-doormat. I'm not being ugly, just pro-active. My IRS debt is important to me. So is my credit report and auto insurance rates.  
This is a serious issue, and if you ever use my SSN and/or name without my permission again, we will have a very big problem. I'm keeping it personal now, but will prosecute if it continues. I'm not worried about (or holding out hope for) a repayment plan, I just want the $600 in tax for (2016)'s tranfer(it's actually $601.80, but don't worry about the difference). There's a Walmart 5 miles from your house, if you send it Walmart-to-Walmart in the next day or so, I won't have to fill out a police report in my appointment with Social Security. I already let them know I would try to handle this personally, and only as a last resort to handle this like an ordinary fraud case. Which requires a lot of legal complications I don't want to get into with family. I am not legally obligated to file a police report, but once it's filed, the actions that police and prosecutors take are decided by them, not me. (There is a significant difference between using a 9 year-olds SSN, and a (her age) year-olds.  
(Her mother) is not my Legal Guardian, nor was I listed as her Nominee for 2016's monetary transaction. What she is doing is falsely claiming to be someone else to receive a very hefty financial benefit.)

It is hard to convey the anger at the betrayal of trust that occurs when your identity is stolen, financial aspect aside. 
I am not willing to contact my mother because we have a toxic relationship. If you want her to pay the $600 from the $3,009 she received in my name and never gave to me, then get it from her yourself.  

Also, if any dividends are in my name, I would like to go ahead and cash them all out please.

Thank you, Niece

PS: I agree that this isn't a pleasant situation. 
Please respond soon as I have a lawyer waiting to hear back from me. I hope to provide her with favorable information on how we worked things out between us. Have a great day.

The reponse she received:

Dear (niece's name),

So nice to hear from you. Congratulations on your growing family.

You have serious misconceptions about what is going on with respect to your tax liabilities and your mother. Most importantly, to my knowledge, no one, including your mother, has stolen from you or robbed you of anything. Nor has she or I stolen your identity. 

While I would like to explain things to you, the tone and content of your email indicates to me that you are not in the mental frame of mind to rationally discuss these matters. Please have your attorney call me at her earliest convenience and I will explain matters to her.

In the mean time, if you provide me with a real address, I can send you a check to cover your tax liability. I don't do Walmart or alternative payment formats.

Your loving uncle,

&amp;nbsp;

What I want to know is: just what type of charges could we (conceivably) be faced with? Am I on the hook foe any of this, as phone conversations qualify as hearsay? Does withholding information [on the dividend payments] count as an illegal act in this context? How might my niece be moving forward with this from here?

301,"Strap in kiddos, this is a lengthy one. 

So there was this brother at a frat that I was sort've flirting HEAVY with last year. He very much reciprocated the flirting but I didn't want to take it further cuz he was a freshmen and wicked immature and whatnot. 

Ok so fast forward to this year (I'm now a junior and he's a sophomore) and I'm pretty close with his frat so I'm there quite a bit. He's a newer brother but I know the older brothers more, so we don't really ever interact. 

I blaming this on the fact that it's now Libra season but I've been getting some vibes from him?? I thought I was imagining it because again, we don't ever interact, but something happened that gave me some sort of confirmation that I wasn't making it up. He, my 2 roommates, and I were chilling on the porch of their house and one of roommates wanted to leave. I was like alright cool, I'll walk you home and grab the joint that we rolled earlier so that me, the brother, and my other roommate could smoke on the frat's porch. 

I come back, we smoke, he leaves after one hit. I'm talking to my roommate later that night and she tells me that the brother was asking about me on the porch. Like he was incessantly asking if I was gonna come back, which I thought was odd considering that he left after the one hit. 

Fast forward to last night, and I go to his frat house at the end of the open party. I go down to the basement and see him and he def sees me cuz I walked by him to get some quarters for beirut. I'm playing next tho so I go upstairs to open a beer and in the one minute that I spent upstairs opening my beer lol, homeboy has a girl and he's dancing on her. I was like damn ok, I didn't know him seeing me would make him feel that way? But I play 'rut in the basement while he's dancing on this girl. He's the type of guy who, if he wants a girl, he'll get the girl. But last night he's weirdly not pursuing the girl as hard as he usually does with other girls and later in the night I sort've just see him wandering around the house by himself. 

Later that night I'm also talking with an older brother in the living room, and homeboy just sits on the couch by himself directly in front on me. I'm standing up and not wicked close to him and the room is decently full, but I can feel his eyes on me from time to time. He looks really sick so I tell the older brother to check on him. He says he's ok, and he seemed to sort've get it together after I had the brother talk to him. But he's still sitting on the couch and then up and leaves and doesn't come back for the rest of the night.

He has a tendency to leave a room once I walk in so I'm surprised he stayed in the basement the whole time I was there and I'm also very surprised that he actually entered and sat in the living while I was there. 

I know this is actually really stupid but I just wanted to hear some thoughts lol. ",30Sep2018,1
302,"TL;DR My friend's fiancee was rude to my wife and I told my friend I cannot be his best man. He says she's only saying how she feels. I think she's giving her opinions on a situation that does not involve her, and it's rude. Please help me make sense of this.



One of my best friend's fiancee (we'll call her L) was previously a very good friend of my wife. Unfortunately, the last few months she grew distant to my wife (constantly bailing out of plans, never responding to messages, etc). Until recently when L completely stopped talking to her. 

I am American and my wife is British. We've got our big wedding ceremony planned for next year, but earlier this year we completed the legal part in America for my close family there. Nothing sorted but it helped with visas and gave my grandparent's something to see, since they can't come to our wedding day. (This is why I refer to her as my wife.)

Recently, L kept questioning my wife on our wedding plans and kept asking about a registrar. Like, REALLY pushing it. It turns out her friend works at the registrar's office near us, and since we don't need a registrar for the wedding, we don't have an appointment booked. 

We didn't want to tell anyone about the legal part in America because we didn't want anyone to feel like it was any less special to us. Well, we had to tell L at this point. And she basically disowned us instantly. She said that she was so hurt that we are lying about our wedding.

Then today, she messaged my wife saying how she felt that we are carrying on a charade with our guests, and she's hurt we lied to her. She also said she will not be coming to my wife's bachelorette party (which she also won't be repaying £200 for). She said that she doesn't know how she feels about being at a wedding of someone already married.

L and my friend are planning their wedding as well for this year. And I was best man. However, after receiving this message I told my friend that I cannot be his best man. I told him that it wasn't her place to question the way we handle our relationship. He said that he doesn't believe it's disrespectful for her to say how she feels. And I say she can feel how she wants, but it isn't her place to say we're doing things wrong in our relationship. 

Honestly, I'm just not sure how to feel at the moment. Since he's a good friend, it's hard to get my thoughts straight. Any advice would be helpful.",30Sep2018,3

305,"I just recently started a relationship with a girl whom upon meeting, presented herself as 18. I’m 21,  about to be 22 soon myself, &amp; I’m already iffy about dating people younger than me anyways, but I ended up hitting it off with this girl physically and emotionally. Today seemingly out of nowhere, I got this strange gut feeling. Her birthday is coming up soon, so I decided to double check &amp; ask how old she was turning. At first she avoided the question until I pressed further, at which point she insisted she didn’t want to tell me unless in person. I persisted, and guessed an age, and she finally told me. 

This girl is 15 going on 16, and I am 21 going on 22. She claims she’s used to dating people in their 20s at this point (even older than me) but the whole situation is extremely offputting for me as I’ve always feared a situation like this especially due to legal implications (though she swears she will keep it private). 

I called her &amp; she’s very upset, crying and breaking down &amp; essentially threatening to self harm &amp; mentioning suicide. At this point, I feel almost numb, yet still concerned bc she is a very nice girl but I can’t even feel much for her now for putting me through this situation. I told her I would come see her after work if she promises not to harm herself &amp; she agreed, but I don’t know what else to do. 

She’s struggled with mental illness for a while now apparently (as have I) &amp; my first red flag should have been how clingy she has been, but at first it was okay Bc I like the attention. Now, I just know I NEED to get out of this situation but I don’t want to be responsible for her harming herself. What can I do beyond talking to her in person? ",30Sep2018,2

We have 2 entrances in and out of my neighborhood and near the main entrance is a house that has cars parked up and down both sides of the street and across their front yard.

310,"I [23F] met a guy [23M], let's call him Dave, on OkCupid a month ago and we've been dating. On our first date I ended up in bed with him but I told him I didn't like to sleep with people on the first date and he was very respectful and kept his hands above the belt.

So we've been dating for about a month now but haven't had sex, I told him I liked him and wanted to take it slow. Now we hadn't talked about exclusivity yet so I continued going on first dates with guys from OKC but nothing came of those but I know he has not been seeing any other girls.

Now the way I fucked up is I went on a date with another guy from OKC on friday and ended up getting a little too drunk and had sex with him, probably the worst sex I've ever had. On saturday I was over at Dave's house and things were progressing to sex when I told him about the date from friday. He got really quiet and just said that I should leave.

I put on my clothes and he didn't say anything else as he walked me to the door and then just shut it behind me. Every other time I'd left his apartment he'd always make sure to walk me to my car. I haven't heard from him since then and he won't respond to any of my texts or calls. I went online and I know he hadn't logged into his OKC account in almost three weeks but now it says that he logged in last night.

Is there any way for me to fix this? He's a really good guy and I thought we could've had something.",30Sep2018,1
311,"So long story short we’ve been friends through grad school.  We got really close and I missed several opportunities to come=e out and tell her my feelings. It’s gotten to the point where we text all the time.  The only problem is she’s poly and when she told me that it took me a while to come to terms with it but I still love her, and yes I understand that I’ll never be the only or most important partner in her life.  I started making efforts to spend time with her again...but I just don’t know how to tell her “I like you, and I’m attracted to you, but I also value you as a friend.”  I just don’t know how the conversation would go either way....either she feels the same way, but I don’t know how a relationshipy thing would work or she doesn’t in which case we part ways.

So the other day I’d just thought I’d invite her to do something with me...long shot, but eh.  She immediately said yeah awesome, and went with me.  We spent the entire day laughing, getting drunk and the watching the sunset by the lake, then going out to dinner.  I know I need to be the one to make any moves because even though she’s outgoing, sexy and confident...she gets shy when we’re close intimately.  The entire day she kept making future plans for us, that we should go on some trip together.  Not that I don’t want to spend time with her...but we seem to be more than friends.  At this point it’s a thinly veiled secret, if that, that she knows I have feelings for her.  She’ll catch my looking at her and just giggle, she still has a laugh which drives me nuts, and now I’m picking up half of her mannerisms.  I want to keep having her in my life, but I don’t know how to move things forward or just run away.

TL;DR: I keep falling in put out of love with a friend I’ve always had a complicated relationship with.  I don’t know how to tell her...just don’t know when or where or how.  But I need to resolve this because there’s obviously tension, but more with me.  I’m completely okay with the poly thing now, but still know that thus is going to be an adventure into the unknown for me.",30Sep2018,1

After a month of them meeting, he moved in to our house. It’s a small townhome where just me [17F] and my mom live so it was very uncomfortable and cramped having a third person in the house at all times, but whatever, I dealt with it. 

Then, my mom caught him lying about several things, like the fact that he was talking to his ex gf (who he broke up with about 2 days before dating my mom), and so him and my mom broke up. The day that him and my mom broke up, he went to his ex’s house and slept with her that night, as my mom found out through talking to his ex gf. 

Now, fast forward about 2 weeks since the breakup, after hearing her complain the whole time nonstop to me and all her friends and family about what a scumbag he is, she started to be his ‘friend’ again. 

3 days ago, I guess they went out as friends. 2 days ago, they went out downtown until about 3 AM and then I found him sleeping on our couch the next morning. Yesterday, I come home, and he’s hanging out in our house and my mom is walking around in a robe, and she says she’s going out. We were supposed to go grocery shopping together, and she said “you can go by yourself and I’ll pay you or you can come with me and (insert the guys name)”. I kind of flipped out on her in front of him too, because I thought the way she was acting was just awful. 

That night, I went to go sleep at my dad’s house.  This morning I come back and he’s sleeping in her bed. I told her she’s acting gross. And she says “we’re just friends.” 

I feel very uncomfortable with her bringing her ex boyfriend around, and now they’re hanging out every single day together again and he’s sleeping in our house. (And they’re obviously sleeping together.)

 I feel like the privacy of our home is invaded. I feel like the way she’s acting is so trashy and so unlike how a parent should act. And I just feel really uncomfortable with the dynamics. 

I am thinking about going to move in with my dad. I am a lot happier with the more normal family dynamics there (it’s my dad, stepmom, and stepbrother). It’s only about 20 minutes away, but the area is a little less nice, my room is not nearly as nice, and the house is just kind of dirty. 
It would be a pain in the ass to move most of my stuff out, but I could probably get it done today. 

What should I do? Should I confront my mom or say anything to her? Or should I just move out?

And my movements feel off. It's like sometimes i can't feel that im moving and it makes me dislike walking and getting up. 

Related? Not? Fell and hit my head on a coffee table Friday.  Concussed. Retrograde amnesia. 

And was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome while i also had neck pain. I saw two docs. One said it could be cervical nerve impingement. Bit since she wasn't my primary and my primary said carpal tunnel i trusted her.  I'm scared. ",30Sep2018,1

329,"There were a lot of things that happened between us, but the brief summary of it is that I was friends with this girl, she's a few years younger than me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very nice to her in the beginning, sometimes I would pay for her meals or buy a random gifts since she always talked about how her family is struggling financially.

&amp;#x200B;

However, as time goes, I realise a lot of the things she told everyone had suspicious points to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Such as, even though she say she was poor, her family could afford really expensive flagship phones from Samsung, she could buy a high grade computer with no problem, and a Cintiq Intuos that most of us would save up for a long time to buy.

&amp;#x200B;

There were other dodgy things about her, for example we're celebrating another classmate's birthday, she would go around person by person to tell them how much they should pay, and if they don't, they would not get a piece of the cake(she did not ask everyone who's willing to chip in before deciding to celebrate that person's birthday). She would not tell us how much the cake cost and how many people are sharing.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a time she saw a shirt I was wearing and ask me where I got it from and how much it cost, I decide to buy it for her as a gift, but due to international shipping, it took more than a month. When a month passed since I offered to buy it for her, she came to question me why hasn't the shirt reach yet. Which I felt was pretty rude since I'm giving it to her for free without asking for anything in return.

&amp;#x200B;

She was also very proud and arrogant in our academics, because she got a lot of high praises from lecturers for one assignment, she would go around the class to check one by one, asking for us to show her our work and criticise it when we do.(no one gave her the authority to)

&amp;#x200B;

It would take the whole day for me to list everything she's done that are annoying or dodgy, so basically after everything, I decided I shouldn't get too close to a person like this.

&amp;#x200B;

I started giving excuses when she ask me to eat with her(she still has other people to eat with), I won't voluntarily talk to her, but when she talks to me, I'd still reply politely.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed after I stop actively hanging out with her, she started forming an exclusive clique inside an already pretty small class(12 people), and would plan for class activities without everyone else, and sometimes not invite everyone to them.

&amp;#x200B;

We had incidents which we disagreed regarding the way she was organizing these class activities, in which she said she's not good at it, so I asked her ""then why do you keep voluntarily putting yourself in the organizer's spot?""

&amp;#x200B;

She purposely said in front of the whole class that if I was unhappy with anything she's done, I could talk to her about it.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's what I did, I talked to her at least 3 times in an attempt to make peace with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time, I didn't say anything insulting or rude, I tried to reason with her, explain my perspective, tell her why what she's doing may not be appropriate, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

She would quietly listen, however, I found out that right afterwards, she would turn around and tell her clique that I was bullying her.

&amp;#x200B;

She went to the extend of complaining to the principal of the school, in which even though he never did anything disciplinary, but I could sense his favoritism towards her.

&amp;#x200B;

She had accused me of this to multiple people, and some actually does believe her and had confronted me about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Being accused of things I did not do had taken quite a mental toll on me, but I felt pretty helpless because she likes to play the victim card and would lie to get her way in things.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have any advice as to how to deal with this person? I could ignore her and move on as I'm graduating soon but I'm afraid she might attempt to damage my reputation in the industry we're in.

&amp;#x200B;

330,"I'll preface this by saying I've seen a lot of people on this thread with real issues, issues that deserve so much more attention that this, but I just feel like I need to talk to someone after having a panic attack as dread washed over me this morning.

I'm a student of engineering, and I'm well into my last year at college. I've always loved learning, and I work incredibly well in a educational atmosphere. College has helped me form a series of connections and relationships that I know I won't find anywhere else, but as the weeks seem to blink past me I am horrified of leaving this life behind to go to a desk job for the rest of my life.

I know that the whole reason I'm here is to get the education I need in order to get a good job, make a living, be successful, and I can handle work. What absolutely horrifies me is the prospect of time moving like it is for me now, with weeks disappearing despite my best efforts to make the most of things, becoming the norm, only this time I have nothing to look forward to.

After I graduate, I'll lose these connections I've made, the atmosphere I love, and with no more goals, no more tangible things to work towards and achieve I really don't know if I can hold the depression I've had for years at bay anymore.

For those who have made this transition, how can I watch my world crumble around me and actually be happy on the other side?",30Sep2018,1

334,"So i know this question have been asked a hundred  times before. So if you're annoyed with seeing this, please just don't comment. I would love your advice, but i'm not here to annoy people.

Ok lets get into this. So i'm 15 and go to a school with a party culture. Almost every week there is a new party where people come together to drink and have fun. Usually people make out at these parties. I have a huge crush on this one girl, and have had it ever since i first met her. She is incredibly nice, and handsome. The problem is, i'm a bit shy. Not to the point where i'm too scared to approach people. But i cant hold a conversation for long, and it quickly turns awkward. My crush has recently told me, out of all the people that goes to my school i'm her third favorite looking dude. I'm so happy about this, but every time we are at the same party i'm too scared to make a move.

Ok so here is what i'm afraid gonna happen if i make a move:

1. She is just gonna rejects me
2. She is too busy doing something with another boy
3. She is gonna do something with me, but since i'm bad at making out, shes gonna leave for another boy  


The reason i'm scared that she's gonna do something with other boys, is because two of my  friends are also trying to make moves at her. One of those two are also pretty good looking, and is ten times more charismatic than me. Plus hes been in an relationship, some time ago so he knows how to make out. And if that wasn't enough, the party we're going to next Friday, a friends of hers is bringing her cousin. I've heard that the girl that i like have a crush on him. So i'm guessing shes trying to have fun with him on Friday.

Can anyone help? If anymore information is needed just comment i'll happily reply.

&amp;#x200B;

335,"Something happened to my girlfriend early in August of this year, that caused her parents to force her to cut contact with all of her close friends, keep a tracker on her phone and regularly threat her with other punishments that would ruin her social life at college. 

Ever since, she’s been extremely down, and one bad thing after another keeps on happening. She goes in these moods daily where she just blatantly feels extremely low. She can’t even describe it herself, she just says it’s a “feeling”. I’ve tried as many different ways to cheer her up/ distract her as I can but none seem to be working. 

She says she is tired of feeling this way and wishes she could get better.

I certainly don’t take the word depression lightly as I have had family members who have been clinically diagnosed with having the mental health problem, however I am becoming more and more worried she is. 

Whenever I suggest taking her to the doctors she outright refuses and shows no signs of changing her mind.

337,"My parents got in a pretty huge fight and it has sent my mother completely over the edge. My mom was in the hospital and my dad didn't come see her for whatever reason and it has pushed her to wanting to push for divorce. I had already taken a year off my university studies to work a job so I could save up money to finish and now this is happening. My mother is going to move away and moving with her isn't really an option. I could stay with my father, but he definitely doesn't really make enough to handle all the bills and I would have to start either working or using up the money I saved for myself to start helping with rent and such.

Are there any options for me here? At this point, I've just considered dropping school and just joining the military because I don't want to have to worry about all this shit.

338,"(this is a throwaway account, because my family knows my most common online nicknames, including the one for Reddit)

My mother tongue is German, so I apologize for anything that's hard to understand because of it.

I'm trying to stay as objective about the issue as I can, since I don't know if I am responsible for the issue, and if that is the case, please let me know.

Since my mother left my father about 10 months ago, the minor conspiracy theorist he already was turned into a full-on one, and he appears to think that he is infallible more than he used to.  
And since then, we argue a lot. The cause is always something that isn't really important, like my accent in English being more on the British side of the spectrum, or me forgetting something he told me to do. In the latter case, while I do want him to tell me, so I can actually improve, it's *how* he tells me that that is the problem (for me).

Basically, the argument that always follows boils down to those things:
* He thinks I purposefully didn't do as I was told, which isn't the case. Which I tell him.
* He thinks that it isn't of any use to tell me stuff he wants done, because I should notice anyway and because I wouldn't do it even if he did tell me. I tell him that I want him to tell me what I am doing wrong, but not in the way he usually does it.
* I think that it isn't fair to judge me based on a few instances where I did forget something, especially since he doesn't agree on me simply forgetting it, although I do have an 18 year long (I'm currently 18 years old) history of forgetfulness.
* He thinks that I owe him respect because of the age gap, which I don't agree on. He tells me that I show absolutely no respect for him, while I think I do.
* He doesn't think that he owes me any respect, while I think that everybody owes everybody else exactly the same amount of respect. I think that whom to show more respect for than the base amount is completely up to you and just shows who you value more. And because I think that telling me that I just ignore him or actively go against what he tells me to do in the household is quite unrespectful, I feel like he doesn't value me at all. Which just fuels the argument further.
* He thinks that I never change my opinions in discussions with him. Which is generally untrue, but is the case in most discussions: It mostly comes down to him just repeating one or two points based on what he feels, which I don't really accept as valid reasoning for me to change my views.
* I think that he never changes his opinions although I bring up valid points, based on a handful of moral axioms (like ""all people should only be treated differently because of what they actively choose to do"") and evidence.
* He thinks that I shouldn't question what he tells me.
* I think that we should talk about this exact issue I'm outlining here, to avoid those arguments in the future. He thinks it would be a waste of time.

The issue is probably as bad (for me, I don't think it really is objectively bad. Other people have it way worse.) as it is, because he tends to ""think with his heart"", while I try to form my opinions based on actual evidence.

I don't want to argue with him every week about the same thing. So I want advice on how to fix our relationship.

And maybe answers to these questions (although that is purely subjective):  
Do I owe him respect because he is older?  
Is he mostly at fault, am I, or are we both? And does it even make sense to ask that question in the first place?  
Should I pretend to not have my own opinions, and just copy his while talking to him?

My disorder definitely worsened the most in the 8th grade as this was when I most noticed that I couldn’t stop moving and I couldn’t focus in class anymore. As it got worse, I developed Severe GAD and started frequently getting panic attacks. These attacks happen mostly outside of school because my teachers understand that sometimes I just need to step out when I feel one about to happen. The problem is that my parents don’t want me to get treated for either disorder.

342,"My(25F) boyfriend(25M) and I have been together for 4 years and living together for about 2 and a half. In that time, I have gone from being a fulltime student, to a part time worker to working full-time in my industry. I feel like I've changed a lot.

He has gone from being a full time student, to working full time to then not working, then working part time, then full time student (for a completely different career) then working part time (again, in a completely different career). He doesn't seem to have any plan, and he's dropped out of three programs in his life, completed one and then never bothered following through on it. I come home from working all day and he is sitting on the couch watching youtube. During the day he plays video games, watches youtube and streams on twitch, and then whenever he has shifts, which isn't that many, he works retail.

I've asked him what he plans to do over and over again and he never has a straight answer; he wants to be a retail manager, then he wants to go back to school. He gets very defensive and flips it around on me for wanting more for him. He's a smart guy and I know he can accomplish what he sets his mind to. But he just never seems to set his mind to anything. He calls streaming on twitch work, but won't manage any social media or try to build his audience to actually make money from it. He even says he doesn't want to make money from it, but gets angry at me when I say that then it's not work.

I tried to set a time limit of 1 year that if I don't see him doing anything more with his life I have to leave. I feel like he's holding me back because I come home and he's attention starved and I'm frustrated he's not done anything.

He says I'm being unfair to him and that setting an ultimatum is wrong. But I don't know what else to do.

I fully and completely love him and can't imagine my life without him, but being with him is draining. He doesn't really cook, cleans occasionally for us. But I won't be able nor do I want to support him financially all on my own. He has money for now...but it won't last forever.

I'm not sure if I'm expecting too much from him or pressuring him too much. I just don't know how much longer I should let this go on or if I should just get out now. I tell him how I feel over and over but he just gets defensive.",30Sep2018,1

I didn't really know him too well when we were playing but he seemed super nice and I needed a roommate in the area so the fit seemed perfect. Fast forward 2 months: He is relatively clean, and really nice, but misses super simple stuff and I constantly have to remind him to do things (e.g. turn off lights when he isn't in the room, keep windows closed when the A/C is on, clean the kitchen table if he drops food after eating, etc.). No big deal - I get it - we are fresh out of college and this is his first time not living in a dorm, but I have to ask him to do these things on a daily basis and it's getting exhausting. I'm not a neat freak and I feel kind of bad constantly reminding him to do things considering these things seem trivial to me; being a conscious person really isn't that hard, right? Additionally, we don't see each other too often considering he works long hours at his new job and I'm in graduate school which makes our communication really limited to a few minutes per day.

356,"Quick background: 
I have a learning disability and have pretty much failed out of every bit of schooling I’ve ever attempted, so I’m very nervous to try again but I really want a career I feel proud of. Right now I’m surviving off of disability and I want a better life for myself that I earned. 

These are some things I genuinely enjoy and feel like I’m decent at:

•drawing up my budget/making budget plans/working towards financial goals

•drawing up daily/weekly/etc. schedules (for things like household chores, my blogging, and so on)

•organizing my home &amp; decorating 

•writing 

I would love to figure out how to make a career out of something I actually enjoy doing. I am however nervous about making myself hate something I love by turning it into a chore (I did this already with writing by starting a blog and treating it like a job... trying to find a healthy balance there and get the love for writing back), and I’m also very nervous, like I said, about schooling. 

Especially math. That was always my worst subject. I can’t believe I made it through algebra in high school and I think I even repeated a couple algebra classes because I failed them. But I really really enjoy finances and budgeting. Like a lot. 


Does anyone have any advice or ideas of what careers/schooling I could try to go for?

I just think about shit soooo much and I never used to be like this. I had a relationship for 2 years and during that time I seemed to have changed or become anxious. I was extremely depressed at the end. And I think that’s where I got the habit of spending so much time thinking about stuff.

367,"  A few months ago I dated the most amazing girl named Raquel. She was like a dream come true right out of a 90s romantic comedy. One day out of the blue, after three months of dates she said she was not looking for a relationship even after tons of flirting and hints of interest  even calling me her boyfriend at one point. Anyway she  told her friends (who are also my friends) that she loves me but maybe not in that way. When she broke it off with me I wanted to be as supportive as possible because all I ever wanted and still want is to see her happy so when she broke it off I supported her and accepted her decision. I did feel crushed when I got home. I went through the whole listening to air supply and watching 500 days of summer over and over again phase of a break up. She texts me days later and now three months later we are  very good friends. She and her friends often come to talk to me during recess, we text all the time through text and when she had a huge argument with a friend of mine she came to me for support, which I found flattering. Anyway, I still love her and I am very conflicted. I am scared of losing her friendship If I tell her how I still feel but I cannot seem to get over my crush for her either.

&amp;#x200B;

  The other day I met this girl on a project we did in class. The girl talked about her relationships and that type of stuff so I told her about  Raquel. I told her everything and said I still loved Raquel. Later I went to follow this girl on Instagram and found that her and Raquel were mutual friends. I messed up really bad, she is probably gonna tell Raquel I still love her. And what if Raquel gets mad or thinks that I cannot take no for answer. What do I do?

368,"I'm still in secondary school but I'm applying for uni next year.

Socially, I've never been the best. I'm awkward and have only gained small amounts of self confidence over the years. It's not great and I have a long way to go.

I have only 3/4 close friends but am friendly with many acquaintances. When we all started at this school we were all in the same situation, but as time progressed all my friends have matured. 

I'm the only person within my friend group + acquaintances that doesn't wear makeup. All the other girls had time to practice their makeup skills and I know that if I try it, I'll look like a clown.

Another problem I have is the fact that I don't go out as much. Most of my friends go to house parties where the host's parents are away. They buy alcohol and smoke weed. While I don't particularly like the taste of any of the alcohols I've tried (like 2) and I have no interest in getting drunk, this really hinders my ability to socialize with other people in my year group. 

Another problem is that these parties tend to begin at 9pm and last until midnight or 1 in the morning. My mother expects me to be home by 6pm at the latest, and that's only if she's spoken to the parents days before hand.

374,"Hello, I'm 20 years old and I recently found out my Dad has stolen money from me a few times in the last couple of years. This most recent time had ~$500 hidden away in my room and I recently checked it and $350 was missing. After grilling him for about 5 mins, he eventually confessed to doing it. He said he has done it at least twice to me (I'm guessing for a total of around $800 more or less) and to my brother one time (My brother already knew about it). As far as I know he is not a drug addict and has only used the money to pay bills. I'm not sure what to do in this situation. If he would have asked me to borrow $350 I would have probably reluctantly given it to him, but him stealing from me really hurts emotionally and makes me not view him as a father anymore.

379,"To preface, I don’t know if “emotional” is quite the word I am looking to explain. 

 My (mid 20’s) boyfriend (late 20’s) of 5 years is a great guy. He’s a little older than me but that’s never meant anything in our relationship. I know he truly loves me but he really doesn’t do a great job expressing it. He rarely compliments me &amp; he doesn’t give me that much attention. He by no means ignores me but we spend all day, almost everyday together so we are quite comfortable being together but doing our own things. When we are not together he does not text or call me. I understand we just spent the entire day together but I’ve expressed to him before that a good night/good morning text would mean a lot to me but it just doesn’t happen. 

I don’t work, and have never worked a single day since I’ve been with him. When we are together he pays 9/10 times. If I want anything he has no problem getting it for me but I rarely get “just because” gifts. Whenever I get money I give it to him because either way we spend his money so it’s just my way of doing what I can. I don’t think he’s ever said “here’s $xx.xx, buy yourself something” and that kind of bothers me. He has no problem handing me any amount of money I want but that’s only when I jokingly ask for it (I also never take it). He will spend money going out with friends, gambling, etc. so it’s not like he’s saving or spending it on more important things. Don’t get me wrong, money is by no means the issue...it’s the fact that he doesn’t even offer that hurts. When we’re eating for example, I always ask if he wants to try some of my food/drink but he doesn’t reciprocate. It’s not that I want some, but it would feel good to be offered. He used to drive off when he’d drop me off at home before making sure I got inside &amp; didn’t really think it was that big of a deal when I said something to him later on. I just feel like you’d want to make sure that your SO got inside safely before you left? He’s also probably only held the door for me a handful of times in our relationship. Not a big deal, and also not something expected just because he is the man but it’s just a little thing that would make me happy.

 He will sometimes invite his friends over when I am at his house &amp; I have no problem with that but I’ve asked him to just let me know before that happens. Sometimes I look a (not so) hot mess and don’t want to see anyone and sometimes I just don’t want to hang out but no matter how many times I’ve explained it he doesn’t really get the memo. Most times I’ll just sit upstairs and let them hang out because it really isn’t that big of a deal, I’d just like to be included in the decision. I ask him how he would feel the other way around and he agrees that he wouldn’t like that but that still hasn’t changed anything. 

If, for example, he accidentally hurts me (drops his phone on my face, etc lol) more often than not he’ll say something along the lines of “ohhh shit” but not “are you okay”, “my bad”. He’s also not very sentimental. I’ve written him birthday &amp; anniversary cards with my heart poured out into them &amp; he has no idea where any of them are. I know guys are not as into saving things like that as girls are but I’d assume he’d have something at least? 

I understand these are probably ridiculous things to be bothered by but this is how our entire relationship has been so the little things have really added up &amp; I notice it in almost everything that happens. I try to be very understanding and definitely don’t voice every single little thing that bothers me (I don’t want to be a nag, and that would be unfair to him if I was constantly complaining about little things). I usually will speak up if I’ve noticed it’s a pattern but that’s really the only time. I know he really, truly loves me but I guess he’s not that emotional(?). Has anyone had experiences with SO’s who are as clueless as mine? How do you expect less &amp; stop feeling a certain type of way about things like this? I really don’t want to be smothered with (forced) love but would appreciate kind gestures once in a while. I’ve expressed all of this (&amp; more) before and not much has changed so I really am just looking for advice on how to not expect so much when I guess it’s just not what he is like. ",30Sep2018,1

381,"I know this may sound ridiculous. But people can be addicted to lots of things, like gambling, gaming or anything. This happened about a week ago


I don't know how to describe it. I just felt emotional. I have no idea what came over me. I don't know what you'd call it. A meltdown or a breakdown. Or whatever, i don't know. But i want to talk about it. I know it may seem silly, but anime is one of my favorite things. Watching it helped me through a depression and difficult time in my life. And since then, i've kept up with my interest on a regular basic. I even have a time of the day dedicated just to watching anime.


(Before going on, i just want to say, with anime, i really like it. I got into watching again a couple years ago. And i try to watch 2 or 3 episodes a night. And, in that time, my list of anime i want to watch has increased. Not kidding, there's about 800 shows on my list.)


So, i had finished a series last night, and this morning i was trying to choose my next one. I was just looking through my list, and it felt weird. It hit me, there's no way i'll ever be able to watch all these. That there just isn't enough time. I can't explain it, i just felt so...broken.


I mean, looking at all the thumbnails, scrolling through, it was endless. I just couldn't get it out of my mind that i'll never finish these. And i felt like i was being ""closed in on"", like i was trapped. Claustrophobic. It seemed like i was wasting my time watching this. Because i've bought a lot of merchandise in those 2 years. I have them in my room, and it really made me feel overwhelmed. Because there's those series, plus the DVD's my friends have bought me before that i haven't even opened yet.


I can't explain it. But i felt like crying, because i was overwhelmed, there was so much i want to see but just not enough time. I mean, i want to watch all of these. But i just kept thinking that I'll probably be dead before i can watch everything. I honestly think i was having a panic attack.

I don't know what came over me.


I know this is something very silly to be upset over, but i've made anime a major part of my life. I watch it almost every day, i've bought merchandise, i have a whole youtube channel dedicated to it, i am active in forums, I've even cancelled my TV service because i don't watch it anymore, my only source of entertainment has been anim. Whenever i get free time to myself, i usually crack open an anime and watch it for a bit, and just the fact that there's literally thousands of series i haven't even looked at yet made me feel very different. I can't explain it, it just...happened.


For some reason, it felt like the list and the dvd's and everything were mocking me.


Is this normal? I mean, when i went through an event that caused me to go into a depression, i used anime to cope. I guess i'm dependent on it now, I honestly think i have a problem. I think i might actually be addicted. Or is this normal?

384,"I’ve known this girl and been close friends with her for 10+ years and we’ve both been very up-front about not being romantically into each other since we first met. It’s been 100% platonic and we’ve never once been a problem before, but things are weird now because of what happened. Here’s the scoop:

I invited her over to celebrate my getting a new job a few nights ago, like I have many time before, and we both drank and smoked up, but she got really wasted really fast while I was still pretty level headed the whole night since I had stuff to do the next morning. She started getting flirty and grabbing on me a ways into the night, and I gently let her down each time, pinning it on her being a little trashed and lonely. She keeps going on a while but eventually called it down and we went back to just hanging out, then later she falls out of her chair and when I went to help her up, she grabbed me and planted on a really deep kiss. I was shocked but got away early into it, then helped her up and pretended it didn’t happen so things wouldn’t get weirder. 

Even further in to the night, she asks to sleep in my bed instead of on the couch, and I reluctantly agreed intending to put myself on the couch instead once she fell asleep. We’ve slept in the same bed before cuddling and stuff when she was going through breakups so I didn’t pay it any mind since she hadn’t gotten any in a while. After I agreed, she walks over to me and plops down on my lap facing me and asked “what if I kissed you again?”, and before I could reject it, she did, but I was able to get her off pretty easily and point out she was just being drunk. 

She went into a short rant about how she’s always liked me and is into me and she thinks I’m cute now with my new hair and so on and so forth, and I’m just kind of mentally panicking the whole time but I kept composure. I put her to bed shortly after, but she kept waking up and calling for me to cuddle her while she slept so we ended up just sleeping together in my bed, but I played it safe and kept my belt on so nothing weird would happen, and thankfully, she went out pretty quick and stayed out once I was holding her. 

The next morning she’s normal and we went and got breakfast. I ran my errands and then met up with her and some of her friends for us all to go to a nearby theme park and go shopping, and everything was cool if a little awkward for me since I was worried she didn’t remember what happened. After all was said and done and I dropped her friends off at their apartments, I was driving her back home and potentially made a mistake in asking her if she remembered what happened last night.

She didn’t.

I only explained that she kissed me twice and not any of what she said or how she was grabbing my junk and stuff, trying to make it seem as normal and small as possible, but she acted mortified by it and just kept saying “we won’t bring it up again, it’s fine.” I tried to point out that drunk people do that sort of stuff all the time, and that it’s just a little kiss and nothing bad happened. Since then, though, she’s not talked to me as much and when she does she’s super short with me, only ever sending like one word at a time in text. 

I’m just kind of sad because I feel like she’s really embarrassed by either how she acted or how I responded to it, and I don’t really want to bring it up again since it made everything uncomfortable last time. She’s a good, long time friend, and I’d prefer not lose her over something as small as her coming onto me while trashed, but I’m not sure what I can do to help the situation at this point since she doesn’t seem to want to talk to me. Am I supposed to be really with her and tell her she was trying to fuck me and that she admitted she was into me? Am I to let her be in denial about it? Or should I maybe go visit with her and try to talk it out and see what she’s got going through her head? 

Any advice to help me get my friendship back on track is appreciated. Thanks. ",30Sep2018,3

So well at first yesterday he asked me if I wanted food and I was yeah but like I thought we were sharing our thoughts about our hunger.  He bought me tacos and actually wanted my address to give them to me. That was weird. He's super clingy. He messages me a lot and stuff. Today he asked for my address so he could give me chips.

389,"So I graduated back in May and have been constantly looking for a job in my field. Let me describe what has happened in the last few months. 

So in June ""Company A"" called me for a phone interview and then I received an in person interview as well. They then notified me that did not get the position, but asked if I would like to interview for another position as they are expanding as a company. I agreed because this company is my first choice and it is literally in the exact field that I want to purse. This interview was 2 hours long, and again they rejected me. I had been holding out for this company since June and at the time they rejected me for the 2nd time it was the end of August. 

So I began applying to multiple positions that weren't necessarily in my field of choice, but still utilized the skills I had gained from university. I finally landed a job at Company B, where they pay $16/hour, which is not ideal for me because the job I was working while in university paid more than that, but I needed an in to an office job, so I accepted. 

I began immediately and a week and a half into the job I received an email from Company A saying that they would like to extend an opportunity of employment for a 6 month contract that pays $22/hour. While this company had rejected me twice, I really want an in to their industry and this contract would be the perfect opportunity. BUT I would feel terrible for leaving Company B after only working there for 2 weeks and then putting in my 2 weeks. 

How should I manage this situation? Should I even accept Company A's offer after they have rejected me twice, or is that a prideful response? Is it worth leaving a $16/hour full-time job for a $22/hour 6 month contract position?",30Sep2018,1

392,"Let me power through the backstory first. I started suffering from depression when I was 19. I have no idea if I had been suffering from depression long before that and I was either unaware/in denial of it or if it didn't officially manifest until then. It began affecting my life pretty gradually as pessimism, low self-esteem, low sense of self-worth, &amp; all around just flat out sadness/apathy became a regular part of my day-to-day existence.

The following year when I returned to college (I went to college several hours away) my depression began affecting my school life as well as my social life. My motivation to study and do work was annihilated as I often felt that I fail at everything I do and that there was no point trying because I would never do well. I would get so deep in depressive thoughts that I would zone out in lectures  I began isolating myself more often and I justified my behavior by insisting nobody wanted me around anyway. Normally I'm super chill and supportive of my friends and always try to encourage them towards positive behaviors and habits, but whenever my friends did the same or even simply complimented me, I would immediately negate what they said and reason why it's not true and why I'm worthless.

Some of my friends began taking notice of my change in mood and the fact that I was pretty down about myself constantly. I have a horrible habit of pushing people away whenever they try to help me and I'm not proud to say that is what I did every single time someone tried to help me. This has led to a few fights between some of my friends and I.

Also I should add that I'm not the best person to have around when alcohol is involved. While I'm not an alcoholic, whenever I would go out with friends and drink I always hit the bottle way too hard and I become you're typical self-loathing drunk. I'd always go on about how much I hate myself, how my life is never going anywhere, etc. Worst of all, I've had a few times where I'd talk about wanting to kill myself and I'd even post it on Snapchat and send it to people. Let me be clear that I'm not justifying this behavior by any means, it's a shitty thing to do and I hate myself for doing it.

Some of my friends have suggested I start going to therapy, but I have shot them down every single time it's brought up. I don't want to go to therapy as I feel it is a waste of time &amp; money in addition to the fact that it won't help me anyway. Plus I don't care enough about myself to go. One friend in particular has been especially vocal and trying to push me the hardest to go to therapy. We've had numerous conversations and even fights about it and I've resisted the idea every single time.

A few months ago another incident happened with me getting insanely drunk and getting into another self-loathing, suicidal state. It got so bad that when she took me home we started fighting and eventually my depression was brought up where she once again yelled at me to go to therapy and I screamed back that I'm not going and never would and she slapped me across the face and walked away.

The next day in an extremely hungover and depressive state I saw her as well as a few other friends who tried talking sense into me and I finally listened and agreed I would start going to therapy. They were extremely happy that i finally agreed to go and I got a few hugs from them. My friends were under the impression that I would be attending therapt once I got back home from school.

Here I am several months later and I still haven't gone to therapy nor do I have any plans to. I've talked to my college friends a bit here and there, but mostly we're all really busy between work, school, and other life events that we haven't really talked too too much. No one has asked anything regarding me going to therapy and I haven't said anything to them about it either.

Now I was invited to visit for a weekend in a few weeks and I'm freaking out because I KNOW this topic is gonna come up. I KNOW my friends are gonna ask if I finally went and if I say that I haven't gone, it's likely gonna cause a huge fight. I don't want to lie and say that I've gone, but I also don't want a huge fight to start because of it.

I'm planning on remaining silent about the whole ordeal and not drinking very heavily to avoid another depressive drunken state, but if it comes up I want to know how to handle it. How do I explain to them that I never went to therapy and that I have no plans on going in the future? What do I do if a fight happens because of it? I really want to see my friends, but I don't want any drama happening because of me.

TLDR: I have been depressed for over two years now. It has engulfed my life and my friends took notice. I have resisted and turned down any attempts they made to help and mixed in with my drunken depressive, self-loathing, &amp; even suicidal episodes, have led to numerous fights. After a particularly bad episode, my friends talked to me and I finally agreed to give therapy a shot when I returned home. I didn't and none of my friends know. I will be visiting them in a few weeks and I'm worried the topic will come up and they will be annoyed that I haven't gone and a fight will ensue. How can I handle this if the topic ends up being brought up?",30Sep2018,1

394,"I’ve been wresting with whether or not I should actually post this, but I’ve decided I need to talk about it with someone, anyone, that’s not my current circle of friends/family.

I’ve been struggling for a while now with the idea of religion and purpose... Namely what does any of it even matter? I have brought up my thoughts and feelings to my friends, even my wife, but they brushed me off and told me the same cliques I’ve heard my entire life. I refuse to keep following something feeling blind and confused simply because I’ve done it all my life and it is “comfortable”. I’ve tried to look for answers, but so far all I’ve gotten are more questions. Disclaimer: I am not writing this to bash religion or a lack thereof, I am not crying out for attention or looking for someone to “save me”, I just want to hear fresh opinions and advice.

Backstory: I grew up in a family and around people who claimed they were Christians so those were the beliefs instilled in me as a child. I was taught “Be a good person cause that’s what God expects of you.” I accepted it, I went with it, I had a “come to Jesus” moment in my teens and even went to college to pursue a career related to the church, met my now-wife there, and gave up a church music career to become a public school teacher to put her through nursing school. For a good portion of my life I have been devoted to this ideology, the “this is right and everything else is wrong” mentality that seems to come inherently with just about any belief system. This has been my life and my identity. 

 I am now 26, my marriage of nearly 4 years goes back and forth from being fine to nearly burning down (and the blame is placed upon me for not being a “godly husband”), my friends who say they support who I am and what I want to do turn to criticize my thoughts and actions in the same breath, and I am struggling with thoughts and doubts I am told I am not supposed to have. I’m not sure if there is a God anymore... I’m not sure there is even a point to existence anymore. I have no idea who I am or am even supposed to be. 

I am confused, I am hurt, and I feel there is no one I can talk to around me who will listen or who won’t treat me like some lost sheep wandering from the flock. I just want some honesty and clarity... so in an attempt to be both I throw these thoughts here and I turn to you. What would you do or have done when you feel as if you have lost your religion and in a manner have lost your sense of purpose? 

TL:DR - My religion has been my identity for a majority of my life. I have come to a point in my life where I have begun thinking independently and more critically and have doubts and questions I as of yet haven’t reconciled. I feel as if I have lost connection with who I am and the purpose of existing. What did you do or would you do when struggling with finding a point to life or struggling to find yourself?",30Sep2018,0
395,"Throwaway account; may end up deleting post. in college; I’m of age to drink but I usually stay away from drinking. I have a roommate who isn’t of age, and I say this for a reason. She also disclosed to our group of roommates we share that she has schizophrenia and would like people talking to her, because she hears voices and appreciates feeling included or no ignored. That isn’t the problem. The reason problem is that she smokes weed a lot and it seems like she has a drinking problem. She had approached me to get her a bottle, and at first I didn’t think much of it that she wanted those one of those tiny bottles until when we got close to the store and she asked me if she could get those big 20 dollar ones with my money so it could hold her over for some time. I said no, and if she was going to get anything it would be her money; absolutely not mines. I told her never to ask me to do something like this again; she told me it’s fine and that she has other people who help get it for her. She had came to the room with a big bottle of whiskey that someone close to her brought for her; the bottles are stashed in her closet . One afternoon, she tried to offer me the liquor before I had to go to my afternoon class, and I respectfully declined. Who drinks on a Wednesday afternoon?? 

There has been times she came home drunk, but one time she did come home drunk and she went to start cooking something. She then went to her bed and fell asleep while her food was cooking. Another time, she has left the stove on again and someone almost got burned from it. She smokes weed in the room a lot with the window and door completely closed, and my clothes and bed end up smelling like weed. I don’t smoke and I am asthmatic. She did asked me once before if it was okay and it didn’t occur to me to tell her no since I was distracted about something in that moment and decided to just leave the room; let her do whatever. And because she has a mental illness, I’m not sure if these habits of hers are keeping her in check. I have heard her make full-on conversations with herself at night; based on that Idk how severe she is mentally with alcohol, etc. and being that she is 20.

I told my RA about all of this, because it has been effecting me. I have lived with an alcoholic and drug addict before and one of the reasons I went back to school was to get away from that; it was a long history of emotional and verbal abuse. Drugs and alcohol are absolutely not permitted on campus, and my RA told me that if she were to get caught, I would of been just as responsible because I live with her. My RA told me I did the right thing in telling her and that I would not be in trouble in doing so. Just even smelling like weed would of gotten me in trouble and I even look more suspicious because of my age (rightfully so). I have made some mistakes, and I shouldn’t have. I don’t like to snitch and I mind my own business. Idc what someone does and I’m all about “you do you”, but her lifestyle was making me really uncomfortable and I feel even more uncomfortable for the fact that I spoke to someone with authority to handle this situation. A report will be made and the room will be inspected and my roommate will be charged. Idk how she would react. Did I do the right thing in speaking with someone?",30Sep2018,1
396,"My friend and I are closeish and I know the perils of asking such a specific question.  There are a lot of mixed signals in our relationship, and I was just thrown when she asked me very seriously to plan a wine tasting trip for the two of us.  This is typically a very romantic thing, and its not like we haven't been in romantic situations together (dates that weren't dates or I thought).

It started out great, she got an amazing job and we both loved living here.
But the problem is, that she only has work 2 days a week, doesn't have school, doesn't have friends and doesn't really have money for hobbies.
I've tried to give her advice on how to find friends and how to find something interesting to do but she doesn't really want to try anything. 

I hate seeing her like that. When shes home alone she gets really sad and things are not fine for her. She generally is a happy and out going person, but she has never had to figure out anything by herself (in my opinion because of the way school always tells you what to do) and now is super lost.

Just cheering her up doesn't help, she needs to find friends and something to do. She likes painting, dancing, dogs and wants to be a radio host. I've told her she should find some meet up groups around her interests or maybe go volunteer to work for a radio company on her extra time (which she has a lot).

&amp;#x200B;

So I met this girl at a house party about 2 weeks ago through a mutual 'friend' and we hit it off really well. We went on a coffee date since then, and went really well: the date lasted around two hours and we both enjoyed ourselves very much and we've been in contact since. Fast forward to yesterday, and this girl sends me a snapchat of her and that mutual friend at another party. I think nothing of it as that's what people do: they enjoy themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I was going through my snap stories and I see that that 'mutual' friend posted something... interesting on her story: it's a picture of some dude's back with the words ""/u/sadboithrowaway22 has a chode"" along with a picture a somewhat small dick drawn right next to it. At first, I wasn't self-conscious enough to think it was referring to me, but as I checked the girl who I've been talking to's story, she has the same picture of person's back plus some sentence that refers to her plus a hand/drink covering up the name of the person who has a chode.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm not going to beat around the bush here: my schlong isn't the thickest you've ever seen and has about an average length, but at a glance of my member when it's cold doesn't exactly give me the greatest confidence in the world. That being said, I'm a pretty attractive guy and she's an attractive girl, but I really don't know how I feel about seeing this. On one hand, it's not like I can do anything about the size of my member but accept it (and maybe wish upon a star), but on the other, I feel like if our relationship continues to develop and she eventually sees my dong, I can't help but feel embarrassed that somehow, without that friend group ever actually seeing my meat, she's going to already have preconceptions about me. The social dynamic between us hasn't seemed to have changed since they both posted it, but now I feel sad that people are talking about it.

407,"To make a long story short I had a very bad relationship before my current boyfriend, an abusive marriage that ended in him having an affair and us getting divorced to be exact. 

So I’m carrying a ton of baggage from my last relationship still, such as trust issues and a bit of PTSD and I find it starting to affect my relationship or at least seeing that it may start affecting it. 

I’ve been with this man for about a year and I still really struggle to want to go through his stuff, ie phone, Facebook left open on the computer, etc. because I feel as though I’m going to find something. Now the thing is, I have no reason to suspect this. He’s not going out late at night, sneaking phone calls, being protective of his phone, literally nothing like that. It’s like my brain tells me things are going too smoothly so something must be going on that I can’t see. I understand how that sounds. And I understand that logically speaking I shouldn’t be feeling the way I do but I can’t stop feeling like that regardless. 

Now sometimes I can fight the urge and I won’t snoop, but other times I give in, dig through and find nothing and then feel terrible for invading his privacy in that way. Every time I slip up I tell him because I feel too guilty and just feel like he deserves to know. I can tell it frustrates and hurts him though he’s never made a big deal about it but I still want to stop because he doesn’t deserve it and I know eventually he will grow to resent me for it.  So basically what I’m here asking is advice on how to stop? Whether it’s maybe some helpful distraction techniques I can try when I want to do it so I can think of something else or ways I can try and get over my trust issues from the previous relationship so I can stop the problem at its roots. Really I’m open to any and all helpful advice, hoping an outside perspective and/or suggestion could be eye opening for me. Thanks!

TLDR: Had a bad marriage, left with trust issues. Occasionally goes through current BF stuff or at least wants to even though he shows no signs for me to be concerned in the first place.

My friend keeps telling me all my symptoms are just adhd but I find that hard to believe. I’ve felt like this since I was around 7 and never disclosed some of the things I would do besides to some close friends. I had severe religious ocd when I was a child where I couldn’t do anything in fear that my soul would be devoured by the devil (its kinda silly looking back on it since I’m an agnostic now lol) but it would be like my brain would do things like “if you can’t do this in this certain amount of time you’ll lose your soul” and if I couldn’t complete whatever task my brain set up I would have a really bad anxiety attack and just spiral and the cycle would continue. While I believe I’m relatively stable with it now I still feel super anxious at night and think about every possible outcome of situations that would never occur and would have trouble stopping myself from doing this.

411,"So my one sister gifted my other sister this DNA kit for Christmas last year. Recently this guy matched as a ""close relative"" (she called and they said it usually means half sibling or first cousin). He messaged her and sent her an old photo (1960s) and said he doesn't know his biological father, but asked if the guy in the photo looked familiar. 

Totally looks like young Dad.

On top of that, this guy says he was born in Germany in 1965 -- and I'm pretty sure my dad (drafted?) was stationed there at that time and had a girlfriend there. 

Throughout my life I've heard my mom bring up, maybe twice, this mysterious German girlfriend and her love letters. Also, according to my older sisters, there's even a photo of her in one of our family albums.

This guy says his mother asked him years ago if he wanted to know who his biological father was and he said no because he didn't think it was important. Now he's on non-speaking terms with his mother and seems to be interested in meeting my dad (which we aren't sure is HIS dad, but with all the evidence it seems pretty likely).

My mother is a very old school, traditional, wait-until-marriage, Catholic. There's a possibility both my parents know and never told us, a chance my dad knows and my mom doesn't (worst case scenario) and a chance neither know.

Also, even though this guy was born in Germany he lives in the states now (where we are), was military himself and says he's moving to a city about 5 hours away for work soon.

My dad is more laid back, but almost 80 years old and although I think the right thing to do is tell them, dad first, I don't know if we should say anything at all and risk putting their otherwise almost perfect marriage at risk. Especially at their age.

Do we tell Dad or best pretend we never found out so we can go on happily as we have for (in their case) the last 50 years?

412,"So at my work I have a good relationship with all my coworkers, we regularly go out together, I’ve had parties at my house with all of them and even gone on holiday with a few of them. We’re a laid back work place and everyone knows each other really well. 

I feel very silly getting slightly upset about this but I can’t seem to get it off my mind. People at my work sometimes draw doodles etc and leave them lying about and when I started my shift at the desk I saw a coworker had drawn a word search with all our names in, except my name looked like it had been added onto the end of the list after. When I had time to kill I decided to do the word search and realised that my name was the only one not in it (believe me I triple checked lol), and coworkers that didn’t even work here anymore were on there. I though it was pretty safe to assume she’s forgotten to put me in. 

Now again I realise this is a really silly thing to get bummed about, and believe me I know I shouldn’t worry about it like I am, but I can’t help but feel a little sad thinking about how she remembered everyone working here expect for me. I do chat to her regularly and even got my hair done by her when she was training to be a hairdresser and needed a model. 

So yeah I just wanted to post this because I don’t really know how else to get it off my chest. Obviously I’m not going to say anything but I just wondered would others feel the same? Am I just wildly overthinking? I actually feel a little embarrassed thinking about how I was forgotten like that.

417,"If you check my post history, you'll see my last post is that I caught my best friend giving my 1414-year-old brother a blowjob. The thing is, he initiated it. He flirted with her to begin with.

Despite her being 3 years older than him, he's way smarter and more manipulative than her. In fact, he's the smartest and most manipulative person I know. He's extremely popular, everyone loves him. 

I just confronted him about the blowjob. He said he doesn't care about her, but she's hot and he wanted to bang her. I told him if he didn't stop seeing her, I would tell our parents. He didn't seem that concerned, because he has a history of doing stuff and then convincing my parents I did it.

Is he a budding sociopath? What do I do?",30Sep2018,0
418,"Okay where do I start? Probably by telling you the whole story so you understand why advice such as ""Just completely ignore him forever"" won't work that well.

So I'm a 17 years old guy, and for the past few months, a 12 years old kid has been following me around at school. (I should mention I have zero contact with him outside of the school.) I didn't mind him at first, as he was always nice and funny and I just assumed he needed a school friend.

After a while, he actually started talking to me and telling me a lot of sad stories about his early childhood and family problems. Stuff like being adopted at the age of 7 etc. I won't go into detail, but it's a lot of sad stuff. This made me act nicer towards him and pretty much accept the idea of him following me around at school.

Then, the kid started getting more and more attached to me, to the point of often trying to hug me, giving me a stone necklace he made and even calling me his ""young father figure"", for whatever that means. (He has an actual father). All in all, I need to admit that I've kinda grown fond of him (to a certain extent) and to me he's like a little ""school brother"".

Here's the problem, though:

Lately, he's been starting to act very strangely towards me. He often tries to touch me in inappropriate places, start borderline sexual discussions with me and even sometimes jokingly saying he ""loves"" me. He once asked for my phone number but I refused to give it to him.

I ALWAYS back off when he does any of these things. I keep telling him to stop touching me, but since I never shouted at him or told on him, he thinks I'm not being serious.

What can I do? Am afraid to get in a lot of trouble because of a silly kid who has zero boundaries. But I also don't want to get him in trouble or completely cut him off my life. As I stated earlier, I do like him, but definitely NOT in the way that he likes me, so cutting him off isn't the best option. I'd rather fix the problem than run from it.

422,"I’m 20. Took a semester off college to join a startup going through a business program. Have lost all passion for what I do here and don’t wish to continue; however, my other options are limited.

My parents had a falling out and divorced recently. My mom lives with my grandmother and my dad lives in Florida. Living with either of them sounds hellish.

I have around $4k in savings.

Going back to my home state to go back to college (somewhere) would mean I have to get another job, and the only thing I have experience in is marketing, which I don’t want to do anymore. Also, any good colleges would require me to live alone (they’re far from my home town), so I’d have more bills to pay.

I’ve worked so hard to get where I am now, and starting it all over just sounds like too much. I used to be horribly depressed, and I’m afraid I’ll get thrown right back into it if I regress. I don’t see any light. It’s times like these I wish I could just die to get everything over with.

427,"Okay so, I've been best friends with this wonderful, hilarious, intelligent and talented gay man since we met in college ten years ago. There has never been another person with whom I have connected with on our level. Our friendship really shaped a lot of who I am today and I love him dearly. When we were in school we spent nearly every day together and a lot of nights. We've been living 1000 miles apart since we left school, but we've stayed really close, talking for hours on the phone regularly and have managed a few visits over the years. 

The last time I saw him was in May for my birthday weekend. My boyfriend and I drove to Chicago, picked him up and we all went to a music festival a couple hours from there.  It was a great time at first - we went pretty wild and stayed up rolling the second night for old times' sake... After that, something changed. 

Before I go into further detail, some background info on my friend's mental health: 

About seven years ago, he was prescribed adderall. He doesn't actually have ADD but wanted it for school and managed to convince a doctor to give him a pretty hefty dose. He ended up developing some serious paranoia - thought he was being watched through his windows and computer, and stopped trusting everyone close to him. Most notably, he became absolutely convinced that I had stolen his private journal, copied the pages and distributed them amongst our classmates. Said he had clear evidence of this but refused to actually say what this evidence was.  He cut me out entirely, and soon his parents brought him home and hospitalized him, and he recovered with short term antipsychotics and discontinuation of the adderall.   

Then we were fine. He knew he'd been wrong about my betrayal, and was super embarrassed, but of course I didn't hold it against him and we moved on.  He said he would NEVER touch adderall again, because it was obviously the cause of this episode. 

Maybe eight or nine months ago, he started a nursing assistant job that required him to work sixteen hour, overnight shifts, and he started buying adderall here and there. I voiced my concern, and he reassured me that he was being careful. He said he wasn't taking anywhere near the dosage he had been years ago, and much less frequently. He said he was carefully monitoring himself for any sign of the symptoms that occurred with the precious episode. And he did totally seem normal to me at the time. 

But then, we rolled. And it was like someone flipped a switch. He became suddenly standoffish, walled in. I asked him if he felt okay, and he said ""yes."" 

We were camping with some of my boyfriend's friends (a couple, Courtney and Cam) and their friends. I only knew the couple as acquaintances before that weekend, never even had a prior conversation with either of them.

My friend started thinking they all disliked him, and I reassured him that he was getting the wrong idea. They were all really friendly, and I told him if anything, they think you don't like them, because he was definitely giving off a vibe.  Then he started asking me ""So, did you happen to say something to Courtney about me before I met them all?"" 

I said ""Only that you're my best friend and you're an awesome person and I'm so excited that you're coming,"" which is the truth. 

But he kept bringing it up, eventually telling me ""This is your chance to come clean; I know you said something. She told me.""

I had absolutely no clue what he was talking about, and he wouldn't tell me what she said. Just kept trying to get me to ""confess.""

He also started being really suspicious of my boyfriend and I. Didn't want us near his bags, thought we were trying to steal his stuff. This was completely abnormal behavior. We've always trusted each other completely. 

I started getting really frustrated, and eventually, as we were packing up to leave, I got fucking pissed and demanded he tell me what the fuck he ""knew"" I said about him.

He said, ""I know you told her that 'he's an idiot, he's just a loser I use and keep around as my pet, and he's a pedophile.'""

I was utterly shocked. I freaked, I didn't care about making a scene I was so fucking angry. I was crying and yelling at him, and he was just stone-faced while I desperately tried to make him see how wrong he was. I didn't understand. I questioned for a second if Courtney had actually said that to him, or something he somehow misconstrued as that? Some kind of weird joke? But his demeanor.. I knew what was going on. It was happening to him again. 

So that was the main event. When we brought him back to his house, he was suddenly normal again and my boyfriend and I hung out for the night before our long drive back. But the next morning, before we left we asked him if he still had anything in the car. He said no, he was sure. Then a few hours into our trip he messages us that he left his phone and wallet in the car. We couldn't turn around, we had to get back for work the next day and couldn't spare the 3+ hours it would add. We apologized and promised to fedex it (at our expense) as soon as we got back. He freaked out, said he reported it stolen by us to the police. He also brought up what I supposedly said to Courtney. 

And then he cut me out. 

I tried reaching out a few times and he ignored me until yesterday, when he responded with a fury of enraged texts. A lot of it didn't make sense, but he made it clear he hates me, and doesn't want anything to do with me.

It's just like before. I don't think there's anything I can do and I am heartbroken.

If anyone has any advice, I'd appreciate it, but I don't really think there's anything to do. So maybe this is just a vent. 

Thanks for reading; sorry it was so long winded.

I've been at my job (shipping, like containers and such) for nearly a year now, it's been wonderful so far, the people have been great, the bosses too. I had constant work and was loving every second of it, I was friendly with everyone at work and I felt amazing... But a bout 2 months ago a new person started (We'll call them J). And my work life seemed to turn to hell.  


At first J seemed okay, like all new people do. I was always friendly when we were paired together, but it seemed really apparent that J definitely wanted to be the alpha. J started telling everyone how to do their jobs even if they had years of experience on J, J also told them how to use the radio but refused to use it... Usually we have 2 people per ""gang"" so to speak, so one person is writing stuff down and working the radio, the other person just helps out. J made it very clear not to be given the radio, so whenever J is put on it, they try giving it away to the other person claiming ""I don't like using it, I can't understand them, I don't know what to say"" Almost every time, even if the other person didn't know how to use the radio. It started to get frustrating but, not much else you can do really.   


But the part that frustrates me is J always brags about how they still get guaranteed money each week as they receive a benefit and are also self employed, so it doesn't matter if they get a shift or not. (We have scattered shifts, when we have a boat in the port, we have work)   


This is my only job, my boyfriend also works here with me, but is an operator so he has to work more because we have limited operators. But lately I haven't been getting the work when it's there (It's been about 2 weeks now) He's had work and told me J is there almost every time when I'm not. I have asked about getting more shifts but bosses say they have to ""spread it around fairly"" which I completely understand but, it seems they are prioritizing J over myself. As everyone else is rotated around on the shifts. The downside to this is J is friends with one of the bosses, who got J this job. So I feel I can't go and say anything about this to anyone.  


Some nights I just feel like I'm not good enough for this job, even though the bosses have told me before I'm one of their best because I never turn down work or complain what I have to do.  


I've thought about threatening to leave for our competitor company, but I'm scared it will backfire and I'll just be let go. Could someone give me some advice on what to do about this please? I feel lost.

436,"(Also posted on a relationship advice sub)

This is long but backstory is necessary. Sorry. We're in freshman year of high school in the U.S.

So my best friend (H) and I have been friends for 4 years and we have been super close. My middle school fed into 2 schools(S and N), with us going to S and our other friend(Y) going to N.  Me and Y are super close regardless. There's a program in our school which allows Y to come to S for humanities classes in the  morning and then go back to N. I go in the mornings to see her sometimes and even invited her to homecoming. 

However, I feel like H feels left out or something because whenever I mention Y, she changes the subject. H has plenty of friends that she's known for longer than me that went to another middle school, but now they go to school together. They're nice, but I don't fit in with them and I feel like H is offended by this for some reason. 

Anyways, at the homecoming game, I went with her and that group of friends. I have to say, it was quite possibly the worst experience of my life. I had no fun and felt left out the whole night, hardly anyone engaging me in conversation. I mentioned that to her after and she brushed it off. At homecoming, it was me H and Y, and we were going to meet up with the hoco game group. They were late so we found some of Y's friends and I had an awesome time. We said hi to H's friends but didn't dance in their group like H did. About 20 mins later, H says her friends are boring and weren't dancing, so she was back in our group.

A week later(this past Friday), I went to Ys house and the N football game after school. We didn't invite H because she was being a buzzkill. Y and I talked so much and it was nice to talk to her for hours like we used to in person instead of over text. Anyways, Y and I both posted on snapchat because we were having fun, and of course H saw. She didn't say anything, but I feel kind of bad. 

The next day, I had a debate tournament and my team received 2nd place out of 36 teams and we were 1 of 2 teams to win all of our debates. It was a huge deal. I also received 9/71 for individual speakers and was very proud. I texted both Y and H separately, but something was different about H. She said good job and that's it. Usually, she would ask questions and say I'm so proud of you and stuff, but she didn't. Y did, she was super proud. 

I can't help but feel H is mad at me, but she's one of my only close friends at S. Also because our younger brothers are best friends and I don't want anything to I interfere with that. I don't know what to do because she holds a big grudge a lot, shes still mad at a girl she hardly knows for not inviting her to her birthday party a year ago and mad at another girl she hardly knows for not inviting her to her bat mitzvah a year and a half ago.

438,"I want to start with this: My girlfriend is a great person. We’ll call her Ash. She was recently a stage manager to a college production that caused her a ton of stress. Ash and I don’t see each other a lot, and it causes both of us a lot of stress as well. After one of her plays that I visited for, she wanted to go and party afterwards with her theatre friends. While I had driven a long way to see her, I knew she deserved this with her friends, and told her to go, and just call when she was ready to leave, and I’d get her. She goes to the party, and gets really drunk. Two things about my girlfriend when she drinks. Ash gets very affectionate and feels very free. I personally don’t like alcohol for my own reasons, but I see her appeal in it because she is a normally shy and stressed person, and this gives her a chance to let loose. Another thing you should know, one of the leads of the show, call him Zeke, has a crush on Ash, and knows she knows it, and he also knows of me. Via snapchat stories and eventually being invited in after showing up after she called me, I found a couple of things out. One, Zeke has never had a girlfriend, and my girlfriend promised him she’d help him get one, which is sweet. But less sweet, is that all the while, Ash rubbed his leg in a comforting and almost flirty way. Two, she also danced with everyone, which I won’t claim to have seen, but from the pictures she was dancing provocatively. While she did all this, I just sat back in her house with her roommates that admitted she may have accidentally led him on. 
We never see each other and we had just gotten out of a pretty big fight and both needed the comfort. This happened days ago and I started to bring it up but I didn’t want another fight, so I softened it, and got an apology.. It still bothers me though and I don’t know how to approach her about it...

Even meeting new people is tough; I can't maintain a relationship with anyone without pissing them off so bad that they'd cut me off after such a short time. I've become a little antisocial, socially slow, and acting 'normal' and not awkward is a tough task for me now. Before the incident, these problems were still kinda present, but I was on the road to conquering them until the incident which reversed all my progress well beyond square one.

I'm also mentally slow and have attention problems now. I was a 3.5 student my freshman year, and even though the attention problems and cognitive issues were developing throughout the second semester, I managed to do well despite falling short of my first semester performance. I am now a sophomore and transferring to a big university nearby, so I decided to enroll in just one class this fall semester. Spanish. I dropped it.


I've never been so deficit of attention my whole life. I've had discipline issues with keeping up with schoolwork and consistent academic performance, but that class made me feel like I had severe ADHD. I could only focus on my own depression, my own problems, the incident from a long time ago, and my brain just completely blocked out everything from that class. I was so self-conscious and stressed out that I couldn't speak up in class, started skipping, and ultimately dropped it.


Now, for the roommate thing. I signed up to be matched with random roommates at a student living apartment complex and settled in during the beginning of August. We met for the first time, and I just retreated to my room shorty after. I could not overcome the fear of meeting new people. During the first few weeks, I could hear them talking about me frequently from outside my room about how I never come out unless if nobody is out there, how I don't do anything, and how lame and awkward I am that their roommate refuses to leave his room. They've tried to make me come out by offering some drinks, watching a football game, etc., and I appreciate the effort that they put in to fulfill their duty of being good roommates, but I haven't been reciprocating. They've stopped making an effort to get to know me, and I think they've just given up and accepted the situation.


The only time we talk is during goodbyes and hellos when coming and going from the apartment. Again, awkward. I want to explain to them the whole brain injury thing and how it has affected my personality and way of thinking, but I'm not sure how to do it. It's been almost two months of awkwardness and I'm sure they've already written me off. Their friends were over while they were gone and they caught me in a good time (I was on Dexedrine, which I use to self medicate my overthinking and anxiety with. It's crazy how it zaps my brain almost to how I used to be), and we chilled. They invited me to go out to the bars with them and my roommates, but I could see the awkwardness on their faces when they saw me suddenly acting like a normal person and even accepting an invitation to hang out with them for once, from another person, no less.


I don't even know if they want to take me out, but I want to go. However, that's besides the point. I've decided to take matters into my own hands and tell them my situation. How should I explain this to them? It's so damn awkward to be around them now, and I'm not sure if they'll take me seriously or accept my explanation.

441,"Ok so my classmate in my masters program saw some medical information on my computer. I normally don't let other people use my computer, but we were working on a project together and she asked if she could log in and check something on her student account. I was shocked that she was willing to type her credentials into my computer, but I let her use it. I quickly logged out, closed all the other open windows, hid my bookmarks toolbar, and let her use my browser to log in. That was my mistake. Once she logged in and checked her grades, she logged out, then unhid my bookmarks toolbar and before I could stop her, she saw some information I bookmarked related to a medical condition that I have and a treatment I'm seeking for it. That was last week. In the past week, she's been blabbing about my condition and upcoming treatment to EVERYONE in our small masters program. A couple wonderful classmates let me know she was doing this, offered their sympathies and let me know to ask them if I need anything. It's not a serious condition but I appreciated their gestures. But now the classmate is talking to professors and telling them that I need extensions on my assignments. I don't! I'm able to complete all the work on time. Now professors are telling me they'll grant me extensions but drop my grade by 5% and I'm like ""NO! I have the assignment done already!"" My classmate has caused such a problem for me.

442,"So, every year my family and a lot of my dad’s old friends’ familys go to a island for a weekend to have fun. One of my dad’s friends has a daughter and she is a few months older than me.

445,"I'm too lazy to go in depth but basically I have severe behavioural issues and I'm to stuck in my ways to medicate myself or attempt to bond with my family. Anyway quick run down, after being suspended over 40 times combined since primary school and changing high school 3 times I was admitted to a school for troubled kids and referred to a psychologist. After 1 year of sessions with the psychologist I was diagnosed with Conduct Disorder and ADHD, this was around 3 months ago and since my mother has given birth to ANOTHER baby. I was prescribed ritalin to help me concentrate which I found useless because I haven't attended ""school"" since December and don't plan on ever returning. My main issue isn't school as I feel comfortable with my level of intellect and I don't think progression or improve will be found through attending that school. For those who wonder about earning qualifications for a job in future my life will end at age 18 which is something my mind is set on. I want to die youthful, my main issue in my life is my family. I have a big sister (Aged 17) a little brother (Aged 1) and a little who is 1 week old (Prematurely born) My relation ship with my ""family"" is absolutely toxic and has been for the past 2 years. I rarely talk to them and whenever they make an attempt to talk to me I say the worst shit I can think of such as ""I hope you miscarriage"" ""I hope you're abducted by a homeless man and raped""  and shit as simple as ""I hope you die."" 

I hate them and everything about them... I know i'm sounding a lot like an edgy teen but it's to the point were I am a danger to myself and siblings. I would never harm my younger siblings, children are off limits when it comes to violence but I'm very close to killing myself and I have attempted to many times. The resolve i'm attempting to find in all of this is removal from my family. I have no clue how I would be taken from them and I do have a social worker but I don't know how to approach her with such a complex issue. I haven't went too deep into everything and I know it seems pretty one sided but trust me i'm not the only one at fault here, I was neglected by my parents at an early age and suffered sexual and emotional abuse from other adults (Not in my family.) I haven't spoken about the abuse to anyone and never will... I can live with it.

Any information on how to approach things would be much appreciated. I just really need to know how I can be taken from them, where I would go and what the consequences would be. My current plan isn't to tell my social worker and try to go cordially but to inflict severe damage onto my ""rivals"" in an attempt to be locked into what are called ""secure units"" aka child prisons. Rivals is a bit dramatic but people who I have had drama or disagreements with and the list is surprisingly short due to complete isolation for the past year, no social media no outside world my brain is rotting day by day which is why I have turned to reddit as a kind of last resort. The reason I haven't committed suicide is because I don't want to cause stress for my mothers children. 

What do you guys think I should do in my situation? Currently leaning towards suicide but it's 51/49 I'm also contemplating the ""rivals"" thing is it's 100% assurance that I'll be taken away and guarantees new scenery or just ""A breath of fresh air."" Btw for anyone concerned I probably won't kill anyone just beat someone or multiple people really bad and announce to the officers who interview me that I will do it again and just act generally cantankerous to make them want me locked away.

My apologises if this was difficult to read due to my scattered speech... I'm working on it and I'm aware I can't write for shit lol.

TL;DR: I have committed so many crimes and endured so many school suspensions that it has spawned a toxic side of myself that has spread throughout my family causing an awful environment for the babies living there and myself who is already considering suicide. I ask for help in obtaining a departure from my ""family"" thank you.",30Sep2018,0

448,"Hi, this is my first post ever, I was kinda reluctant to post, but I REALLY need some advice, and I don't know who else to turn to. I wanna apologize beforehand if there's some broken english here and there, since english is not my first language. Also I am on mobile so sorry of there's any more weirdness.
Buckle up, cause it's a long one.

So, context. I'm now 20 years old and have a 1 month old daughter. I know I am young and shame on me, but I love my LO, she's everything to me. I currently live with my mom, my stepdad and three younger siblings (10yo, 7yo, 3yo). My BF has been an amazing support through all of it, specially since my pregnancy wasn't really easy to me. I dealt with a lot of sadness and felt like my whole campus was judging me (i was studying, took this semester off and still don't know if I'm gonna go back or what, but that's another story), I thought all my friends would abandon me, and had to deal with some awful people that thought it was cool to basically mock me and my BF, ironically congratulating us for the pregnancy posting it in facebook in a group with tons of people (I hadn't even told all my friends yet, and I was freaking out over it, thought all of them would hate me), then suggesting I should get an abortion (not in a nice way trying to help me). 

But my problem right now is here, at home. For some necessary back story, my mom had me also when she was 20, only difference is that my dad was an asshole, they got married but it didn't last, and he proceeded to ghost on us and be an awful father. But my stepdad shortly after came into our lives and  he was the best. He taught me so many things, but most importantly he was there through everything. He taught me how to drive a bike, showed me star wars, bought me books, listened to me, and was a friend when I didn't have any. When I found out about the pregnancy, he was so suportive. He hugged me while I cried scared, or hormonal, idk, I just cried while he hugged me, and as always, he made me feel safe in his huge embrace. 
But a few months back, something inside him just snapped. He became severly aggressive with my siblings, yelling at them constantly, threatening them with physical punishment, treating them like garbage, he started behaving weird with my mom too, yelling at her and fighting over everything. I see how my little bros are struggling with it, the oldest one started plucking his eyebrows and cries himself to sleep, so does my sister. He cannot end a sentence without cursing at least three times. As for me, he began ignoring me. I had to do a couple of weeks of bed rest, and days would go by and he wouldn't talk to me. And when he did, he looked in my bedroom, said hi, and left. I was broken hearted, I needed him so much. But things just got worse. Every time we would speak he'd started yelling at me for no reason. Stoped speaking at all to my BF, and talked pure shit about him and how he was gonna beat the crap out of him cause he just thought he was an asshole. Then he started yelling at me for using things, for example the hair dryer run up his light bill, and I already had fucked up and was gonna bring another kid to the house that he was gonna have to pay for even if it wasn't his. Or talked to me about how irresponsible I was for deciding to take this semester off, that I'm a lazy fuck up, and am not even bringing money in to help. I have spoken about this with my mom, since it has really affected me, but every time we speak about this, my dad ends up going into this speech of how I am irresponsible and deserve to be treated like this. 
My BF is not only concerned for me, but also, every time he comes to visit, he's not even greeted, he has tried people, he really has. We hide in my bedroom all day long, eat up here after everybody else is done. My mom has been amazing, but he's still out doing this. Just yesterday, he insisted I had dinner with them downstairs, suggested I shouldn't eat something cause I'm still fat (fyi I now weare all my pre baby clothes and they fit perfectly, but am still dealing with A LOT of body issues), then proceeded to take my kid while I did the dishes and stood behind me as he told her how much of a fuck up I am, that I'm dumb and stupid, that I'm a terrible mother and she should hate me and love him. I love my mom, and don't wanna break her heart, or get her angry at me, but I just can't deal with this anymore. My BF just got an apartment alone, he used to share one with friends, and told me that if I need to, we can move in. And oh boy do I want to. 
Here's were I need help. Should I stay here, were there's lots of money, and where I will have access to resources if needed (tho will be shamed for wasting their money), or should I go with my BF, where we may not have that much, but we will be happy? 
I don't wanna fuck things up with my mom, and I can't help but to feel ungrateful, and that I'm overreacting and in some part I do have to accept my dad treating me like that. I don't know guys. Please help me.

449,"So I have a pretty small family and the women are generally catty. As I’ve come into adulthood (just turned 23) I’ve noticed these traits and set out to not follow the family script.
One of my aunts is, in my opinion, the cattiest of them all. She’s the type of person to make fun of somebody’s wedding dress at the reception dinner. This was really fun when I was a teenager! I could say something off base and she’d be the one to laugh! But she did cross the line a few times, when I was 17, she told me about her affair. And on my 21st birthday she tried convincing me my mom, who was separating from my dad, was having an affair.
Recently, she’s had a really tough run. She had a tough break up and isn’t handling it well. Being the niece, I did not know all the details. Yet. 
I’m not a big birthday person so my mom invited just my two aunts and my grandmother to a small dinner the day before my 23rd, my best friend was also there. My father and siblings recently moved across the country and it was an emotional day for me but I was trying to keep it together. I was warned that the aunt in question would not show for dinner but would come for a drink. When she shows up, she’s wearing a bulky sweatshirt, work out shorts, and her face is tear stained. I’m taken aback as we’re all dressed to the nines, as we usually do for birthdays. Other aunt asks, “how are you?” And aunt in question answers, sarcastically, “oh just dandy.”
I’ll admit it, I snapped, I turned to her and in a voice you use to reprimand a child said, “well it’s a birthday so let’s be nice please.” Mistake. Hysteria.
“I didn’t come all this way for this” and storms out. Now I’m thinking I’m gonna follow her to the car, apologize for flying off the handle, hug it out, and it would be over. So I try that. She’s totally hysterical. C words are flying, fingers are wagged in faces, and she ultimately tells me *when* she commits suicide, the blood will be on my hands.
In the coming days I learn she’s stopped going to work, is in therapy multiple days a week, is leaving her husband, and that the restaurant we went to is apparently the bar she would meet up with her lover at. My plan is to let it cool off a bit, and reconcile.
Life got in the way: my car got stolen, I moved, I found out I was pregnant, I changed jobs, I honestly forgot I had a “duty” (set by other aunt and mom) to apologize to aunt in question.
I was still planning on apologizing until this past week I was informed that aunt in question, now two months later, told my mom I was mocking her during our argument for threatening suicide. This is not true. My mother was there for mediation and I work in mental health and would never do this. I was actually more upset, for her,than offended when she said what she said, knowing she isn’t in her right mind.
I feel as if I’m caught between a rock and a hard place. My life is really starting, and I’m worried about introducing another generation to this toxicity. I don’t want anything to do with her. Am I hormonally overreacting? Should I be the one to apologize? What would you do? Give me an action plan! ",30Sep2018,1

So backstory I have been depressed for several years and that took a heavy impact on my grades in school. The last two semesters I basically didnt go to class at all. And ended up failing out and getting on academic suspension, after some research into my suspension at my college I found out that my school has a program for people who have depression and failed because of it. The program will let me back into college and basically wipe my failed classes from my transcript. And the program requires that I seek mental health help (which I have and things are better), and they also require a personal statement about what my circumstances and why I want to get re-admitted to my college.

So far for my personal statement I only have that I was severely depressed and that made my willingness to go to class next to none, and made me want to shy away from going to class because I could fail. And now since I have gotten mental health help I do not feel that way anymore. And I actually want to take on the challenge of going to class.

I msgd her 3 hours before dinner to let her know I couldn’t make it because I was coming down with a cold. 

She lost it. She said I’m not very present lately (I see her once a week, like I always have, which is more than I see other friends), that I don’t respond to text msgs in time (it takes me up to 24 hours because I don’t always have my phone on me for work purposes). She said she expected more from her best friend, even if that was to suffer through dinner. 

I so rarely cancel, and I hate running late so will often leave way earlier to get to a meeting on time. But if I slip up, this friend thinks it’s a personal attack on her. 

He grandmother died 3 months ago and whilst this outburst has a lot to do with that, it should be pointed out that she’s always had these outbursts.

My other friend (who she doesn’t know) committed suicide last month, so I’ve been dealing with that. But somehow, her issue is more important. 


I don’t want to lose her as a friend, but how can I explain to her that I find her behaviour unreasonable and I feel like I’m being held ransom to her expectations? How can I make her see that her expectations are unreasonable?

468," Living with my mom is hell. When I ask her if I can do something simple like riding my bike to school which is a few block away, she says no and tells me some fucking stupid reasons why and just says stuff that make me angry then she says that's why I can't do anything. She always does this. One time I got really mad because she threw away my $80 air-soft helmet and when I told her to get it back she keeps saying no because your being really loud and all that. She never buys me the food I want, always buys the food I hate, and purposely gets orders wrong when I ask her to buy me something on the way home. When she does buy me the food I want she cooks its horribly then makes me eat it. I'm tired of eating ramen every day. She should have enough money to pay for all the food I need, because my dad pays a ton of money in child support. In fact she never uses the money from that on me and instead on herself. When I tell her to tell my grandma to feed my dog less food she says she does but she really just says "" Don't listen to him"". I think shes trying to overfeed her so she has bad hips and therefore has to get put down. My mom doesn't pitch in with stuff I need such as dress clothes for a dance I have to go to and always makes my dad pay for it and go behind in his rent and all that. Before 7th grade she wanted to put me through some cheap, lousy school full of gangs and think I will still have a great career later. And if your wondering why I'm mad about not being able to ride to school; well it's so I don't have to go to daycare where you'll get in trouble for calling your fucking parents. I don't want to go to daycare anymore because my mom leaves me there till 6 pm and its so boring so I do stuff i'm not suppose to and get in trouble. Anyways I don't know what  do, so i'm asking ya'll what I should do. If my dad had more custody and actually lived in his house and not my mom; I'd think I wont have any issues that I just told you.",30Sep2018,1
469,"I’m a 19m going to college in San Francisco. I work at out schools gym as a  [Route setter ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_setter). I’ve been working here for about a year and a half now. In SF the minimum wage is 15/hr, but the school doesn’t have to pay us that. It’s bullshit but it’s the way it is. Currently I make 13.50 an hour, the same as everyone else that works in the gym. As a route setter my job is much more demanding than any other position excluding the mangers. The rest of them just sit on their phones and help the occasional customers, that’s all they have to do. Meanwhile I show up and work 6-7hrs straight with no breaks. I work way more than any other route setter except perhaps my student manager, but even then he mostly does office work like scheduling people. I consistently put up the best routes and the most routes. I can do two routes and a bolder problem in 4hrs easy. It takes the others 4-6 hours to do one route and 1-2 hours for a bolder problem. Yet because we are paid hourly working fast and doing good work is of no benefit to me. In fact the other guys make more money than me because it takes them so long.

So yea idk what to do, I’ve never asked for a raise before. 


Sorry for any bad grammar, kinda frustrated rn. 

TLDR- I work harder and more than other employees yet I make the same or less than them. How should i ask for a raise.

470,"I have a friend.  Well, had one.  She was in a relationship. They broke up, but remained roommates. Right at the end of August, her roommate  called her at work and said she was going to kill herself.  My friend went home,  stopped her with the help of the police.  Because the police were called, roomie had to go with them and be evaluated. Ended up being a 7 day stay in a psych ward. On Sept 3, my mom fell and broke her foot.  I had to leave work, and that ended up being out for 2 weeks. When I left that morning,  friend was at work, her roomie was home, and as far as she was concerned all was relatively well. That was the last day I saw her. She stopped coming in to work. Called out for 2 days and then stopped that as well. Our HR lady even called the police to do a wellness check on her.  I had been texting and calling friend with no response.  I finally get a phone call from her roomie, saying friend is in a bad place emotionally and wants to be left alone, and she'll call me when she feels like talking.  Ok, fine. No reason given or anything.  So a couple of days later I get a text from her saying she is fucked up literally and figuratively.  I'm at urgent care again with mom because of complications from the broken foot. So I tell her I can't talk right now and I love her and to take care of herself.  Later on that evening I text her and no response.  Same deal for the next 3 days. I figured if was texting me she was ready to talk. Later again, I get a message on messenger from her ex husband saying ha hadn't heard from her in a while was everything ok? They have a son together, and she thinks adores him. That's why ex was calling, because she hadn't talked to her son about as long as I hadn't. And at that time, it was about 2 weeks. So last night her ex messages me again asking if I had heard from her. No. I give him my number and we talk for a few minutes about how strange this all is.  He says he got a couple of texts here and there with BS reasons why she hasn't talked to her son. This guy is kind of straight laced, and tells me how he found out she had been smoking weed and it bothered him.  I tell him I knew about the weed and it helped her with stress, and it was no big deal, weed is not so bad, I'd kill my hub if he didn't have it, I kind of tried to put it in a different perspective, that no his ex wife wasn't some druggie just because she like to smoke a little weed.  He then tells me the reason it bothered him was because way before she married him, (she's 48) she was a heroin addict.  It seemed like everything clicked in place. Cutting all ties with me, her son, everyone that gave a damn about her. And since she cut all ties she had been drinking hard, according to another  roommate I barely know, but who also works where I work ( big box retail). I think she's back on that shit. And I don't know what to do. I guess I just needed an outlet. There are so many little things in leaving out. Not trying to write a novel here.

478,"Hello,

My mother (54) has been in the hospital repeatedly for numerous reasons related to body pain, intense aches, leg cramps, the inability to exert herself physically, feelings of tiredness even just from simply walking to the mailbox. She's very obese and always makes bad health choices, such as eating fast food, candy, and drinking soda. All she ever does is sit on the couch, play games on the iPad, and watch TV. The house is never clean, dishes and laundry are always dirty, and the refrigerator is always packed with leftovers and take out gone bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I (23 M) lost my job truck driving two weeks ago, I've been making conscious choices to be healthier. Making salads instead of eating potato chips, drinking water instead of soda, roasting vegetables from the farmer's market, etc. Even going on a walk around the block twice (one with each dog) every night at sunset (though I have been falling behind on this since the last three nights I've been busy...not tonight. I'll restart my streak tonight). In the two years of truck driving I gained 50 pounds, as a result I've been a ""health nut"" since I've been home. My mother has even started taking measures to counter me at every move. One night I was roasting sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts when she discarded them outside, claiming they smell bad and she can't stand it. When I made a barley salad using butternut squash, dried cranberries, and red onion, she gave it all to the neighbor without telling me. She has always refused to cook vegetables when I grew up, the only exception was a simple lettuce and tomato salad drenched in ranch dressing. Last week she would stop me from taking my evening walk by saying she had to meet someone important, but it turned out that she lied and wanted McDonalds. After a trip to the ER in which she was told to eat more potassium, she wanted me to take her and get a baked potato...from Wendy's. Even though I had a whole sweet potato that could have filled the need. Nope, she got herself two bacon burgers, a large fry, large coke, chili...and a baked potato from Wendy's. Oh, I have since swore off all fast food with the exception of Taco Bell since nothing will ever force me to give up TB. Gotta have my one cheat ;)

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from that, my mother not only seems to be making the wrong choices, but doing so on purpose and against the advice of her nutritionists and doctors. She refuses to go for a walk - even to the stop sign five houses down and back. She eats fast food almost every day. And it seems that she hates the fact I'm making my own health changes since I quit my job as a truck driver.

If the doctors can't get through to her, how can I?",30Sep2018,3
479,"Hi Reddit I need some advice,

I am a mid-twenties unemployed envi sci/water quality researcher with a BA in environmental science. I spent the past three years in research as both a technician and a research assistant. I enjoyed my time in research but I learned that I won't be content merely uncovering environmental problems and I want to play a role in solving them. 

This led me to the field of industrial hygiene/occupational and environmental health--which I thought would be a good fit for me. I applied to various industrial hygiene/occupational and environmental health programs because I believed it would give me agency to keep people safe. However, as it turns out occupational and environmental health standards are quite antiquated and what we consider legal isn't always safe. I started a masters program over the summer but recently decided to leave the program before any deadlines for a multitude of reasons: 

1. I didn't want to spend time studying worker exposure if it doesn't ensure safety

 2. I was getting really stressed out reading about chemical exposure limits, cancer, people getting sucked into machines/dying at work; visiting factory settings knowing all the dangers was stressing me out 

3. I have an IBD and I take immunocompromising drugs for it and my safe exposure threshold is likely a lot lower than the average adults. Of course it had not crossed my mind until I was sitting in a toxicology class, but I might not be safe or even cleared for work in some locations 

4. My long-time girlfriend moved to another part of the country--we are still together and going strong. She is my support system and my best friend. We used to live together and it is very hard being away from her, and I didn't want to spend any more time away from her if I didn't have to. 

5. Mentally I was not in a good space and I was worried that my grades would suffer if I stayed in the program. 

6. It was a very technical program I was in, and ultimately it was just not what I wanted to do with my life. 

I left on good terms with my advisor, and teachers. 

I am now wondering how to proceed. I feel like such a fool for not knowing what I want to do with my life, and throwing away a chance at grad school. I have lots of other interests but I don't feel qualified for any other fields. I think I could also see myself getting into health, public administration. I really like leading teams and solving workplace problems. Are there any entry level jobs I should be searching for? I want to work at least a year in the field before I commit to another program.

483,"I am chronically ill, have pretty severe mental illness, and am on Social Security Disability. I grew up in Virginia, then when I was in my late 20s, I moved to Portland, OR with my parents, as my dad got a job there. I was there for just under 4 years. We moved back to VA a year and a half ago, I now live with my parents. My parents have been able to financially support me (my income is literally less than $700 a month, most all of it goes to rent) and I lived on my own in PDX in an apartment they helped pay for. My parents are my support system, which is a huge part of why I moved back with them, but the other big part is PDX is expensive and they can’t afford to help me with all the things I would need. I am *extremely* grateful for everything they do for me and I will happily stay living with them forever if that’s my only option, but I really miss my life in PDX. 

I miss all the normal stuff like my friends, favorite places, the weather (I love rain), all that, but what I REALLY miss is how well the city works for a disabled person like me. I had a fantastic therapist and psychiatrist, I had world class care at OHSU, TriMet made getting anywhere so easy and cheap, everything I needed was in a 3 block radius, I was able to feel independent after a lifetime of being very sick. I have nothing here, other than my parents’ support (which is a huge thing), compared to there and it sucks. It’s like I I got a taste of a world where everything was designed for me, then I got yanked out of it just as I got comfortable.

I have trouble reciting stories because I get ahead of myself and I can't seem to find the right words.

When I can't convey my stories how they truly felt to me, I'd rather not tell them in the first place.

When I engage in conversation, I have trouble continuing on a single subject. I change the subject and it makes me seem uninterested.

This has further contributed to my lack of expression.

My mind is a cage.

I could be surrounded by people I love and still be alone in my mind.

I'm a good listener but a bad responder.

I consider myself logical and smart in many regards but I often come off as empty.

Sometimes I need to make a conscious effort to think about something.

I'm very patient and I rarely get bored but being content in nothingness makes me seem boring to others.

I often fill the emptiness in my head with useless entertainment.

I love sharing my passions but I have trouble doing so.

I adapt to other people's interests to seem more interesting to them but I tend to keep my own interests to myself.

497,"Hi everyone,
I’ve got a very unique situation that I would love some advice on. I’ll take you back to the start of the story, which was about 4 months ago. My puppy was about 4 months ago old and would happily be in my backyard whenever my partner or I were not home. One day , after coming home from work, my partner and I came home to my puppy looking very upset and weirdly , wet. We then shifted our focus to the fence that had a massive hole in it , it was a hole large enough for the neighbours dog to rip through and enter my backyard. Long story short, my neighbours dog had ripped the fence palings off and entered my backyard, where the dog then attacked my dog, leaving her with a puncture wound in her neck that required a vet visit that night . After this incident happened the neighbours put plywood up agains the fence in order to reinforce it and prevent their dog from entering my backyard again. This dog not work and on numerous occasions, day after day the dog would continue to rip down the fence palings very aggressively .  My partner and I felt helpless, and spoke to them on numerous occasions to which they basically replied ‘ there’s nothing else I can do’ . I had even told them that we had to keep our dog inside every day because I was too scared to keep our outside for the fear of their dog ripping though and attacking her again. We believed that if it had gotten though it would have killed her because she was so defenceless and scared. Eventually, on one evening that I was home, the dog ripped through numerous fence palings in such an aggressive manner that , to be honest , I was in tears because I was scared. I rang my partner and he was nearby because of work. He came and was very very frustrated, he rang the neighbour and told them to handle their dog because it’s ripping through our fence again. It seemed this was a catalyst for the whole situation. The fence was beyond repair and eventually the neighbour had to pay out of their own pocket to get it fixed ( although I think that’s fair as we did nothing to the fence). Following the installation of the new fence , the neighbours dog had started nibling on fence palings again, which resulted in further reinforcement of the fence. Flashback to my current situation. A few weeks ago, the neighbours dog had actually jumped over the fence and was in my backyard with my pup. Luckily, I was home and immediately called her inside. After speaking to my partner and taking into account that I needed to leave soon as I had a meeting, I had to cal the council to get it taken out of my yard. It turns out the dog was able to jump over into my yard as the neighbours had reinforced the fence with multiple sheets of plywood and kind of established a ramp for the dog to jump on. This ‘ramp’ was taken down, but the dog is still able to jump on my fence without the extra levels. As of today, the neighbours dog was on top of the fence with its whole body on my side of the fence and was about to jump over , I yelled at it telling it to get off and it did, so my pups safe . I’m waiting for a person from the council to get back to me , but the neighbours have taken no further action to prevent their dog from jumping over my backyard. With my pups attack still in my mind, I am so scared of the neighbours dog jumping over when I’m not home. I really need some advice on what to do , because every time I leave home I’m worried that he’ll jump over and injure her . My partner and I have spoken to the neighbours on numerous occasions and nothing has worked . I think they need to cage their dog or at least chain it up while they’re not home. Someone give me some advice , I’m so sick of worrying about this.  Sorry about the long post by the way ",30Sep2018,6

501," My roommate is a friend of mine of 12+ years. Were both 25 now. 
 All he does is sit day in and day out playing Playstation for 10+ hours and doing blow. When hes working his 12 hour shifts it's still about 6 hours a day, getting little sleep. 
 He doesn't do any housework, stays in his room 24/7, dishes get moldy, cats piss on things, bathroom stinks and he orders SkipTheDishes almost every single day to avoid cooking. 
 
I'm not exactly innocent as we both smoke a lot of weed, but at least I keep my share immaculately clean. My dishes never sit terribly long and I vacuum and sweep every week and pay all my bills. I'm pretty sure I'm a decent roommate by these standards. 

I feel like if I mention that I'm uncomfortable with this behaviour hes just going to try and hide it even more. The fact that hes an old friend makes it even harder. 

I fear it's going to come down to having to break the lease and move out but I cant afford the 3500.00 (est.) fee..  

If I HAD to remove him would this be possible? I dont know If i can live with him for another 8 months.

502,"So there’s this girl who I have literally all my classes with and she constantly shows signs of intense attraction to me. BUT- she dated another guy (my good friend) before and turns out, she never even liked the guy that much in the first place. After that she got dumped by some other guy and now she’s set her eyes on me. She 2 years older than I am and I don’t know who to handle this stuff. I’ve never had a crush on somebody (ever) but there’s an odd charm to her. Any help??",30Sep2018,2
503,"Me and her have been separated for three years. Over that time she has been invovled with one of our mutual friends. It was about 3 days after she left me that she moved in with him.  After the first year we started talking again regularly via text. Shes admitted she wants to come home to me and our kids, and that she wasnt happy with him. We would talk about future and becoming a family again. After almost two years of talking about it she finally left him and moved back closer to us to work on things. She has been staying with me off and on as she is looking for a place. I started falling back into my old routine of forgetting things and not remembering to inform her in everything that's been going on with our kids. She started to get really distant and I knew something was wrong. I found messages to her ex of pictures of herself naked on my bed and him sending them back saying how much they miss each other.... Ohh are you in his bed... I love you and I love you toos. 
I dont know what to do. I love her. I've always loved her. Were not back together we were closer then we are now but we've never been official. After confronting her all I got was I dont know what to say. I'm here right. 
I dont want to give up on us. I want my family back. The kids want there mom back. I've been a single dad for 3 years and it's no easy picnic. Props to any single parents out there. But I dont want her back just to fill that void. I miss her. I've never wanted anyone the way I do her. But I'm scared I'll never trust her again. When I look at her now all I see is the photos she sent. His laugh towards me. Am I stupid. Help reddit should I give up or hold on. ",30Sep2018,3
