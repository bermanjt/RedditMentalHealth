The problem I have is, the opportunities I have found require years of college. College, I have tried and is just not the right setting for me .

3,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for 5 months now and in the time I’ve gotten to know her, I’ve gotten to know her parents too, and there’s clearly something wrong with them. There are many shining examples but the latest one was a bit much.

We just came back from a holiday together along with two of my other friends who are dating. During day 3/5, my GF’s dad messaged her demanding she put a post on social media so that they know she’s having a good time. My GF responded and told him to calm down but he retorted with “how would you like it if I didn’t respond to your texts after 3 days when you need to be picked up from work?” This really pissed me off

Aside from this, her parents never take her driving because “they never listen to her”, so she can’t get her learner hours up, which in turn makes her parents angry because she can’t drive on her own yet. It’s just an endless loop.

I feel as if my GF won’t say anything, even when she does her parents throw it back on her. What’s the best way she can go about this?",06Feb2018,2

10,"I am a 21 y/o female. I have no idea what i want to be. I know my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to jobs and what i want but i wonder if you guys may have suggestions.
Weaknesses:
* bad at memorization and logical thinking. Something that would be sort of the same task over and over would be good
* bad at spelling
*have a harder time picking up new skills than others, typically after enouph practice i can get as good as most people are when they start. 
*bad at school, especially math.
*good with customers but come off as nervous, possibly unprofessional and give in easily.
*tendancy to not understand directions, have to be told a couple times sometimes before i understand
Strengths: 
* willing to do things that are ""gross""
*able to handle sad situations and not be effected to harshly.
* friendly, optimistic, generally happy
* willingness to cover shifts and help beyond what is asked of me
*strong ethics
*high empathy
*willing to do hard physical work
*does not get bored easily. Would be able to do very repetitive tasks or hand out repetitive information. 
*it takes a long time to learn things but once i do i have a very deep understanding and am able to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions and ideas

Best case scenerio i could find a job that requires a certificate or a 2 year (i'd rather do something that required some college or some sort of extra schooling) classic 9-5 or anything with stable hours would be amazing, something i could live off. Not too mentally high stress. Could not do nursing for this reason. Will look into any suggestions! Thank you!

11,"My husband has given me an ultimatum. I can choose to be with him or continue to be friends with my best friend for over 10 years. My husband is foreign and my best friend is a gay male. I truly love my husband and don't want to get a divorce, but I also can't give up a friendship that has being going on so long. If anyone has some insight it would be great to hear. ",06Feb2018,2
12,"So before i tell this going on story, i need to clear some stuff up. First, i'm 14, i'm probably just thinking too deeply or being stupid about it. Second, i'm not trying to brag about our relationship, i'm literally wondering if this is gonna last. Third, we haven't met yet we are in a long distance relationship, that's why i'm scared because i really love her and want to be with her in the future.

Anyways, about a month or two ago me and my friend we're talking and we started talking about relationships and having a girlfriend, i wasn't really looking for a girlfriend but eventually we started looking at pages on social media of other girls our age. I didn't find someone that seemed interesting or that i was attracted to, so we kinda just got off the subject. But a couple days later while going through the pages i find this really cute girl that liked what i'm interested in, i started talking to her and i think i kinda went blunt cause i told her she was cute and stuff, i know pretty cringey at our age, after a little while meaning like 5 days or so she said she liked me too and we started dating. Yes we jumped into a relationship that fast, immediately we both started getting to know each other more and i felt really good, i wasn't in all love but she seemed like a really nice girl. But eventually she started talking about how she has depressed, and i shared with her that i also get really depressed sometimes and we kinda bonded over how we we're both making each other happy, a few weeks go by and she just breaks up with me out of no where, confused and sad i just kinda laid down and we talked it over. We stayed friends for a week but we got back together and talked more, she said the main reason why she dumped me was because she was afraid i was gonna leave her, she told me how she hasn't dated in a year because her last bf treated her like an ass and dumped her for a more pretty girl, it was disgusting to think about. Anyways i showed her i loved her and i cared about her and we really got closer after that. I know we kinda jumped into but i do really love this girl, i can't say how much i do, she is so sweet and cute, and i know some people saying your just in love because your young and need someone to love, but that's not true, i have had many gfs in the past but she is really special, i never felt this way until i met her. 

Now the thing i'm wondering is will it last, we are planning on meeting in the summer, ohh and i forgot to add remember my friend that i was talking about earlier, i showed him her page, and guess what, its his COUSIN! I got kinda scared cause i'm such close friends with him but he said it was fine, and we kinda awkwardly laughed it off. But anyways we are planning on meeting at his house, we have sent a lot of pics, talked a lot, and don't think like that we are actually both christian which is amazing, so yeah. So the thing i'm scared about is we are both in middle school, she's in 7th Grade, i'm in 8th Grade almost in high-school, but i'm worried once we get to college we are gonna lose connection with each-other or grow apart eventually. I love her more than i have loved anyway before, i really want her to be in my future, i don't want to lose her, does anyone have any advice or they can relate, thanks guys.",06Feb2018,2
13,"My roommate moved in because he was living with his parents and they were at each other's throats. They often yell at him unreasonably (to me anyway) because his dad is very professional, sells insurance, while his mom is a lawyer. They yell at him because he likes and wants to work security instead of selling insurance etc. I overheard one of their fights and told him he could stay with me. Also, his parents offered to pay $400 a month to help him with rent and bills. The downside, now after staying with me for two months, he has no job and his parents are cutting him off. He went into a job interview where they offered $9hr and he said he was worth more than that. The only problem is that I'm tired of buying food for the both of us. Also, I feel like he doesn't do anything most days. He doesn't clean up after his clothes, etc and he will lay in bed for 10hrs +. When I spoke to him today, he just got very upset and yelled and told me not to bother him while he lay in bed. I'm also pregnant and working full time. ",06Feb2018,2

The problem is that another friend (Lets call her Chloe) is in love with Aaron and recently told me. I know for sure that Aaron only sees Chloe as a friend and that he is in love with Gwen (Chloe Doesn't know this, only I do).

I can't tell Chloe that Aaron doesn't like her (that would break her heart). Chloe said I could tell Aaron if I wanted, but I don't think that's the right thing to do. What should I do?

18,"I lived on my own for several years and have a very low standard of living. My dad, on the other hand, has been trying to heighten it in ways that have ultimately made me dependent on him. He gave me a car after a semi or something destroyed mine in a hit and run. He started paying for the car insurance for the car as well. I can't afford to make payments on the car because he got one outside of my budget, but I'm in a trap now. I was laid off from my office job and had to do what my dad said because he's making huge sacrifices to give me this car. I had to move back in with him and take the job he wanted me to have, which requires a car. The job isn't awful--i would have liked it when I was 18--but now it feels like I'm in prison. It's a complete waste of time when I should be focusing on finding a career.

He is very emotionally attached to my job and is constantly policing me about it because of his best friends owns the business. I talk about still looking for work and he gets pissed off--I NEED to do this until at least October because that is what he promised her (the owner).

If he texts me and I don't respond for a few hours due to being annoyed at him, my phone charging, or whatever the reason, his reaction ranges from sending me a long message about how I'm selfish and shutting him out to threatening to call the police to find me because I'm clearly missing.

I've tried actually going missing with a Greyhound ticket, trying to find a cheap place I could move to along the way. It went as expected. He blew up my phone about how my sister (who doesn't even like me at all) is up all night sobbing because she thinks I'm dead. And he had an elaborate story about how I was being held hostage and my texts saying I was fine were actually from a kidnapper. While I was gone, he broke the transmission on 'my' car while driving it around, and I had to foot the bill to get rid of any extra money I may have had saved up.

This is beyond where ""just move out"" is good advice. Even if I can find a job and place to live somewhere, once he gets my address, I can expect to answer his 20 questions and random quizzes (to prove I'm not taken hostage) all the time or have the police at my door on a welfare check. I want to be selfish and go back to being dependent on myself.",06Feb2018,3

20,"Hello, I have come for advice on what probably seems like an odd concept; I was wondering if there was a way to completely eradicate sex drive. 

But first, a little backstory. I'm a young adult male living in California, currently attending a community college. I have ASD, and as a result I do not get along with people very well, especially since I was bullied growing up and am naturally confrontational. Anyway I have been sitting around since the age of 11 watching all my male peers get girlfriends, dates, hookups and the like, while I sit here in a flurry of involuntary celibacy. It just gets worse considering female fashion is to wear extremely revealing clothing, and it makes me depressed and in many cases suicidal.

I need a way out of this that still allows me to be alive and function in everyday society. Any more of this torture, and I feel like I will be prompted to choose that final solution. I have considered voluntarily castration, but I have heard that it does nothing unless you get it done before puberty. I have also heard of a largely soy-based diet, but I have also heard that the estrogenic qualities of soy might end up making me more attracted to men. Remember, I want to lose all sexual attraction.

Anyway, if there is a way to achieve this goal I would like to hear it. It doesn't matter what the cost is or the potential difficulties regarding a solution, I just want this torture to stop. Finally, don't try to convince me to partake in prostitution or force myself into a sexual relationship, because it isn't gonna happen. I want relevant conversation here, either give me an idea of how to accomplish my goal or don't say anything at all. ",06Feb2018,1
21,"ok - I am a PhD student in a science field.  I am moderately successful (I get out publications, but I'm nothing special).  Recently, I've started spending my time by myself just creating things, and I'm obsessed. It's all I want to do. I've made music, I write, and I paint.  I'm supposed to finish my PhD in 6 months, but I feel like I want to just tap into my creative side -- I think that is the career I want. My research is very interesting, but I am really over my PhD project.  I've done three projects, but my supervisor wants a fourth and I have no interest in it at all.  It is literally pulling teeth.  Actually, I'd literally rather have teeth pulled than do the work. The rest of my PhD is very interesting to me, but I feel so ready to move on if that makes sense...

I like the idea of the security of a tenured position -- or a research position, or consulting even, etc. (ironic because academia is not really secure), but I feel like I'm being so pulled by my other side right now.  I feel passion towards it.  I don't even care if what I am making sucks, I just feel like it is what I want to do.

Does anyone have works of encouragement to help me finish this PhD and help me apply to post-docs? Has anyone gone into the arts from the sciences with literally ZERO experience? (though, I am get some right now) Just advice/wisdom/experience around this would be appreciated.

It was going great until something came up for her and she couldn’t and apologized. 

I was pretty bummed but I knew it was legit and wasn’t some fake out flake. I asked the next Thursday and she said “yea I’ll see if I can :)”. The next day I asked to hang that night (Friday) and she said she was having friends over. Right then I felt like shit until she said “another day tho :)” that was two weeks ago

The program (major) I'm in at my school is highly regarded and I like it, but it's too much money for a pretty poor out-of-school life. I sometimes feel like people are only here to have fun, many don't take academics seriously and don't actually care about the subject. The only thing holding me back is that this school is well known for the field I'm going into and that my parents are really proud of me getting in here. I feel that if I said I want to transfer they would be disappointed. I don't want to put myself into debt for something I could get at another school where I'm happier (somewhere closer to home with a different social climate). To put it frankly, I'm pretty depressed here and don't think I could handle 3 more years here. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

49,"   Recently, me and and old friend of mine have been texting and talking. This friend used to go to the same school as me, but moved away the same year (2 years ago, this was in seventh grade. I’m in ninth grade now) we were best friends and we’re really close. Recently, I got Instagram and found them on the social media app. We began talking and exchanged phone numbers (they changed their number) We talked about how we wanted our friendship to be how it was back then, in seventh grade. We talked for about a week, texting each other every day. I text them everyday saying “Hey!”, but recently I’ve been getting no response, yet they’re always on Instagram, which lets me know they are talking to others and posting regularly. 
  Am I annoying them? We both talked about wanting to re-kindle our friendship, but it doesn’t seem like they want that, even though they said that before. Should I talk to them about it? Someone please help.",06Feb2018,2

57,"Over a year ago my friend got a pug puppy for herself as a present. She had been planning on owning a dog for a while so I didn't worry. 

Last September however when she visited me, I noticed her puppy looked pretty skinny. She confessed she had only been feeding her dog once a day. I gave her quite the lecture about it and she promised she'd change that. She's honestly kind, just not very smart. 

I didn't worry too much until yesterday. I came over to visit, bringing my own dog along, and I feel like her dogs weight just hasn't changed at all. The puppy still looks skinny. Even worse, I noticed immediately that her dogs eyes look red. When asked about it, she said it was just because they are tired, even though it was still daytime. 

And during the visit I noticed other things as well. She keeps her dog in a cage most of the day. I asked if her dog has playtime often and she showed me the dogs toy. It was a large plastic chew toy, probably meant for a larger dog. Her small puppy didn't even acknowledge it at all when I tried making her play with it. She told me her puppy ""doesn't like to play"" and she doesn't go for walks a lot because she's always ""busy"". 

We took our dogs for a walk and from the start I immediately noticed her dogs harness is too big for a puppy that size. I felt like it was going to come off at any moment. My friend tried to assure me that ""that's the way the harness is and it isn't going to come off"". It almost did so I ended the walk early and we went back to her house. 

When we did get back, She put her puppy back in their cage. I suggested to her to let her roam around her house for a while and play with my dog and she said she keeps her in there because ""she'll pee everywhere"". I felt bad for her puppy. 

I just feel like my friend is not doing anything to even try potty training her puppy, or even giving them proper food. And now that I think about it, I didn't even see a water bowl available for her puppy. 

She's been my friend since Elementary and I don't want to ruin our friendship, but I feel like I need to have a long talk with her about it because I'm worried her puppy might get worse. How should I go about this? At what point should I do the right thing and even call Animal services?",06Feb2018,2
58,"I'm a 23 y/o male living in NYC.

My friend lives in an apartment in Brooklyn that is owned by his family and he's asked me to move in with him. The rent is controlled and would be $550 a month which is madddd cheap for anywhere in NYC. I've been living at home with my mom since graduation, which at times has been a little rough, but for the most part, we get along pretty well. Not to mention I still get all the momma's boy benefits (free laundry, cooking etc). 

I've been considering moving out for some time now because I want that experience of being on my own and I feel like it can help me grow a lot. I feel really comfortable at home and I don't think it's helping become an adult. The thing that is holding me back the most is that I'm not sure it's the best decision financially. I'm lucky enough to have no student loans and to have a steady full-time job. I pretty sure I could afford the move, but I would definitely have to be more conscious about my lifestyle. To give you an idea, after all the deductions and the automatic savings that I have set up I bring home about 1k every two weeks. 

I'm also in school part-time, as I'm trying to get into physician assistant school, but once again I'm lucky enough to have a job that reimburses my tuition for the semester. Currently, I'm in this certificate course and once I complete it I will be eligible for a higher paying position at my hospital which I plan to get.

61,"I've struggled with this problem for about 10 years now. There are so many creative things I say I WANT to do in my life, but I *ALWAYS* doubt myself and convince myself I just don't have the talent and can't do it. I've quit literally everything I've enjoyed doing for this reason. I used to draw avidly and pretty well as a child, and recently got into competitive gaming which I loved to death and was making progress with, but ultimately ended up stopping them both due to my own thoughts of inadequacy and failure, and the pressure I put on myself to do a good job. 

How in the world can I enforce a positive mindset for growth and learning when I constantly think overthink everything in a negative way? 

Now, I know there's a Fixed mindset, which i feel like I have, and a growth mindset, where I would see issues such as these as a challenge to overcome, and where I'm focusing on the aspect of growth through learning. With this, people say you can learn any skill you set your mind to through practice and positive mentality. 

But that's the thing. I am aware of these things yet I just can NOT seem to apply them, no matter how hard I try. I try forcing myself to practice, but i just end up getting distracted and asking myself if I even want to do it or why I'm even trying or getting upset with myself or my work. 

My biggest dreams are to just be able to CREATE anything I'm proud of. I've always been interested in the arts and would love to be able to make creations of my own in the fields of music and drawing that I could enjoy and share with others, even if its on a small scale. But every damn time I try, somewhere along the line when I get stuck, I just give up and feel extremely depressed, thinking i just can't do it. That i have to have a natural talent for it, or I'm just wasting my time.

I know failure is part of the process of improving at anything, because I've been through many failures in my gaming and drawing hobbies before my mindset went downhill.

 But there comes a point in my practice with anything new I pick up where I get so frustrated at myself for not understanding something or making something I think is up to par with my standards that it sends me into a ton of negative thoughts with self doubt included that just block any positive thoughts out.

Can anyone give me any advice to overcome this fixed mentality? Thanks in advance.",06Feb2018,2
62,"This is probably going to be more of a rambling-type post but I just don't know who to ask for help. I'm 22 and currently taking courses at a community college (halfway to an Associate's) and working part-time in a shitty retail job. Obviously as you can see I'm pretty far behind other students my age, I never really had the discipline I should've had from my parents as they weren't super high achievers either. Don't get me wrong I love them to death and they allow me to live at home as long as I want but I feel like it's impossible to break out of this man-child lifestyle. I don't know shit about being an adult. Renting, taxes, mortgages, any of that. For taxes I just throw my info into Turbotax and let them do it all. I only just got my driver's license a couple years ago BUT I still have terrible anxiety when driving and I'm not confident in my ability to drive farther than 5-10 minutes from my house and I won't even think about taking the freeway (even though I passed that portion of the test in terrible weather with a packed freeway when merging on). All of this is affecting my ability to potentially get a higher paying/decently respected job in a bigger city, or even meet people since I have 0 friends in this rural town.

I need advice for pretty much every aspect of my life to be honest. For now though I'm just not sure what to do education-wise. Like I said I'm only halfway to an Associate's and there's so many paths/degrees/programs for me to take it's just overwhelming. Neither of my parents went to college either so they aren't any help in this area. I figured I would just chip away at the Associate's and by the time I get it i'd have a better idea of what I want to do for the Bachelors. I dunno, I just feel like such a loser making minimum wage as a cashier at 22 years old when there are high school graduates working in respected fields within months of graduating. I'm not sure what this post turned into but I just feel so alone in trying to improve my life and I need some sort of guidance. Thanks for reading this wall of text I guess.",06Feb2018,2
63,"Hi,

I have a 19 year old brother who is definitely doing some sketchy stuff and it's making me very anxious about his safety and I need advice on how to proceed.

Some background: He has a history of mental illness. He was diagnosed with ADD and ADHD when he was in 6th grade and after cognitive behavioral therapy we were told that he is basically maturing slower than others, which explained a lot of his immaturity (he generally acts about 5 years younger in my opinion. I'm not sure about the specifics of what the therapist said as I was only about 15 when he went through therapy). He has a history of anxiety and depression, and I once found a suicide note he had written when he was around 12. He had consistently gotten poor grades during high school but somehow managed to get into college for computer science. He failed his first semester and was fired from his on campus job. The college allowed him to retake his classes the second semester, but he also failed out. The college then kicked him out and he enrolled in community college for his second year as a freshman. However, when he failed out of the first college he was thousands of dollars in debt. He started his first semester at community college in September 2017 and also failed out of that. The college demanded that he repay the grants and loans they gave him as it was wasted money in their opinion, which amounted to a few thousand dollars. After this, he decided to end his college education in December 2017. This meant that he must begin paying his student loans off immediately, making his monthly payment about $260/mo. During the summer of 2017 he got a job working at Walmart. He was fired from this job about a week ago. On December 31st, 2017 he was kicked out of our house for threatening and then attempting to break our mother's fingers during a dispute about where he was going (he constantly lies about where he's going). During this time we do not know where he stayed, but we do know that he contacted several family friends asking for help. He was allowed back home and then came back home on January 28th. He asked me to pick him up and bring him back from a local QuickCheck. Since he has started college he has been a compulsive and pathological liar, lying about things that he doesn't need to lie about. He also drives an exorbitant amount of miles every time he goes out. Because of his compulsive lying, my parents track his phone log as well as the odometer on his car. He now knows about the odometer but not about the phone log. He also has very antisocial behavior with his family. When he is home he stays in his room or the basement and does not come out. He rarely talks to us and if he does, it's very short and quiet responses. He constantly does things against everyone's wishes, which are mostly stupid things like chauffeuring his friends around constantly in a car that isn't even his or getting his ears pierced. According to a psychology major friend of mine, he generally displays signs of antisocial personality disorder. However, it is basically impossible to get him to a psychologist as he is almost 20 and does not see anything wrong with himself.  

An example of his lying: On one Tuesday he went out, saying that he was just going down the street to his friends house. My mom had read his odometer prior and read it when he came back. He had driven 125 miles in one day. A few days later on Friday he went out again claiming to go to the same friends house down the street. When he came back 5 hours later than he said he would be back, my mom confronted him and asked him where he was. He claimed he was at his friends house and lost track of time because they were playing an online tournament. My mom then told him that she had checked his odometer and that she knew he drove 125 miles on Tuesday and demanded to know where he was. He admitted that he had driven to a mall about an hour away 3 times that day. Then my mom asked him where he was that same day (Friday) and he admitted that he had driven to the first college he went to (about an hour away). My parents would not have stopped him from doing any of this, if he is to be believed. He had no reason to lie about any of it. 

The current issue we have now is that we've learned some things from his phone call log. My mom only started checking it during the time he was kicked out to keep track of his well being for the most part. My mom has mostly figured out which friends belong to which phone number. However, since the beginning of this month (since he's been back home), he has been making constant, hours long phone calls to a new number. And since December been making frequent very short phone calls to another phone number. Calls to these numbers occur all day, even into the night. When we looked up the first number, it says it belongs to an old gay man, probably in his 70s. We cannot figure out the person who has the second phone number but they live in the Bronx. The weird thing about the phone calls is that they are either very long (25 - 60+ minutes) or one minute, but frequent. Often his call log will say ""9:25 call to ###-###-####, 9:26 call to same #, 9:27 call to same #"". And so on for like 5-10 minutes. Its as if he calls them for a minute and then hangs up and then calls them again and then hangs up. There's no way for us to know if he's just reaching voicemail or not and just keeps trying. He calls these numbers far more than he texts them. He has also made several phone calls to 9-1-1 since November. 

Would anyone have any insight into this kind of behavior? Is it drugs (doing and/or dealing)? What could these calls mean? Is there any way we can figure out who these numbers belong to and who these people are? 

What is mostly concerning my family is the sudden frequent phone calls to a man 50 years older than him. Worst case scenario, we are afraid he's doing some weird stuff for money for this man. We do not know if he is gay (I myself have questioned it growing up), but my family is pretty open and welcoming and not homophobic at all so he would have no reason to not come out to us. But then again, I know it's a significant moment in someone's life so I would not be entirely surprised if he were in the closet. I've also questioned if this is a sugar daddy type thing. It would make sense because he has his loans to pay off as well as a nicotine vape habit to keep up, and he has been jobless since around February 1st and therefore has no income. He has no savings because he is an incredibly reckless spender and spends every penny of his paycheck every time. He's bank account is frequently overdrawn. My mom used to keep track of his bank account but he switched bank accounts a few months ago so she couldn't keep track anymore. He also only carries cash. 

We would confront him directly but he has a tendency to get violent and also mislead conversations. He also starts yelling the minute you say anything to him and makes it impossible to get anything across to him. We are afraid that he will make a drastic decision and will make things worse if we confront him about these calls he's making. 

Sorry this is so long (and for any mistakes), but we don't know what to do anymore. If I left anything out, please feel free to ask. Thanks! ",06Feb2018,3

However, I've been thinking about changing careers which would require me to get another master's degree which I'm not fond of given that I'm still paying for my loans.  

Option one is to do something very different, art therapy. However, I know it doesn't pay much and financial aid would require me to take loans. 

Option two is to study social entrepreneurship but I don't have a business mindset. I get bored with accounting and finance classes. 

Option 3 is to produce creative items like bags and pattern designs. I have zero experience and doubt I can make a living off of it. 

Option 4 is to be a design thinking/strategy coach. Again, no experience but can gain by going back to school.

I have quite a few ideas for what we could do with the business, like building a recording studio, with instruments and equipment, that we charge people to use, but it seems very unstable compared to the tech business right now. I guess I just need some unbiased advice on whether or not this sounds like a good idea for a potential career. Thank you all in advance.",06Feb2018,2

82,"I [22F] have no car no job, and I'm trying to get back on my feet but thing is my dad tells me I'm going to be a loser and have no future because Im not getting my shit straight. The amount of times I have talked to my dad about him name calling me and how it affects the way I think about things is enough. I live under his roof so I have to go by his orders or else I get yelled at and named called. Its pathetic, I'm trying to sell my car that does not work at all, I have no money to take it to a mechanic and he has no money so its just sitting in my driveway decaying. I've told him about it and I was gonna sell it for 300 and its under my name and everything. Then he tells me ""you're not selling that car for 300, I can get that car for 500 at the junk yard"". 

1. It does not start/run. 
2. It has about 200k miles. 
3. The junkyard will not give you 500. Thats ridiculous.
4. My uncle is a ""mechanic"" and basically ruined the inside of my car by trying to find the problem and he left it that way when he left. He didnt put everything back the way it was and 1 year passes by. He never told me he was gonna come back and take a look at it again. (Piece of shit mechanic I'll tell you that) 

If I sell it hes gonna tell off the guy/girl who comes by and checks out the car. He will take over and he will deny that he will not be selling the car for 300. 
I dont know what to do. I want to sell it but I'm scared of selling it eventhough it is under my name. 
So I'm basically stuck between not selling it and selling it. I really am scared of someone coming to my house and him getting pissed off and scaring away the buyer. (If anyone wants to know what kind of car and if its worth it to sell for 300;  it is a bmw 2002 3 series.)

84,"A couple times a month for the last 4 or 5 years, my friend and I would go see a Saturday morning movie and then go to lunch afterwards at one of the local fast food joints to sit and discuss the movie, and then whatever else was ailing us at the time.  The reason I cherished these outings was that I am in a wheelchair and can't drive.  This was really the only opportunity to get out of the house other than going to work every workday.  And work is just not a fun thing. 

I have been going through some tough patches for the last two years with the family and work, and I started referring to these outings as my therapy sessions, and they were really the only way I was able to make it through, and have told him as much on multiple occasions.

So he overhears from a doctor, not his own mind you, that the doctor can't take Lipitor for cholesterol reduction because of allergies, so he has adopted a vegan lifestyle instead.  My friend's doctor prescribes for him the smallest dosage of Lipitor possible, due to a family history of strokes, as a preventative measure...so he figures if he gives up all animal products and processed sugar, he can stop popping the pill and it will be the same thing.  Now he doesn't want to go to anywhere for the lunch because he needs to eat his peanut butter sandwich or bean-something-or-other.
 
I was hoping this would be a passing fad, but it doesn't seem like it is going to be ending anytime soon.  In fact he seems to be doubling down by actively trying to convert others to his diet of choice and is preaching to anyone who will listen about it.  (despite having no evidence that it is having any effect on him yet) While I appreciate his health, and of course want him around for many more years, our last outing just wasn't the same without that lunch and stimulating conversation afterwards, and I felt really bothered by this.  

I have recommended that he really consult with his own physician, the one who has access to his own medical history rather than trusting informal medical advice from someone he had never met before.  I also said we can try other places in the area that have vegetable lunches, even if it costs a little more.  I'd be the one popping for the movie and we'd alternate buying lunch anyway. 

I have been purposely dodging him lately just because I don't want to hear his spiel again about buying 50 pounds of beans at Costco and all the money he saves now not buying meat, cheese, and Coca Cola.  As one who lives on a small family farm, and loves a good meal, inside I just cringe having to hear this.

So I have been diagnosed with clinical depression and I’m currently on meds that I think are starting to work + I’m working with horses and I’m beginning to learn to live again. 

My best friend is the daughter of a pastor. She also lives on a ranch, but she has such a tender heart, every time an animal dies, she cries. Lately she’s been spacing out throughout the day, she wears a frown, and can’t seem to get herself out of her head; all symptoms I’m quite familiar with. 

She talks about how hopeless and worthless life all seems and it breaks my heart more than my depression ever could. 

I’ve been trying to keep her busy, and I’ll tell her jokes to try and cheer her up, but I know I’m just putting a bandaid on the real problem. 

She can’t visit a therapist, her parents don’t like them and insist on praying away problems.

100,"

I know I’m pretty young to be posting here, I’m 16, she’s 16 and it involves high school drama. I developed a crush on her (let’s call her Grace) a few months ago and we started snapping each other. We’ve snapped for a few hours every day for the last few weeks. However, we are part of different cliques at school and she’s very social, so she’s always hanging with her friends. Whenever I want to approach her, she’s with her friends. I’ve only had a few short conversations with her. 

She’s super friendly over snapchat, and she’s left me some pretty obvious hints (i thought) over snap recently. Fast forward to today, she posts something on her snapchat story that said “It’s almost valentine’s day. Who do you ship me with? I want to hear what everyone thinks!”

One friend (I’ll call him Mike) asks me if he can send my name to her. I say yes, not realizing how bad my other friends were. 5 minutes later, Mike says Grace told him 4 of my other friends also said my name. Fuck. A few minutes later, Mike tells me two other friends who have never spoken to Grace ask her if she likes me. I wanted to ask her to the dance in person. Myself. Alone.

To recap, 4 of my friends ship me and my crush without telling me. They don’t know I know. 
2 of my friends straight up ask if she likes me. I NEVER asked them to, DID NOT want them to because I wanted to tell her myself. 

I’m fuming with anger because the valentine’s day dance is friday and I was planning on asking her tomorrow. Mike told me Grace feels like shit because she didn’t realize I liked her, and she told Mike not to tell me.

I worked for a major Fortune 500 corporation for two years as an assistant for a very high up manager. I am a female and my boss was a female. My boss and I never got along from the start. In her own words I “intimidated” her. Throughout the two years she did everything possible to make my life a living hell all while managing to fool everyone else in the office that she was the perfect manager. Eventually my already fragile mental health went drastically downhill.  Being the “great boss” she was she allowed me to take some mental health days off - only to write me up as soon as I got back for “missing too much work”.

To the point - part of my job involved having a company credit card that was shared by the entire department of 15 people. Because of the company culture TONS of non-business items went on this card: alcohol, gift baskets, party supplies, food, cosmetics, bath and body items, Yeti coolers, iPads, watches, etc. 

Right before Christmas 2017 I decided I had enough of the mental anguish. I was mentally ill leading to me constantly being physically ill - I put in my two weeks noticed and she was downright ANGRY. I was terminated immediately. 

Last week I receive a letter in the mail from my boss on behalf of the company’s legal department stating they had found $3,500 worth of unauthorized charges in my company credit card dating back to 2016 and that I had 60 days to pay the full amount or the company would “seek further legal remedies”. 

These items were NOT for personal use, these were the same items I was told to purchase throughout my entire career there.

113,"Ok. I will make this as short as I can. I don’t want any sympathy. I just need advice. Getting professional help isn’t an option right now.

So for almost three years I’ve been in the closet. The first year I was ridiculously depressed and wanted to die. I’m over that though. The second year, I thought I was fine, until I began to remember the sexual abuse my older sibling had caused me when I was young. I wasn’t traumatized by the abuse, but I was terrified of what this meant. Was I supposed to confront him? Was I supposed to tell my family? These worries made me wake up on the verge of a panic attack each day. 

I confronted by brother the day before he went away for two years with little to no contact with his family. I would explain more but I’m trying to keep this as short as possible. He broke down and told me that he did what he did because of abuse he suffered at a camp the year before, and he was acting out his trauma then. I still can’t forgive him, but I at least am a little more open to the idea of maybe forgiving him one day. That sounds crazy I know, but we talked it out. But now he is gone for two years.

Compared to dealing with the aftermath of the abuse, coming out feels like nothing. I’m a maladaptive daydreamer, which means I spend hours daydreaming in unhealthy amounts each day. It is literally an addiction to daydreaming. It is almost impossible to get rid of, because your imagination is always with you 24/7. You can’t just restrict access to it like you can with drugs and alcohol. It’s like being a drug addict constantly living in a room filled with all sorts of drugs. So in these daydreams, I imagine what coming out to my family will be like. In real life I know it won’t go well, although I’m sure they’ll come around eventually because they are extremely loving, just kind of closed minded. I just want to create a reality where my parents will fully love and accept me for who I am, and I never have to hide secrets from them again. 

But this creates another problem. I want to be able to be open with my parents. I don’t want to keep any more secrets from them. But at the same time, I never want to tell them about what my brother did to me. I wasn’t traumatized by what he did, he made it obvious to me that he feels terrible and would never do anything like that again, he was just extremely messed up and confused (although that doesn’t excuse his actions), it would only cause more pain for me and my family, and I would probably be more traumatized by my parents’ reactions than I ever was by what actually happened to me. I can move on from being abused as a child. But seeing my parents faces as they cry from hearing the news of my past abuse? I could never unsee that. It would keep me up at night. So for my own good, and my family’s own good, I don’t want to reveal what happened to me. But at the same time, I feel like I’m still hiding secrets. And I don’t want to hide secrets anymore. It feels like something weighing down on me. But I can’t tell them what happened to me. Advice? I made this as short as I could. There is so much to this story. Tell me to add a tl;dr?

115,"So some backstory. I was your typical smart kid that didn’t put forth enough effort in High School, 34 ACT but a nice 2.1 (after I worked my ass off to raise it) GPA. Struggling with depression and not feeling confident in my own abilities I decided to stay at home after graduation and go to community college while working full time. The stress got to me and I started calling in to work and skipping class as I would have regular mental breakdowns that got compounded by me skipping things as I knew how damaging it was to my future. Fast forward 2.5 years (from the start of college) and I have now completely failed the last three semesters but have not been shirking work, I got a new job after I had to leave that other one because of attendance and I had to regularly take care of my grandmother while my grandfather went through his final year and a half after being diagnosed with cancer. I have had this new job (burrito place not as popular as it once was named after a pepper) for over a year and a half now and haven’t missed a day and regularly pick up extra shifts when needed. I have become the go to guy to call when someone calls in as I have no problem closing one night and then opening the next, or working those great 14 hour double shifts should I be needed. I have finally opened up to family about depression and failure with school, I am seeking help with the former and have stopped the later. Where I need help is that my parents are moving across the country for work and I have decided to stay where I am and will be moving in with a coworker I get along with. While looking for solid secondary jobs, or a primary job to replace my current or move my current down to part time, I found one that I am quite interested in. It’s for a water treatment facility operator, that provides on the job training, good pay, and good hours. The issue is I am just a 21 year old kid who might not be taken seriously as an applicant. As they have an online application process I can’t rely on my strength of face to face communication to prove I am willing to work harder than anyone else if to prove that I am capable of providing for myself and because I want to start taking myself seriously. I don’t currently have a resume and wouldn’t know where to start on that as I’ve really only had retail and foodservice jobs so I’d still just look like a kid applying. I’ve thought about maybe writing a letter to attach instead or to supplement a resume but I also wouldn’t know where to start with that as writing is my biggest weakness. I just need help knowing how to show that I am a viable option enough to get an interview, I’m confident once I get face to face I can show my full worth and let them judge based on that, but I’m worried that I’ll just come off as a kid before I get the chance to prove otherwise.

117,"I'm 22 and currently going to university but I am feeling lost and confused about where I am headed in life. I know what I've always wanted to do since high school but that changed when my dad passed away a couple months ago. I took some time off school. I felt I'd be stuck in bed most days so I went back just to keep myself occupied. However, nowadays my behavior has been erratic. Whenever things get difficult I think of my dad and I'll tell myself to push through and keep going. But other times I get so caught up in missing him that I don't feel motivated to do anything. To the point where my grades drop and I just want to drop everything and go some place new for a fresh start. Some days I feel like I have everything figured out while others I feel like my life will fall apart. And at the same time I feel like I shouldn't complain either because other people have been or are in worse situations than me. I'm just unsure about what I'm doing and if I'm on the right path and it's just making me anxious. How do I stop feeling like this? What can I do in order to have a sense of direction?",06Feb2018,2
119,"So this is where I am. 8 years into a relationship.  I have a 16 yo daughter, she has a 14 son and 15 yo daughter. I have been the father, period, for her kids the last 7ish years (dad is a loser deadbeat). Up until 2 years ago, things were awesome. At that time however, things unfortunately started fizzling sexually. Before that we were all good, but then things just..... changed. Multiple times a week became less, then sporadic, then roughly 4 times a month if we were lucky. Every other facet of the relationship was awesome. Family vacations, everyday life, etc...or so I thought.

I know I am leaving gaps, but fast forward to some small bickering the last few months, but nothing indicative of a relationship ending issue. 

Two weeks ago she floats the idea of an open relationship,  which I am not down for, with one dude specifically ( who she works with, whom I know). This dude is in a failing marriage, so has nothing to lose. I flatly decline and head to sofa city pissed. I put it in the back of my mind as we had a few drinks when this was floated, but  don't forget. 

Over the next week things get weird, she is secretive, taking long bathroom trips etc. And I have an idea what is up. She gets drunk and blurts out that she is going to take a day off work to hang with her friend(cryptically, but I had an idea). We argue, she back tracks, I think she is just talking shit to get a rise out of me. 

We get a couple days past this and her phone is going off like crazy over night, keeping me up. I pick it up and look, which I have never done, and get an eyeful. Lots of love talk, photos of their escapade and enough to make me see red. I was done right there, regardless of the love I still had for her. We argued,  I moved downstairs. The next day she is begging to fix it, like cant live without me tears. I am hesitant. Ultimately, I give in. I love this woman and don't want to break up my family.

Fast forward 5 days.... things WERE getting better, but she is not showing much, if any remorse after begging for me to try to work it out. it appears she is still hanging with this dude at work. She insists it is over,  but I just don't think so, she bought dude lunch today. I am by far the bread winner (85k vs 45k) and I feel she is just trying to keep the status quo for her kids while she still fucks around.

120,"This isn't even remotely as serious as some of the other posts here, but I'm not entirely sure what to do. There's a lot of freelancing advice on the internet, but I feel like I'm in kind of a unique position.

I'm a 14-year-old who dropped out of school 2 months ago (bunch of really personal reasons). Since then I've been focusing on learning through a Udacity AI Nanodegree, whose first term I have just finished. I have previously gotten [a certification in the foundations of Deep Learning](https://gist.github.com/naiveaiguy/41bbff8f1e2410ca6fb05ed0a328699a). This year, I'm one of the 50 winners out of 3555 students who participated in [Google Code-In](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) (proof is on there - scroll down to ""MetaBrainz Foundation"" and ""Eshan Singh"" is under the winners section).

I don't know how to build a good portfolio, and even if I somehow managed to do that, I don't know who would trust me with their projects.

125,"Hello!

First of all, thank you for taking the time to read my post. Also, I'm not a native English speaker, so please forgive me for any mistakes.


I have to say a few things for context:


-I just graduated from high school and I had what I consider a normal high school life. Had a couple of friends and did well in tests.


-I was always well behaved and dressed appropriately (knee length colorful dresses, nothing abmormal in class standards).


-I went through life without much complications and was well liked by my classmates

But somehow something stuck with me and it's making me overly paranoid ever since...


When I was on my last year of high school, we had a new history teacher. She seemed well liked by everyone, including me.


But after the 3rd month of class, she suddenly interrupted what she was teaching, pointed at me and said ""You look so scary. Your eyes are scary. It feels like you want to murder me"". I remember it vividly, word by word. The class seemed confused as well, but nobody said anything, including myself.


Since then she would ordinarily tell me that I look terrifying while also asking what was wrong with me.
People would get confused the first couple of times but throughout the whole year, my class eventually just got used to it.


It eventually got to me and I asked my friends if I indeed looked scary. They said they didn't think so.
Then I started asking myself if I ever mistreated the teacher, but couldn't think of anything. 


But she would say it so genuinely, I just couldn't believe she was just messing with me. She was not the kind of teacher who would interact with the class. She only ever directed her attention towards me.

And I also can't believe she was ""bullying"" me. She wouldn't give me bad grades on purpose and wouldn't do anything bad to me other than calling me scary.


When we had teacher-parents meetings, she would always tell my parents I had good grades and behaved well. Never mentioning anything else.

Even after graduating I am still paranoid about it. I just can't see what's wrong with me...
To me my speech is normal and so is my fashion and appearance. I never even thought of myself as ""scary"".
I also always try to be approachable and never treated anyone badly, as far as I can remember.


My paranoia became so extreme I started to think there might be something paranormal she saw on me or something. Maybe she saw a ghost behind me?


So I would like to know what might be the reason she said that and how I can look less scary.

-What is scary in a person?
-If she was indeed not messing with me, what could it be that startled her so much?
-Is there a way to look less scary?


Please feel free to ask about any details I might have forgotten. I just want to get to the bottom of this.

Thank you!",06Feb2018,2
126,"So today my manager informs me that a couple of my coworkers have told him that I am very negative and spreading negativity in the work place. This could potentially be a serious issue. In my personal opinion i do not feel like im being negative but i can imagine that most negative people feel that their not as-well. I work in sales. And quit frankly its not my preferred occupation if you want me to be honest. Its very stressful. No matter how hard i work my job is always at risk. In this type of job numbers matter and nothing else is relevant. However, I don’t think a better job exists for me in the current stage I am in my life. I’m a college student studying to become a Nurse and this job pays very very well commission based, Health benefits. Cool uniform. Allows me to work part time AND is flexible with school. So i really don’t want to quit or look for anything else because I won’t find it. Sometimes when work can get hard i let off some steam to some coworkers that i feel i can confide in. For example, it has halfway through the month of January and i already had a feeling that my chances of not hitting quota were high. I haven’t hit that quota for 4 months in a row so i told one of my coworkers “ fore-sure im getting a write up this month “. Is that considered spreading negativity?

Before you guys tear me a new one. I am well aware that there are many barriers to entry, and that it is widely understood that your best bet is 'who you know'. I am basically seeking advice on things he might not be doing or doing wrong.

I have been finding great success (not in music) and want the same for everyone especially my friends, so I wanted to help. My buddy has been working hard trying to get interviews and get his foot in the door. His approach is the same every time:
1. Use LinkedIn to find and identify people in the music industry. He looks for people in Nashville, California, and New York.  
2. email them and wait a response.
3. Hope that they get back to him. This often takes months and most times nobody reaches back.
4. If they do get back to him. Most times they say they will forward his resume and he has only gotten 1 interview the past 7 months.

Just looking for any advice helpful advice. Finding a new passion won't help here because that's a cop out and he's already well aware of this. He's an Economics major trying to get into a different field because you only live once and there is no room for 'what ifs' so what he hell he's gunning for it.

131,"Last year I did a nice thing. My friends (a couple who have been dating for about 10 years) were between apartments and were forced to move into her mother's cramped house for a few months. Having just moved into my first house, I had a relatively empty basement and decided to lend them my space instead of renting a storage unit. Her mom's house was super tight, so they basically moved everything in -- including my friend's PC.

Then I did a not so nice thing. One night, I said to myself, ""Like most men, I bet he has a decent porn collection somewhere on his PC."" So I took out his HDD, plugged it into my machine, used some indexing software and found his ""stash"". A decent one at that. What I didn't expect to find was home-porn. And here's my problem... Not only was it sex tapes of my two friends (I know, I'm terrible), but it was also sex tapes and videos of some of my friend's friends. He's clearly been cheating on his girlfriend over the years.

On top of that, and this really freaks me out, he had nudes of his own mom.

So here's the advice part. I feel like I should confront him. He's clearly either not happy in his relationship or just a dick and needs to zip it up. But I can't tell him how I know -- mainly because I was a grade-A creeper to even go looking for his stash. Suggestions? Just live with the knowledge?",06Feb2018,1
132,"It hasn't even been a year since my grandfather passed away and my grandmother suddenly has a boyfriend. My question is if it's okay to not be happy about it. I want my grandma to be happy and if this new guy makes her happy then fine, I'm glad. And I know she isn't trying to replace grandpa and I know their relationship was a bit stale in the end anyway, but I just don't like the situation.

I feel like it's too soon. I feel like I can't accept this new man into our family yet. My parents dog doesn't like him (not a good sign in my opinion). I looked him up on Facebook and he honestly doesn't look like the kind of guy I would leave my child alone with. I don't know what kind of intentions he has toward my grandma. I don't know him at all since I've never met the guy in person and I had to learn all this info from my mother.

Growing up my grandma always said that if grandpa died she wouldn't have another man in her life, she would buy a smaller house, live a quiet life, etc. She was adamant about it, so this new boyfriend news comes as quite a shock.

My husband thinks I'm being rude and that's it's none of my business and that I need to be happy for my grandma and just get over it.

I don't know if I can. I just spent my first Christmas knowing my grandpa isn't around anymore. My sister is also having a hard time with this news also so I know I'm not the only one feeling this way. My parents think it's just really awkward. But I don't know.

133,"I recently moved to an alternative school because of my bad attendance and social anxiety. I am in grade 11 now and when i started high school i decided to go on the one where my middle school class wont be attending. I though starting at a new school would give me a fresh start.

The first few months in grade 9 i made acquaintances but never friends. I'm really quiet and really shy so it boggles me how new students can be really popular and have friends, when lunchtime came i would go to the bathroom and eat my lunch there so nobody can see me that i'm alone and think i'm a loner and i also use different bathrooms in the school so other students won't get suspicious. Grade 10 went on still no friends and it sucks. I don't mind being alone but when the teacher says partner up, get in groups or when my parents or brother invite me with their friends because i don't have any, or my brother wishing that i was popular so that my parents stop nagging to him about me( this is when me and i are in the same school).  it just reminds me how much of a loser i am.

In grade 11 it got worse I started skipping and did not do the work. School counselor noticed my absences and i think he asked my teachers because he said that i'm a quiet person, too quiet. So he suggested me this school with students less than 20. I started recently and i love the independent study. 

I don't know if the paragraphs above would help answer the questions but i think a background of me would help. I have been in this school for a week and i cant make friends and cant relate to anybody. They've done some bad stuff such as crime and drugs and that is what they usually what they talk about. the main topic of their conversation.

 I really miss having somebody as a friend and hanging out and joking. Any advice would be helpful. thank you for reading if you read the whole thing :D.",06Feb2018,2
134,"Hey. It's my second year of college, and I have a 2.4 GPA. My major is biology, and I ""hoped"" to become an endocrinologist. I have diabetes and thought this is the perfect job for me.

However, over the past year I haven't been myself. Depression and anxiety has taken over my life, distancing me from my friends until I eventually lost contact with all of them. This depression and anxiety has had an impact on my performance in college, and now I find it extremely difficult to be motivated.

I know that my current performance will lead to me failing in college, because my classes will only get harder from this point on. I've lost most, if not all of my motivation to pursue a career as an endocrinologist. I don't have the will power to go through all of that schooling. However, the biggest reason for me giving up on that dream is because I believe that I simply am not capable. I look at all of the students in my biology class and how they seem to know what's going on and understand the material. 

Then I look at myself when I can't answer half the questions the professor asks. Sometimes I think I'm an idiot and that I don't belong in that class, much less become a doctor in the future.

I don't have the motivation to even try anymore. All I really want to do is make my old, tired mother and father proud of their son, and prove to them that they didn't go through all the trouble of raising me for nothing. I want them to be happy, and I want them to be proud of me. 

I don't want to end up living in some cardboard box under a bridge somewhere. I want to love myself and be proud of who I'll be in the future, and not have to worry about finding the next meal to eat.

The scary thing is, if I'm losing passion for the only thing that interested me in school (biology), that leaves me with no aspirations whatsoever. I've recently gained an interest for photography, but I'm not sure how far that can take me. I'm also good at writing when I try, but I haven't explored that idea.

I want to make it very clear to you guys that I'm lost, I'm completely lost and I have no idea where I'm headed. I don't know what's waiting for me in the future. I don't know what to do. I want to make my mother and father proud of their only son, and I want to be able to have a nice home and have a nice family in the future.

137,"Apologizing in advance because I’m on mobile, and I’ve never posted to reddit before, so excuse my formatting and whatever else I may do wrong please! 

So lately I’ve been thinking a lot about my one friend, and I’m just not sure if the friendship is right anymore. We met in college and become friendly, then got really close and actually ended up living together at one point. No issues in that, we got along fine while living together. The normal squabbles of “can you clean the bathroom/your dishes in the sink” but nothing major. The issue is for a lot of our friendship I’ve felt like it’s kind of one-sided. By that I mean it feels almost always like it’s her way or the highway. I’ll give some examples for context: 

-one time I needed a pair of dress pants ironed and I didn’t have an iron. I knew someone in her bfs house had one, we were over there all the time so I was friendly with them. Texted one of the housemates, and he said to come on over and I could borrow it. So I went over, he made fun of me for not knowing how to iron pants, and ended up doing it for me. No big deal, mentioned it in passing like “haha Jake ironed my pants because I didn’t know how” (note. Jake is not her bf. Just a guy that lived with him) and she got mad at me. Apparently I was supposed to tell her before going to her bfs (even though he wasn’t even home) and that she was uncomfortable with me being there without her. This even extended to times where I was invited over, and I had to turn them down because she couldn’t go and I wasn’t allowed to be there without her. I thought it was kind of ridiculous, but I thought maybe I just have different boundaries. 

-another time I left my heels after a night out at said bfs (we had all gone back to their house after the party, and I decided to walk home barefoot apparently.) So in the morning I texted her about it. She said she was going over there tn (at least four hours after from when I was texting her.) I was a bit nervous because the guys were known for occasionally throwing girls’ things out after a party if they didn’t know who it belonged to. Since I lived down the street I figured I would just walk over there and get said shoes, instead of waiting hours for her to get them. Didn’t stay or anything, literally got my shoes and left. Apparently this was a very big no no.  Again thought maybe I’m just an oblivious person and I was crossing a line I hadn’t thought of. 

-she acts like if I don’t outright tell her things before I do them that I’m trying to hide them. Like if I hangout with anyone I met through her without telling her beforehand. It’s almost as if they’re “hers.” (Idk how to describe it honestly. It really just is like no matter much I hangout with the person, I met them through her so they’re not really my friend.) 

-she clearly favors other friends in front of me. It’s gotten to the point where I’m anxious about it when her other friends are around and question why I’m even there. Will fully admit that this could simply be due to my social anxiety, but I’ve brought it up to her and it hasn’t really changed. Example- she’s always posting pics with her one friend and calling her her best friend, and even sometimes on nights when I was there, she’ll just post a pic of the two of them. Or every time they hangout she’s all over her snap story, and I can’t remember the last time I was even on hers. 

-she is a very firm believer in only having sex with people you’re in love with. I have absolutely no issue with this, to each their own. But *every* time I sleep with someone I get the “you probably should’ve waited longer” or if I am no longer together with someone and I’m upset i get the “this is why you should probably wait to sleep with people.” Now not that there’s anything wrong with sleeping with people on a whim, like I said to each their own, but I am not the person who sleeps with someone on the first date. These are people i was with for a few months, but every time that’s what she says. It’s gotten to the point where I actually think about not telling her. 

-when she got a new bf she couldn’t get over that I talked to him. (Not as in talked like we were together. But just like I spoke to him like a friend.) I started talking to him more after they were together, because now you’re dating my best friend obviously I want to be closer with you. But I didn’t talk to him more than I talked to anyone else, it was a few Snapchats a day at most. I basically stopped talking to him altogether because she said it bothered her, but I asked her why it did. I told her it makes me feel like she thinks I’m up to doing  something shady or trying to go behind her back in some way, which I’m not. She says she knows I would never do this. Maybe I did talk to him a little too much, I don’t know, but my perspective on it was if you know I only have good intentions why is it bothering you at all? I brought up how with her last bf I knew him for years, but felt like I could never really talk to him, and certainly never felt like he was a friend. She thought it was even weird that I had his phone number. Maybe this is normal, but for me I want my SO to be friends with my friends. I want them to get along. I’m not going to get weirded out if they make plans to go to the library together during midterms. 

-when she was mad about the last bullet point, I finally kind of snapped and said all the things that have been bothering me. They were all small so it was never something I really thought worth bringing up, but finally all of them piled up plus her being mad *again* for something I honestly didn’t think was a big enough deal to be making a thing over, I snapped. I 100% admit I handled that wrong, *however* once I said these things, I felt like instead of trying to resolve them it became “I was mad about this one thing and you just brought all this stuff up” and it was just another thing to be mad at me for. 

-when I went through a break up we talked about me and the breakup for maybe 20 minutes before the convo was deflected. I get it. You don’t want to talk about someone else’s break up. But as a friend, you suck it up. You let me bitch about every tiny aspect for hours if I want to. You don’t start talking about your own problems. Or another time when someone I was with  and I stopped talking (he just ghosted), I was really upset and asked her to have a wine night. She texted me right before I left to go to her house that her friend Alex was coming over too. Didn’t ask me if it was okay, and I honestly wasn’t that close to alex so I didn’t want her there, but how am I supposed to say that? So I didn’t. Would have been fine and not really worth mentioning except that *all night* i just had to listen to Alex talk about her new guy and how great he was. I got maaaaaybe 2 minutes in to be sad about my thing. Didn’t even occur to her to tell Alex to stop talking about it or to apologize to me after for subjecting me to what is probably the last thing you want to hear when you just got ghosted. 

-was talking to someone and we stopped talking, I straight up told her it’s basically because I had a mental breakdown and was super depressed and crying all day one day and i felt as though he wasn’t there for me.  (Whether that’s accurate is neither here nor there.) She obviously asked if i was okay when i said it, but she never checked up on me after at all. 

-there have been a few times where I have just left gatherings we were at upset because she spoke to me very rudely and dismissively when drunk. (Ex. Alex was having a dilemma, told me, we went to tell her and I was walking behind Alex and then standing next to them and she turns to me and goes (rudely) “can I help you?” We were in our apartment, directly in front of my room too) she typically apologizes, but it still bugs me. 

-a girl that was a hometown friend of her now ex recently asked me to hangout. Me and this girl got along really well whenever she would come visit, and I would really like to hangout with her, but I’m actually afraid to tell my friend. I don’t even know how to tell her. I don’t want to tell me she doesn’t want me to go (she’s big on the “I’m not going to tell you that you can’t, but it makes me uncomfortable and if you care about me you shouldn’t even want to do things that make me uncomfortable”)  but I have a really strong feeling she’ll be mad at me if I do go or don’t tell her. I don’t want to have to hide it, and i feel like i would have to, which i know sounds like an abused gf or something, which is what got me really thinking about this whole thing. (Note here that here’s 0 chance I’ll see her ex. He’s in a completely different state.) 

I don’t know if this is all because I’ve been withdrawing from people a little lately, really seeing who reaches out to me or if friendships are one-sided with me putting in all the effort. (In case you’re wondering she has reached out, nothing major though.) And I’m sure i made her sound awful, she’s really not. These are just the bad things/things that bother me so remember through reading this you’re seeing her in the worst lens. She’s not like this all the time, or else I would have cut off ties long ago. I’ve had some people say to me that she’s extra about some things and the friendship seems pretty one-sided, with me going out of my way for her more than she for me. (My ex and someone else i was together with have both said this to me. They saw us interact/our dynamic [like if i would leave the bar and go to her because she was upset] a lot first hand.)  Another aspect to the dilemma is that I really don’t have many friends. I realized after graduating a *lot* of my friends were more of convenience, and are happy to see me, but don’t go out of their way at all to make plans with me. 

If you think I should try to talk to her, give me some ideas on what to say please. I’ve tried to talk to her, but she always just says that it makes her uncomfortable. Idk how to nicely say basically “well it shouldn’t make you uncomfortable, so you need to work on fixing that for yourself instead of trying to control the people around you because it’s kind of irrational” 

Tl;dr - I don’t know if my friend is selfish and a little controlling, or if I’m just obliviously being an asshole

138,"In 2015, I dated a mistake. We had been friends for 2 years before that, and the relationship lasted only 10 months. He had semi abusive behaviour and after it had ended, I had not spoken to him in 3 years. As more time went in, I distanced myself more, but I remained close friends with his sister as we met in the same school we were in. 

After the break up, everything was quiet. Being a 16 year old kid and all, I was over it in a matter of three days. Until I started dating my current boyfriend in 2017. My ex began bragging to his friends about how he found where he works, seeing us in public, is monitoring both of our social media profiles, is trying to find where he lives, and general just shitting on him.  He got a new girlfriend and I was so relieved as I thought it would stop. It didn’t, he became worse and starting bragging like this more frequently and to more people. I got fed up, and blocked him on everything as well as made all my social media private. I told him to get over it, it’s been two years and it’s embarrassing to say shit like that when you have a girlfriend. He goes batshit insane, claims that I’m the one who should get over him. 

I leave it at that. I lock down my social media profiles more and asked my boyfriend to do the same, and then hear that he’s talking shit again. He says I’m crazy that I pointed out his borderline stalking behaviour, and that I’m being melodramatic, and then goes straight back to the bragging. I cut contact with people who were associated with him, and left it at that again. 

Now, months later he uses his sister to get information about me. While he STILL has a girlfriend, when our relationship ended now over THREE YEARS AGO. I recently opened a new business, specifically a clothing store. People were excited for me and congratulating me. When I told my friend/his sister about it after she asked, she leaves me on read. I ‘coincidentally’ get an email in the customer complaint form a day later. The form was filled out with a fake name, fake email, and fake details. From the way it was written, I immediately knew it was him from the way that it wasn’t even a normal customer dispute, it was clearly an attack against me. 

He included incorrect details about my company. The opening line in the second response email was ‘you’re not supposed to tell me I’m wrong’. I never said that, I only corrected the false facts he put in there against my company. I block the email, am in process of blocking his IP address from my website, and blocked his sister from everything and completely cut all contact with her. I was fed up of her telling me everything about him when she knew to detail what he did to me, and I knew she was passing information about me to him because she did the same to me about him. I have no doubt.  

I want to move interstate. I want to change my name, dye my hair, and completely change my identity so I can feel like I finally escaped.  

Am I in the right or wrong for this? Should I unblock her? Am I over exaggerating? I just want him gone forever. I never want to hear about him again. 


TLDR: 
Dated semi abusive person in 2015, broke up 10 months later, he becomes a nutcase when I date someone else and brags about finding his work, address, monitors our social media profiles, etc. claims he’s not stalking and that I’m just being melodramatic. I was friends with his sister for 6 years, and I suspect she provides him information about me. He finds my newly opened business due to his sister providing the information, and contacts me AGAIN through the contact form. Being so fed up of feeling trapped and always being found by him, I blocked his sister and officially cut contact with everyone associated with him. Am I over exaggerating? Did I do the right or wrong thing? ",06Feb2018,1

I smoke weed sometimes without my parents knowing, don't drink but I've done some other questionable stuff.

Now only the problem: I personally believe that shoplifting is immoral and that we can easily afford anything that she would possibly be able to shoplift. She knows it too, but has only picked up the habit recently due to her friends also participating in the practice. I've been thinking about asking my parents to get her transferred to a different school in order to make sure she stays on the right path, but I'm not sure if that would be the best move.

I started playing DnD a few months ago with some people who I now consider my friends. One of the friends and his gf (another friend) seem to have either the strangest relationship I've seen or an unhealthy one. 

He constantly belittles her in front of us while we play, and is pretty demeaning when she is running a game or doing anything. 

Like about a week ago we were all together, and I wish I was lying when he said something that blew my mind. He straight up said ""I wish I wasn't in such a sham of a relationship and felt any sort of affection"" at the table.

I don't know what to do. I want to say something but I don't want to lose what basically is my only thing to do outside of my house besides work. I just want my friends to be friends and stuff.

Im trying to help my friend with this. He is trying to sell vape supplies (Basically at a loss almost) just to build seller reputation.

He is starting off very small, we only have 10 items. He is including free first class shipping on his listing. But when I tried to send 1st class at the post office, they said it was '13.2oz' and made me do priority.

Anyways, I would just like to know, where I can find the cheapest supplies to prepare these packages and print labels (I have a normal inject printer, not sure if I can use this or need a special one). And basically just have the packages ready to be dropped off. Have no experience with this.

I believe ebay has an option to print shipping labels but I am not sure how it works. Should I do it through them?

Also, Do I need a scale? Preferably shipping first class.

Any input is highly appreciated and I am sorry if this is the wrong place to ask. Thanks guys.

My bestfriend and I have appointments to get matching tattoos tomorrow. We scheduled the appointment a week before and I just found out I have to babysit my little sister tomorrow! Would it be appropriate to take her to the shop with us? She’s only four, but she’s very well behaved and quiet + my friend and I would obviously take turns taking care of her while the other is getting their tattoo done. Her behavior isn’t what I’m worried about, she knows when it’s appropriate to be loud and when it’s not. It’s just more of the fact that it doesn’t sound right to me to take a child into that kind of environment..? Should I just wait?

157,"So I've been married for quiet a while now. We had a plan to buy a house then have kids which was going to happen few years back. But buying a house didn't happen despite both of us working and financially being able to do so. My OH had a mental breakdown after we had put an offer on a house. Aparently he wasn't ready for such commitment. And I got scared because if he wasn't ready to buy a house, it made me think if he was really ready to have a child. So, I quickly went on the pills but it backfired, I fell pregnant. Been trying for a year or so and it didn't happen. And the minute I went on the pills to not fall pregnant. I fell pregnant. I thought we were on the same page. We talked about it. He knew once having a child, it will be difficult to buy a house because I wouldn't join workforce until our child goes to school. I have done everything for his mental state. He needed the support of his mother once I had given birth. So we moved rental and went to rent at his mum's house. He used the excuse of her being helpful to me once I given birth. I know his mother and I knew she wouldn't be of any help to me but would make my life a living hell. But because I knew how important it was to him for his mum to see him as a father, I allowed us to live with her. 2 months living with her was an utterly a nightmare. I couldn't even spend time with my newborn. She'll grab my baby off me and let him cry and not give me back to breastfeed. She wasn't happy me breastfeeding and even instigated to my OH that I wasn't producing any milk. I was FORCED by him to pump to prove that I had enough milk to breastfeed. There's too much to tell about my first 2 months at my OH's house. 

Eventually I was done. I had to put myself and child first. So we moved. We have been renting from the time we have been married. I have been pushing during the first few months of being on maternity leave to buy a house because I was still employed. But OH wasn't into it. Eventually he realised the mistake he has done and  nearly 2 years after our child's birth he decided to buy a house. But again, when we decide to buy a house, he ends up with a mental breakdown. He is able to buy a house with his own salary. If we had to buy a house, we will be paying $100 - $150 less per week in mortgage. We are already paying so much in rent. 

Knowing how important it is to buy a house, he had a mental breakdown and decided that he doesn't want to work anymore. Because I couldn't see him in that state, I asked him to ask work if he could go part time. He didn't even want to ask work. I forced him to and eventually he did and was able to get part time. 4 days working and 6 days off. 

Now, my period was a bit late and he had a go at me. Saying having 2 dependant we can't buy a house which is true. But whenever we went house shopping he would always have something negative to say about the house and few days ago had an argument with an agent for asking his details. He could have given a fake name and my email address, but he decided to be a dick and have an argument with the agent.

What's FUCKING wrong with him? I know how important is a person's mental health but with him being like that, deep down, I'm losing it. I've really tried my best to put his mental state first but he doesn't care much about mines. Whenever I ask for help to see our child while I rest a bit, it's a huge no no. He has called in carers leave numerous of times just for him to sleep. And when I'm sick and our LO is sick, he'll not even bother to help despite calling in sick. 3 months ago he was on leave for a month and our LO got sick. So I asked him if he could just comfort our LO if he gets up in the night while I try to catch up on some sleep. His response, ""oh I can't. I want to relax"".

Am I missing out on something? Am I too much burden as a wife and a mother to him?

Basically, each normal subject is classed as 10cp, so 40cp equal a full-time load. For this semester coming up I have enrolled in 50cp. Last semester I did 30cp and was somehow able to pull HD's. I added this extra subject out of 2019's list, and was accepted to commence it a year early. I was feeling on a high from my good marks from last semester when I arranged this, but now I'm not so sure. 

Because, even though I did well (for the first time in a semester), I don't have good time management and I get stressed pretty easily.

I'm really not sure what to do. I assume by taking on 50cp I wont be doing my overall GPA any favors since I know I might half-ass a subject or two. Does this plan sound silly? Should I just be sticking to the subject guide and do a balanced 40cp each semester?",06Feb2018,4

174,"I've been having mixed thoughts about a certain sort of philosophical discussion. A discussion in regards to happiness, and success. Something that may be binary by outcome, but very complex otherwise.

The question I ask here is, How long you should shoot for something before telling yourself you've tried too much?

The obvious answer is, it's up to you. But how can we, as people, trying to live out our quite short life responsibly, possibly know when to move on and confront ourselves with realism? How do we know when realism is trust-worthy, or just pessimism from a lack of motivation or faith?

How can we avoid playing life as a game of chance?

I've been game developing for about 9 years now. And this is something I struggle with on a daily basis. I've not made much success off of it yet, but it's something I work for and dream of every waking moment. Hell, every sleeping moment.

when do I stop chasing that dream of making a life off of it? (I'm stubborn when it comes to something I want to do, so it'll probably be a long time). But I know it's not healthy, or is it?

I know a lot of people who have tried something , repeatedly failed and told themselves ""I just fail at this I'm moving on to something else. I can't do this. I don't have the talent. I don't have the skill. It's not for me. etc."". And arguably if if becomes unhealthy it may be the right choice. But then again I know people who trudged on failure after failure to the point of unhealthiness, shooting for the stars and not giving up without the fight of their life , that finally landed on their dreams and made a life off of it.

So whether you'll fail or succeed based off intuition or previous outcomes isn't always so black and white.

What are your guys' thoughts? How do you determine when you've tried too much? A set time, a numerical amount of failures? Loved ones telling you that you should do so?

I'd love to hear opinions and advice on this.",06Feb2018,5

The past few weeks I have been noticing that my food has been missing. I am not a very confrontational person and I am sick and tired of people not having the basic manners to ask before they take. I am a very laid back guy and would've said yes as long as they replace it when they can. Might sound a bit petty but as a student I am already strapped for money and cant afford to spend much on food (everyone in the house are students too).

176,"I've been dating my bf for 4 years now. Recently, my family moved pretty far off and made me go with em. My bf and I have been long-distance since May now. Anyone else who's been in an ldr will tell you, this is awful. To make matters worse, my life in this new State is awful. My mental health is a wreck, but I won't bore you with the details. My bf and I have been trying to think of ways to get me back up there permanently, but to no avail. I just don't have the money to rent a place in his State, and I won't for quite a while.
But something recently dawned on me: What if we get married? Maybe I could at least stay with him at his parent's place while we look for our own place. (I doubt I could do so otherwise--his mom has a very strict policy of having guests at their place, and despite having been dating her son for 4 years, I'm still just a guest as far as she's concerned). 
Only problem is I don't think he has any interest in marriage. He has no particular desire to move out of his parent's place and not much more money than me (but I don't want to do anything fancy for a wedding, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't either).
Is there any way I can present him with the idea of us getting married without sounding awkward? We've never talked about it, even in jest. Should I even ask him in the first place? Is this a good idea? If any of you have ever been married, how did you present the idea to your partner? (Or did you just not bring it up til someone had a ring).",06Feb2018,11
177,"Hi all, not sure if this is the best place to post this question, would be very grateful for any advice. I currently work an office job in procurement and I absolutely hate it. I have always wanted to work with animals but I had a lot of pressure growing up to be in something that made decent money, like business. Unfortunately I’m just miserable. 

My question is, how can I get into a job working with animals? Ideally I would love to work with rescue animals or be an animal caretaker like at Australia zoo but I know that they need qualifications or a uni degree. Are there any recommendations as to what I should be aiming towards? I am looking into a certificate IV in veterinary nursing - I would love to go back to uni but my HECS debts (student loans) are too high at the moment to do so. 

I am also aware that getting exposure to working with animals is incredibly important so I have signed up to volunteer at animal shelters yet they seem to be full all the time. Would you recommend any other way to get experience?

178,"I (19/F) moved from Adelaide, Australia to Sydney, Australia about 2 months ago and don't think it was the best decision for my mental health. I don't really know how to word what i'm feeling right now but i'm just looking for some unbiased direction I guess. 

I've been very lost and depressed since around age 13 when my dad died. I haven't felt motivated to do anything or that I was going there but simultaneously feel immense amounts of pressure to succeed and get everything done straight away. This usually ends up backfiring because it's all pressure with no motivation or direction. 

Both my siblings have high functioning autism and my mother has bipolar and it's been quite dysfunctional over the past few years to concentrate on things for myself like getting my license, working, studying. I've managed but not very well. 

A big reason I moved was because of the difficulties with my sister but she seems to be a lot better now and i'm worried moving back might mess that up. My number one reason for moving though was that Sydney has more job opportunities than where i'm from in Adelaide and It felt like a fresh start but it's starting to just feel lonely. 

I love it in Sydney, i'm from here and have a lot of extended family here but it doesn't feel right for now, while i'm trying to sort my head out. 

I'm so conflicted if I should move back to Adelaide and focus on my mental health and be with my close friends and Mum or stay here, soldier through and try to build a new life and move forward. I have no idea what I should do.

That doesn't mean I have a particularly horrible life or that I'm in physical pain or anything but I just can't stand the way life is.

I thinking about highly meta things 90% of the time, like what is life, why are we here, why this or that to the point of being unhealthy.

Since I understood what death is when I was young, I'm afraid of dying, to the point of not being able to sleep at night fearing never to wake up. I don't understand why we live, I can't enjoy anything I do and the only thing I do is waiting for days to pass.

I look at people everywhere, either they fake being ok with life, either something is wrong with me but I don't understand the point of everyday life. I feel like during the day I have to pass time and at night I can't sleep.

Obviously I have some side problems in my life, I'm struggling with my identity at a profound level, big anxieties, depersonnalization since I'm 14 and family problems.

I'm supposed to be happy with my life, I'm not ill, I'm not poor, I have a wonderful girlfriend, no one in my family is dead, I have some friends, I'm doing great in my studies but I still can't manage to be happy.

This world is intrinsically bad, people are awful with each other, everyone fake liking each other, war, hunger, illness, discrimination are everywhere.

I can't stand people, I'm highly misanthropic, I'm nihilist, anarchist, way too shy and yet I feel alone. I don't want to have anything to do with people yet I feel alone. I can't even love my girlfriend properly, I fear that I'm staying with her because I'm supposed to. There are so much things that are forced unto me and people in general by society I can't stand it.

I feel like something is awfully wrong in (my?) life and I can't get over it. I'm ok for now but I feel like I won't be able to live like this forever.

Around December before the week of christmas I was given a break until last week from work due to not taking time off last year and my boss being nice to me. In that time a drank alot of jack daniels and well fast food so I gained weight specifically in my stomach area and I got my stomach growing a lil bit. Since then I made two great friends and the moment I come home I instantly jump online with them because we all get home at the same time, which means I dont run after work like usual and wake up at 4am for work so I dont get up early to run in the dark. 

So having that context now, I want to lose weight again mainly due to my stomach and face looking rounder. Is counting calories my best bet that will aid me in losing weight or do I have to bundle it in with running again? a few people told me running help but eating under you calorie intake alone will aid you losing weight and will do the trick.

Before i went to rehab i had a GF who lived with me. We never used a condom and had sex a lot. We are no longer together but we talk from time to time.

So I find out and did research, its treatable, etc. It took a few days before I thought to myself, ""I should really tell ex GF, just in case."" Im super embarrassed about it but I know I have to tell her, right? 

Anyway, a couple days ago I txted her and told her I needed to talk. No response. Every day since friday I have sent her some txt saying how I really needed to talk to her and how important it was. No response. I called her last night, straight to voice mail. Same as with this morning, straight to voice mail. She blocked me out of no where.

-There's no fire
-I can't focus on a task due to it going off so unpredictably 
-I'm concerned my neighbours will put in a noise complaint

I’m 19 and I should be having a social life but it gets to the point where it’s just easier not to go out because it’s so much effort to tell them I’m going out.

They’re okay when it’s my close friends, but when it’s my “party” friends who they don’t like, they really put up a fight. It’s crazy coz they’re not even that bad, they party a regular amount. They legit forced me to come home from a party because they didn’t like the person who was hosting.

So anyway, I’ve been snapchatting this guy recently (who’s in that “party” group lol) while I was away on holiday, and it was very much “we’ll get together when you get back.” And now I’m back and I really wanna go and see him, but it’s like how will that even be possible?!

203,"(TL;DR at the bottom, this one is long) I’m finding that tons of people my age are emotionally damaged. It’s giving me a rather bleak outlook on the world tbh. Perhaps it’s just the way that people my age handle their problems? After all, we all have our issues that we need to sort out, but Jesus what’s the deal with these people?  Forgive me if these thoughts seem out of sequence.

I’ve been lucky enough to have a group of friends that know how to handle problems healthily. Outside of that it seems that a majority of people are just really hurting, and are too emotionally weak to deal with it. (I’m not using weak in a derogatory fashion, it’s just that’s what they are) 

The most common thing is people’s parents being divorced. In some social groups I’m the only one who can say my parents are still married. This situation seems to take its toll on a ton of people my age. The second most common is depression/anxiety. The third is intense passive aggressive behavior. The fourth is physical/sexually abused people. 
If you have these issues there are right and wrong ways to deal with it. Most people seem to choose not dealing with it at all. 

I went on 4 dates with a girl, Lily. She had to smoke weed each time we saw each other because (and this is just inference) she doesn’t like not being high. I know a lot of people like Lily are out there with a dependency.

 I took another girl on a date and she told me she was forced to leave her old high school because someone “really screwed her over”. She was cryptic as hell but she seemed like a real shut in.

My favorite girl, and one that I’m thinking about asking out, has bipolar depression. The reason I like her is because she knows she has an issue and actively tries to work with it. She’s strong, which is a trait that seems so rare to find. She is a diamond in the rough compared to others though. 

The main problem seems to be a lack of action. 
People are content to sit back and let their problems eat them away. I have suffered no childhood trauma, I was sexually harassed once and I got the guy expelled, and I have no mental issues, so perhaps I just don’t get it. 

Is this the reality for anyone else? Are people just like this at my age or is this generational? Will they grow out of it? 
Now onto the more selfish part of this. I’ve been seeing a few different people, but when a majority of your age range is depressed it can be hard. I just got out of a relationship where I was acting as the emotional dumping ground and support beam for another person. Our relationship wasn’t always like that. It started off as two people being there for one another and enjoying each others company but then quickly turned toxic. It seems like so many people want to take advantage of you. So many people just want someone to act as a support pillar for them. They’ll be the scarecrow, And I’ll be the stick that holds them up. They want to use the relationship as a distraction from their problems, as though it were weed or alcohol. It’s not about love or enjoying someone’s company. It’s about propping yourself up. I, however, want something real. Is this an unrealistic standard to have? Am I going to find it? I want to fall in love again but I don’t want to sacrifice my personality to do it. 

TL;DR: everyone my age is depressed. Is this how the world is? Can I expect to find a love that doesn’t want to use our relationship as a means of escape, as if it were weed or alcohol?

The walk in center gave her a urine test that resulted in a positive, they then referred her for a blood test at the local hospital. That blood test came back negative. She visited the gyno yesterday and was told her new test results would be available in 2 days. 

The doctors think she's 6 weeks pregnant, but she has the nexplanon implant in her arm. She was also prescribed the pill because the implant was causing her to bleed for weeks at a time. Apparently she was missing the pill frequently though, which scares me. She was also complaining about her breasts being sore about a week before we broke up, and there was a day or two where she bled lightly.

Has anyone experienced pregnancy symptoms before while being on nexplanon and the pill at the same time, or while stopping the pill?

I got with this girl I had wanted for a long time this just passed January 13th. Things were super peachy. She would always tell me she loves me a lot and I didn’t completely feel the same but I knew I was falling for her so I would just say I love you back. I gave up all other options in women because I really did want to be with just her and not mess it up. 


We would see each other every weekend and a rare weekday. When we had sex I never wore a condom because I always pulled out except for (literally) one time. During sex she’d say shit like cum in me daddy and freak nasty hot shit like that. I really thought one in the barrel couldn’t do any harm. Things were sooo great till we started fighting this one day (Jan 24th) and a few days later we broke up. 


The last time we had sex was possibly the 21st. The way we broke up left a bad taste in my mouth for the simple fact that it was over money, and how I’m unemployed. I figured I’d try to never pay her any mind to try and get over her. I forgot to mention that within these two weeks we haven’t been together she’s with a new guy and apparently he’s supporting her which is super weird to me I didn’t know where to put that in this narrative but that’s another factor in this scenario. 


So just when I thought I had gotten over her she sends me a bunch of texts yesterday morning saying she’s pregnant and doesn’t wanna have it. I’m waking up to all this and immediately FaceTime her and I see her mom holding the positive pregnancy test. And I couldn’t say shit I was totally speechless. Our first reaction was to abort it ASAP. I told her I got shit I can sell to come up with at least half for the pill. I know she has a job so she should have at least something to contribute, but she tells me she has bills to pay and is giving her mom money to fix her car. Honestly I wasn’t tryna hear any of that so I started to tell her that this abortion is more important than her paying for any of that stuff. This conversation was through text and I knew she wasn’t understanding me so I decided to call her again. When we started talking she’s yelling at me while I’m talking to her super (super) calm. Her and her family kept saying I need to “man up” and that I didn’t want to pay for an abortion when it was the first thing I offered so it was getting me hot too but I was trying my hardest to keep a level head. But basically by the end of the phone call all I heard was a loud “FUCK YOU” from her mom and she hung up. 


All day I was lying in bed taking a few naps trying to take everything in. At that time I came to the conclusion that if it’s fuck me then fuck you too. I thought of completely wiping my hands of the situation. Around 12 I get a text saying that she didn’t mean to be so emotional but that she’s scared and that she’s *keeping* the baby (no apology). This is when I proceed to shit myself again. I start trying to tell her how I definitely do not want to have this baby.  I tried to explain that this is an accident but she’d be making a mistake having the baby. But she seems headstrong about having this kid. 

I don’t know if there’s something wrong with me but as mad as I was about how we broke up I still wanted be with this girl I’m just too prideful to tell her I still want her. Something tells me she places too high value on objective things instead of emotional substance. I cared about that girl a lot, I put in all my chips betting on her and she left me with nothing. I’m trying not to bash her but she can be super cold. Now that she’s about to be the mother of my kid I really don’t want someone fucking her especially while she’s pregnant so this new boyfriend of hers is really fucking me up in the head and I have no idea what to say to her. 


A part of me wants to be a total asshole selfish dick and just run for the hills and never come back or just be an absolute deadbeat. A part of me wants to be happy this is happening at all but it’d be easier if we were still together. I know I’m not ready to have this baby. Im literally Seth Rogan in knocked up, stoner, slacker, the whole thing. I know I do not want this baby. 


I just wanna know what do I do? Do I take care of a baby I never wanted and be miserable slaving over a mistake I made when I was 21? What do I tell this girl? She has a doctors appointment this Thursday and I plan on going to support. Do I tell her how I feel about her? Is there something wrong with me for wanting to be with her? Am I blindly a fucking asshole and should stop what I’m doing and kiss her ass? What do I do??? Any comments/advice helps. I’m just super stressed and looking for some wisdom. ",06Feb2018,0

1st occasion, I am friends with this girl from Highschool and tried to keep in contact after, didn’t want anything, just the friendship because she was a trustworthy person whom I enjoyed talking to. She one day didn’t even bother opening the message, it didn’t seem like she didn’t want to talk to me as she also did message me first and whatnot but after that time she stopped. No explanation no nothing.

2nd occasion this girl was a friend of mine and we would often (us and our mutual friends) go out, go to the movies/dinner/coffee etc and at one point she didn’t even open my message, I was trying to get my shit together and I looked up to her because she was in a similar situation and she did get her own shit together and was going to ask her to help me with that. After she didn’t reply, she also didn’t ever invite me and my best friend out like we used to go.

3rd occasion. Met this girl at an event we were volunteering, had a conversation and I knew some pages that would have helped her with the project she was working on as asked her if she knew them. She didn’t  and picked her card (it had her name written onto it) and said I should add her on Facebook to send them to her. 

I sent the links, she replied with “thanks” and I replied “no problem, good luck on the project” she replied “thanks, as you can see we are very busy” and sent me a selfie of her and her friend ready to go out. 

My sister said she was interested in me and I tried to have some short conversations the past few days. Yesterday I asked her if she wanted to have some coffee in the morning before university and she said she didn’t like coffee and she couldn’t because she had lectures early in the morning.

I'm not her best friend by any means, but I guess she hit me up because I was one of her humorous friends and wanted some cheering up.

227,"TLDR- A classmate/casual friend has recently taken up a snarky attitude specifically with me, that's making me feel uncomfortable and confused. I haven't done anything to him but it feels personal.

I have a classmate I will call Jay. We are in our final quarter of college (we do trimesters, not semesters) and have had several courses together over the years. I first met him in a class freshman year where he and I and another girl in the class would always get lunch/coffee together during the break, I gave him rides home, etc. and since then we have had a casual friendship based on having our studies in common.

Currently I am in a class that spans two quarters as we're working on our senior projects. Before the winter break everything was fine. There are 16 people in the class and we have a very relaxed studio dynamic where everyone kind of talks across the room to each other and is generally friendly and open about our lives. 
 
About a week ago I came into the studio as my friend/classmate was saying something and I said ""what? Who?"" just because there were several people in the room and it seemed like everyone was involved in the conversation. 

Before she could even respond, Jay snapped, ""nothing, olivejew0322. Nobody is talking to you."" Ok? I was kind of offended because I clearly wasn't trying to pry, was just curious, so I just left the room without saying anything and chalked it up to Jay being in a bad mood over breaking up with his boyfriend over winter break. 

Well today I biked to class and it was really warm outside. I walked into the studio and everyone who sits in the vicinity of my desk was talking about the weather. I said ""yeah, I'm like sweating it's so warm out there."" I kid you not, Jay basically picked a fight with me about the weather.

Me: (literally seconds after I heard someone else comment on how remarkably nice it is out today) it *is* so warm out- I'm practically sweating
Jay: (looking at me like I'm an idiot) it's really not.. that... hot...
Me: yeah but I just biked here, and in the sun it's pretty warm
Jay: it's under 70 degrees?
Me: well it feels like 70 and that's still pretty warm for morning time in February, I would say...
Jay: well that's like, your opinion.
Me: (leaving the room) yeah, it is??

Once again I wanted to ask him *what is your fucking beef??* but instead chose to leave the room because I could feel myself getting upset. I just want to know why he seems to be singling me out and it's like he's trying to make me feel stupid for joining in conversations. Sometimes he has a dry and sarcastic sense of humor but these instances didn't seem at all lighthearted, really just unnecessarily venomous. 

I also have witnessed him literally going around the room and showing everyone an Instagram post from one of our classmates and quietly making fun of it. And he'll put his hand over his mouth during group discussions and whisper to the girl who sits beside him. It's really uncomfortable and I feel like either nobody else notices or they just choose to ignore his snarky behavior. Due to his attitude towards me lately I'm paranoid of what he's saying to my classmates and friends when I'm not in the room. ",06Feb2018,2
229,"I’m a freshman in high school. My perfectionism/completions brings me two big issues;

First, my grades are my life. I check them about 12 times a day even if I know they didn’t change. I have straight A’s and if I even got a B+ in a class (unless it was like a failed test I could make up) I would be depressed until I got rid of it. I obsess over any issue until it goes away. This is good for small problems like unfinished homework because I get very anxious and finish it all efficiently. Long term problems like being over scheduled for months will just make constantly stressed until it’s over. 

Second, my coimpletionism makes me SO black and white. If I want to lose weight (which I need to), I’m either eating terribly or on a ridiculously strict diet that’s impossible to stick to.If I fall off that diet I’m suddenly eating every unhealthy thing in sight. I’m either spending an entire day cleaning and doing work or I’m doing absolutely nothing but playing video games for hours. I have trouble finding a grey area in my life with a healthy balance. I will get very anxious if things aren’t complete. If I get a long term project I’d sooner (and have many time) find a weekend where I don’t do anything but that project. For example for my bio midterm instead of studying a bit everyday over a few weeks I literally studied for 30 hours in the span of one weekend. I got a 91, so it’s not that this doesn’t work, but I don’t think it’s healthy.

236,"Hello everyone and thanks in advance for reading this post.

Some background: My SO and I used to work at the same place before we were together; once she stopped working there, we started dating. I still work there but she's in between jobs. 

My workplace is now hiring and I know she's very interested in working there again. The position they're hiring for is in the department I work in and I've been tapped to help during the interview process. (Note: She has not applied yet.)

The problem is my workplace has a policy against working in the same department as your spouse and that employees have to disclose their spousal relationship with employees/applicants to management and HR.

So I'm conflicted as to what I should do. On one hand, I believe my SO is very qualified for the job and that they should at least apply/interview for the job. On the other hand, I feel that *though we are dating and not married (""spouses"")*, I have a responsibility to disclose this relationship and possibly recuse myself from the interview process (either altogether or at least for my SO's interview). Lastly, I personally don't think it's a good idea to work with your SO, not out of caution from an inability to separate the personal aspect from the professional relationship while it is ongoing, but because of the possibility that the relationship will end and this would then affect the professional relationship and make things uncomfortable. (Though I feel we're in a good, secure place in our relationship and have no problem working with my SO and maintaining boundaries at work.)

240,"A little background: I moved into my apartment 3.5 years ago, on the 3rd floor of a 3 story building with the landlord on the 1st floor and a family on the 2nd floor. Over the years I have become somewhat friendly with my neighbors on the 2nd floor. They are a couple in their 60s with 3 kids. Let's call them Elizabeth and Thomas. Elizabeth and Thomas's eldest daughter, ""Jamie"" lives around the corner, just one block over with her teenage daughter, ""Lisa"". Lisa is disabled and Deaf and her father abandoned them when she was a baby. From my understanding, Lisa's father is not a good guy. 

Sunday, I was in my room on the 3rd floor of the building with the windows open and heard an argument outside. I live in a city so it's not uncommon for there to be a lot of noise outside so I didn't think anything of it. As the argument continued, I realized it was Jamie yelling with/at her parents, Elizabeth and Thomas and her daughter, Lisa, was with her. I was watching TV and getting ready to watch the Super Bowl so I wasn't paying much attention but I did hear something about calling the police- that she was going to or she didn't want to, I can't really be sure and then I swore I heard my name mentioned. I then tried to listen a little but the argument seemed to die down and I could really hear and  I just figured I was being a little paranoid or whatever as my name isn't exactly uncommon so I went back to what I was doing. 

Then last night I was talking to my landlord on the first floor about an unrelated matter and I mentioned the argument they were having to see if she knew anything about it since I thought that I had heard my name mentioned. My landlord kind of brushed it off like she didn't know what they were talking about but said the she thought that Elizabeth was going to come and talk to me about it. I really sounded to me like she knew more than she was letting on but I let it go. 

Then about a half hour later, Elizabeth calls up to the 3rd floor and asks if she could speak with me so I went down to talk with her. She told me that pretty much since I moved in, Jamie thinks that I know Lisa's father. She thinks that I am acting as a spy for him and feeding him information about Jamie &amp; Lisa and that I had something to do with the break in at their apartment recently. She has thought this on and off since I moved in which I find very strange as we had actually become somewhat friendly with her even inviting me out for her birthday and inviting me to Lisa's birthday as well. I occasionally see them in the neighborhood and I will say hi to both of them, since I know sign language and can also communicate with Lisa. I guess me knowing sign language is part of the reason that she thinks I am spying on them? I'm not really sure. So Elizabeth told me that I should be aware of the situation since her suspicions have escalated lately and that if I run into Jamie in the area (which is highly likely since she lives 1 block away) I should go the other way. She also gave me her cell and house number in case Jamie approaches me and told me to call her. 

I'm honestly just at a total loss as to why she thinks I have anything to do with any of this. I only met them after I moved in to the apartment and have never met Lisa's father in my life. The entire situation makes me a little nervous and I'm just not sure what to do. While I could not hear what was being said in the argument on Sunday, she seemed absolutely manic and I feel somewhat unsafe in my own home. I do not have the financial resources to move at the moment. Is it too extreme to be thinking about an order of protection? Do I even have grounds for an order of protection? Also, I feel like my landlord knew about this and didn't tell me which upsets me as it has to do with my safety in my own home/ neighborhood.  I could use you advice (hence why I am posting here), what do you think I should do?

I looked at insurance got the job and put in my two weeks. After a talk with my manager I noticed insurance was a risky field and I wasn't in a financially secure place to take that kind of risk. So I stayed. Another reason why I stayed is because I was told we could talk about the idea of moving locations which would mean new environment and a pay raise. I agreed and started the process. After 2 weeks the process was both stopped and denied due to the changes that were about to occur. However, the company announced everyone would be getting a minimum pay bump. this meant although I have been here for 3 years and being 3 positions up I am still getting paid the same as someone who is brand spanking new and in the lowest position. This is both annoying/depressing. I stayed at the same location where I have been disliking the path it was headed down due to my transfer being denied and now I make the same as everyone else. Why should I try harder than the others? Why should I do more work and have more responsibilities than the others for the same pay? Yeah I got the pay bump but at what costs? 

Ultimately, I would like advice on if I should look elsewhere or just ride this out until something better comes along. 

I am sorry if this seemed like a rant. In a way I guess I needed to vent some of my work stress that has been piling up. If this seems like a petty issue please tell me! Thank you.",06Feb2018,1

258,"There are a bunch of facts that go into this issue but just to make it simple, it started with me looking through my SO's phone and seeing that he followed a bunch of girls that attend our university with huge tits and sexual photos, along with finding screenshot of these girls on his phone. I confronted him and he told me it meant nothing. 
Then he admitted that he downloaded tinder and a girl messaging him, leading to him feeling guilty and deleting the app. I was hurt, but I forgave him because I believe this was a dumb mistake we were able to move past.
Then recently, a friend of mine told me that he had messaged her friends roommate on tinder 6 months into our relationship. I was heartbroken, I cut off contact with him for 4 days to think about everything. But I felt that we had such a strong relationship that would be wasted if we just ended it. So he let me check his tinder and instagram DMs and I didn't see anything that would lead me to believe this was continuous. He also said he would unfollow the girls on instagram. So I forgave him.
Now, it is about two weeks after this whole ordeal and while he was busy I decided to check his phone, and he had more screenshots of instagram girls and still has not unfollowed the accounts. I also saw that he messaged one of these big breasted girls on Snapchat a month ago.

277,"I am 26 years old, I have a degree in fine art. I initially went to college to study mathematics and physics; after two years I transferred to art school. I regret this decision. I currently work as a graphic designer in the marketing department of an investment bank (I should mention that I find graphic design extremely boring and not fulfilling). I was just offered a full ride to a top their MFA program but I am having a major conflict because, over the past year, I have decided I do not want to be an artist anymore. I have done quite well (I have sold artwork to museums, several A-List celebrities and major private collections) but I do not enjoy it and I would like a more lucrative career in the long term. 

The more I get to know about the banking industry and interact with investment bankers, the more I think about how I would enjoy that as a career and I think it is incredibly mentally stimulating. I should also mention that I LOVE school; going to classes, learning new material, and managing projects that have specific deadlines is something I am good at.  I have a knack for recognizing patterns and sequences in numbers and I ace’d calculus 1 and 2 and statistics in college. 

I would like to go back to school to study something like finance, economics, or business in the hopes of having a career as a financial analyst, an investment banker, a business consultant, or something along those lines. 

Do I need to go back to undergrad and get a four year degree or is it possible to study for the GMAT or the GRE and get into a reputable masters program? If going for a masters is possible, do I need to take prerequisites online or at a community college before I can apply? Can I get into an MBA program with my work experience as a graphic designer at this bank? If I have to go back to undergrad, is the application process different for me since I already have a 4 year degree or do I have to take the ACT or SAT again?

278,"So I am a senior in college studying music education.  Lately I’ve been having a lot of doubts about if teaching music is what I want to do, and this indecisiveness has been affecting my grades and motivation to get work done.  I love music and teaching, but the difficulty and pressure of it all is not something I’m sure I want to deal with at this point.  

So there are a few things I am considering as options. 

1. I could push myself through this semester and a few summer courses (gotta get my school’s language requirement out of the way), and then do my semester and a half of student teaching.  I would then have my bachelors in music education and my teaching license.  

2.  I could drop a few of my classes this semester and make things easier on myself, then I could finish my language requirements this summer, and graduate with a bachelors in music.  I live near a big city, so I could apply for a lot of office/sales jobs, since I have a 4 year degree.  

3. I could do number 2, work for a while, and then go back and be a part time student working towards finishing my music education degree.  My school has an adult undergraduate program that would actually make this quite simple.   

No matter what I do, I’m planning on getting a 2 year degree in computer science after I start working.  I love technology and I feel like it would be a good back up plan, and that it would offer me different, possibly upwards paths if I go the corporate route.

290,"So I started at an entry-level position in my career field over the summer. There's been a lot to learn and so far things have been smooth sailing but I seem to have hit an unexpected snag. 


At my place of employment we prepare data files for our in-house marketing department. Files are requested, pulled and then processed. But only files that have been previously requested are available for process. Most of the time we have requests coming in consistently but it seems like since about November we've been very slow. Only a few parts trickling in at a time so we've had a ton of down time. Literally once we prep files there's nothing to do, we occasionally have some files sent back to be fixed but that happens very rarely. 


I bet you're wondering why I'd be complaining about being paid to not work. Well there are a few factors that make this situation very stressful for me, one of those factors being my boss doesn't like to see what he considers slacking. The second factor being that I sit on a corner cubicle, every one can see what I'm doing and I'm the first person you see when you enter the room. 


My boss has walked past a few times during these down tines and unfortunately to him it appears I'm not working. However he for the most part stays confined to his office and only comes out to grab coffee/lunch or use the restroom, so he's not seeing me when we actually have work to process.


I had hoped my lead who I report to on a daily basis would convene with our manager and let him know when we have down time but I guess that isn't happening. In fact my lead actually encouraged me to just load up a finished file on my screen so it looks like I'm working. Which I have been doing and just randomly repositioning the screen every few hours. 


I thought maybe if I used the downtime to learn more about the software we're using that would be an acceptable use of time;  but that was met with a passive aggressive email about us wasting resources surfing the net.


Honestly I've never had any one think I'm a slacker before I've always tried my hardest to give 200% of my effort. The situation just isn't sitting right with me and I'm not sure how to approach it.",06Feb2018,1
293," I broke up with my ex about 2 weeks ago. He and I started dating Februaury of 2016, but we went on a ""break"" from november 2016-march 2017. We started talking again in March and it led to us hooking up again. We were FWB for about 6 months then became official again. I found out (just after Christmas) he was back in contact with his (3-timing) ex, that he conveniently kept from me for a handful of months. He was happily agreeing to date me and have her attention on the side. Douche. I wasn't about to get involved in the stupid, cyclic love triangle he always creates. So, I said good riddance &amp; best of luck with you ex for the 4th time.

Now I'm lonely. I'm not depressed about it, I just honestly am missing the sex and hooking up (with my ex of course). We had amazing chemistry and the sex was so good, I've never experienced anything like the attraction I had with him.

Anyway, I've used tinder before but it was just for chatting. I met up with maybe 2 guys in the past but it was just for a date each and I lost interest. I can't stop myself from longing for the hookups with my ex, though. Like..(we've been NC for a few weeks) if I knew somehow that he was down to hookup secretley again, I'd do it in a flash.

But I have self respect and won't go back to that selfish, egotistical asshole. Thus, Tinder. 
For those of you who've used it just for hookups, I have a few questions:

1) Is the sex really that good? Is it awkward, considering you barely know the person that well?

2) I may be old fashioned here, but I'm legit worried about STDs n shit, I know that's a risk especially if I don't know how many girls the guys have slept with.

3) I'm worried that I'll just end up comparing them to my ex. But I need to get rid of the sexual attachment I still feel for him, and I've heard that ""the best way to get over someone, is to get under someone else"". Has that worked for anyone?

294,"Im in my 2nd year of university and the results of the first semester dropped in. Out of 250 student, only 6 of them got a GPA of &gt;4. I’m one of them. To my surprise, 4 of the other top6 student are in my group ( for projects and class where you apply what you learned during lectures )

So I thought the university administration did the same thing as my high school : put the best of each class during sophomore year into one class during senior year and get them the best professor. No one really talked about it although we knew what was happening. 

But well it’s quite the contrary here, we got the least good professors. I’m not going to say that they are bad, but I’d rather have a well experienced professor with rigorous methodo my rather than some foreign doctorate who doesn’t give a shit and just read the corrected exercises.

What makes me more uneasy about this is that there’s a group of student, like 70% of them failed the first semester, but they get like the best teachers, those who do lecture and care about their students.

It may just be bad luck, which is why I don’t want to talk about it anywhere else than anonymously on the internet.

I know some people just struggle but really want to learn. But well knowing those people in the group I’m talking about they’re not that kind of person.

In my country, university is often associated as a last resort education, because it’s free and there are no selection, although past the 2 first year it’s false. They want to improve their image and yet they « sabotage » their best student and give opportunities to people who don’t care.

Im not saying educational success is tied to your professors, but it’s still a big difference when you get experienced teachers. If they did not make a difference, why do taxpayer have to fund their livings and why don’t we just look st online course and take exams on a computer right?

We are planning to move to Seattle in 6 months and are having worries about saving money for the move. Fiance (!) and I are trying hard but have lots of ongoing expenses. He thinks it’d be a good idea to get married before Seattle and use the wedding to help fund the move. We can celebrate with our friends, and have them help us move through wedding gifts (a gofundme would be set up.)
Problem is....my parents live overseas and come to the states once a year on furlough. There’s no way they’d be able to come to the wedding, as they have already visited and are now about 10 months out from the next furlough. Also, none of my extended family live in Denver, but a lot of them live in the NW.
Can I have a Denver friend wedding, and then next year, once we are in Seattle, have a family wedding?

I grabbed my flashlight(since it was still dark out) and took him downhill to the court in the cul de sac where I live first before returning uphill to venture towards the next neighborhood. As I was walking parallel to the road behind some trees and bushes, I saw an old red honda civic(early 90s) with aftermarket trim and bumper very slowly coming down a road to my left. The downhill road he was taking runs perpendicular to the road I was walking. When it meets the road it ends and the driver can go either left(into the woods where my street ends, or right downhill to the cul de sac where my house is.

As the driver coasted down the hill I noticed him stop in front of the driveway of a house for about 20 seconds, then move on. I continued to walk up the hill as he made a left to take my street into the more densely forestish part of the neighborhood. 

A few minutes later my dog finally decided to do his business behind a bush. As he began to squat, the red sedan returned up the road from the woods and began to slowly coast down the hill towards my cul de sac. Once again, the car stopped at every driveway for about 20 seconds or so, then moved on. After pausing at the 3rd driveway down the hill, I noticed he wasn't stopping in front of the mailboxes(where the house numbers are) but in front of the driveways peering to the house or cars. One of the houses(where there is not a clear visual to the house or cars, the red sedan went up the driveway just barely until it was within line of sight, then backed out. 

While the car was coming up to the last driveway, my dog and I had walked down to where my house was(on the slope of the hill leading towards the circle about 150 yards away, just next to the road). After the car finished his 20 second stop, he began to drive up the hill. In this moment, I believe he took notice of my dog and I because he only drove up the hill for a few seconds before he threw on his high beams. 

The car then accelerated up the hill and slowed to a stop until the driver's side window was about 6 ft away from me. I could not see inside the car due to the heavy tint. The driver's side and front right passenger door each opened about an inch whenl my dog snarled and then began to go apeshit. When he first lunged at the car the doors shut immediately. As I used what felt like my full body weight holding my dog back, the car peeled away up the hill. 

Context: The neighborhood has experienced a couple of break-ins in the past few years. They always occur in the pre-dawn hour, and the criminals in question check door handles for open cars and break a window if they see something of value. Both times they have hit, they have hit multiple houses in the neighborhood in the same morning, one after another. 

It is not unusual for us to have younger teens or adults stroll in the late hours of the night to smoke, but that usually occurs before 2am, leaving a very noticeable smell if you happen to be outside. There was no scent of weed. 

GPS is pretty good about taking you to the right house. My friends have used waze, google maps, etc. and have never been lost getting to my house. I tried using waze and google maps at work to see how the directions are going to my neighbors and they are almost pinpoint accurate. So it is highly unlikely this person was lost.

My dog has not ONCE done what he did this morning. He has never snarled at anyone in the 8 years I've had him let alone lunged at anyone like that. 

My dog has woken me up between 3am-6am. Most of the time it is around 4am. I have never once seen a car enter the neighborhood at that hour when I am out there. If the dog wakes me closer to 5:30, I will see at least one car per house hold leaving for work(I assume, but never earlier than 5). 




My fiancee does not think I have enough information to make a printout of a warning to put in mailboxes. She thinks if I feel strongly enough about it to go door to door and caution, but she does not think I have enough to go on. I, myself, am not sure I have enough of a case to even bother my neighbors about it and possibly spread undue worry. At the same time, if something were to happen again and I had some knowledge, I do not know if I could forgive myself for letting it go. Any advice would be helpful.

311,"In September of 2017 I purchased a Dell XPS 13 inch 2-in-1 laptop.  Great laptop, very portable, I love this computer.  Flash forward to November, I'm on the floor of my friend's room working on a project and the laptop is on the floor (first mistake).  My friend leans too far back in her chair and falls on my laptop. Surprisingly, my laptop is fine and everything works. The only injury sustained is that the hinges are unaligned and therefore when the laptop shuts the top and bottom are askew. I decided to wait a month to get this fixed and finish my projects/finals.  I returned home and went to the nearest Best Buy/Geek Squad because, at the time, it seemed like a no-brainer.  They ship it off with no problems, and it comes back in two weeks.  I pick it up the evening it returned and by the time I get home (not even 30 minutes with the laptop) I notice the trackpad is bulging out of its casing. I return the next morning and explain the situation.  They ship it off and it returned two weeks later, seemingly fixed. Fast forward to now, about two to three weeks later, the bottom of my laptop is bulging out.  I can see through the split in the casing in the back and into the laptop itself.  In the three(ish) weeks I've had my laptop with me I have treated it very well.  I haven't left it on the floor, it's either in my backpack in a case or on my desk.  Essentially, it seems that GeekSquad has haphazardly repaired my laptop.  On the outside, it appears to be fixed but give it a week or two and it falls apart.  I don't want to send my laptop back to be fixed by this company but in the same sense, I don't want to be left with a new laptop that falls apart due to poor attention to detail from a previous repair.  My question is what should I do? I want to return to GeekSquad and make it clear they've royally F***** my laptop, and honestly, at this point, it should be replaced. Should I avoid a headache and go to a better/smaller PC repair shop? 


TLDR; I went to GeekSquad to repair the hinges on my laptop, and it was returned to me with a broken/bulging trackpad.  Sent it back again, and not even two-three weeks later the bottom casing is now splitting, and I can see into the laptop.  Do I return to GeekSquad and make them aware of the situation? Is it even possible to have the laptop replaced at this point? Should I just avoid a potential headache and go to a smaller, less commercialized PC repair company? ",06Feb2018,1
312,"So I had been seeing this guy for the last few months. He was my roommate, so I know my mistake already, but that’s beside the point. Things were great for a while, but I started to be more reclusive (due to depression/feeling like a stranger in my own home since I live with other roommates and I’m a little antisocial). Last night, during one of those hour long depressive episodes, I told him I thought it was best that we stopped seeing each other because of my mental health, and he said he understood. Also, that night he was planning on going to a bar with a girl who is over at my house a lot, so this was a pre-planned thing that he had told me about. This morning, I woke up and saw her car was still here, so I texted him saying I felt disregard for my feelings in this situation (knowing he slept with her last night, it was obvious) and he acted like it was no big deal. Both him and her weren’t very apologetic, and I feel even more shitty about myself because no one has been supportive towards me. I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’m going crazy and no one understands how I feel about this. Both of them have been avoiding me.

320,"I don't want to get into the mental health challenges I've been experiencing because it will make this post extremely long (if anyone is curious they can check my post history). I'm just feeling so down right now. It's like the part of my brain equipped to take action in seeking help short circuits any time I try to access it. It's like there's some sort of malfunction. I know I should probably see a psychologist, but the paranoia I deal with can get so intense at times I'm unable to do so. When combined with the horrible guilt complex I've developed, and how I continuously flip flop between thinking there's something seriously wrong and thinking there's nothing wrong at all (I can say I honestly believe both, fully), it makes it impossible. 

I realized today that my whole life has turned into a lie. I don't trust anyone, not even my own family members. I have no close friends and never have, really. Never dated and can't even wrap my mind around what that would look like either, it honestly feels absurd. No one knows some of the most basic things about me. I feel like I've become so comfortable living two separate lives, I can't even imagine things being any other way. I'm only 21, and because I know the brain stops maturing around age 25 and loses much of its plasticity, I'm terrified if things aren't turned around soon then the me that's here now is going to be the me that's here to stay, forever. And the fact that I've basically single handedly destroyed my own life by living inside my own head when there's a fairly decent chance my problems are so much smaller than I realize, just some young adult angst mixed with some moderate anxiety and depression, kills me. I can't help but feel like all the people around me have dealt with the things I've dealt with, and the *only* difference is that they've been strong enough to deal with it, strong enough to take control of their own mind and push these sort of thoughts away. I feel like things have snowballed so much and it's completely my fault. 

I don't have anyone I can talk to about this. I'm completely and utterly alone, ultimately by choice, but I made that choice because I honestly felt like I had no other option. I live at home but feel extremely threatened being there because of how volatile and dysfunctional my family is. I think my sister has BPD, she's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and her Mr. Hyde side is a real fucking monster. My parents love me and are kind to me, but they weren't equipped to handle any of this, and in their attempts to appease both of us they essentially ended up manipulating me, stabbing me in the back, betraying me, scapegoating me, throwing me under the bus, and essentially invalidating my pain for years because ""you know your sister can't be confronted because she's too explosive, it'll destroy her, she won't be able to process it, etc."" - all of this, to keep the house from turning into a minefield. I feel like I'm living in an episode of the twilight zone where concepts like fairness, justice, trust, and security don't exist. I feel fairly confident that many of my trust issues and other mental health related issues stem from this. The situation has gotten so out of hand I think about suicide regularly.

322,"Hi, thank you for reading this. I take any advice, I'm in serious trouble now.
Long story short, I move to the capital of my city after graduating from high school, from the poorest city in my country, they are 150 miles apart, also its in europe. I started to study Computer Engineering, but since I didn't do well in Maths and Physics in HS, I was suffering, but managed to complete the first semester decently, but I burned out so hard, that when I met a girl after the exams I eventually just kept spending time with her for the next semester, barely doing anything at university, met a whole bunch of cool people, I first felt like a normal human being that has proper social connections etc. I broke up with that girl, went back to the uni, still struggled. Fast forward 3 years, I'm in the most perfect, honest and loving relationship a human could possibly ask for, we are living together, dropped out of Computer Engineering and doing menial startup work, web development to be exact, which I hate. I was so happy and thankful being with her, that I wasn't really paying attention to anything, we were the perfect match from day 0 which I couldn't believe to be possible ever, and she is also gorgeous and loving and the best person I know. We loved each other so much that we decided that I should move back to my city so I can stay with my parents to complete my degree, and not having to work to pay rent (because they eventually cut supporting me for not attending university and the rent has gone up by 300% in 4 years in the city, thanks to airbnb and the general housing crisis all over europe) and she stayed with her parents too in the capital. I'm all alone here, everyone moved away from here, I only have 2 old hs friends, but I'm not getting along with them since I changed so much and had the time of my life living away, meeting seriously interesting people, journalists, politicians, artists and I'm infected with the cultural vibe of that city, and I was a part of a large social net. You have nothing of that here, it is as dull as it gets. Think about Pripyat to get the idea. I actually enjoyed studying again, and I managed to pass all my midterms, but then my girlfriend broke up with me because I was in fact ignoring her because of the courseload, I didn't even call her for a week one time. She said that she just stopped loving me because of that and became disenchanted, but I was in a bubble of stress to pass my exams and learn everything. Now I'm here alone without my friends, I fucked up most of my exams, because I've been crying for 4 weeks and she said her decision is final, but I know she still loves me deep down, but I also know I lost her for good. I've never been in such a low point in my life. I have nothing here, I'd have to spend another 3 years here all alone, she was my safety-net, the bridge between my new and my old life making it bearable. It's completely impossible to feel at home here, since I never felt like that in 19 years I spent here, this is the worst city in the country, and has a reputation for it. On the other hand If I'd move back to the capital, I'd have to work during bsc which is nearly impossible, and I'd live miserably for another 3-4 years, but I'd have my friends at least. I'd have to bring in as much money as a fresh graduate to even have my own room again.

329,"My brother and I were best friends our whole lives, but about 4-5 years ago, he started to change. Here are a few examples:

In 2014, I made a commitment to paying off all my personal debt. I made a plan, put the plan in writing, committed 100% to the plan, worked like crazy and 1 year after beginning, I paid off all credit cards, student loans, and automobile payments. When I told him, he wasn't happy at all. He stayed silent and you could tell he was visibly not happy for me at all.

When I got engaged in 2015, my brother kept talking about the size of my wife's ring and that I got screwed on the price and how he got a much better deal on my wife's ring than I did.

-My brother and I used to work at the same company, in the same job, and earn the same salary. He was not happy working there any longer and decided to take a small pay cut and relocate to a new city for a job that he thought would make him happier. I also left that same job, but I made a plan to better my career and my personal development. Since leaving that job 2 years ago, I have more than tripled my income. My brother is furious about this. He asks me how much I make, but when I tell him, he says that my pay is complete bs and that I don't deserve it and that I'm ""lucky"", yet he doesn't acknowledge any of the hard work I put it in to accomplish this. Also, I have NEVER bragged about any of this, but topics such as salary have always been open in my family, so that is how he knows. I am a project manager at my job. My brother knows this, and continuously says that project managers are idiots and know nothing and worthless to a company. He loves to throw in these comments during normal conversation.

I should also mention that my parents are caught in the middle of all of this. At my mom's Bday party in November, he was there and things got heated and turned into a screaming match and the night was ruined. To make matters even worse, both our wives are pregnant and are expecting. We spent the holidays together and neither of us spoke to each other.

I live with my girlfriend and her family and have been for almost two years. 

A little background: Both of us are young this has been my longest relationship (2 years) and I don’t regret any of it ups and downs. Lately (past 3 months) we have been arguing over small and big things. We throw words back and forth and always make up and apologize. (This is nice but I don’t like arguing and not finding a solution to what is really bothering us.) 

She works full time and I am currently out of work. Not happy about not working. Did landscaping for about 5 or 6 years but under the table. So right now its just her income. Im struggling to find a job. Ill admit I am picky I refuse to work fast food. Would rather work with my hands or do something physical. But don’t really have any professional skills. Ive been looking around and am slowly losing hope. 

We both deal with depression, adhd and anxiety and help each-other out as well as seeing counselors. But we have both been mentally exhausted lately due to one of her siblings and he (24) has ocd, and is bipolar. It seems like he hates his life because he’s always doing the same shit (working,reads dumb shit and feels the need to share with everyone, eats fast food, smoke, repeat) so he feels the need to bring people down when people call him out for the things he does(Accusing people of doing crazy things that he probably did himself, says negative/hurtful things. Doesn’t affect me but affects my girlfriend, throws our wet clothes on the ground. Crazy, disrespectful, possible psychopath)

My girlfriend came in this morning and woke me up crying and told me why and said she wants to leave. I remembered she was sad but I forgot all the facts. Until she was on her lunch and called me then I was caught up. Then I handled it and talked to her unreasonable brother with no expectations holding nothing back. Told him what he did was fucked up he tells me to not talk to him and I tell him to shut the fuck up and he listens and I say what I felt I needed to say and leave.

We want to find our own place we have pets which is hard. We have been thinking about moving in with our friends who are also looking for a place and they also have pets but would help with income. What should I do? Any input would be greatly appreciated. As well as and questions Id be glad to answer them. Thanks

337,"Hi,
So I live in a share house with 3 other people, we get on well and generally have no issues with one another which is great. However, a little while back one of my housemates told me that she had been seeing some fleas in her room (back story I have 2 cats). I got slack and the cats had caught fleas however once I realised this I did everything one is supposed to do when dealing with fleas, I deflead the cats, bathed them and kept them outside, I cleaned, vacuumed and bug bombed the rooms and even bought a new vacum at her request. Anyway so my issue is this, while I appreciate that having fleas in your room is not great and I felt terrible and apologised over and over, previous to this she was willingly letting the cats into her room, even sleeping in her bed. 
When she told me she had seen fleas in her room, I went out the next day and bought bug bombs, helped her wash her sheets, clothes and vacum her room etc..all was fine for a bit until she told me she had seen more fleas, so I went out and spent more money on flea bombs so her room has now been done twice, which I was told at the pet shop should be more than sufficient to get rid of any fleas?
So about a month passed and she has now told me she has seen another flea in her room (singular), the thing is the cats were in all the other rooms of the house and me, nor any of my housemates have ever seen any which I find strange. I should probably add that my housemate has extremely high anxiety so I'm now wondering are the fleas actually still there? Or is her anxiety playing a big part? I guess the thing that annoys the hell out of me about this situation is that she was willingly letting the cats into her room (she's also had a dog in there  several times). I take full responsibility for my cats having fleas, but I feel because she let them come into her room part of the responsibility should be on her? I feel I've done everything I can to remedy the situation and it's creating tension between us which is never a fun living situation..any advice greatly appreciated ",06Feb2018,1
339,"Hello all! I am a 24 year old Hotel Front Desk Agent living in Los Angeles with my parents. I have a degree from a top public university, and student loans to prove it. 
I have a cousin who is currently in Germany as an Au Pair, which means she is being a full-time Nanny for two children. She is living in their home, doesn't have to pay rent or for food, and gets paid around $250 euros a month as a stipend. 

She is 19 years old, and is going to start University in Germany this year. She offered me the opportunity to replace her as the family's au pair later this year, and I have been considering it. 

It is a one year commitment, and she has spoken to me about the workload, which does not seem bad at all.

Although I do yearn to travel while I am still young, I don't know if this is the right thing to do. I have been saying I want to go do a Graduate Program since I've graduated from college, but I have not done much to apply to a program.

I currently hate my job and would love to do anything else, but I don't really know any German, and I don't know if doing this year abroad will be financially smart. I will be 25 when I leave and 26 when I come back and I don't know if this will help my resume in the future. 

My cousin is younger than I am and is actually going to go to University in Germany, so she took this year to master the language while she was working.

I was hoping I can get some advice. I would love to travel and have a shot at living somewhere else while I am not tied down, but I really don't want it to be a huge financial waste, as the stipend amount isn't very much. 

The family seems wonderful, and the city they live in is small and very beautiful so I doubt I would be bored.

I need to make a decision ASAP, since the family does need to start looking for a replacement since my cousin is going to move on soon.

341,"Hello everyone! So let me cut to the chase. I have this really close guy friend and his birthday is tomorrow. However, he has a really protective girlfriend. Like the type of girlfriend that doesn't allow him to have any girl -- friends. But at the end of the day I don't want to miss out by saying happy birthday just because of her. But I also don't want to create any beef with them, especially on his birthday. Should I text him happy birthday tomorrow?.. or what do you think I should do?

343,"So this has been going down over the past few days and I’m not to sure how to deal with it, feeling very conflicted.

2 of my “friends” have made a couple jokes making fun of my anxiety and anxiety of a friend of mine they fell out with. I said a few weeks ago that I’m not ok with it to one of them and he called me pathetic and hypocritical because I joke about other stuff, for example we all make jokes about how one of our friends cant smell, which I had previously made clear that if they were not ok with I would stop and they seemed fine with it.

I tried a few weeks ago telling one of the 2 that my anxiety had been pretty bad recently and I was quite stressed, and he changed the conversation to saying how I need to work on being less insensitive and rude

More jokes were made yesterday and I just kind of sat in silence next to them for most of the lesson afterwards. once the lesson was over they walked off when I was still packing up and lied to my other friends about where I was and they all went out without me for lunch.

I message him at the end of the day that i’m still not ok with the jokes and he tells me to grow up. I reply fuck off and didn’t speak to him again. Today he says he wants to talk to me to “get this sorted” I agree expecting some form of apology but he just doubles down saying how “I’m an adult” so I shouldn’t get mad. 

I don’t know how I feel really. I want to cut them out of my life but I still have to see them almost daily and my other friends are still going to be spending time with them. I’ve been friends with them for a year and a half now and have spent a lot of good times with them yet at the same time they just don’t seem to give two shits about my feelings. ",06Feb2018,1

345,Should an atheist tell his friend his opinion on religion? Or is it something that you should discover by yourself? Maybe my friend is one of those people who cannot live without religion and it would crush them (but then again I don't know). I don't want to regret anything.,06Feb2018,1
348,"For a while now, 3-4 months at least, I haven't really been able to handle eating food or even putting most liquids on my stomach. I've lost roughly 50 pounds and am down to 120lbs (6' tall male) dressed in heavy winter gear.

Most things seem way too sweet or bitter and make me sick after a few bites. Cold and spicy food/drinks burn the entire inside of my stomach and have me in tears on the floor or vomiting. I have found a few things that I can eat or drink, but I can only take a few bites before I get sick. I'm not getting proper nutrition nor am I getting enough calories.

My blood pressure is extremely low, I black out or come very near it if I simply stand up, in constantly fatigued, dizzy, can't focus, etc. I can't even handle performing my job anymore. I work in Housekeeping and I can't even take blankets off of a dirty bed without having to take a breather.

Please help. I don't have access to a doctor. I don't know how to fix this, but I know it can't continue.",06Feb2018,3

350,"Hello! New to this subreddit, but needs some serious advice.

Long story long, I'm a recent graduate and have been unemployed for the past month and half, looking for almost any job that'll look my way. I got a job interview with an after school program that's 20 hours a week and the pay is only okay. 

While the school was running my background check, my university called and asked for an interview, but for next Monday. That same day that my uni called, the school sent an email saying my background was good and they would love to hire.

Where advice is needed: I don't know how to respond to the school. The only reason I even considered them was because I was desperate for any job, but I don't want to burn my bridges since getting an interview at my uni isn't a guarantee for a job.

Is there any way that I can tell the school job that I have another offer to explore, but if that fails, then Ill climb on aboard with them?

Thanks!",06Feb2018,1
351,"I mean I genuinely feel empty, not to the point of killing myself though.

I want to get back in education or maybe even get a job but I don't what type of thing I want to do. Any sort of help with appreciated, feel like I'm losing my mind",06Feb2018,1
354,"So, earlier today my pet dog was run over, I’m very obviously distraught and I don’t know what to do. 

The van that ran him over sped off before we could get the plates but we have the business the driver worked for. 

What is the best course of action for us as a family right now? Should we contact the police and leave it as that or also contact the Business?

Thank you so much for any advice you can give. ",06Feb2018,1
