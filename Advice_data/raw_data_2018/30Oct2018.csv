0,"For context: We are having a lot of trouble explaining to my little sister the importance of taking care of your possessions and being grateful. In the past she was pretty spoiled, she's gone through multiple iPhones and iPads, but now my mom has put her foot down. My sister still asks for things constantly though and doesn't seem to understand that even $10 can be a lot, especially for something she won't take care of. My family isn't rich or anything, I know my mom struggles sometimes, but there's always food and necessities in the house, which I think adds to my sisters view of 'you can just buy whatever you want.'
There's not really a possibility of an allowance because of the family's situation and they don't live in the best area so things like shoveling the neighbors driveway are also out of the question. Any ideas anyone? It would be greatly appreciated. ",30Oct2018,1
1,"I’m so annoyed at my husband. I was getting really annoyed with him hounding my 3 year to go sit on the potty (he has to poop). My son now is retaining his poop and is becoming constipated. It’s frustrating and scary!! Anyways I was getting annoyed at my husband for being annoyed. He clearly picked up on it and asked why are you mad? Which is fine but I was too mad to talk about it without calming down. And he kept asking and I kept saying stop please stop I don’t want to talk.  He kept asking and then I blew up. In front of my son. I feel like I tried to tell him to stop and he wouldn’t. It’s like he got the reaction that he wanted. He wanted me to blow up. Then he’s like your crazy. Ugh, I just don’t know what to do. He won’t ever just let me be. Help!! ",30Oct2018,1
2,I'm a 12 grader who doesn't want to continue high school. The reason I don't to continue high school is because I've heard that I can't fail a grade so meaning I would fail high school because I'm missing like 11 credits or 12 and even if I passed all my classes for the 12th year I would be missing 4 or 5 credits and they're just gonna fail me anyways. I'm in Florida and from what I heard from my teachers before is that you can't fail a grade. What I want to do is fail a grade so I can actually catch up correctly but I don't know if I can. ,30Oct2018,1

I now have a new account, that is a copy and remake of my first new account after my youtube, because that was probably when I was happiest in middle school. Seventh grade was awesome. despite being worried over liking a certain body type on girl, because I find chubby girls sometimes attractive, back on point, Seventh grade was amazing even with, being hormonal, along with the paranoia, it was awesome. Anyway, So I have deleted account 11-15 times probably, and have stopped with this, but my friend had to deal with this, that makes me more scared.

&amp;#x200B;

But, now I delete my windows profile and delete all files of it, and make a new windows profile... I have done this a lot...

4,"College student, 19 year old sophomore here. I attended a community college very close to a big university for freshman year and first semester of this year (sophomore year). I ended up getting accepted into that university for the upcoming spring semester and dropped my only two classes for this semester last week. Nowadays, I just sit around, browse Reddit, play Fornite, smoke weed and do other drugs by myself in my apartment, and I'm feeling pretty bored and empty. I don't have any friends--receive no texts or messages from anyone and generally have zero social life.

8,"I finally had time today to fill out the Alaska Airlines credit card application I got since my first trip back home from vacation using that airline, and I only got as far as the legal name part because the ""preferred name"" part confuses me.

Since airlines require the legal name on airline tickets so they can check IDs, isn't it just safer to not have a preferred name part in the application, and just use the applicant's legal name?

Should I just put down my legal name as my preferred name to avoid this confusion at the gate checks at airports? Do I need to worry if I use a nickname as a preferred name?

I can't finish the application until I get this answered, so any advice would be helpful, especially if you're an Alaska cardholder or a cardholder of one of the other airlines. ",30Oct2018,1

10,"I graduated this past May with a Biomedical B.S, originally hoping to go into lab work. I realized the last year of school that I didnt really separate my interest in LEARNING about science from PERFORMING science and don't really know if I want to do lab work. I also took an art class, because it's a hobby of mine, and realized just how much I loved it. I had never looked at art in a career perspective before because I just thought it wouldn't be a good enough career. I was too far into my biomed degree though so o just graduated and thought I could go back to school for a quick 2 year associate's degree in Graphic Design.
Long story short, the plan fell through due to issues with the school preventing me from getting my associate's. I could go back to the same school o graduated from, but they have a limited acceptance program that has at LEAST a year of prerequisites to even apply to. And it would take me probably another 3 or 4 years and money I don't have.
I've been applying to lab jobs hoping to maybe try it or just bear with it to save money. But not only am I not getting accepted to anything, but I read the job descriptions and just... don't like it. I feel I'm either not qualified to do the job right or just won't enjoy it at all. 
So now I feel stuck. I desperately want to go take art classes and get an art degree, but can't afford it, and can't even get a lab job to see if I would like it. My current job has me part time on an inconsistent schedule that leaves me not getting much sleep and being stressed out a lot, so I really want a new job.

14,"There is a person I have been seeing off and on for the past year. For some fucked up reason I absolutely adore him though I would ever admit it to him or to anyone else. We get along so well, we have stuff in common we are the same when it comes to personality. We both have low self-esteem. He seeks sanctuary in me sometimes and opens up to me. But... sometimes he just flips. He’s a dick. Possessive, mean, short with me, asking questions he already knows the answer to just to start shit, being stubborn. Something as simple as “hey sorry I don’t feel like coming over tonight I had a rough day and just need to be alone” gets a response like this “🤔🤔hmmm okay, but you’re doing this and blah blah blah” or just simple conversation will be turned into a defensive aggressive argument. Like shit I don’t even know how he turns into arguments. You have no idea how careful I am with my words through text because of this but always he will find a way. He makes me so angry and annoyed when he does this because I fucking love him but what the fuck is all this. He makes me petty, and aggressive, and defensive back and that’s not me.

15,"My aunt (aunt 1) lived with her aunt for most of her life. Around five months ago, she finally decided to leave because her aunt was abusive etc etc. She moved in with her sister (my other aunt, aunt 2) for about a month, when there was an argument. The argument arose because aunt 2 paid for aunt 1's holiday to benidorm with the agreement all of it would be paid back. It was, but every payment was late. Aunt 1 is 25 and has never been self reliant. She works but spends all of her money on weed and cigarettes, and relies on her family to feed and house her. Aunt 2 mentioned that she would continue taking rent off of aunt 1, but putting it into a savings account so that when aunt 1 wanted a car or a house or something, the money could be used towards that to help with saving. Aunt 1 took this badly, and blamed aunt 2 of treating her like a child.

After this argument, aunt 1 moved in with us for a few days. Or so she said. Three months later, she uses our living room to sleep in, we pay for her food, her washing, we store her items, she uses our electricity, and although she was supposed to pay us £80 per month to stay, she has paid a total of £40 for the three months she has been here and she has used a lot more than was agreed. 

She is a major financial drain on my mum and stepdad, who don't earn much as is. They have five children, I am the eldest at 17, and aunt 1 makes that six children essentially. Recently, aunt 1 was awarded a flat as she was registered homeless. Every single day my mum has been at that flat cleaning, painting, working hard and my aunt has done nothing and continues to rely on us. My mum wants her out, and so does my stepdad, but this causes extreme tensions between us all because my mum can't bring herself to kick her sister out while my stepdad has no issue with it. They both want her gone. My aunt said she would be out by the weekend last week. She is still here. She constantly ignores calls intentionally from builders and workmen who are at her flat trying to turn on her heating and do essential repairs. She takes no responsibility for anything and has my mum do literally everything or she gets pissy. She has promised to be out by Wednesday, which absolutely will not happen. There is no way she will be out tomorrow and Wednesday is Halloween. When this deadline is missed, I have informed my mum and stepdad I will be removing my aunt from our house. She has had plenty of time, and the hesitation always lied with the fact that she had nowhere to go. Now she does have somewhere to go, and I mentally can't take the arguing and tension that is happening with her being here. Financially too, my mum will sometimes refuse to get nice food because she simply cannot afford to with my aunt expecting share of everything. My aunt literally indirectly takes money from us for herself. It is extremely draining. I have at times felt like leaving the house, so has my stepdad. I am kicking her out on Thursday and I have approval from my mum and stepdad to do this. What do I do. ",30Oct2018,1

24,"Hi! TL;DR below. 

My fiancés sister spent a ton of time in college just trying to figure out what she wanted to do. She landed on occupational therapy and I️ think that’s great! I️ love her, she’s super sweet but has never really left home so she’s the kind that is used to be catered to. 

She got into OT school(yay!) at my fiancé’s school. We are renting a place right now and since he’s still in school I’m the only one work so we live off my income and his loans. Combined the money is plenty but I don’t like to consider the loan money ours. 

His mom suggested his sister live with us to save money (she would pay $400. Our rent in total is $1575) until she was done. Plus she doesn’t know anyone in this town and could not really afford a place on her own. She is NOT the kind of person that’s comfortable getting a random roommate. 

So my fiancé thinks that this idea makes sense but I️ don’t really want her to move in. We have two bedrooms, an office for my fiancé, and two bathrooms. I️ don’t think it’s enough space. We’ve always had other people living with us (his friends finishing up their degrees) and we’re finally alone! I️ don’t want to give hat up especially after we are wed. 

I’ve told my fiancé I️ don’t like the idea but he says she can’t afford rent elsewhere alone and she’s scared to be alone somewhere new. What do I️ do? 

Some needed details: I’m 22, he’s 23 and his sister is 25. He’s in medical school.

It was around July when I finally managed to convince them to go to a therapist, and I was happy at myself for greatly improving their life, the problem was, the amount of stress and strain put on me effectively broke me. I had to carry the weight of the world and more for an entire year.

It's a new school year, and things are shit so far. I have no friends because I helped the one so frequently and other good friends either burned bridges with me, left to a new school, or simply drifted away.

It made me feel even more like shit than I already was and so I'm coming here now, I really want to repair my life, but the biggest thing I want to do is to somehow become less of this toxic individual that I turned out to be.

28,"Hi there, 

I’m here to get some advice about my current situation as I don’t have anyone in my life I can talk to. To preface I’m in my 20’s, living away from home and a full time university student (until mid November). 

I have secured 30 hours a week bartending at a club to support myself that I should start soon, but I do not want to do this job. I have mental health issues stemming from a traumatic experience that I have been trying to sort out for a few months and my first assessment/appointment will be next week. The idea of having to constantly interact with people and be happy and bubbly leaves me as an anxious mess and I truely do not believe I am in a good enough mental and emotional state to handle this. Secondly, the hours are sporadic and can be anywhere from 2pm to 5am. I have a lot of issues with sleep that cycle with my anxiety and depression and can leave me mentally, emotionally and physically exhausted and even suicidal at its worst. 

I feel so useless right now, I just want to suck it up and do it. But I’ve realised lately that if I want to be better I need to take care of myself. And I think that this position will only make things worse. I can turn down this job, but they are such great people and I don’t want to let them down. It may also leave me high and dry once the semester is over if I’m not able to find something quickly. I’ve never been in this position before, I’ve never faced my mental health issues and I am not handling the stress well. I have asked for my therapy appointment to be moved forward to address this issue/what they think the best action would be but it isn’t possible. 

I was wondering if anyone else has been in this position before? What would you do? ",30Oct2018,1

My longest position was 2 years of agony in a gas station and the position only ended because I developed severe anxiety and had a mental break while working there. 

I am going to school  for a largely self employed field so i have hope that i will eventually be in control of my habitual self-sabotage cycle, but I can't swallow a day job any more than i want to swallow cyanide, but I'd sooner foam from my mouth than turn in reports to Janice in HR or stock shelves at the local Kroger.

Now since getting out of the military I went back to school and got my masters in math. I recently moved to a major city and got a job in data science. And I just don't seem to fit in. With our current political climate office talk is heavily political.

My friend did something yesterday that bothered me. I confronted her about it today and she said that it doesn't bother most people so I'm being overdramatic. I told her that even if it doesn't bother most people, it bothers me, and I'm not being overdramatic for asking her to stop doing it in front of me.

She finally said she'd stop but that was only after an entire argument, but even then I feel she only said that to shut me up, not because she truly thinks she shouldn't do something that bothers me, even if it *shouldn't* bother me.

It was a really upsetting argument because she would say things like ""so and so doesnt care when I do this. He doesn't care when I do this. She doesn't. They don't.""

35,"I own a Discord server where I could just message my friends, play around and that stuff

But as of its creation, drama has become inevitable (Obviously)

We had a ""three strikes, you're out"" type of thing. If you messed up the first time, you'd get a warning, the second time you'd receive a time-out (IE, you got kicked and were not allowed back in for three days) The third time would lead to an inevitable ban

As the manager of this server, I had to take on so many responsibilities. I tried making people moderators to try and ease down the drama, but it just kept coming back...

People were leaving... I was losing friends... I felt horrible

Someone told me ""Where were you when this happened? How many chances did you give this person, huh?"" I proceeded to go invisible for a few minutes, then the guy just left. I understood, he was fed up with my shenanigans

I realized that I'm not a leader, I'm a coward. As of now, I'm taking a break to try and take my mind off of the drama...

But that one quote circles through my mind constantly, over and over and over, like a Merry-Go-Round

I know that I'm a bad leader, everyone there knows it, but they somehow stuck up with me for almost a year now

&amp;#x200B;

I never enforce the rules I bring down. I'm not that type of person. I try to be fair and give people more chances than I deserve. I want to know if there's anything I can do to help bring my server back to light. I don't want to give it to someone else, let alone delete it... I just want to improve my leadership and try not to make it a Monarchy...",30Oct2018,1
37,"My friend and I both are working and saving towards moving to California. We want to go live in a town that includes:

-a community college
-cheap cost of living, such as rent (cheap for California of course) 
- that is at the most 30-40 minutes from the coast (this is flexible)

We are both from Michigan and have little financial support. I would very much appreciate a general idea on how much we should have saved before we go and some affordable community college towns/cities to look into.

Also tips of the trade would very much be appreciated ! :)",30Oct2018,1
38,"Today I was in the car with my dad heading home, I'm a teen. We were debating about the type of people that get into the NFL. I said that the people who get into the NFL had to be athletic as well as intelligent, in order to be the best of the best. 

&amp;#x200B;

He kept deflecting the conversation to something to something like, ""Well, there are different people in different percentages. There is the best of the best, who are athletic and smart, and then different groups. There are groups that have high IQs and naturally not athletic, and people that are athletic and naturally high IQs.""

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't say intelligence, he specifically says IQ.

&amp;#x200B;

That made sense, but we've had this discussion before, and it always turns to race. (We're Chinese by the way). He eventually brings up that black people are more athletic, and Asian people have higher IQ. So I cut him off and tell him that the way different cultures groups are raised help determine what people wind up prioritizing and being good at. 

&amp;#x200B;

He beats around the bush a lot, but after he brings race into, I said, quote, ""This is literally a type of racism"". I should explain my parents have a history of being racist to Indian people, and that one is self-admitted by my mom.

He says, ""I'm just stating facts, I'm not a racist.""

After that I forgot to ask him for my paper back for a week, when I did remember to ask him, he said he totally forgot to give me back my paper, but he was looking at me every day that week even though he forgot to give me back my paper? I've asked him to help me three times now and he always so nice to help me whenever I ask. I asked for his snapchat, then I thank him but I look like i'm in a rush, and he said to me ""have a good one"" then we part our own way. I've messaged him on snapchat only about asking his help again, and he replied, but then now he doesn't open it yet but he view every of my snapchat stories. He walks really fast, but when i was talking to him, he walks slow to match my speed, even when the conversation stops for a while, he still walk slow to match my speed. We stopped talking when we're walking up the stairs, and the stairs weren't as wide, if two people walk in one stair step, we would have to squeeze in to fit 2 people, and he was walking squeezing himself to the wall as he slightly looking down at me as I was a step of a stair behind him. I'm interested in him, but I want to know why is he being so nice to me? We're just two strangers or classmates, but whenever I ask him to help me, he would be so nice about it.

(UPDATE) My crush and I are only classmates and strangers not friends yet... but I always ask him for help and he always so nice about it. We exchanged Snapchat and he views every Snapchat stories I post, and whenever I ask him for help he would always look at me the entire time while we’re talking and he usually walk fast but he would match my speed when walking with me, I’ve also noticed he looks at me in class and once we just hold each other’s gaze in class for couple secs then I turn away before he does. When walking side by side he would look at me the entire time when I’m speaking, and he would only glance at me if his turn of speaking. But now when I ask him for help he don’t look at me when he’s talking anymore. The only time we talk is I ask him for help and he’s always so generous and detailed about helping me.

43,"Hey I posted this in r/offmychest but thought I might as well post here too. I'm going through a really rough time right now. I've had depression and anxiety for 8 years now and it just seems to be getting worse. I'm on medication for it but it's still pretty bad. To make matters worse I come from a very verbally abusive family. I would get a job and move out but I have no job experience and I'm having a hard time getting a job. I also had to drop out of school this quarter because my anxiety and depression got so bad and I feel like a failure for that and I'm also freaking out because I have no idea what to do for a career.

I'm also dealing with some health issues at the moment. I'm lightheaded 24/7 and my doctor thinks I may have POTS. I'm also thirsty all the time which is making me miserable, my doctor doesn't know why I'm so thirsty but I'm getting tested for Diabetes Insipidus. I'm kind of worried about getting a job too because I'm scared what if I get super lightheaded at work or extremely thirsty. I just don't know how I would deal with being lightheaded or my constant thirst at work and if I got hired somewhere I don't know how my workplace would respond if they knew that about me. 

I'm also 20 and barely have any independent skills. My parents didn't teach me a lot of life skills growing up so now I'm having to learn them all on my own which is frustrating. I also have really bad driving anxiety and trying to learn how to drive right now which I'm embarrassed about since I'm 20 and should have learned that when I was 15 or 16.

I honestly feel like such a failure right now. All I do now of days is just sit on my couch or go to my therapy appointments. I feel like I'm going no where in life and my parents keep on telling me how ashamed they are of me. I want to get better but I don't even know how or where to start and it's hard because besides my therapist, I have no support. All of my other friends are in college and doing pretty well in life and it makes me feel terrible, I'm doing nothing with my life.

48,"    I drove by that neighor and honked very loudly, while giving her the middle finger. I feel a lot of guilt now, because it was so out of character and I realized I know I must have ruined her day. Is there anything I can do to apologize? 

Why I did it: Last week she yelled and swore at my very socially anxious brother (she was angry he ran past her to the bus stop, perceived it as him implying she was too slow). My brother could barely tell me, and he stopped taking the bus for a week. I started waking up very early to drop him off, but I didn’t want him to just fear someone who yelled at him for no reason. He still wouldn’t budge, so my solution when I saw her was to slow down and honk at her, to show him I was “hitting back” for him, I guess.

I feel like a bully. Maybe she was having a rough day, and she didn’t need me honking at her early in the morning. She hasn’t responded or anything, and I don’t know if she will. 

Should I go over and apologize to her? (I’m a bit weary of doing this, as she and her boyfriend have got in police trouble many times since they’ve moved in. They even hung up a confederate flag on their house. My brother looks caucasian but I look more like a POC, so I’m afraid offering an apology will make things worse) ",30Oct2018,1

When I look at my split times and how distance I have been able to build up, I'm feel like I should objectively happy with my personal progress but I'm still struggling with how I feel about my performance when compared to family friends and while I know you should only ever look at your personal performance, I can't help but have this nagging voice in the back of my mind telling me I'm not good enough or attractive enough.  I recently completed two major races - a Marathon and a Half Marathon with a new personal record but after looking at the race photos, I'm utterly disgusted with what I see and am getting discouraged.  I know most people generally do not look good during or after a race but I feel like my own photos are really atrocious.  I'm struggling to resolve these feeling and get past it.  I know physical performance should improve over time but it's still hard to accept and deal with in the moment without reacting to these really negative feelings (i.e. self-deprecating statements and thoughts, withdrawing from friends and family, not wanting to do any races, etc.).  Any advice on how to move past these feelings and accept my physical performance and appearance?

I love my new home. The arts, jobs, diversity, entertainment, and public amenities are incredible. I want to plant my roots here, but feel like it won’t happen because I spend my free time flying right back to my family. I was homesick for 6ish months, but now I’m getting very comfortable.

55,"Ok, so I live in an apartment with 1 other person. Almost everyday when I wake up, or when I come home from class, my room smells like cigarettes. Maybe faintly in other areas of the apartment but mainly just my room. I thought it was the person that lives below me, and I complained to management. Well, after almost 2 months of complaints, they informed me that ""they've checked their room multiple times"" and claim they aren't smoking. Now, management is pretty shitty at my apartment complex, so they could be lying. Or maybe the person got rid of the smell, before it was inspected. An important note is that whoever is smoking , they don't smoke constantly, it's usually twice a day (once at night, once in the day), so covering up the smell wouldn't be that difficult I don't think.

Ok, but the thing is I didn't have a problem with this before my roommate moved in. I lived in the unit for 2 weeks before he got here and never had a problem with cigarette smell before. And I notice that the smell conveniently occurs when I am either away from the apartment or am sleeping. And furthermore, when my roommate *isn't* here, I haven't smelt cigarette smell at all. I confronted my roommate about smoking inside the apartment twice. Both times he denied it, and one time even let me smell inside his room. And I didn't smell anything. But I did smell a wierd smell (like baby powder?) or something, and his window was wide open which I found suspicious (it's very humid in this state), I also didn't smell cigarettes in my room at the time so maybe that explains why I didn't smell anything in his room? 

I've tried smelling around his door a few times and haven't smelled much. But I'm thinking maybe he deodorizes his room, but the smell makes its way into my room and my room retains the smell? I should note that our rooms are on opposite sides of the apartment, but the air vents allow sound and smells to travel from room to room. 

So basically it comes down to is my roommate smoking and lying to me, or is my neighbor smoking and my apartment complex lying to me? And what to do in this situation?

Sorry for the terribly long post.

60,"So this has been a thought of mine for a very long time. I’m a guy and I haven’t been in a relationship in a very long time. I have quite a few guy friends and couple girl friends but I usually find myself getting hooked on one of my girl friends and I feel like I start becoming a “nice guy” and i feel embarrassed about it..

My current situation:
I started being friends with my friends girlfriend and never had feelings for her but I eventually ended my friendship with her boyfriend (because he was toxic) and now we are basically best friends and I do things for her all the time and treat her good and she does the same for me. I’ve kind of fallen into the role of the shoulder to cry on. I started to have feelings for her after about 3 months of talking to her non stop and hanging out with her a lot. 

I’ve done this before (without the whole boyfriend being my ex best friend thing) 

The only difference in this situation is that I feel like the feelings might be mutual, if she wasn’t in a relationship but she is so if I do want anything to happen I will have to wait for her and her boyfriend to end things (which they are going to soon), and then I guess still be there for her? 

I’ve had self esteem issues and have bad anxiety that causes a lot of paranoia and I’m just worried that she and other people might just see me as a nice guy. I have the feelings that I’m subconsciously doing things and that I’m a “virus” because I make her doubt her boyfriend. Even though when I think about it I really don’t want her to break up with her boyfriend because he’s very smart and would make things hard for me if he was still in contact with her. 

I might delete this because I usually only go on here for advice when I’m having a foggy head and my anxiety and stuff is super high. 

my current plan in the situation is to wait it out and continue being her friend and just keep to myself. Eventually they’re going to break up and I’ll be there for her and eventually I’ll be able to see if she has feelings for me too.

67,"Hi, I am a Sophomore in college and a Physics major. 

I've battled depression and anxiety, as well as eating disorders, since Freshman year of high school. 

In high school, I was pretty low achieving. I'm ""naturally"" good at school, so my grades were still above average, but I did not apply myself at all. 

When I entered college, I had a killer 1st year. I go to a small school, and the Physics program is super small and tight knit. For comparison with this semester, I got all A's my first year, and scored the highest in my Physics classes. All the Physics professors know who I am before I even take a course with them. This only adds to the pressure I feel.

This semester though, I've been struggling a lot. I don't know what is wrong with me. I cannot focus on my classes, I come home and nap or watch Netflix and procrastinate and don't study. Even after attending lecture, I feel like I'm not absorbing anything. I can't pay attention in class, so everything just goes in one ear and out the other. 

I've been doing awful in my classes. For me, anything less than an A- is pretty bad, and I'm struggling to even get a C in Calc III so that it can count as my requirement for my degree. Doing poorly on the quizzes and exams is only weighing me down and making me less inclined to study. I want to withdraw, but it is a co-requisite for my Physics III course, so if I drop it, I have to drop Physics III. It is only offered every Fall, so I would be a year behind.

I've been beating myself up pretty badly. At night, I just lay there and think about how to end things and wonder if anything is even worth it. I don't think life is worth the struggle and pain I feel. 

I don't know what a normal amount of suicidal thoughts are, but I feel like I've passed that. I feel like I've mentally retracted back to my same tendencies in high school. I want to be dead everyday. In class, with my friend, I never can escape the stress. Its constantly weighing on me, even when I'm procrastinating. In every aspect of my life, I just feel like I would rather not be here, so why try at all. I think that is why I cannot sit down and study. I did the same thing in HS. 

I had a counselor in HS. She diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, but her only method of treatment was meditation, and it didn't do shit, so I've looked carefully at therapists in my area. There is only one who lists methods besides what my counselor did, that I can also afford.  She cannot see me until late November (a month from now). I only have one friend at school, and I can't bring this up to her. I need help now. My suicidal thoughts are escalating and my opinion of myself is extremely low. If I don't figure out why I can't focus, I'm not going to be able to pass my classes, and only drive down my self-worth. I don't know what to do.

I have my AA and 30 credits towards a BA but I dont see my BA useful for the real world, nor do I want to be a slave to the loans to finish it quite yet. I have been told I would be great for the military. I am intelligent, coachable, efficient, and tough. I dont want to be on the frontlines but I do think that my gifts and talents could greatly benefit our country in some way. My fear is that I will be put in a job in the military I hate. I want to do something I love and something that will serve others. I was in youth ministry for the past 3 years where I learned leadership, how to lead volunteers, influence 300 teenagers, raise money, and champion others. 

I just want to hear your honest pros and cons and whether or not the military (and what branch) would be the most beneficial.

On Saturday night he wants to walk with me and another friend from his house to hers (10-13 miles away) we are runners so we could get to her house (and leave) in the span of a couple hours

We mainly wanna do this just cause it would be an interesting experience. We've looked at the route and it seems safe with us being on a main road (we have to cross a parkway once but there's a bridge going over it we could take)

I grew up with a single mother in a particularly religious family not concerned about this ""dad"" character, he wasn't around. I guess I met him when I was 2?

At age 18 I had college plans (no thanks to mom), and my mom tells me this guy she worked under for decades (who's 14 years older than her) asked her to marry him and she accepted. During a very emotional monolog she tells me the full story that her early husband had problems, and during the separation period she slept with this other guy and I'm probably his kid. (I have since met this guy, and he is an amazingly terrible asshole) (I mean, he's amazingly great at being an asshole, but that's a terrible thing)

It's been a long time, but I have never figured out how to deal with this. My entire extended family knew this stuff, and nobody told me. They are Christians, all of them, but they never told me the truth.

Also, apparently I got a high score on an IQ test when I was 10 but my mom destroyed the documentation and didn't tell me because she thought it would make me an asshole or something.

We have been through some really tough times recently as I've been dealing with mental illness and receiving a proper diagnosis, medicine trials, hospitalizations, etc. I'm diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder and Bipolar type 2 and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It has been a very rough year for us. We've found ourselves in a number of fights that have gotten very intense. We have said some hateful things to each other during these fights but have never gotten physical and both have always felt HORRIBLE after. Like cannot live with the guilt and remorse the next day. It will eat me alive for days and I won't be able to eat. We're both children of divorced families who fought often. I know that we need to work on our communication and we need to learn how to fight properly. But I'm worried that the more I read about ""abusive relationships"" and that they can never be fixed- that were screwed. He is my best friend, he has taken care of me during my worst times, he's saved my life during multiple suicide attempts, been at every doctor's visit imaginable, keeps watchful eye on my medication and makes sure I'm taking it properly (not sneaking more than I should or not taking it at all), he's a gentle man with nothing but support for me. But when these fights happen, we hit below the belt and I'm not sure why. We love each other so very much and our relationship has so much potential but we have to stop the fighting. I'm at the point where I'm wondering if these kinds of situations can be resolved if both parties do their part. We both want this fixed so badly.

Long story:  
A few weeks ago my step mother was out of town at a conference. We hadn't heard from my dad for a couple days, which is normal because usually he just doesn't answer the phone when we call (probably because he's drinking, but that's another post). Eventually we get worried and my brother goes over to find he's been laying on the floor for \~24 hours after having split his scalp open during a fall. He's doing OK, but I totally got to pull a ""Mr.Wolf"" and clean up a bedroom covered in 2 liters of dad-blood...so that's fun.

79,"A little insight. I’m a student at a private university going for a degree in elementary/special education. 
I’m here mostly on scholarships through band and what little financial aid could help with. Due to my parents getting a nasty divorce and my dad being the only financial help even though he keeps getting more and more money taken by mom, and me being a waitress in a small town and barely making enough money for gas and my own food, I can’t pay for what tuition I need to pay. 
There is also that I have almost no time to get field experience hours in schools with both my work and class schedules. And that takes up a decent portion of my grade. I do well on my class work. And decent on my tests besides a few times where I didn’t get to study as well as I needed to. But my grades aren’t enough to keep my scholarships and financial aid. Which is all I have to pay for me to come here now. 
Due to so much stress, I’ve been having many mental breakdowns and panic attacks. I’ve been lashing out at those that I love for no reason. I’m constantly on the verge of tears and any little thing could trigger me into a panic or mental breakdown. 
There is also so much I need to do to become a teacher but I have no way to pay for the exams they want us to take and no time to get them taken. 
Idk if I even want to become a teacher any more. The reason I went into this is because it seemed like a good idea at the time and people thought that’s what I should be. There’s nothing else I want to do. And I work well with younger kids. 

My dad is taking so much for me so I can get a degree at college, no matter what it’s for. He wants me to stay in education. But it’s too much for me mentally. My mom and sister don’t believe I’m going to make it through college. And dad wants me to get my degree to show them up. 
I have talked to my dad about switching from education to something else. But he wants me to stay as I can’t find something better for me and he really believes in me becoming a teacher.

I’m most likely gonna flunk out of education anyways as right now they are trying to see if I’d be a good fit in their education program. And I’m not fitting in too well. 

I thought about switching to a technical or community college as I would be able to afford that better and just go for a business degree.

I’m a 19F and my roomate is a 28M. I’ve been living here since January and for the majority of the time that I’ve been here it’s been fine. I’m don’t talk to my roommate much outside of asking whose gonna buy milk that week or to complain about the neighbors above us. I met him on Craigslist so that’s probably why we don’t really talk but I’m fine with it, we stay out of each others way.
That was until about 2 month ago when he started sleeping with his best friends little sister (18F) and secretly dating her. I don’t really like the fact that he’s going behind his best friends back and I think the age difference is icky, but it’s really not my business so I haven’t said anything. 
This girl though guys is super fucking annoying. It didn’t start off well with me and her. The first week she was here at like 1am she banged on my bedroom door and woke me up (I have a 7 am calc class so I wasn’t happy) but when I opened my door she was drunk af asking me if I wanted to have a threesome with her and my roomate. I don’t know what the fuck went through her mind thinking that was okay but it wasn’t. My roomate the next morning apologized to me because he knows it wasn’t cool but ever since then she legit hasn’t said a word to me. 
From then on ahi just got worst. This chick eats all MY food (my roommate and I buy deprecate food, we only share milk because we buy a ton of milk), she leave a mess in MY bathroom even though it makes more sense for her to use his bathroom, she never picks up after herself (just last week idk how she did it but she smeared toothpaste ALL over my bathroom counter and just said fuck it and left it there, she leaves her  shoes,purse,keys, chargers, books, homework and shit all scattered over the living room, and she keeps leaving her pants in the kitchen and I find her underwear in random places?? Its fucking disgusting) She also ALWAYS brings over her best friend who is equally annoying. I can’t even go into the living room anymore because the best friend has decided to squat there whenever my roomate is fucking the girlfriend. Both the girl and her friend just leave there shit where ever they want. It’s gotten to the point that I try to stay out of the house as long as possible and when I do get home I’m basically confined to my room for the rest of the night. 
Fast forward to today and I come home from class and the apartment door is wide open, at first I though we got broken into but nothing was missing so I was super confused. I shut the door after I chase out like 4 stray cats. 20 minutes later this girl is bringing in boxes and bags. This bitch not only left the door open for at least 20 minutes but for who knows how long but I s moving in. She is fucking moving in. My roomate isn’t even here rn and honestly I don’t think he knows she’s moving in. He would have told me something. At least a “hey my best friends teenage little sister that I’m fucking and cheating on is moving in tomorrow! Cool? Cool!” 
I don’t feel like I can mention any of this to him because I’m afraid he will kick me out and I’ll be back on the streets. I’m looking for a new place but it’s hard, I go to school full time and I work part time, and I can’t go back “home” because my parents kicked me out at 16, my home was through foster care and I’m too old for that now.

You study several times a week for about 2 to 4 hours and some of your classmates come to you for answers or explanations and you manage to help them out a lot. The professor sees you as one of those students that participate and usually gets the answers right. You also hand in your homework assignments on time and sometimes the professor throws in a couple group projects that you manage to pass like it was nothing. On rare ocations, you may end up in the tutoring center and end up leaving with all your answers solved but overall, you knew deep inside that you knew all the answers all along.

It's exam day and the professor gives out the exam and as you are taking the exam you feel quite confident in the answers you've selected. Then BAM! a week later you get your results and all you see is a big fat F in your face.

Around two years ago, I had a stomach bug and I spent two days only eating soup. This is where everything started. After I had gotten better, she started saying that I was losing weight and needed to start eating. I was eating normally at this point. This confused my father and I and it went on for weeks. She once said I was starting to look sickly skinny. Keep in mind that I'm 5 foot 4 and haven't weighed less than 130 since I started middle school. She would force me to eat things and yell and scream at me if I didn't eat what she gives to me at that moment. It would make me cry at times and my dad would get angry at her.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon after that I heard her talking on the phone with my grandmother. I heard her tell her I was anorexic. I was absolutely appalled and yelled at her and I was hysterical as why she would say such a thing. A few days later, I suddenly had a ""checkup"" at the doctor's and the only thing my doctor asked me was if I was binging/purging. I said no. The appointment was then over.

Fast forward about a year, I'm still the same weight I was then, she is obsessive about my caloric intake. I have always loved vegetables and fruit, but every time I eat something relatively unhealthy (candy bar, piece of pie/cake) she says ""Do you know how many calories are in that?"" and ""Ugh, that's probably so fattening"" Every. single. time. I can't take it anymore, its like she tries to guilt me out of eating snacks and my dad has noticed this as well. She once asked me if I was aware of how many calories my latte had and I blew up on her and said that i'm not insecure so I don't care. she still does this.

102,"Little background ; i'm 21, going to school for the first time since highschool, and i'm the only one supporting myself ( no parents to support me) 

So, I am going to a nearby community college in January for an Associate of Applied Science Degree with not many, if any transferable credits (hence APPLIED science degree). I just had orientation the other day and am still very interested. Only problem is.. the bigger school next to me, has a major in something that I can earn more money for the future and pay tuition and student loans back. Plus this major offers something more specific, and even has a masters program. Should I just put it on the back burner? Should I go to the community college and just go to the bigger college after I graduate?",30Oct2018,1

106,"I have been going through a very serious episode of depression and anxiety over the last few months. It has 100% affected my work ethic and I have made some not so great choices in that regard. I travel for work a lot, and when a date is set for travel, the anxiety builds up over the weeks leading up to it to the point of panic attacks. When I am in that state I just can't focus on anything at all and just don't end up really doing any work. The depression is something that lingers regardless of the travel, though worsens while the anxiety peaks. 

I don't think I have really done anything super bad, more so the little less important things is where have been having issues. Going to meetings, working from home instead of going into work. I have been like a ghost. Even though they are unimportant in comparison to my real job, which I do very well regardless of my state of mind, I feel guilty. I am working really hard to dig myself out. I have found out why I am depressed and am working on fixing it, and I am learning to cope with the anxiety . 

I have already hit rock bottom and am climbing up hill from here.  But I feel guilty regardless and I feel like honesty is the best way to get it off my chest.  

The question, should I tell my manager I have been struggling? If so, how can I do it in a way that wont make things worse for myself? Thanks

107,"I'm sorry if this is long. This is my first time posting and I'm on mobile. I'm  really upset right now so I'm sorry for mistakes. I also do not know the proper military terms so I will try my best. 

Almost two weeks ago (October 18) we found out my younger brother, Sam, killed himself. He was in the army and was transitioning to civilian life. He was not taking it well. There were many warning signs that my parents and a few of my siblings knew about but never told me until after it happened. 

It has been really tough for my family. My dad and mom are convinced that Sam's girlfriend was able to use dark powers to influence the suicide. Now I was raised a Christian so I know they believe in heaven and hell and all that. But trying to blame Sam's suicide on the gf because she smokes weed and is Wiccan is a stretch for me. I could live with them thinking that because everyone has their own ways to cope. And they are talking with detectives who are letting them know its a crazy theory. 

But now my sister, who is also in the army, is saying she can talk to God/Jesus and our dead brother! She is saying the suicide was part of a bigger plan and Sam did it as a sacrifice. She's saying there is a big spiritual vs mortal war that is going to happen in the near future and it all is going to start in Africa. She says I need to find my third eye and be able to see what is happening so I can protect my kids and husband.

I know she had mental problems growing up but I didn't know she heard stuff. She is using the voices to try and turn a terrible situation into something with meaning. Her ex-husband (they are still close) is being deployed to Africa in a week so I think that is why she is saying the war is going to start there. I know she blames herself for what happened to Sam but I can't talk to her without her closing her eyes every few minutes and having an imaginary conversation.

She's told all this to our parents. When I tried to tell them she needs help my dad said that ""she has been around Sam's gf for the past week. She just needs to read her Bible and come back to Christ."" Like anytime I try and suggest she needs to be hospitalized it turns into a sermon about how we need to hold fast to our faith and to stay away from the darkness in this world. I feel like I'm the crazy one for even suggesting taking her to a doctor. 

I don't know what to do anymore. What if the voices tell her she needs to kill herself or her kids?? I have tried to talk reason into her but since then she has barely talked to me and says she's going to give me time to see the truth.

I guess I need to know if we can put her in a psych ward against her will. Or if there is a way to report her to a commanding officer in the army. Like any option that will result in her getting help would be great. Or should I just play along with her and let her believe whatever she wants. I'm exhausted and trying to deal with my brother's death on top of all of this is soooo difficult. ",30Oct2018,1

109,"Here is the data:

Basics:

I've lived there about 4 months.

I always pay rent a week in advance, and all bills as soon as I receive them.

There are 4 other housemates, so 5 total including me.

Three of them are friends.

I'm rarely home, and when I am home, I am in my room.

When I see my housemates, I say, ""Hello, how's it going?""

Sometimes they say, ""Good, you?"" Other times, they simply say, ""Hi.""

We're all in our 30s.

Why I worry about being kicked out:

Sometimes, I'm home and they don't know, so I can hear my housemates talking about me.

One night, I heard two of them talking about me. They were both drunk. One of them said he was worried I am addicted to ""hard drugs"" and ""would have no problem asking me to leave."" The other said, ""He's a good roommate, pays his Bill's on time, quiet."" The two eventually fell into a screaming argument over the state of the restroom, which was messy before I moved in. I have seen them both since then, and they've been nice to me.

Another roommate actively avoids me if we see each other in public, such as the grocery store near our house. If she sees me, she will take out her phone and look at it as she passes me.

One night, I heard two housemates loading the dishwasher. One of them said, ""He really should be doing this, it's not like he never cooks!"" I'm not sure she was talking about me, but couldn't say for sure?

None of them ever stop to talk with me. It feels like they avoid me.

My room is really messy. I don't think they've gone in there, but you never know.

Final thoughts:

I am very introverted and very busy, so it's great that they don't seem to want much to do with me. I also really like this place, and all of them, so I'd like to stay if possible.

I just worry they don't want me there based on the above.

I'm also kind of paranoid about these things. I've felt vaguely worried about being asked to leave most places I've lived.",30Oct2018,1

115,"I moved into an apartment with 3 other people. None of us knew each other upon moving in together and I chose the place mostly out of desperation- I could not afford anything better and had recently withdrawn from college. During and before moving in with them I was a heroin addict and am now 3 months sober. Only one of my roommates knows about this now (let's call him Jim). Jim found out about my addiction a while back in June because I passed out on the floor and he found me. Since then, what had been a semi friendly relationship became much more distant. My relationship with all the roommates Jim, Bill, and Kelly (all name's changed for anonymity), had been distant but not unfriendly. For some context on Jim, Bill, and Kelly, all of them are a bit older than me and in their late 20s. Also, they are all one race and I am another. I feel that this is important information because it seems like sometimes part of their unfriendliness to me is racial. I also feel like they try to take advantage of me/don't take me seriously because I am younger than them. Throughout my time living here I have noticed various things of mine being taken. Sometimes food, drinks, at one point someone took about $20 worth of beer that I bought and none of it was replaced. I also provided a good deal of communal cooking and bathroom appliances but all of that had been overlooked. More recently, people, especially Bill and Jim, have been openly antagonistic towards me and accusing me of not doing anything regarding household chores. All of us have separate schedules/work hours etc. so it is very difficult to know who does what; however I know I do my fair share. I'm not claiming to be an avid cleaner or mop everyday by any means, but I do my part to the extent that everyone does their parts. I have consistently been blamed for full dishes and flooded sinks that I have had no part of. When I was shooting heroin everyday I was a bit of a slob and I've owned up to that, but that doesn't change that a lot of recent issues are not my fault. A lot of the accusations feel extremely hypocritical. I feel attacked, singled out, and frankly incredibly uncomfortable being in my apartment. Kelly is much less of an issue but I have a feeling if it came down to taking sides, she would side with Bill because they are friendly. Even beyond the current issues, there are past things that I need to mention as well. When I was still in college (and this is part of the reason I withdrew from college) I was raped. None of my roommates know this (thank God) but I have a troubling story of something that happened when Jim and I were still on good terms. One night he came home late drunk and saw that my light was on so he came to my room. I don't have a door so he just came in. He seemed extremely plastered and asked me if he could lie down in my bed so I let him. It seemed innocent to me. I was also in bed. Then he proceeded to turn towards me and grind into my back. I got out of my bed and told him to get out of my room and he then made a disparaging remark about not wanting to touch me and stayed put in my bed. I asked him to leave again and he would not so I went into the kitchen and sat on the floor (we don't have furniture) until he sobered up enough to go to his bed. The following day he gave a half-hearted apology and I accepted at the time because we were otherwise friendly and I didn't want to make a big deal of it. I felt like if I did I would be overreacting and he didn't deserve me doing that to him. That was probably about 8 months ago and before he knew about the heroin but nevertheless it's inappropriate. I feel bad calling him out but it did bring back a lot of trauma from my assault and technically what he did is sexual harassment. I feel mildly harassed across the board by Jim and Bill (for different reasons as previously stated). I contacted the landlord a while ago and told him I need to get out of the apartment for medical reasons (which is true, the heroin rehab has been extremely physically trying and I know I need to be in a facility). His response was that I need a subletter or else I will still be responsible for rent and that it is solely my responsibility to find someone to take my room. There will be no support from the landlord's end in me moving out. I have not had any luck yet in finding a subletter and I have been looking for a couple of months now. I really can't take this anymore I need to get out of that place. Any advice on how to handle my roommates or if there is a way for me to break my lease because of these situations would be extremely appreciated. Thank you for reading all of this.",30Oct2018,1
118,"So, I feel like I'm surrounded by fucking idiots. 

Not in the sense that ""I have higher IQ; /r/iamverysmart"", but in the sense that my peers are always doing some stupid shit that will get them in trouble/hurt them later in life. 

For example, while most of my school generation drink alcohol, I have never come close to a bottle or want to. 

I also see that most ignore their school duties, and see them secondary to socializing (which ends up being pretty shitty for me in team assignments). 

However, I gotta admit that they do have some valid points against me. 

I am constantly told to ""enjoy being a teen while it lasts"" and, even though I do have friends, they constantly tell me that I should go out and socialize more.

I’ve also been told that, as a teen, there is a point where you think you’re more mature than everyone, and then you realize you aren’t, but the facts just don’t add up. I do everything based on entirely on science and facts (I even became an atheist against my parents’ will). I value going to school because I understand the importance of learning, but most of my peers do retarded shit to get attention or to socialize. I’ve only ever met one person which I can relate to, and they he is also constantly told to “enjoy teenage hood.”

skip to bottom for tl;dr

I met this guy at school in Aug 2017. I'll call him Nick. He was in my fourth, I was a sophomore and I had a crush on him and we bonded somewhat quickly, he was gay too.

He told one of my friends he had a crush on me so she told me and then when I confronted him about it, he told me I'm ""too young"" for him, because he's two and a half years older than me. I guess I never noticed it until Nick mentioned it, but he was only a junior at the time because I think he started school late or something along those lines, his age was that of a senior's and his birthday is in Sep 1999 while mine is in Mar 2002.

I thought it was annoying how he said he liked me in front of others but didn't in person to me. But I understood why he did it because we are in ""different stages of life"" as all the sex ed teachers put it.

He started to drift away from me and insult me to my face, so I did the same thing and our relationship turned sour.

This new girl asked me after all of that if I was friends with him, so I said ""no he's an asshole.""

I still don't know how he found out I said that but he was pissed when he did and on a Wednesday in October he told me he was going to ""fuck me up"" the next day, Thursday.

I went to school like regular but then I got scared of seeing him in fourth so I snuck off campus and went home. I didn't wanna snitch on him because that's just not me.

The next day I figured he had cooled off so I went and a lot of people made fun of me throughout the day, because basically the previous day as I was illegally escaping campus, one of his friends recognized me and took a video of me climbing the fence. She sent it to him, and he decided to post so it caught on a bit quick. He also reported me, so the next Monday I had a day of ISS. But I didn't care about any of that, I was just glad he didn't get his chance to ""fuck me up.""

Over the months of February 2018 to April 2018 I slowly became more social with him because we started to have mutual friends.

In April he apologized for threatening to fuck me up and sending that video like wildfire, so I apologized for calling him an asshole. Then he tried to convince me to date him because he didn't care about the ages anymore, and so I told him no. He didn't respond well to this, but we were still friends.

But then I found out his sister was this one girl I didn't like. I didn't remember her name but she was always a huge bitch to me whenever we interacted and so since I didn't know her name I just called her ""that redheaded bitch"" because she had red hair. Not natural red hair, the dyed color that Ariana Grande made famous.

Idk if she was a bitch to me over the problems I had with Nick, or she's just a bitch in general but I didn't like her either way.  
Then that same redheaded bitch got into a fist fight with one of my friends. So Nick and all his friends started talking shit about my friend, so I straight up told them ""Don't talk shit about my friend, idgaf if she fought your sister.""

Needless to say Nick cut me off and so did all his friends.

We had a few interactions over the summer, I saw him at the mall a couple times and he gave me dirty looks but besides that, that was really the end of us.

But this year, I'm a junior now and Nick is a senior. That redheaded bitch I was talking about is also in my grade.

Come to find out I have a sixth period with BOTH of them. So I BEGGED my guidance counselor to change my schedule but they said no and so I tried to just ignore Nick and his sister.

It was working fine but today in class we were assigned groups of four for projects.

I of course got put into a group with both Nick and his sister, and some other new student I don't know.

I don't want to go to that class and deal with one of them, let alone both and so I desperately need advice on how I can manage this whole thing, I need to get good grades.

**tl;dr** there's this guy who's not really my ex. I tried to get with him, he said no, he became mean so I shittalked him, he found out and wanted to beat me up but I avoided it so he spread an embarrassing video of me. Then we became cool again, but his bitchy sister got into a fight with one of my friends so we divided again. He gave me dirty looks anytime I saw him after that, but now I have a sixth period with him AND his sister. I have a group project with both of them and another kid idk, and I desperately need advice on how to deal with them because I want good grades.

My parents just helped me move into a new apartment. I noticed some strange behaviors from my mom. First of all, she seems to be extremely hyperactive. She talks extremely fast and goes from one topic to the next in conversations. She gets noticeably tense when I can't keep up. She doesn't give me any chance to respond. 

She calls me to talk and its always rushed. It's borderline offensive that she calls me and talks for 30 seconds, says she has to go. It seems like she gets frustrated with the pace of the conversation or maybe I'm just boring?

She is over the top hyper and doesn't notice that she makes messes. For example, she washed my dishes as we unpacked them and didn't seem to notice the water mess she made by washing them erratically. 

I calmly explained to her that she was making a mess and that she is overly hyper. She kind of snapped at me and said ""this is who i am""

Her physical appearance seems to be drastically changing. 

She is very irritable. 

It almost seems like she is abusing a stimulant, however she has worked for the government for her entire life and I can't imagine her knowingly abusing drugs. Maybe a doctor gave her some amphetamines?

The main reason I'm not convinced it's drugs is that she has gaines a lot of weight.

Lastly, she has this weird tic thing that she does at random. She puts her hands together and rubs them together really fast while gritting her teeth and making a complex audible noise. I hope I described that well enough. She has had this tic for as long as I can remember.

I don't know how to talk to her about this without triggering her. She is my mom and I love her. I'm afraid of what this could be and worried that it may be genetic.

I also want to add that nothing is ever her fault. All of her actions are always blamed on someone or something else.

Now some of you might think that I'm just being your typically 16 year old girl who hates her mom and just wants to get out. Maybe I am. But I only really started realizing how uncaring my mother is in 7th grade.

This all started with me being bullied in 7th grade. An 8th grader would constantly insult me and harass me for being blonde (I ended up dying my hair partially because of this) and another girl in my grade would shove me around and hit me, and the most I could do was tell them to stop. It expanded to a few more people bullying me, and I started hating going to school. It got to the point where I was self harming because of how worthless I felt. When I worked up to courage to tell my mom so that I could hopefully get help, all she did was get me a bible and a cross. She said that there was a spirit in our house that was making me depressed. Things just got worse for me. It wasn't until the school found out that I was so close to killing myself and called my parents and the suicide hospital that they actually believed me. They'd told me that the guy who bullied me had a hard home life and that I should just ignore it. Same thing about the girl. But then the threat of me almost getting put in a psychiatric facility and ruining her image of a ""Perfect Family"" seemed to kick in and they got me into therapy. I can't even go into a therapist's office without having a panic attack and I am so terrified of mental hospitals that sometimes the thought of being put into one will send me into tears and a panic attack. She had the chance to help, but would rather say that there is a ghost causing me mental problems instead of admit the truth that I needed help.

She and my dad fight a lot, and most of the time it is started by her. She's a drama queen and will yell at my dad and accuse him of things that he didn't do. For example, if he doesn't have time to do something like put up a light outside along the railing (which she is perfectly capable of), she will yell at him until she's in tears and threaten to leave. My dad is working a full time job and is active in the community, while she doesn't have a job, my brother and I are mostly self sufficient, and she mostly just lays and watches TV all day in her room. She doesn't take initiative and just blames everyone else for everything. If she messes up, it's our fault. If we mess up, then everything that has happened in the past 7 years is our fault. She's still mad at my dad for moving to our current location, even though we moved 7 years ago. Any time we try to call her out on things, she gets beyond pissed and will throw a fit. Last time I called her out on her BS, she took my phone away.

One of the most recent things that makes me feel like she doesn't give a shit about anyone except herself is what happened on Friday. There was a threat of a shooting at my school. The Elementary School, Middle School, and my High School were all on lockdown. She texted me a few times just to tell me what was happening. I let her know when the lockdown was over and the girl who made the threat was in custody. She asked if I wanted to come home and I said no because I had to leave at 11:00 for a Rotary lunch, which was only an hour away at the time. Before the lunch, however, I had to come home and get my cheer uniform. I expected her to be relieved that I was okay and hug me and all that, but nope. She was on the phone when I came in. She just pointed my uniform, which I had left on the couch. She barely said anything to me. I quickly changed into in for the lunch and said bye to her, but she was too busy on the phone to acknowledge me. Meanwhile, my boyfriend long distance boyfriend of 7 months who I've probably only spent 16 hours with in person was begging to call me so that he could hear my voice and know that I was okay. My boyfriend of less than a year was more worried about the fact that there could have been a shooting at my school than the woman who gave birth to me. Even when I got home, all my mom could talk about was what people on Facebook were saying about it. I must say that hurt quite a bit.

I don't know how to react when she does things like this. A lot more has happened, but this post has gotten long. Basically, I need advice on how to react. I'm a senior in HS, so I don't have to stay around for much longer, but it just drains me of energy being around her and she always makes me feel like I'm not good enough. How can I counter her toxicity without setting her off? How can I get through these next few months? What can I do to make her realize how much trouble she causes?

TL;DR: My mom causes a lot of problems and is overdramatic and self centered. When there was a threat of a shooting at my school, she basically just brushed it off and cared less than my boyfriend. She doesn't listen and doesn't realize that she does things wrong. What can I do to make her realize that she isn't perfect? Please help. I don't know how much longer I can deal with her before I say something that I regret...",30Oct2018,1
137,"I [24f] have a crush on my co-worker [28m].  Without getting too specific, we’ve been working together for a little while now. I haven’t told him how I felt because I think it’s a little weird to date a coworker, but we’re always chatting when at work together and there’s (what I think to be) a little flirtation on both ends. 

I got the courage recently to ask if he wanted to see a movie with me and he agreed. I didn’t really go into it thinking of it as a date, it was just like a hangout so I had no expectations. We went, saw the movie, and I left thinking maybe there was a mutual attraction. There was a little playful hand holding involved, we chatted for a good hour after, and he hugged me before we parted. 

We don’t really text outside of work which isn’t really a big deal to me considering I see him all the time at work. The next time I see him, we schedule another movie hangout. This time, we just kind of sat and ate, minimal interaction, a little light chatting after and a hug but it was nothing like the first hangout. 

Now I’m thinking that maybe I just misinterpreted the vibes on the first hangout and he’s not that into me. He’s leaving for another job soon so I’m worried that this is kind of it and I’m never going to see him again. One of my friends who’ve I’ve confided all of this to suggested that maybe he’s just waiting to leave this job so it’s not weird when we work together. I think of this as a possibility, considering I personally think that it’s weird working with your S/O. But it could also be that he’s juuust not that into me. I dunno if I should tell him how I feel before he leaves or if I just just let it be? ",30Oct2018,1
138,"Basically a ‘friend’ thinks I like her. This is the only reason I can guess for why she’s acting like this. There was a party tonight at her mates house and she told me it was just her mates going and not to come. I found out loads of people ended up showing up including all my mates and messaged her about it and she wouldn’t tell me why she told me not to come so I just said ‘fuck off we’re not speaking anymore’. I messaged her again saying ‘are you going to tell me why you didn’t want me there or are we just gonna stay mad at each other’. She kept just sending me snaps of all my mates at this party so I asked for the address and she blocked me and told all her mates not to give me the address. Now she’s telling everyone at the party she’s scared of me for some reason. I really don’t know what I’ve done but now everyone there is going to think I’m a rapist and literally everyone’s there, including one of her best mates who I wanted to start talking to. What am I actually meant to do here? If I lose my chance of talking to pretty much every girl I know and all my mates start thinking there’s something wrong with me because of this I’ll probably end up killing myself. ",30Oct2018,1

141,Hello! So I can't talk about things I'm going through without it feeling like I'm whining or making it a bigger deal than it actually is. I also want to know if talking about things really helps and how it does. Also I'm currently in high school where we have access to guidance counselors and to just get straight to the point: can they report on alcoholic parents?

They always seem perfectly happy to talk to me, or hang out with me, or whatever, but if I never initiated it, I would never talk to or see most of them. This is true for all of my friends.

146,"I work as a bouncer in Canada. Last week, I used some strong language against a patron who was pissing me off. I used no physical force or anything and pretty much followed procedure while directing two other bouncers to evict the person. One of the bouncers ended up shoving him vilonetly onto the street after the patron put his hands around his neck. 

Now my shitty luck, the patron was a rich lawyer who threaten to sue us (he doesn't have a case since he entered the club after closing and there are camera footage of him resisting eviction and putting his hand on the other bouncer). He happens to be friends with the manager of the club. 

My question is, if I quit and he does sue, will I be covered by the lawyer of our current Nightclub since I was employed with them at the time of incident or will I have to hire my own lawyer in case I get dragged into it. ",30Oct2018,1

Like I've loved her for like I've said.. 5yrs.. and some stuff got hard with parents and we split. I stayed faithful to her bc.. I love her, I didn't want anyone else. She had another relationship that lasted about 9 months(it ended in August). Through that relationship we've come back and been what seemed to be happy and Everytime we started to get comfortable, it seems like she back pedals putting us at square one again.

I just recently learned that she thinks I'm controlling, possessive, and over barring. I don't like her friends, they do that stuff, and I love this girl a lot. I just want the best for her, I know now that I need to change this possessive controlling shit. And I'd like some suggestions. She's my best friend and she feels like she can't talk to me anymore.

148,"When I was in middle school, I was the best player on my team. Granted, our team was not good and we lost the majority of our games, but I was a very promising player. 

My freshmen year, I was on the C team. Halfway through the season, I worked my way up to the starting PG spot for Junior Varsity. However, I then realized that I wasn’t as good of a player as I thought. I lost the ball a lot and wasn’t much of an asset. 

I didn’t go out for basketball the next year, not only because I wasn’t that great of a player, but because I didn’t have as much fun playing it and it was really stressful at the time. 

Now, I’m a senior and part of me wants to play again, just because it’s my senior year. My friend wants me to play, but I’m not entirely sure I want to.  The team this year isn’t going to be very good, so I would just be doing it for fun. 

I’ll make a pros and cons list on why I want to/don’t want to play. 

Pros:
It’s my last year of high school. 
I used to love playing, and now that I am able to cope with a busier schedule, I think I could handle it  
It seems fun to be on a court with a gym full of people watching. 
There’s a new coach this year who seems pretty cool. 
Basketball used to be really fun for me. 
Since I’d be starting, I would be more well known. 
It has more publicity than soccer, which is currently my main sport. 



Cons:
I won’t be able to have a job. 
I won’t be able to devote my focus to soccer (which I hope to play at the college level). 
There’s practice everyday. 
I don’t have that many friends on the team. 
I’m not sure if I’ll be happy if I join. 
I don’t know how good I will be (after shooting hoops a few times, I realized it’s pretty fun but I’m very very rusty. Also, my strengths as a player were my shooting and ball handling skills, which have diminished greatly). 

I guess this post was partially for me to write out my thought, but I could really use some general advice if anyone has any.

149,"Backstory: almost exactly a year ago, my girlfriend left me. We had been together for nearly 2 years and actually lived together basically the whole time. We absolutely rushed the moving in together part, but at the time it made sense and I think we adapted fairly well.  Anyhow, we were deeply in love for the first year, easily. But towards the end, the last 2 or 3 months maybe, she started getting distant, talking about wanting to move back in with her mom (to take care of her, even though she is only about 55 and in relatively good health for her age). Never admits to wanting to break up, despite me asking her numerous times. Just moving out. Obviously I'm feeling pretty shitty. At this time I am in the first semester of a very difficult and laborious program at college, so I do as best I can to try and talk about our relationship in addition to giving as much love and affection as I could find the time for.
  
Anyhow she moves out and when she gets back to her hometown I text her about how I'm going to miss her and to make sure to chat as much as possible. This is when she decides to break up with me through text message. Pretty shitty but whatever. I was basically expecting it at this point. She never really gives a solid reason. Just doesn't love me anymore (she absolutely did at one point, this isn't just a wishful memory or something).   
  
So I begin the healing process of having your first love that you wanted to marry just get bored and leave. But considering all this happened right before finals, I essentially flunk out of school.  
  
 It's about a week before Christmas at this point when she messages me asking if she can pick up a few things she left. Of course, sure, come on by. Well, she needs to use the bathroom too. Sure no problem. Then she sits down and we talk a bit to kinda catch up, I guess. Then I make one of the biggest mistakes in my life (in my opinion, and in retrospect) I ask her if she wants to have some drinks.   
  
Drinks are had, she gets emotional, she pounces on me, and we end up having sex for hours, (the rest of the night) and then more sex the next morning. With as much or even more passion than we ever had before.   
  
At this point we continue to go our separate ways. But after this encounter, I just can't shake the thought that we can end up back together. I was really starting to accept that she was gone before that night in mid-December. I am at the lowest point in my entire life. Girlfriend gone, can't afford the house we were renting and so moving back in with my parents, and flunked out of school. There was a few drunken nights that December where I almost walked a few blocks away to the train bridge, where my plan was to aim for the rocks below. Gladly I did not.   
  
But we keep in touch, and honestly there was definitely some leading-on on her part. Whether she did it on purpose doesn't matter, I guess. I do my best to move on, date a few people who turned out to be not so great in the girlfriend department.   
  
Cut to last Friday. I'm back in my program at college, getting terrific marks in the 3 classes that I had to retake, working out almost every day. Best shape of my life. But I'm feeling stessed and lonely. So what do I do but text my ex. We chat about it, I open up a bit, and it leaves me feeling much better. Well the next morning (Friday), I wake up to a text she sent: ""I'm in a relationship and he isn't comfortable with me talking to you."" And like that she completely blocks me from every social media platform we both have.   
  
Since then, I just can't get her and her new boyfriend out of my head. I'll be half asleep, then the thought ""omg I wonder if she's in his bed right now"" pops in. Then I'm awake. And it's midterms. Very busy week. But I'm sitting in lecture, all I can think about is her and this guy. I try to do homework. Same thing.  
  
Sorry for the wall of text. I really needed to get this out. I am asking for advice with 2 things:   
1) I want her out of my head. I have important things to focus on. I really don't care if I never see or talk to her again, she was never all that great to me, looking back. Except for that honeymoon period that exists in most relationships it seems.      
  
2) how do I deal with the loneliness? I don't really have the time to start a new relationship, plus living with my parents at 27 makes finding someone that I'm interested in a lot more difficult anyhow.   
  
I just want to put my head down and focus on my college program. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated!!

151,"I used to be best friends with my ex, I had no romantic feelings for him as we had broken up years ago, I no longer felt attracted to him when we met in person the last times I saw him and I identified with him more as a friend than an ex since so much time had gone by. 


He died in May, and I still think about him every single day, multiple times a day. I look at his Facebook page every day and his mom writes to him all the time and it is just so sad. I really miss him but I want to stop having these depressing thoughts about him. He was the first major death/person I was closest to that has died so far in my life. He was and probably will forever be the closest friend I will ever have, the friend I have had the longest (I met him in 2008 but we became very close in 2010, dated from 2011-2014, remained friends until the very end) His wake was the first one I ever attended and I feel uneasy thinking about seeing his body in the casket. 


How can I make these thoughts stop. This has put a huge damper on my life ever since he died. We talked nearly every day for many years, and it has been hard to adjust to never being able to talk to him ever again. He was the only person besides my dad who regularly called and texted me. He was pretty much the only reason I used Facebook, since we mostly messaged each other on there and while I have other FB friends I never really talk to any of them. I haven’t posted on FB since I wrote a five paragraph status dedicated to him. 


When I first found out he died I was extremely shocked and upset, but I have been feeling WORSE about it than the day I found out. I read somewhere was something like “The worst part isn’t finding out that they died. The worst part is that they stay dead” and that resonates with me so much. :(


I just want to stop having these haunting thoughts. My last straw was that two nights ago I had a dream the he was still alive and we were hanging out but then in the dream I realized this isn’t real since he has been dead for months and I woke up feeling very upset. ",30Oct2018,1
152,"Throwaway account. I’ve been at my new job for a few months and I really don’t want to rock the boat.

I had an experience tonight that made me very uncomfortable. My office is on the lower level along with the cubes of my direct reports. My boss and other execs sit on another floor. Moving my office is not possible.

My employees all leave at 5pm on the dot. I typically need to stay until 6pm or so, and my boss generally calls me up until 5:30 or so (although I could, in theory, leave at 5 with my employees and finish work from home). 

One of my peers in middle management came down to tell me something at around 5:20. It should also be noted that my boss is on vacation this week and he knows this. He said he noticed I stay late so he thought He’d come down to tell me. I said great, thanks for the info. It could have been an email but whatever, it was nice of him to come down. He should have taken off, but he didn’t. He just stood in my office watching me. I tried to do other things to signal him to leave, like type an email etc but he continued to stand there. I decided to pack up my stuff and get going. He followed me out of my office and watched while I cleaned the coffee pot, cleaned out the fridge, etc. It was only until I walked  outside to the parking lot and he went to the bathroom instead that we parted ways.

Is this really weird or am I reading too much into this? What should I do? I worry as I’m in a totally secluded part of the building- by myself- for approx 45 min-1 hour each day. There is NO one down there with me. 

What should I do? Am I reading too much into this? We are a small company so I fear saying something to HR, especially since this person has a good relationship with my bosses boss. If you couldn’t tell from this post I am a young woman, he’s probably mid 50s older gentleman. ",30Oct2018,1

I have really bad anxiety, am depressed,  and in the process of looking for medication.  im just going through a shit time really, its affecting my mood everyday, and taking a toll on our relationship. 

Me and him are super close and have an open-phone policy kinda? It’s not really a policy, we just are fine using each other’s laptops and phones.

We watch alot of youtube shit but dont have youtube history enabled, so I opened the history to try and find a video we were watching yesterday morning.  

at 7:44 yesterday, he was looking up “im scared if i break up with her she will kill herself”. the next things were articles about how to break up with someone who is suicidal. 

this was right after we fought yesterday, we’ve been having a fight every other day now, mainly due to my irrational thoughts and anxieties, and how they affect my mood (getting closed off, not communicating, being rude).  i went for a bit yesterday to clear my head after the fight, but when i came back, he apologized, repeated that he was feeling sad, but i managed to get him smiling, and i thought i cheered him up? we were back to normal happy for the rest of the night. 

 ALL of today has been wonderful. made breakfast together, and he was actually really attentive to what makes me anxious, and helped me figure out how to work through it? which he hasnt been doing lately. ive been so happy all day, and i thought we was too. 

but now i cant get that out of my head. i dont know whether to bring it up. i dont know how to forget about it. i dont want to breakup up with him, we’ve been together for 2 years, and we’re eachothers best friend. he’s my best friend. it really would fucking kill me but!!! he has the right to whatever he wants to do.

159,"I apologize in advance for my unorganized thoughts or ideas. So currently I am a 19 year old male attending community college and I'm studying computer science. I  live with parents and don't have a job.  I have switched majors a couple of times from chemical engineering to mechanical engineering and now I'm at computer science. Anyway, I have completed the majority of the requirements necessary to transfer as an engineer major but now  I am not competitive as a computer science major since i have only taken one computer science in the time that i have been in college. This means that i will most likely have to stay another year and complete additional requirements to make my profile competitive for the schools that I want to apply to. The thing is i'm not so confident in what i want to major in so i am considering taking a break from school. The one thing that has remained constant throughout most of my time high school and in college has been my interest in learning how to draw and anything related to art. So what I plan to do if i take a break is get a job and learn how to draw on my off time from work. Currently I am not sure what i where I would work. All in all, I have no idea what to do.

160,"I recently found an Instagram account (not telling you, in case someone I know finds this) of a teacher at my school. Problem is, its not his actual Instagram account, nor does he have Instagram. He has stated in the past that he does not like having pictures of him used without his permission (example - someone tried to edit a picture of him through Photoshop and the teacher forced him to delete the file.) The Instagram account is relatively small, with less than 100 followers. Some of the photos of the teacher are probably taken without his knowledge. I get that the account is meant to be a joke but I still feel like its wrong.

I think the people running the page are friends of mine, and I don't want to be an asshole to them. Should I talk to the account (probably anonymous), tell the teacher who has had pictures of him put on the account (again, probably anonymously) or let it slide?",30Oct2018,1

164,"Obligatory apologies for mobile formatting, this is gonna be a long one. TL;DR at the end.

Ok so I barely even know where to start so I'll just throw it down as it comes, bare with me please...

Background, I(21F) live with single mum(45F) and in a long distance relationship with SO(34M). Mum has her own small business so doesn't make much herself, and as yet I haven't got a job(and not for lack of trying) so I get bare minimum to live off from GOV, so our current monetary arrangement is that she pays the bills and rent from her pay and 3/4 of my pay goes to her for groceries.

I want to visit my SO of 1 year for preferably our anniversary or maybe Christmas/ his birthday. For the most part I can't discuss this with mum as she shuts down and won't hear it. We fight. A lot. And about a lot of things, but this is probably the most important issue I NEED to discuss with her, but she won't hear it.

Part of this fighting is she is worried about me going so far away and to a whole other country and such, which I understand, she's my mum, she's supposed to worry. But she should also respect that I am an adult and it IS ultimately my decision and to support me with it.

The other part is money and a big cause of frustration for us. She says without my money she won't be able to support herself and she'd have to find another place and get rid of my animals. As much as I understand that she needs me, I would likely only be gone a month, and what she refuses to listen to is that I'm not an idiot and will ONLY go if I have enough to keep sending her money and enough to do so for at least 2 months afterwards(on top of required travel money).

I love my SO and he is adamant that he will move to be with me, though I have told him I wouldn't mind moving to him if he would prefer that. I feel the only way to go visit him is to save up what I can and just not tell mum till I leave. (Making sure I have enough saved for long term support)

What make me so angry, hurt and most of all, guilty, is that I feel I CAN'T move out on my own/with SO without basically abandoning my mum and leaving her without means to support herself. I feel trapped and I hate it, and I feel so guilty for wanting to leave and maybe even resenting her a little for making me feel so guilty... But I DON'T want to live with her forever, I never have. As a young child(7+) I would tell her that once I hit 18 I would move out. But I couldn't because money. 

What should I do? What CAN I do?! I hate feeling so trapped and helpless, so guilty.... I want to start my own family with SO(we discuss it all the time) but I can't do that while still there. It stresses me out and gives me massive amounts of anxiety being there, but I can't leave...

TL;DR: lives with mum and provides support money for basic needs like food, can't travel to other countries for SO without massive arguments about no support and feels guilty about wanting to leave and start family with SO because of abandonment guilt...",30Oct2018,1

169,"Okay so long story short, I don’t make much money, I’m 21 years old and I live on welfare. My boyfriend and I are currently LDR, and he’s well aware of my financial status. However, I decided to buy him an online game for his birthday present, he’s been wanting it for a very very long time so I thought it’d be a great gift. I gave him my card details and told him to buy it for himself, he rejected multiple times at first, but I insisted. He was really happy and all went well. Fast forward a couple days or hours I don’t remember, and I let him use the card again for a 5$ virtual item. I tell him that it’s okay he can use it whenever he wants, thinking that all the things he would buy would be in this range, and also assuming that he wouldn’t use it as much, as he’s aware of how I’m dealing with finances.  Fast forward 10 months, and I live on ramen because of his spending, and some nights I go to bed hungry so I can afford his spending. I couldn’t go visit him because of all the money he wasted on multiple online games, he’s spent at least 4K. In the beginning of each month, he takes hundreds and I’m left with little to no money to last me the rest of the month. I know he’s not with me for money because he’s done so much for me, he’s just caught up in the “you can use it whenever you want” moment. 

 Last couple months I’ve been preparing for the winter and buying some winter gear, including clothes, shoes etc etc.. So I’ve been spending a lot on myself, and he’s left with barely anything, so he’s been getting a little effy about it. I told him I’d try my best to save for him and he just told me not to say anything because he didn’t want to be disappointed. I feel terrible for spending the money on myself now, but I also am aware of all the things I could’ve bought that would’ve benefited me, one of them being a bed, instead of wasting thousands on virtual items. I’ve spoke to him a lot and cried to him about my financial status, multiple times, but his spending doesn’t change.

170,"Hi! I made a throwaway just for this, and I’m really sorry to be bugging everyone with this. I’m just really desperate right now. 
Background: I’m going to start by saying everyone in my family is flawed and I, an 18 yr old female, am no exception. My parents are immigrants, struggling to make ends meet, and I have three impressionable younger siblings. The six of us live in a tiny little apartment with only two rooms, my uncle makes seven. This is relevant, it gives context to the whole mess that comes next. 
I’m so sorry for this long thing. 
Tl;dr is at the bottom
One of my earlier memories include my mother slapping me incredibly hard when I was 5 and I spilled milk while pouring it, and her wielding a knife against me when I didn’t understand what she told me at 8. I have scars on my arm from where my father pulled me by the arm, and looking him in the eye is honestly the most terrifying thing I can do. If I missed a single word on a spelling test, my father would hit my head so hard until I felt dizzy, and make me write the word I misspelled a hundred times. He still hits my head. Last week, he slapped my head when I was eating a small bag of chips because I didn’t ask him. My parents said if no one loves fat people, and they would be disgusted with me if I became fat. My dad punches me, and he kicks me. Encounters get so violent, that I was scared he was going to unintentionally hurt my baby sister who happened to be walking near the area my father was hitting me. 
Today, he began yelling at me. And it was justified, I spent 40 minutes in the bathroom, I shouldn’t do that. I was just thinking about this chem test I have, and I was completely stressed out, and it was quiet. I calmed down, and when I came out, my father began to yell at me. Again, I think it’s justified. But then I respond “ok” to his statements. Why didn’t you apologize OP? Because my father would go on a rant about how apologizing is “bullshit”. So it’s safer if I keep it short. I began walking outside, and out of the blue, I smack against a wall, and my glasses fly off. I yelped, and said asshole. I do not think he’s an asshole. I only said that because I was surprised, in pain, and I couldn’t see anything. I shouldn’t have done that, and I didn’t meant it, and I regret it very much, because he then begins kicking me, and pulling my hair. My arm is still scratched, and it still hurts. My shoulders still have faint bruises from last week, when my father repeatedly whacked them with a sandal. 

And for those curious, I like to think I’m a good student. I graduated high school with honors, had a 4.0 GPA, and my major is chem. I don’t party, I don’t do drugs (yeah, I’m a pretty boring kid), and I spend most of my time at home. Right now, I’m taking over the 18 unit max at my CC, and I finished my GE’s. I’m a freshman, hoping to transfer in two years. My father wants me to get a job in less than three days. My counselor said with my workload, the last thing I should do is work. I told this to him, but he doesn’t believe me. 

My friend and her mom offered me a place to stay. It’s great, and I’d have my own room, and I’d finally be able to do homework in a quiet environment (I’d use the library, but my parents hate it when I’m not home). My rent would basically be me being a live in maid. I’d have to clean their house x amount of times, but it seems manageable. My grades are suffering because right now, I’m only allowed to use a computer for an hour (even though no one else really uses it). And I can’t sit for more than a little bit of time before something happens. Those problems would be fixed if I moved.
 My friend is really nice, the only problem is that her mom knows I’m a virgin, and made a snide remark about “prudes” and that those girls are highly entitled. And said that we’ll find someone who will fix that for me. But I’m not that (I really don’t care what people choose to do with their bodies, it’s theirs). That’s the only downside I see, I don’t know if I should be worried. Oh, and if I leave, I run the risk of ruining my relationship with my parents and family forever. They’re not bad people, and I don’t want to cut them out. But they might if I move, which can be disastrous, as I’m not financially independent. 
Guys, I’m tired. I want to be happy. I have panic attacks because I’m scared I will die a failure. And although it has been going on for a couple of months now, last week was the worst. It felt like I was dying. I couldn’t breathe, and I couldn’t think. My parents don’t believe in mental illnesses, and say if I ever decide to kill myself, I should go far away, and never come back, and they’d deny I was ever their daughter. I asked to go to therapy one time, because I’m pretty sure have some form of anxiety, they said I was tipos, and that it’s fake. They say if any of their kids would grow up to be gay, they’d disown them. All I can think about right now is how much I want to kill myself. Maybe that’s really weak and stupid. I’m just some college student who’s only job is to get perfect grades, but I can’t even do that. I want to succeed, and I have a feeling that I will academically be strong again if I move. But I do know that my parents will resent me heavily, even though I talked to them about it, and even though my father constantly says I ruin his life and make everyone miserable. My poor mother is just exhausted of us fighting. My siblings are scared. No one deserves this. And it’s probably all my fault, and I don’t know what to do. I just want to be happy and successful. 

Tl;dr: College person living in a small place with big family (and maybe abusive father) in small apartment can’t really succeed academically because everyone is yelling constantly. Opportunity to move out, but if the move out doesn’t work, I probably won’t have a family to go back to. 

Note: I’ve talked to a couple of people (including some adults) about this, and they said it could be good. But Reddit now knows a better depiction of scenario. Please, any logical input you have to this is necessary. I’m not in a logical place to think right now. ",30Oct2018,1
171,"so I have one roommate and five suitmates, three of them are chill. theres two who always bring friends over and they leave a complete mess in the living room and kitchen. no respect, the dishes are never done, they throw hella trash in the recycling bin and its so filled up garbage falls on the floor. always leave dirty plates and garbage around on tables. I use to clean and pick after them but ive given up and the place is a disaster which gets annoying I tried to talk to them about it but they brushed it off and I am the confrontational type but theres no point of arguing about it at this point. also my roommate and I are having a bit of issues you can say. I smoke medical marijuana and obviously have it in the dorm, at first she said its okay if its there as long as she ""doesnt know"" so tht she's no liable. but one time I came back after smoking outside and I smelled like medical marijuana and she flipped her shit and started yelling at me. I just apologized and said I wouldn't do it again and that was that because theres no point of arguing. then I went home for the weekend and bought some more medical marijuana and just hid it where I always do so that my roommates isn't liable. I told my other suitmate that I bought medical marijuana. then my suitmate told my roommate and my roommate just flipped her shit again threatening a room change and telling the RA. I just told her ill get back to her on tht lmao. but also why would my suitmate tell my roommate that? its non of her business and I feel like there was an alternative motive to telling her. lots of background info but I need advice about whether I should have a roommate change, meaning I get all completely new roomates? im not that close to my roommate anyways and half of the other girls make the suit unbearable to live in bc of the mess. but im scared to switch bc what if I get worse roommates. what do you think?",30Oct2018,1

173,"I have been talking to this girl for a few weeks. We met at a gathering and basically just chat on messenger.

I get a lot of mixed signals from her. I'm usually the one to initiate contact. When we talk, she seems interested in what I have to say and asks me questions about myself. We laugh and have some dovetailing interests. She likes my Facebook posts, etc.

One time she asked me if I had any kids or wanted kids. I thought that was a pretty big question. She sort of disappeared before I could ask her because she relapsed and went to detox.

I was worried for the whole week and she messaged me when she got back. In my messages while she was gone I told her I would step back and let her do her thing, because I felt like maybe I was messaging her too much.

She went out of her way to tell me I don't annoy her and that I'm a very kind person.

So sometimes we'll talk later at night before bed and wish each other a good day.

One time she sent me a music video link and it made me feel like she was thinking of me.

In person she has held eye contact before and her feet were often pointed in my direction.

But sometimes she takes forever to respond to messages. And I feel like maybe I'm a bit more emotionally invested, but I still see and feel this glimmer of hope in our chemistry.

So now I am just sort of going back to taking a step back, because I wouldn't mind if she reached out once in awhile.

And I wonder if her issues with addiction and where she is in life may play a part.

I don't want to rush anybody and I try not to have expectations, but I don't want to get hurt either, nor do I want to miss out on a potentially good friendship or something more in the future.

So right now I am just sort of making myself available. She knows I'm here. She has my number too. My friend told me I just need to be patient and let her decide what she wants.

What do you think?",30Oct2018,1
174,"As you can tell from the title, I need surgery but I’m starting a new job so I don’t know when to schedule the surgery. 

The surgery is for my left eye. I have pterygium (growth on the eye) that will eventually cover my pupil, so I’m going ahead and getting it removed before it starts affecting my vision.

The job is just being a baker at Panera. My first day is in a week. I know it’s nothing special, but I’m a college student and it’ll help get some money in my pocket. 

The problem is I don’t want to request days off so early into starting a new job. I’m afraid it’ll rub my manager off the wrong way. The problem is my dads on my ass about getting the surgery ASAP. I voiced my concerns about requesting days off so early, but he doesn’t really see the problem. 

The earliest I could get my surgery done is Nov. 21, which would put me in around working there for 3 weeks. I thinking about getting it done early December so at least I have a couple weeks under my belt before I start asking for days off.

After the surgery, my eyes will be very red for at the very least a week or so. I’d like to request a week off so my co workers don’t look see my eye so fucked up. But I’d be willing to cut it down to 4 days, as it seems more manageable for the manager to accept. 

So basically, I need surgery, but I’m starting a new job and I don’t want to seem demanding asking for days off so early into my new job. Along with that there’s pressure from my dad to get the surgery done ASAP. 

What should i do? 
Any personal experiences or insight?

178,"So this is going to be a long first post. 

I moved states for college and was unable to live in the dorms due to having a dog, so I ended up lucking out at a condo 6 minutes away from my college that was in my price range AND allowed dogs. This girl had a condo but her roommate had to move out. It was perfect all around. We signed a year long lease that started August 1st. 

In the beginning there were some issues, but I was pretty happy overall. However I really disliked how there was no communication between us about anything. I never knew when she was throwing parties or having people spend the night. As a neat freak, the fact she has never once taken out the trash or unloaded the dishwasher bothered me immensely. But I didn't want to mention it since I had *just* moved in and they weren't THAT bad. Or so I thought... 

Just to paint you a picture of her personality, she ""forgot"" to pay our electric bill (which I paid her my half of) and I had to fix it because she flat out wouldn't call the energy company. After hours of her not picking up the phone/not texting back, I was able to get the last 4 digits of her SSN and account # to have anyone talk to me about the account. She wasn't home when this happened so there was no urgency to fix this, after all... it doesn't affect her. Why should she care? :| 

Notice a red flag, anyone? Or, ***many*** red flags? 

Early September she left the condo and didn't come back till 2 weeks ago. Again, there's no communication so I had no idea when was coming back. A few days after she came back, her new boyfriend came over. He's extremely antisocial with me, didn't even introduce himself to me which was weird. 

I've told her in the past I'm fine with friends coming over and spending one or two nights. Emphasis on **one** or **two** nights. Well he's been here a week and a half now, and moved in a ton of stuff. So obviously it was time for me to figure out what the deal is. I texted her asking if there's a time later we could, in person, discuss her boyfriend being here all the time. I admit, It wasn't the best idea to mention the topic of the discussion via text, since she latched onto it and the conversation happened over text - I wasn't going to be home for another 3 1/2 hours. She got beyond defensive and extremely rude. I made sure to not argue, I was simply trying to fix something that bothered me in a very polite manor. After all, I signed a lease with just her. And we pay rent, we pay utilities and internet, he doesn't. Some of the texts I received were ""Don't go and talk to \[our landlord\] be a big girl and handle this on your own."" Which to be fair, I honestly don't want to get anyone else involved unless necessary. After all, she is violating the lease that states no overnight guests for more than 7 days in a calendar month. But I wanted to resolve the issue ourselves as two civilized adults with a legal contract. I constantly told her I'm *not* trying to start anything between us. The last thing I want is beef with a year long roommate.

I then tell her I'm mentioning this because it bothers me, she goes on to tell me ""well that's stupid to bring up."" And goes on to say ""I can have my boyfriend over whenever I want. You do not control me. But I sure as hell will call \[our landlord\] and move the fuck out."" And it goes on and on with a similar tone - very childish for being in her 20's. 

While I hope I'm wrong, I strongly believe she won't be calling the landlord and won't be moving out. Just an empty threat. However, it's apparent we cannot live together for a multitude of reasons. Not just because she moved a guy in without mentioning any of it, but also because of how poorly she handled the situation. She even told me I wasn't a good fit for her as a roommate - as if I'm here to be best friends. 

Moving out for me is much more difficult than for her. She doesn't have a job or go to class (despite being enrolled as a full time student in a private college,) her parents give her absurds amount of money and don't care that she could live wherever. I don't receive things on a silver platter so it's more difficult financially. The town we live in is very expensive, and so are the towns around us. Not to mention its damn near impossible to find a place in general, let alone within my budget, that allows a small dog, and not over an hour away especially due to heavy weather conditions in the winter. I would have trouble finding another place like this with everything I require - minus the roommate, of course. 

I'm not sure how to handle the situation. Like I mentioned, I don't want to involve the landlord unless necessary however I think I have to. How would I approach this with my landlord? Do I mention the fact she violated the lease? Is there anything else I should try to do before contacting the landlord? I'm desperate - I cannot live like this. Any and all advice is appreciated!

I didn’t finish college because of massive depression about my mother’s health, the divorce, and coming to terms with how my life is going to play out with all of these components.

I more or less have no control over the fact I’ll be working to pay off credit card debt and provide for us until she passes away (I in no way blame her she was the perfect mother and none of this is her fault).

Those of you in similar situations, how did you find happiness with what little you’re able to do with your life? How did you deal with dating and relationships while having an adult dependent? How did you not go into massive debt as a young person making a little more than minimum wage and making less then what your bills are each month?

I’m having so much trouble knowing I’ll never be able to pursue my dreams and live a full life. I’ve accepted it but sometimes I almost want to just give up. 

Any and all advice is wanted and appreciated, thank you.",30Oct2018,1
183,"Hello, thank you for clicking on my post throughout your busy day! I don't expect anyone really to post on this, it's truly for catharsis. So here it goes: I have been dating for a while now, being 20 years-old at the moment, so about six years. In all of my relationships, I have cheated on my partners. When I say cheating, I don't mean sexual intercourse— all it has to be is some thought or liking to the person with whom I am not in a relationship. That being said, most of the ""cheating"" in this case is similar to the giddy feelings one experiences when first meeting a person and they hit it off. So much so that they cannot stop thinking about the other person. Not all of my experiences of breaking commitment has fallen in these lines. I've also been in a toxic relationship and was seeing another person, talking to them quite often and flirtatiously as a potential partner, as I tried breaking up with the other person but wasn't assertive enough to say no when they told me we could work it out.

There are four relationships I've been in: (1) I cheated on the first boyfriend by letting others take advantage of me in the way of rubbing my thighs during class (I was too shy and concerned of appearing badly to tell the person no. They were toxic as well of course) and kiss me on the cheek before I got on the bus; (2) I cheated on the second by also talking to another person, whom I had quite a bit more compatibility with in that relationship that shouldn't have been, and also cheated with someone by hanging out with them a lot and they eventually became my third boyfriend; (3) I cheated on the one I cheated with with my present boyfriend, this being the relationship I mentioned earlier as toxic and unrelenting in his clinging; and (4) my present relationship, who knows I was dating someone else at the time of our flirtatious conversation. Since then, I have kissed a friend during a time when I was very unhappy with him (he didn't seem to care or be listening to me) and now am in a simliar situation. Going back a few months, I kissed this person on the cheek to reassure them that everything would be okay. This was akin to the psychological development of a ""rescue fantasy"", where the friend in question was experiencing quite the depression. I told my boyfriend that night, crying and saying that I didn't deserve to be alive. We worked through it, but he has been suspicious ever since. I don't blame him, but there is little evidence compared to last time to corroborate his case, which seems driven mainly by irrational speculation rather than an observation of signs.

The person that I am currently thinking about now is one that I have recently just started talking to more often and lately. We didn't really talk before, but decided it would be interesting to meet each other in person. We met online through a Discord server, and he moved close to me for work basically. So, we met in person and I had a feeling that the same thing was going to happen again. And I was right. I really like talking to him as he's a wonderful person who truly listens. We share commonality in most things, but to be honest I don't know if I would ever seriously pursue a relationship with him if I was single. He seems to want different things than I do, put simply. Even then, I am fantasizing about him day and night. I am depressed most of the time now and he is how I get my high. I miss him when going through withdrawal like I have today. We spent the day at an amusement park this weekend, ending the night by just talking in his car and listening to his music for four hours before he drove me home. I really want to kiss him, and have imagined myself as his girlfriend. In case you are wondering, I don't think he likes me. I'm not sure of course but since we met through my boyfriend he likely knows to not do anything. He's very cautious as well, and quite taciturn of a personality. I hate it yet receive so much happiness from this fantasy that I don't know if I can trust myself anymore.

As my present boyfriend feels suspicious about this only because he's a member of the opposite sex and we've been talking ""a lot"" (a few times every day, only when we have something to talk about or clarify), my boyfriend has requested screenshots taken of all our messages in every form possible: Discord, text, and Twitch messages combined. The other person doesn't know about any of this and luckily hasn't divulged into personal details that I couldn't show anyone else. As I said, he's very shy and quiet. Since we have started talking, my boyfriend has been moody every day, always asking what I am doing or who I am talking to. He sends me articles stating the same thing, that in order to gain his trust back we need full disclosure. When I told him about the person I was dating when I first started talking to him, my boyfriend that is, I was completely fine with it. Now I feel suffocated. I feel like I can't think or do anything without him getting mad anymore, and I just want to go somewhere and leave. I can't do anything without his surveillance it feels like. He feels bad for enforcing such control in a way, and says it's truly just to know if anything is going on. I believe him. He has been a wonderful partner from the beginning, and unlike myself is monogamous beyond words. I don't understand how he can be, but am jealous that he doesn't feel this way.

Does anyone know why I have such a history of cheating? Is it something that can be addressed in cognitive therapy or anything else? Something to do with my childhood? Cognitive structure? I don't know anymore, but I feel like whomever I touch, I will always hurt them if I continue to feel this way. I hate myself for doing this. I hate myself for causing my boyfriend suspicion. I hate myself for coming off as flirtatious and perhaps causing him to feel something when he shouldn't have. I want to apologize to both of them but I feel like I can't tell anyone without something going wrong. I want to get better, but I just don't know how.",30Oct2018,1
184,"Hey guys I need some advice, so I was work as a graveyard receptionist at a gym and meet all sorts of people coming in and out of the gym. But one day I just started my shift and this attractive, kind, girl comes out and starts striking up a conversation with me. So I politely indulged her and she started asking my personal questions about my family background, goals, and what field of work I wanted to study at my post secondary institution. She seemed really interested in what I had to say, and then we exchanged phone info. She asked to keep the conversation we were having for another day for coffee. I was skeptical, and curious at the same time so I agreed. To make it long story short I met her and she spent an hour talking about higher education, helping families financially, and mentor-ship. I instantly knew it was some sort of pyramid scheme. So I made up a lie and left quickly. Blocked her number. My question is. Should I tell my boss about the encounter?

186,"I'm not depressed. I don't feel sad or cry. Not to say that I haven't in the past, I certainly have. 
As I've gotten older (I'm 30 now) I get really annoyed with anyone else's presence, even my awesomely loving parents who have given me a privileged life. Even my girlfriend or my closest friends. I do not have the energy or patience to become involved in forming new connections with anyone. The only kind of person I enjoy the company of are strangers I know I'll never see again. If I spend any longer than a day with anyone I feel like I'm going to explode.
Working life is mundane and just simply boring to me. I'm tired of hearing about in-house politics, other people's dramas and relationships. I hate working for money. No job I have ever had has bought me any kind of happiness or sense of contentment or belonging. I just don't care. 
I'm also at university and my grades are just fine. My degree is one that interests me but I just don't care whether I see it through or not.
I'm building a house. That should excite me greatly but I know I wouldn't feel a sense of loss or any anger if it burnt down overnight. 
Nothing in life, and I do mean nothing, brings me any joy. I get bored easily. I lose interest in everything quickly. I don't enjoy prolonged engagement with anyone. I'm not depressed or suicidal though, I suppose it's difficult to explain but I'm trying here.
I've often thought of liquidating all my assets, throwing my phone off a cliff and buying a house bus and just drivimy far away, disregarding everyone and everything (despite their love for me) and starting again. Somewhere very quiet.

How do I know if the bullets have powder in them or not? They're heavy and don't seem fake in any way, but again, I'm not exactly an expert. Is there a way to check?

206,"My dear friend died in a hit and run in August. She was the most beautiful, one of a kind, intriguing, and bright person I have ever known. The police are now seeking tips and I desperately want new eyes on this case.. The media has done little to nothing, while a case a few counties over (involving 2 younger girls who posted a snapchat with possible suspect) has had nationwide attention. It is so unfair that because there was a photo of a POSSIBLE suspect, these girls were a few years younger, and that they were murdered in cold blood, that their case has had attention. I feel for them and their families, I truly do. However I do believe that this case deserves attention aswell. My frustration is growing with our local police department, as they have gotten nowhere. They know the color of the vehicle and the possible build of the vehicle. They didn't do more publicly than make one post on Facebook initially. We are left wondering, did the even survey nearby body shops? Meanwhile there was a fatal hit and run a few weeks ago, involving two vehicles (rather than pedestrian walking and being hit) that had a state wide search. Because it was on a highway. And there were PHOTOS. This girl's poor mother has now lost both of her only children at the age of 19, within a year and a half of eachother. I live in a relatively ""country"" area, and I can't help but feel that the police don't have the resources to solve this on their own (such as cameras to solve the case for them). I also feel jaded that the earlier mentioned murder had the fbi and other law enforcement brought in for a year to try and solve their case seemingly because it was cold blood murder with a photo of possible suspect and they were minors- instead of a possibly accidental hit and run of a small woman who was of age. I just don't understand how someone could hit a 4'11"", 110 lb girl on a push scooter- and just leave her there. I want to believe it was an accident, I want to believe the driver wasn't a bad person. However, for all they knew, they had just hit a child. And left her there.. alone.. It is uncomprehensible. This post really was meant to look for a sub to share the article, which is highly important to me, but as I said- advice on dealing with grief is clearly neccessary for me..

People at school do not like him, he had told me that. I asked why and he didn't know. Another day, he had told me had a bad day. I asked why of course. He told me, ""A girl was staring at me and I called her ugly and stupid. She cried. Now everyone hates me"" I was surprised and I asked why. No reason, he just didn't like the girl staring at him (you know how sometimes you stare off to the distance and might be staring at someone).

I hated living there towards the end and he'd make rude side comments at me. He'd mutter them so I couldn't really hear what he was saying. He would also make fun of my speech impediment, I sometimes don't pronounce words very easily and he'd mock that.

So whenever I'd get home from work, I'd go on my laptop, okay? No problem, but he made snide remarks saying ""she's already on her laptop"" even though he sits at the couch playing with his iPhone all day. I really hated living there.

He also would constantly joke about my race. It was funny the first two times, but it became so old and not funny anymore. When I would complain about his behavior towards me, his mother would be like ""You're picking on him, right?"" So I mostly stayed in my room all day only coming out to eat.   

Should I just block him? His mother might notice.",30Oct2018,1

223,"Sooo... About two years ago I started a masters degree at a university, I started it thinking I would finish it quick and without too much hassle, and it wasn't really something that I really wanted (my parents told me that I should do it now) , and it was more of a 'do it now because later you won't do it' thing. In the first year, I started a job, that wasn't really in the field (the degree is in automation engineering - job is programming) and I continued to go to some courses but mainly focused on the job. When I had to do my final exam, the last night before the exam, I had a problem at my project (it was a practical one) and it fried my circuits, so i had no way to finish it in time. The next chance to take the exam I missed because I was focusing on work (I like where I work and didn't want to disappoint). Right now my project is still not finished, I have no drive to finish it , but in the same time I don't really like the idea of just abandoning it. I was raised to try and finish anything that I start even if I don't like it or can't finish it (basically try until it works). In my country, the masters degree doesn't have that big of an advantage (a minor increase in salary). Every time that I missed the chance to do it, my parents were pretty disappointed, and were even a bit mad... Right now I don't know what I should do, I don't really want to do it and just concentrate on work and on things that I really like, but I know that my parents will de mad as hell, or just try to finish it, without any drive just for the sake of it...

Any criticism or advice that come my way brings me deep shame and sorrow. I feel that I'm not good enough for anything that I do.

If I answer something wrong and am corrected, I get discouraged and I feel that anything else I'll answer will be wrong too even if I know it's right. If I did something incorrectly and see someone else do it correctly, I get discouraged. Eventhough I've never done it before or in the process of learning. When I feel like someone could be judging me for my actions, I get discouraged from doing it. Even if it's something that ive done for a long time. Just thinking about how I'll look from others POV makes me very anxious and puts me into mini panic attacks. Anything that I think connects to my mistake triggers me and I constantly think about it and why did it like that and why didnt I do it another way. 

But prior to this, I've been in various environments that have been very criticism heavy, and I've never been one to put down criticism. I have always taken it as something educational and something that will help me grow.

231,"Last time my husbands brother and wife came to stay, he said that I had put on weight and then they both said in a rather creepy way ‘you will loose it won’t you’

I think they were disappointed that I had put on weight after getting married. I always thought it was rude to comment on a persons weight.

Anyway, they are visiting this week only for 4 hours thankfully. I am dreading them commenting on my weight again. I haven’t had the best year, lost two dogs, menopause is making me feel quite ill at times, husband has been out of work so money has been short and I am caring for my 85 year old mum full time so her health is declining. I have lost some weight but I am not skinny. Honestly, I feel like a piece of meat they are inspecting and not a human being.

I just want to say something back without being rude. 

Another thing his brother does is take loads of pictures, then uploads them to Facebook in record time. Pictures of people eating, people looking distinctly uncomfortable after being posed.  On one occasion, we were all taking the dogs for a walk and it was like the paparazzi had found us, you couldn’t walk five paces without him taking a picture. My husband had to ask him to stop. Hopefully his brother is more restrained on this occasion.

I think the photograph thing runs in the family, as his sister took numerous photos and uploaded them to Facebook with lightning speed. One particular occasion was on Christmas Day, I was stressed trying to cook dinner and she is snapping away. Well photos find themselves on Facebook and husbands ex wife likes one of me looking stressed trying to cook dinner (his sister is still friends with his husbands ex wife on Facebook)

I think people think I am odd, but I am quite a private person, I don’t change my profile picture often, upload pictures etc In fact I don’t really like Facebook, it causes problems. I would prefer to talk to someone.

At the moment, if I could I would book myself into a hotel just to have some peace and not have to see them, look after my mother or do anymore cooking or cleaning, had enough.",30Oct2018,1

On the first day, a couple of co-workers came up to me individually and introduced themselves, which was nice. What I didn’t expect is how each of them would tell me who they hate and like in the store. 

This is a strange experience for me because I wasn’t expecting some school like behavior to happen so quickly on my first day. Then another co-worker came up to me and asked if I wanted to buy Mollys (drug) which was super random to me.  

When my shift was over and it was closing time, the co-worker who wanted to sell me a drug begged for me to stay and help him organize the shirts in size order. I was nice enough to do it until he told me to organize his entire section whereas he left to who no knows where. I felt like he was making me do his responsibility for closing duty. So I stopped and left. 

The second day of work I came, there were new other employees that I haven’t met. They had an attitude towards me  and I felt like I couldn’t ask anyone a question without getting an annoyed look. Everyone in that store was just uncomfortable to be around so on the third day, i decided to quit. I couldn’t be honest with the manager even tho he seemed like he wanted me to stay. 

I didn’t want to tell him about how the workers came up to me telling me who they hated and liked and how I was offered drugs to buy etc I felt like a snitch if I told him the truth, so I made up a lie that convinced him enough.

my husband and i have been together for 13 years (married for 8) 

10 years ago his brother had a baby with a woman who turned on him. she burnt his clothes, killed his pet lizard, kicked him out and refused to let him see his child. not long after that, my husbands brother died from an overdose and the mother of his child cut us out of their lives. we would occasionally get random phone calls from her abusing us, name calling, relentless teasing about me not being able to concieve and accusing my fater in law of being a pedophile. we have had no communication with her at all in about 6 years. 

during this time me and my husband were able to concieve and have a child. we discussed letting his brothers ex know and i asked my husband not to because i didnt trust her and was worried what she might do if she found out. he agreed and that was the end of it.  

fast forward 3 years and my husband tells me tonight that he had a phone call from her at 1:30am last friday while he was on his way to work and he told her about our child and is basically arranging a time for us to all get together and play happy families.

am i right to feel a bit betrayed by this? i feel like my husband should have told me about it sooner and maybe discussed with me as to whether we felt it was the right time to let her know about our child.

237,"How to help sb with depression triggered by losing best friend? I mean I understand depression, i’ve had it myself most of my life, together with anxiety. Im much better now because of the amount of work i make to change it. Therefore i know things could help him since i had years of struggle and now im finally managing to be able to control it. 
Its only that because it’s triggered by grief, i dont want to come across as insensible. I dont want my efforts to reach, my ideas to be read as ‘ come on, its all in your head, move on’. He may be in deep sh*thole and question the purpose of living and im gonna tell him ‘here, read this book’, or tell him all the changes he needs to make. 
My intention is to not fix him, not to make him forget and feel like nothing ever happened. I just want him to feel bit better. I want to give him that gentle push not to move on but to try to go through it with least harm and suffering possible.

238,"Sorry this may be a long post, I'll include a tl;dr at the end. I just need to get everything off my chest.

My best friend and I- who have been friends for the past nine years- got very close this year. Like, very close. We spill our hearts out to each other and tell each other everything. We even went as each other's dates to our school proms (we go to different schools). If people didn't know any better, they'd say we were dating and many people DID believe that. Friends, family, you name it. I would tell people that wasn't the case but they would tell me that her and I have a clear attraction towards one another. 

Eventually, this became true on my end. After her prom, which was about two months ago, we went back to one of her friend's house. She was slightly buzzed, but she cuddled up beside me,  her head on my shoulder and her legs on mine and held my hand every now and then and had I one of our serious talks. I think that's when I realised I liked her A LOT. I just feel so secure and safe in her company, something I think I desperately need.

She doesn't reciprocate though. She always tells me about a huge infatuation she has on this person, how she made out with this person at a party and hasn't gotten them out of her mind since. I consoled her and gave her advice on the manner. 

But this is where my heart shatters... today she had sex with this person. And... I feel completely defeated. She's told me she would never start a relationship with this person- which I don't why since they both clearly 

Where do I go from here? How do I stay friends with this person after she broke my heart without even realising? Or am I not meant to be friends with her?  I don't want to cut communication though, because she is my best friend and we are emotionally dependent on one another. But at the same time, I don't want to be around her knowing we aren't together. I'm so sad and distraught, what do I do?

TLDR - Developed a crush on my best friend of nine years and she broke my heart. I don't want to cut her out of my life because I rely on her so much. What do I do?

253,"Hey guys...

  
So I 'm single and therefore talking to a few girls at the same time - I've been straightforward with all of them and explained I'm not looking for a relationship and for them to be aware that I will be talking to other girls.

  
Now, I might sound cocky, but girls find me attractive. I'm lean, I've got a good smile, nice proportions, a strong jawline, etc. I'm 18 years old, and reaching the prime of my physique. It's great. I think that's the reason why a lot of girls talk to me... After a while though, I always mess it up.

&amp;#x200B;

A few stories... So the first one is this girl I was talking to, she was so so nice. She messaged me amazingly, and honestly, she was really interested, giving me long paragraphs about stuff she loves doing, etc. At 12 yesterday she went into to work so I told her ""ok talk later xxx"", you know, simple, nice, not needy... At 9 pm I popped back up to her and asked her how work was, she gave me a horrible, off reply. So I thought, alright let's keep talking... I asked her why, and she told me people kept shouting at her. So I was like ""yeah I hate that, people love being horrible to others"" and then I said I've been lucky to never have a job because of my dad, which is true, I said it in a simple and nice manner, to sound as humble and grateful as possible, and she replies with ""Yeah xx"". I'm like... OK, let's try and spark a nicer conversation. So I tell her ""what makes you so passionate about dancing?"" and she replies ""everything about it"" and then I say ""what do you mean?"" and she removes me. She doesn't tell me anything else, just goes on to remove me on social media and I can't talk to her anymore. Like, seriously, what the fuck? What the fuck did I do wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

This other one happened a while ago, she was also sending me long paragraphs and stuff and telling me how she loved to drive and was learning, and we were flirting and it was great. Then I told her ""let's call"", she agrees. Now we were in a call for around 20 minutes and she was being super nice... All of the sudden we were talking about Halloween and police officers, and she asked me if I had ever handcuffed someone and I say ""nope but I've tied them up"" and she laughs and asks me if it was during sex and I said ""yeah ahah, it's a lot of fun, to be honest, dominating"" to which she says ""you're so kinky"", then hangs up the call, removes me on social media and doesn't talk to me again. What the fuck, again?

&amp;#x200B;

This is just two fucking scenarios, I've had like 50 of them. Really. It pisses me off. Every fucking girl I talk to seems to always fuck me off after an exchange of words, after having simple, normal dialogues with them. I hate it. It really does knock my confidence down and I have no way of feeling better. It has happened with over 50 girls so far. Really, I have tons of girls talking to me and I always mess it up. They're attracted to me, they talk for a while, and then I always say something to mess it up. I have no social or communication skills and really it just makes me upset in general about my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice appreciated, sorry if I've bored you to death.

254,"My husband and I are expecting our (planned) first baby in several months. We also have plans to move to a different country to start a new life. My husband and I are each from different countries as well (to keep it simple, I’ll refer to his country as A, mine as B and our future country as C). We got pregnant while living in his country A and then moved to my country B (where we are now) for antenatal care and to give birth. This means my husband had to give up his job - I work remotely, so it made no difference for my work. With just my income plus a couple hundred hubby gets from rental income, we’re now living in my mom’s house. 

In hindsight we feel extremely stupid, but somehow we thought this would work well for us, before moving to country C with our baby. Well, it hasn’t. We’re absolutely miserable in my mom’s house and my husband feels massive regret about quitting his job. My mom is a slob and she has SO much stuff everywhere and doesn’t clean up after herself. It’s a messy, cluttered house. A lot of things are also broken and she’s not bothered about repairing - sinks are leaking, pipes are clogged… My nesting instinct kicked in a few weeks ago and now I just can’t STAND it anymore. I feel like I can’t breathe here, it feels too saturated and busy to bring a baby into this house. The noise of all this chaos is screaming at me. And we also realize just how little space we have left for our baby - every time a baby order arrives, we don’t even have a proper place to store it. Having a baby here even just for a few months seems like a nightmare. I’m also getting increasingly annoyed with my mom (hello pregnancy hormones), but it’s her house so has the right to do what she wants. 

As for solutions… My income alone is just enough to move out and rent something temporarily, but it will be tight, especially with a baby. However, I would much rather do that than stay here, even if we hired a cleaner. My husband is different, though. Since we moved here, he has become quite unstable and really unhappy - he’s not himself. He is full of regret and feels like we should have had the baby in his country, which I agree with, but we can’t go back now that he quit. Even though he hates living here too, he is against moving out of my mom’s and renting because ‘it will just create new problems’ and 'we should have done it with his income in his country’. He is worried that the additional expenses will stop us from buying the property we want. I agree that this situation sucks and that renting until we buy a house might have some implications, but staying here with my mom is just not an option for me. I might have a breakdown when the baby actually comes! I feel like my husband is stuck in the past with his attitude. He also doesn’t want to work here because he doesn’t speak the local language and it should only be a few months until we move again - again, he mentions ‘then we should have stayed in his country with his good job there’. I’m getting a bit sick of this self-pity and his frantic reactions, but he’s really fragile mentally, so it’s not like I can just talk sense into him. 

Seriously, what am I supposed to do? Push him to move out and come with me? I feel like he should really get over the feelings he has about quitting is job. By deciding to go to my country we’ve made a mess of our life, but we need to deal with it. My mom is supportive of us moving out and renting before the baby comes. I wish my husband would get mental help and speak with someone, but there’s no money for that now. Other than my parents, I have no friends or family that could help.",30Oct2018,1

256,"Hi, thanks a ton for reading this post! I go to an East Coast college. I am living in a quad (suite) with three girls. Two of them are totally fine but third girl is a whole other story.

For some context, I am really not a short-tempered person. I've never been screamed at in my life. I'm pre-med, a part-time model, and I go to a very competitive school - I try to keep life simple because of my hectic schedule.

This girl is not quite the same. Yesterday, right when I'd woken up and walked into the living room, she started screaming out of nowhere: ""CAN YOU WASH YOUR FUCKING DISHES?"" I don't know her well so this was rather impolite...I requested her to mind her language. However, she continues shouting at the top of her voice (she's very loud). She brings up every little thing I have apparently done wrong - I'm talking trivial things from 2 months ago like dropping a piece of cake in the living room by mistake (and cleaning it right after). These are all things that were taken care of; I barely even remember them. She even mentioned this one time weeks ago when I asked her to talk a little softly in the living room because I was napping - she said ""napping"" sarcastically as if I was lying to her about napping...yikes.

She has entered my room without my consent before (although we resolved it, it was strange). She consistently said and kept saying that I lie to her about not checking the messages she sends to me. She *saw* the guy I'm with walk into my room on a Friday night and we were obviously having sex, but she decided to text me to wash the dishes that night at 2 AM (they weren't even my dishes but I think she didn't know that). Then she tried to claim I ignore her based on that.

Well, she was terribly rude and no one has been like that with me, ever; not even my mother (which is saying something since my parents are indian and hers are not lol). I was so taken aback because I had just woken up and this was totally unexpected. I did not even know what to say but I was in shock at how harsh she was being - she was so ridiculously skeptical and mean. She took the worst meaning out of everything. I called her a bitch and started storming towards my room and she started charging towards me screaming ""I DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU CALL ME."" She is more than double my weight at the same height - I am way way thinner than her, comparatively a stick, so I was SO scared since she could probably actually hurt me.

I am perhaps over-idealistic, and I do assume the best in people. That just made this whole incident so much more shocking. My best friend is so appalled and he asked me to stop trying to understand her. But I can't help but wonder why she dislikes me so much...I texted her asking her to never talk to me that way again, and preferably keep minimal communication with me. Then I blocked her, so that part of it is pretty much over, but I am confused and I want to understand her side.

I would understand if I had actually done something wrong recently, or if multiple people had this impression of me. But that is not the case at all! Plus she is not even in my year - she is a senior and an english major while I am a sophomore and a biology major.

I know I should probably just be pissed but I am just scared and confused - what have I even done, and what should I do next? What are your thoughts on this?",30Oct2018,1
257,"(Reposting this due to no responses) So, I'm in a lot of trouble and am just sort of coming back to the real world from some really bad mental health issues that I won't get into here. I am 25 single in greater New York State.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have around 5 approximately two+ year old tickets from various towns in NY from when I was in college against my license, preventing my from driving legally. I haven't been driving since I got the notice. I was licensed to drive in another state at the time and made the choice to ignore the tickets. Of the five or so, only one is for driving without a license (as I did not have it on my person, it was valid at the time.) All the others are for mechanical issues such as faulty head or tail lights. I no longer have the vehicle. I have the numbers for the tickets and counties they are in. I still have and am technically registered to drive (though suspended) in another state. I called each county office like 6mo ago and left messages but didn't hear back. I know, I know, just call again. I plan to. I just wanted to know what my options were regarding those tickets.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Can I even get some kind of traffic lawyer to help me negotiate them all and get driving again sooner? Please humor me here, I really know next to nothing about all this and transportation is a major issue to at least two of these locations in rural NY. I know the fees were estimated to be about 1k collectively due to fees regarding opening the tickets again then pleading guilty then paying a fine when I called over two years ago after I got the four suspension notices (one for each ticket). Does time change anything? I realize my choice to ignore the tickets was a foolish decision, so how do I make this right and get back to being able to drive?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have some past due credit card bills that have fallen to collection agencies, on top of my federal student loans I just more or less have ignored, on top of Sallie Mae breathing down my neck (which I do pay and am close to being caught up on at least). Credit cards are over four years old. Sallie Mae I started paying in Feb or so, and Federal  Loans may have been emailing me about paying them around then too.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I also have medical bills I've been ignoring and am behind on my electric bill and rent. I make \~70k but am overdrafting after spending every paycheck within days. How do I even begin to deal with this mess I got myself into?

Thanks, and if there's a better place to ask please say so. I'm new to reddit and pretty nervous about trying to tackle this all. I'm also having a ton of trouble leaving my house with agoraphobia, so I'm hoping fixing this and being able to drive again might help me get out more and maybe do in person appointments.",30Oct2018,1

I'll be going to college in September. I would rather start right away but the Computer Programming course I'm interested in is not available until the fall.

I just learned yesterday that he coerced about a dozen, if not more, women (some married, and their husbands were also in the cult) to sleep with him. He took advantage of them,

I also learned that aside from rape by coercion and powerful influence, he also raped one of the women, who helped raise me, by force. He also likely raped my mother, who was one of the main targets of his abuse. I have a few memories of him abusing her, but i was young. 

I knew he was abusive, domineering, and severely mentally ill, and I have been working on making peace with my past and trying to forgive him.

270,"Hello Reddit. This is my first time posting, but I created a throwaway all the same. I may oversimplify a few things but it's an attempt not to alert co-workers who also use Reddit.

I used to work for an IT consulting firm, building software. It didn't pay a whole lot, and the cost of living is high and rents are astronomical around here. But it was enough to get by every month. Also, given the nature of consulting, I never truly felt I was a part of either the consulting company or the client company. I was in between the two, and felt there was no real employer identity. For these reasons I decided to get my CV out and about, to gauge my worth. In short, a few weeks later my CV is picked up by my current company, and after 6 lengthy interviews, which included technical and soft-skill evaluations, I landed a new job, with a mind blowing ~31% pay increase. But I had to accept a demotion to a junior rank. I didn't mind it, since I figured I would quickly climb back up, as I had done previously.

Initially things went well. It's impossible to measure a company up in a few days, but I found, to my surprise, that most people working here were very laid back and welcoming. I was happy with the change. The offices are incredibly spacious and there's free fruit/snacks/coffee/yogurt! Moreover, I joined the team that, in my opinion, is the most interesting in the whole engineering department.

Now, four months later, after having worked with my new team and learning their processes and internal structure well, I find myself incredibly disappointed and frustrated. The entire department is wildly disorganized, leading to huge amounts of time wasted trying to recover context of issues that were identified several months before! No one remembers what the issues were about, and most perplexing of all, most people who were closely related to the issues I would ask for help and were stumped as well. This happened every day no matter the issue. I find myself having to fix other team's assets, and being obviously unable to without assistance. I have to take up a resource from the correct team to help me navigate the issue, and more often than not the problems are not lined out properly. Everyone I present these issues to looks absolutely stumped. Only by bringing in one of the few people with 10+ in-house years of experience was I able to get any work done. There are huge information silos, accentuated by the fact there is zero documentation. And some parts of code base are absolutely unreadable, making consulting these dinosaurs all the more necessary.

I have never felt this demotivated before. I've been constantly thinking about returning to the consulting firm over the past two weeks. At this point it would be rather easy, since I'm still within a 6 month probation period. Either my employer or I can terminate my job contract without needing an explicit justification or a heads-up. My former manager was clear I would be more than welcome to return when I left, but it stings thinking about the raise I will be throwing away. Redditors that have been in this situation before, what do you think I should do? If I decide to return to my former job, who do I talk to first?",30Oct2018,1

Today we're supposed to learn about espresso and actually start making drinks.

And, regrettably, I'm sick. I was so embarassed yesterday because I was a little sick then, and I had to get up like every ten minutes to wipe my nose. This morning my nose isn't *quite* as runny, but my chest is tight and it's more difficult to breathe.

Basically, I know that I can still function and do what's needed of me. I can still pay attention, move around, and be present. But I also know that my nose is probably going to be an issue and I don't want to get anybody sick. Also, the online course we were reading *heavily* emphasized that you shouldn't be at work when you're sick.

Should I call in sick today or should I tough it out and go? I'd feel like absolute trash cancelling on just my second day. Also, I feel confident that I wouldn't collapse or even be super miserable, and could do the things I needed to do. But I also feel like I'd be a liability to myself and to others if I went.

I dropped out of high school because of bad grades—I tried studying every day, doing my homework, going to class on time and sleeping regularly but I got failing grades. Going back to school, I imagine, would only yield the same result.

So I had two roommates, one who could not speak the language at all, lol. But he was the bad one... It started off fine, but the first night I playfully gave a very feminine wave, just kidding of course. He laughed his head off, the next day we were in different groups of about ten, and he called me from across the hall to do again, this time to his friend but I just ignored him. This kept on happening.

Another was the phrase""maith an fear"", which means good man. I asked our group leader am I a good man after he called this other lad a good man every night. This was the funniest thing my roommates had ever heard, the laughed for about 5 minutes. The next day, he and my other roommate made it out that I said as if I was scared again and again to different groups we were in.

Then another lad who didn't say anything for the first week just started to toy with me. If something fell over he would go ""Críostóir!"", and blame me. Then he would make a fart sound and call me out again. This would happen about 10x an hour.

In the end I managed to make a joke out of it, or kind of make a meme of myself (which led some girls talking to me as if I was 5, I was 14 at the time). But I think I did a good job of well, not letting them get to me and fighting back in a funny way...

Now my other roommate has told me they are going again and are asking if I will go...

275,"So I talked to my mom at length about school yesterday. She was pretty supportive about every thing until I brought up potentially changing my major down the road.

She went absolutely postal on me. My favourite question being ""are you on something right now?"", unironically. Generally, it kept coming back to ""you're halfway done, stick it out"" or ""why didn't come to this conclusion two years ago?""

A couple things urk me about this. 

1. She was very insistent going into university that I take the program I'm in. When I was 17 choosing my major I said what I wanted to study and I was told it was pointless.

2. My parents essentially contributed enough for them to buy textbooks... I'm not complaining, but the bulk of my university tuition is from me. 

A huge chunk of my credits would transfer and it would be into a more competitive program. It's just upsetting to me that I'm in a lose-lose position here. I would rather have my mom on my side with this, but I have almost no drive to complete this program. When I was taking intro classes last year in stuff I enjoyed I was excited to study, now I only do it so I feel competent for when I handle patients next month (my feelings shouldn't cause unsafe practice).

I think I want to stop attending. I want to be a tattoo artist, and didn’t plan on going to college at all until I received a pretty big scholarship from the college I’m attending. I also work ~30 hours a week as a server so I can afford to pay for my half of the bills. The problem is that I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for several years now, and having to juggle so much at once is keeping me at a low point that I’m having a really hard time getting out of.

I’ve fallen behind in nearly all of my classes and I doubt I’ll be able to catch up and pass them all before the end of the semester. I can’t keep my apartment clean because on the days that I do have off work, I’m entirely unmotivated to do anything and exhausted.

I talked to my mom and my boyfriend about this yesterday and they both agree that I should do what’s right for me and shouldn’t bother wasting money if I’m not happy. I just feel like I’m wasting time when I’ve already been offered a tattoo apprenticeship. I feel like I just need to keep working until I have enough money to pay for that and then just dive into my dream job. Otherwise, I’ll most likely have to wait till after graduation to even begin the apprenticeship.

Art is something I’ve always loved and been good at, and the way my life is going now has prevented me from making art outside of class in almost 3 months. 

I’m just afraid of disappointing my professors and some of my family, but I really feel like I can be successful without going to school. I just don’t really know what to do about it right now.

I’m meeting with my advisor at 11:30 today to talk to him and will be meeting with a counselor on campus about it as well. I’m asking for advice here because I just want as much insight as I can before I make any final decisions.",30Oct2018,1
286,"I've been with my bf for four years now. I know we're still young (we're both 21) but I really see a future with him and I don't know if he feels the same way. I'm kinda scared to communicate with him about this kind of stuff because every time I mention it he takes it the wrong way and starts saying ""Go be with someone else"" or ""Sorry I'm not good enough"". I mean eventually I want to get engaged and married and I see people all the time that are my age getting engaged after only a year or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I want to start saving up for a house so that when I get out of school next year. I've been working on my credit score and putting back a little bit of money each month and I have almost $3,000 saved up now. Meanwhile he doesn't have any credit at all and spends his money like crazy on his gaming computer and games. Every time I ask him about saving money with me for a house he says he will because he wants to move in together, but he gets all defensive when I ask him for the money and says I'm babying him. Also, I know I might sound greedy, but we've been together for four years and he's never gotten me any gifts for my birthday or Christmas and it's not because he doesn't have any money (he has a pretty good job). I get him stuff (not anything really big) for the holidays because I love the holiday season, but it'd be nice to get something from him from time to time. Then again I'm not really the type to ask for him to get me gifts but I feel like I shouldn't have to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be a little bit more serious and mature in our relationship. I think we could be more than what we are now. I feel like he's not serious about our future at all but I don't know how to address it. However part of me wants to think he is serious because why else would he have stayed with me for so long? Am I just being unreasonable? If not, what can I do or say to him?",30Oct2018,1
287,"I am in desperate need for some advice over here!

&amp;#x200B;

A little context.. My boyfriend and I have recently moved into a flat together, which has been amazing on almost every level...except for my sleeping quality. I have always been a very independent person who values my own space, and so this is the first time I have lived with a partner. I am incredibly happy with the relationship and know it is the right decision for us, but I really do need to crack this sleeping issue soon because I am currently running on around 2hours sleep a night most nights during the week :(

&amp;#x200B;

I have to wake up really early for work and consequently will always aim to fall asleep before 11pm. I have never had problems falling asleep and staying asleep before, but now my sleep quality is extremely light and it can often take me hours to fall asleep. My boyfriend is more nocturnal and will come to bed a couple of hours later than me, however I think the fact that I expect him to come to bed later results in a much lighter sleep quality. What then usually happens is I will wake up once he has come to bed, and then will not be able to fall back to sleep at all. This is all made a lot worse by the fact that I know my alarm will go off really early and knowing that I will feel like utter shite at work the next day. I am now finding myself moving into the living room every single night after I wake up, where I will lie on a mattress on the floor and usually toss and turn and often not fall back to sleep at all :( This has become a cycle over the past couple of months and I just cannot seem to break it, even when i am so incredibly tired after so many terrible nights sleep in a row.

Just to note, this only seems to be a problem during the week when I have a strict routine to stick to for work. During the weekends and holidays, I do not struggle to fall asleep in the same bed.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any suggestions to help me to get through this and break the cycle? I really don't want to have to always sleep on a mattress in the living room because I am getting a strong feeling that this will eventually begin to affect our relationship and I care about this working more than anything in the world.

288,"Here’s what:

* When you study worthless majors in university, racking up six-figures in student loan debt and only to ask yourself, why you are in debt and cannot find a well-paying job?
* When you prioritize your spending habits to having the nicest car possible, masking your insecurities — one of the greatest depreciating types of assets out there.
* When you barely have savings, yet dropping $400 on Jordan Brand shoes (FYI, I am one of the greatest Jordan fans out there, but come on…).

289,"My boyfriend is aware of my drug addiction. He's also aware of me trying hard and soul to recover entirely. I don't do it regularly, but only once a week which still has impacts on my well being. I've taken steps in full on recovery with a therapy session starting next week. I love my boyfriend and we are together for 2 years. After I told him that I had a relapse this weekend, in response he told me that he has doubts about everything I say now. But I didn't lie. Infact, I was being honest about my relapse. Now, I understand that his reaction is only natural and expected. So in my response, and since he's pretty neat and strategic about his life, I gave him the opportunity to rethink about our relationship if he feels any different of me or if my recovery side effects has it's bad effects on him.

Was it the right thing to do? Because at this point I'm quite unsure of what should have or should be done because I don't wanna lose him. I did give him the reassurance that I'm trying to get better and told me that he supports me regardless. But clearly this recent response put me off a bit.

290,"My son is always by himself. He never goes out to hang out with anyone. He's always been a loner. I ask him is he making friends with anyone from school and work, and he says ""I talk to people, and I'm cordial with everyone.""

My son does work and is taking classes at our local community college. He helps out around the house. He is responsible and a good person. However, I would like him to have a social life. He goes out to go to the gym, to the mall, etc. but he always goes alone. He's at a point in his life where he should be living it to the fullest. He's a young adult.

I've tried to encourage him to make friends his whole life, but it never worked.

I just don't want him to spend the rest of his life alone. It can be a very miserable and isolating way to live, and I don't want that for him. It's not healthy to be alone all the time. Humans are social creatures, and we were not meant to live in isolation.

291,"My mom was diagnosed with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy last year.  It’s a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no cure.  The neurologist told us that most patients with PSP pass away from respiratory illness, caused by eventual weakening of the breathing muscles.  

My mom was just wheeled into ICU this morning.  She is unconscious and unable to breath on her own, caused by exacerbation of both the PSP and aspiration pneumonia.  Even if they are able to treat the pneumonia with antibiotics for now, her ability to breathe will continue to worsen with her progressive PSP.

She is hooked onto a mechanical ventilator for now.  I was not expecting how soon her disease would reach this point.  I am single - no kids nor a SO.  I have no siblings and my father passed away when I was young.  I feel so so alone in this and I have no idea what to do.  I’m scared shitless that she has not much time left.  I miss her so much.

292,"So on Reddit particularly there is a lot of racism towards Indians. I'm an Indian girl who has a huge problem with being Indian. All the ""ugly people"", ""low iq"", gangraping, shitting in the streets, ""weird creepy men"". I think on Reddit, if there was racism towards black people, it's died down a long time ago. However Facebook is probably notorious for racism towards them etc. 

White people have achieved a huge amount of stuff. We succeeded in shitting in the streets and causing chaos.

Indians are probably the most stereotyped group to get a small amount of support. Self proclaimed ""liberals"" constantly make the same jokes about India. For some reason I feel like I'm worthless because of it, like I'm just a disgusting Indian girl.
I'm constantly disgusted by myself. I feel like I have the dirtiest shittiest background ever (a pun if there ever was). I think being Indian is absolutely disgusting. I feel like I have no actual worth.

293,"I’m applying for a Postgraduate Masters in Graphic Design next year at a University, and I need to submit a portfolio with at least 12 examples of work. This will be on PowerPoint and is 20 slides max. 

The criteria from the University states, projects can be: “photographs, drawings or other media, with dates and descriptions of why the projects were undertaken.”

I have an undergraduate Bachelors of Arts degree in Animation, and I’ve never done a portfolio for Graphic Design before. I have a website where I have a few projects which so far include: conceptual drawings for an events company, some logo designs for another, some random photography of animals. 

I have also done storyboarding and digital environmental design a few years back for a small Animated trailer but I’m not sure if it’s too old! 

All my work is different (in terms of medium and theme) and I’m not sure if it’s high enough standard or what is needed for a portfolio for a Graphic Design course.  If I submit some of my photography, it wouldn’t necessarily be a project. Only a personal one. Would that count?! Again, the projects above are only 3-4 so I need another 7 ideas! 

Any guidance would be much appreciated! ",30Oct2018,1
294,"Alright here's the situation as best as I can put it.  My place is a 24/7 shop so to make it so everyone gets at least some weekends and the like we do 12 hour rotating shifts (2 on 2 off 3 on 2 off 2 on 3 off and repeat).  Right now there are 3(well 2 once this one is filled) on the day shift(7am to 7pm) rotations and kind of down one on the other night shift(he's working two jobs and put in notice months ago so no one knows when he'll just stop coming).  There is also an opening for the next position up in our company I would say(which I'm not qualified for imo).

So you would think nights would be ok but in reality mine relies heavily on me for my knowledge and the other night shift relies heavily on one guy as well(who I think is qualified for that next position up and will go for it and has spread the rumor at least that he'll quit if he doesn't get it).

Well I was picked to fill one of the day shift spots.  However they have asked me to stay until they can get more people in(they've been trying since I started and still haven't had a new person for like 3-4 months now) or at least get the guys on my shift to a point where they don't need any help.

Which you would think isn't  be a big deal but if I decide to help this position is being filled by a different guy and I'm just the next guy to get days.  This isn't a written guarantee and there is no guaranteed time line.

The only upsides for really staying on nights are an extra dollar an hour in shift premium and they're offering a $100 gift card.  I mentioned a stopping point of when I would go to days no matter what and while my boss entertained the idea but it was once again all verbal.

So I'm going to take some advil and have a nap.  Hopefully you guys can help me make a final call and stick to it firmly.  If you want further details feel free to ask.",30Oct2018,1

298,"Sometime ago, my mom bought back some fish from the office because nobody would be at the office to feed them during the weekends. I grew attached to them pretty quickly and would sit down and watch them swim around while I studied. 

The day before she was supposed to bring them back, one of them died and one of the fish kept bumping into it and it didn't move and that's how I knew it died. At this moment, my brain starts to shut down and I feel dizzy and want to get out of sight from the fish tank as soon as possible. I call for my mom and tell her one of the fish has died, and she just tells me to scoop it out with a spoon. I can't explain it, but I just can't bring myself to do it. She asks my dad to do it instead, but he doesn't want to. My mom ends up coming out of her room to scoop it out, and I'm sitting there on the couch not knowing what to do. Both of my parents give me death stares and my dad reaches over and hits me, asking me why I can't do such a simple thing. He then goes into a lecture about how I shouldn't bring fish home if I can't take care of them, when I wasn't even the one who bought them home in the first place. 

After this, I just make a beeline for my room and sit down on the bed still in shock after what happened. A few minutes pass and I start flipping over blankets and pillows, horrified that I'll find a dead fish there. I do this a few more times before reading a book to take my mind off it but I couldn't concentrate at all and occasionally kept looking at the floor and flipping over blankets and pillows again, to check for dead fish. I also keep waking up during the night as I'm afraid my mother would come in and place a dead fish in my room as I pissed her off. 

The next morning I'm relieved as my mom has brought the fish back to the office. However, I swear I could smell this fishy water smell in the air and I start getting scared again. I avoid looking at the area where the fish tank was and try not to use the dustbin as I'm afraid the fish is still in there.

There is this guy I met online a while back (november last year). For two months we used to chat on WhatsApp. We’ve never actually met in person but for some reason I got really attracted to him. 

Then it all stoped. I figured he wasn’t that interested and got over it. 

And then today I was doing some chores. walking down the street carrying a bunch of papers, feeling like hell. AND THERE HE IS.  Walking towards me.

It was a really quick Hi in passing. He walked right by after that Hi. 

I got really self-conscious as he walked by. I think my hands were shaking for thirty minutes.

302,"So this co-worker is an older gentleman who is not very tech savvy. He often comes to me needing help with basic computer questions. He came to me today and said his daughter found a phone in a McDonald's bathroom and asked if I could factory reset it for her so she can give it to her daughter(his grand daughter). I asked if they had tried to find the original owner and he said yes and that she had had it for ""a while"". I tell him I'll look at it and see what I can do.

So he brings me the phone and leaves it in my office. It's an iPhone 4 or 5(I'm an Android guy so idk exactly) and it's locked so I figure that I won't be able to do anything with it. I'm about to give it back to him when I take a look at the notifications and see that it was still getting calls as of 2 days ago. It's in Airplane Mode so I turn that off and see that it still has the service for it turned on through Verizon.

So I'm now thinking that by ""a while"" we're only talking a couple of days. I am not going to pursue any method of trying to reset this phone, but I don't know what to do next. 

Part of me says to just give it back to him and wash my hands of the whole thing. I want to be clear here that I do not believe the phone was deliberately stolen. I believe that she probably did find it in a bathroom and made an honest although probably not very thorough effort to return it to the rightful owner. Failing that I think they decided to take the opportunity and just keep it. I think I can go through Verizon and get it back to the owner.

I don't know what to do here. My co-worker is a very nice person, a ""sweet old man"" most would call him. I don't want to just ""steal"" the phone away from him but I also don't want to screw over this other person when I have the chance to get them their phone back.

One possible solution that crossed my mind is that I actually have a spare phone myself from a recent upgrade. I had not decided what to do with it yet but the idea has now occurred to me to just trade phones with him. I had thought about selling it but in all honesty it would probably just sit in a junk drawer for a couple of years until I decided to just throw it out. I would be ok with letting it go to this guy so that his grand daughter can still get a phone and the stranger can still get his phone back.

Shortly after she began dating someone else for a few months and naturally I began to feel very sad and I struggled with being around them without breaking down. Around the end of the school year she and I began dating. I tried organizing plans for us to meet up but we both have pretty strict parents and weren’t able to see each other over the summer. Sophomore year we had the best time for a couple of weeks then her mom transferred her to a school about an hours drive from where I live. She broke up with me a couple months after and we could be back together when we are able to see each other more regularly. Since then she has shown me less and less affection. Her texts get shorter and responds are slower. On instagram I’ve seen her tightly hugging another guy that she confessed she had previously had a crush on. They’ve been on numerous trips to Las Vegas with their mutual friends and their friends created a couples account for them. She tells me that she still loves me and that she doesn’t want to date the other guy. She also said she doesn’t want to be in a relationship because she needs to love herself first. It has been over a year since she left and has not once visited me, she promised she’d visit before 2018 and didn’t. Then she promised she’d visit over the summer when we have more free time, she didn’t.

309,"Hi all, I know this might be a semi-broad question but... hopefully someone can chime in and give me some hefty life advice.

I've been debating packing up and moving across the country for a very long time, as I feel like my time here has expired and I want to further myself outside of this area. (United States, from the East coast wanting to move to the West coast.)

I've got a savings of about $6,000-$7,000, work in the IT/Technical Specialist field with a lack of a college degree but an extensive history of employment in said field, and have been at my current employer for about 4 years. However, I've been attempting to apply to jobs but I have yet to receive any contact back from potential employers. Am I aiming too high by continuing looking in my field of employment or should I be looking else-where or possibly a career change? Should I be looking at jobs that pay less than average in that area? My state is a very low-income state, and working at my current place of employment rakes in about $40,000 annually. Cost of living in the areas I'm looking to move are only slightly higher in the sense that rent is approx. $300 a month more and gas is more expensive and I have a tendency to put about a grand back a month as it is.

I want to be able to leave before February but it seems as though that may be asking much by my progress.

He said that he's sorry for leading me on.

Whenever I am with someone again, when the nagging insecure voice goes ""They're not attracted to you,"" it won't be illogical anymore. The voice will have evidence. The voice has power now.

All I wanted to be was enough for him. Why wasn't I enough for him?

This hurts so bad. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to go on. I posted this in r/offmychest but I really just need some help. I either feel numb or like crying. I just don't feel like I'll ever recover.

315,"Found out today I had an arrest warrant, I'm at the courthouse now clearing it up. Basically we had a verbal argument in which I stormed out and left. I said some hurtful thing and in her spiteful rage she called the cops and filed a report saying I hit her with a belt. I never did something like that violently, she took a sexual situation out of context bc she's kinky and likes getting whipped, stuff like that. So she told the cops I hit her, since then she's forgiven me and told the police that she doesn't want to press charges, still I have to go to court to take care of the warrant. I think everything is going to be fine legally but I don't know how I can trust her ever again. We have been together for a year and live together, she has never done something this serious. It feels like a major backstabbing, to jepordize my freedom in a heat of rage. Makes me think that if I don't walk on egg shells she will do something like this again. Should I forgive her? How do I know if I can ever trust her again? Sorry if the context sounds weird I wrote this in a rush before my court case. If I we're to be arrested today I know for sure we are done- but I spoke to lawyer and he said most likely the prosecutor will not go through with it if she doesn't want to get an order of protection and file charges. This whole things is so fucked and way out of proportion from her normal behavior.

Last night, 3am pst, I got woken up to my nephew screaming. He was freaking out that he was surrounded by bugs and spiders. My sister said he woke up at 10:30pm from a stomach ache and threw up.

He didn’t have a fever so I called he nurse helpline and they said to bring him to the er. As soon as we got to the hospital the hallucinations subsided but he started getting all fidgety and neurotic.

Immediately I thought he looked like a meth head all twitchy, stuttering.... nurse and doctor sent out for urine and blood test and he came back positive for methamphetamine (something about both that it’s not just the kind found in adderal or Ritalin).

I don’t know what to do, my sister said she has nothing like that in her home however I don’t trust her. But I also know CPS is scary and can possibly latch onto anything, so I don’t want to not stand by her if I have no evidence. She works for the county and keep applying for other jobs and days she is being drug tested....or so I think.

There’s two houses in the property I live in the front my parents and she lives in the back with him and his 8 yr. old brother.

It’s also Halloween time and he has already gone trick or treating at this neighborhood lake so idk if he was possibly exposed via candy.

Tl;dr: nephew had hallucinations, anxious, tested positive for meth. Not sure if I believe my sister but also don’t want him taken away.

Anyone else ever deal with something like this? I know cps will be notified. I’m worried about him as we’re in the hospital as he’s coming down.

So to start off, I'm a long time PC gamer. I sit in front if a PC all day for work 40 hours a week, and when I'm not out with friends, I'm probably at home on my PC or in front of the TV playing Red Dead Redemption 2 :).

It's been a goal of mine to get lasik one day because I hate wearing glasses. I've had them since I was... maybe 10? And I'm sick of cleaning them 3 times a day, laying down in bed and not being able to watch TV at a specific angle, scared that I might bend or break them.

The other day I went to a rock show with friends and we started moshing.  Some guy guy his hand in between my face and glasses and flung them off my face. Somehow I reacted quick enough and caught them. But if I hadn't, then they were forsure gone for good and that's a ton of money and a huge inconvenience to get new ones.



My issue with lasik is that because I'm in front of a PC damaging my eyes all day, and I dont get enough sleep as is(this probably won't ever change.), 

I have bags under my eyes that I feel are much more noticeable withOUT my glasses on.

Are there any ways to clean up dark eyes? 

I'll attach a picture when I get a moment of what Im self concious about and you can be the judge, but regardless, it really bothers me and Im wondering if there are ways to fix them.

343," 

I've recently moved in with a friend, whose house it is, and I'm having difficulty adjusting.

The house is a mess, and I realise now it's in no small part because of a bad history in the house (ex bfs, friends, other 'failed' housemate adventures), and also because she smokes a ton of weed. Lots. Several blunts a night.

I didn't know these issues in depth before I moved in, but I can recognize some of the red flags in retrospect.

I recently cleaned the kitchen - blitzed it all in a few hours while they were out - and they came back and literally cried: ""No one had done this for her before.""

I said it wasn't so much a gesture, as it was something I needed: clean, tidy living spaces to function properly. Especially the kitchen, I guess, because it's where I cook, listen to podcasts, etc, and because it's where dirt and germs can grow easily.

Since then, she did well at first, for maybe a week, but then it's become slovenly again - half assed jobs, or nothing done at all. I recently learned her mom used to come over and do it every other day, but she doesn't come over anymore (I'm thinking this is because I'm the one doing it now?).

Either way, every conversation, whether about a movie or an album or whatever, comes back to some distant memory of childhood. She's stopped talking about past traumas now, I think because she noticed it affecting me. She still smokes copious amounts of weed, one time even explaining her dealer needed her to buy a big bulk because he was going on holiday and needed spending money(!). Another time she rushed to hide it all as her mom dropped in for a visit after she had come home from arguing with her dad. She's nearly 40, not a teenager.

I'm not sure what to do, in all honesty, or if I have any real need or responsibility to do anything. I'm not a counselor, but I am a concerned friend. It's just that I have to live comfortably too, right?

I have some friends, I enjoy my roommates most of the time, I talk to my family often, but everyday I get this overwhelming feeling of sadness and I cry uncontrollably. I thought maybe i was homesick at first, but it's been over a month that ive been crying everyday. I can't pinpoint my sadness either, its just... there.

352,"4 Months ago I broke up with my girlfriend and I keep having this fear that in 5 months she's gonna call and say she just gave birth or something. I keep fearing for everything, I fear that I'm gonna get fired. I fear that I'm not going to get anywhere in life. And again I keep fearing my ex is pregnant or something even though the week before we broke she was on here period and I didn't have sex with her a month prior. But i still fear it. Everything I do in life I'm afraid to give it 100%. I feel like I'm going to mess it up. Also for the past year I've had swollen lymph nodes in my neck. I've done multiple tests (xrays,ultrasounds and bloodtests) and they all came back clear, but I keep thinking I have cancer. Even though the doctor isn't worried a bit I am.

I was wondering if there were any books or exercises that have helped any other people train themselves out of an anxiety inducing lifestyle pattern.  A lot of the books I've found are pretty wishy-washy and don't address much except being motivational. I'm looking for the practical side.  


Some basic tenets that I've come to do and realize myself:  
Sleeping (7 hrs/day minimum)  
Eating (Less/No Sugar, healthy diet)  
Meditation (5-20 minutes per day)  
Exercise (3-4/week 1hr 30minutes each time, weightlifting and cardio)

355,"We are both Sophmores in highschool and are more introverted. I have little to no relationship experience because 1 I’ve never really found someone I’m interested in dating, 2 never really cared for having a relationship cause I still have my goals to work for and I still do which takes up a absurd amount of my time. But one thing that really has stood out to me from other girls is she can be really strange at times in a good way like just out of nowhere saying something really random.

First and most recent she mentioned she was Bi and I instinctively kinda felt put off by this, not that it’s a problem because I do have bi and gay friends as it is but it was kinda natural for me to feel that it could complicate the situation even more. 

We haven’t really talked much in person, maybe 10 times in the years we’ve been at the same school. So 6th-10th. But we have talked a lot over text but none at all using our voice in a call. And we have never met outside of school. 

I’ve seen a lot of those videos of like signs she’s into you but a lot of those are directed for in person scenarios, and the ones that are directed towards text based scenarios have occurred, but then other things have happened that make me believe otherwise.

From what I’ve learned is she’s probably a shy introvert. But even then I’ve learned they generally would still be willing to meet up, which last time she turned me down. 

I know that with more introverted girls they can be harder to get to open up and have relationships with, but with the amount of time, energy, and work I have to put in for trying to go pro with Counter strike, i don’t even know if it would be worth it in the long run. Say I actually did hook up with her and I also got contracted by a Non-North American team, that would mean I’d have to move and with that we’d likely be traveling all over the place basically every other week.

358,"So my girlfriend of 6 weeks, went to her doctors appointment today in hopes of getting back on birth control.. doctor wanted to take a pregnancy test before just to check... turns out she’s pregnant. She was with her ex around 2 months before me, she says it’s the ex’s baby...

I have a few questions.. 

1.	how could she possibly know it’s his over me when the doctor told her they need to do bloodwork and an ultrasound to get the exact age?
2.	this girl has been my best friend for nearly a year and we only recently started dating, we’re extremely close and I really see a future with her, how am I supposed to be the father of a baby that isn’t mine, ontop of that I was personally friends with the actual father before he went off to college a few hours away. 

I don’t wanna ruin a good relationship over this, but I really don’t know if I’m the type of person to father a baby that isn’t mine. When she said they’re gonna weigh her options she mentioned keeping it, abortion or adoption.. with the way she is I honestly couldn’t see her consenting to an abortion, she’s not that type of person.. and she really loves kids, so I doubt if she went through the whole pregnancy she’d be able to give the child away either.. I don’t wanna tell her how I really feel because I don’t want her to make a decision about her future child based on the opinion of a boyfriend that’s only been with her a few weeks.. 

If she wants a baby I’d rather see her happy and do what she wants, but I don’t know if I’d be able to stick around. I love this girl but I’m not sure I’d be able to see the child as my own when it’s not. 

I kinda needed to vent and I also need advice, I don’t wanna hurt her (end the relationship) I don’t want her to have an abortion if she doesn’t want to, I don’t want her to give it up for adoption if she doesn’t want to. If she wants a baby I want her to make that decision and be happy, not do something because of me. I honestly don’t know if I could do it knowing it’s not my child, I’m sure I could raise it but I’ll always know deep down it’s not my child.. or who knows, maybe when it’s born I’ll absolutely love it like my own...

Tldr; girlfriend pregnant with her recent ex’s baby, we’re now dating and I think she’s gonna keep it. I don’t know what to do.. I want her to make a decision on her own, not based on my opinion because we haven’t been dating long enough, I don’t wanna affect her big decisions like this.

360,"I’ve (20f) been friends with this person (20m) since we were 15. I felt I’d been trying to buy his love for years, just so he’d been a good friend to me. I’m burnt out. We got in several arguments over the past few days. I think I’m at the finale. 

I feel free. Sad but free. 

Problem is, all my other friends do not like him, because he is toxic, many of which, dumped him long ago. I have the problem of letting people back in. How do I prevent it? I’m aware that I give people too many chances and accept too many apologies. But this person has drained the life out of me. What do I need to do? 

(Also I gave him a couple paintings over the years, how do I ask for them back? I really would like them back)",30Oct2018,1
361,"Back story: I moved to a new area about 3 years ago for work. I was introduced to a new group of friends through a college roommate. Two of the people in that group were dating and about a year later got engaged. I always was attracted to and liked her, but I never acted on anything or told anyone because they were dating and I’m not the kind of person to get in the middle of another relationship. But I always thought she was very flirty with me. She was like that with everyone though, so I didn’t think much of it. 

Flash forward ~8 months after they get engaged. She breaks up with him seemingly out of nowhere. He was devastated and I helped him get through the worst time of his life. Since then, he found a new girlfriend and has generally moved on. I’m sure it still upsets him, but he doesn’t bring it up anymore.

It’s been a year since she left him. A couple of weekends ago I went to a festival with some mutual friends for the weekend and she ended up going too. We all had a great time, had some drinks, and one thing led to another.. she kissed me on the first night. We hung out the rest of the weekend and it was really easy just to be with her. And now that we’re back, I can’t get her out of my head. 

I know that dating her means I will most likely lose my friend. I already feel bad about what happened over the weekend, and I know continuing with anything will just make the situation worse. But it’s hard to get past because it effortlessly was the best weekend I’ve had with a girl in a long time. My dating record has been pretty miserable lately, this just seemed like it already worked. 

I’ve thought about secretly trying to date her to see if we really connect, but I don’t know if she would be interested in that kind of dating. And I also don’t want to lose my friends only for her to bail on me. Should I move on or try to figure out if this can work? 

TLDR: I hooked up with my friends ex and now I can’t get her out of my head. Not sure what to do

I can't get an appointment just for this, though, or my mum will know there's something wrong, so I've got to wait until there's something not embarrassing to go to the doctors about, and then get my mum to leave the room whilst I tell the doctor, which in itself is suspicious.

I don't know about my privacy, though, will the doctor tell my mum? I'm fourteen, I'm in England, and my mum wants to know all of my medical shit, so will the doctor tell her, or will it be kept private?

How do I even bring myself to tell the doctor? Or to ask my mum to leave the room? I've only said a few words to them before, my mum's always done the rest of the talking, but I don't want anyone to know about this.

364,"My son is 7, in first grade and this is his second year of being bullied.  Last year he was repeatedly hit and kicked by a kid and his friends until the one kid was expelled and only happened while at school not when playing in the neighborhood.  We're a military family and the school they go to is largely a collection of other military kids so a wide variety of backgrounds.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, a new bully repeatedly kicked balls at recess at my son and hit him several times in the crotch. Yesterday this same bully yanked him off the monkey bars and when my son got up from that the bully pantsed him (completely).  My son is extremely gentle in nature and I'm trying to build up his confidence to stand up to bully and if necessary fight back but he just isn't there, it takes so long to push him to a point of just saying someone hurt him let alone standing up to someone and even then he's fairly mild about it.  Yesterday, he told me repeatedly how embarrassed he was (and he has never said that before even when he's clearly been a little embarrassed, so it was a big deal to him)

&amp;#x200B;

The bullying seems to be escalating and I'm trying to find the parents of this kid to reach out to them and figure out more about what is going on and see how they are handling it.  Advice I've gotten from my family and friends is to of course be on top of it with the school, but several mentioned police involvement and this would be considered a sex crime in middle and high school levels and should be at his grade.  I'm honestly, a little lost and not sure what or how to proceed.  I'm normally the calmer one when it comes to handling situations and I wish I had been a lot more aggressive last year. My husband has been deployed essentially the last two years and isn't home to help handle this now and he is much better and handling situations like this he's an ass by nature (in a good way).  I am going to stand up for my son!  I just don't know how best to proceed with this. Should I be involving the police?

I am a 19 yr old transgender male and ever since I was about 9 years old, I've become increasingly uncomfortable showing affection, both verbal and physical, towards older familial adults in my life. I don't really remember there being any kind of trigger for these feelings, I thought maybe it was because I wanted to be ""cool"" and not be seen by friends hugging my parents or whatever. 

But I'm 19 now and I have some self awareness, and I still feel incredibly uncomfortable in situations like this. I don't like when my parents (etc) hug me, tell me they love me, give me compliments or encourage me. It just makes me want to run away from them and never return. I do love my family, but I hate showing it in the typical ways, even more so if it involves them touching me. 

This feeling increases tenfold if I'm upset or in a bad mood. I'm not really sure what to do. Sometimes I don't even want to be around them. Does anyone know why this might be happening, or what I can do to alleviate some of the discomfort? Thanks. ",30Oct2018,1

1) Thanksgiving weekend from November 21-24 have to be off, my parents and sister will be coming up to visit and spend with me, they already bought tickets way beforehand and I cannot just cancel it.

Pretty much everything beyond a kiss has been my first and she knows I am not experienced. One of my biggest fears is still that I’ll somehow manage to let my inexperience ruin things and the area I worry about the most is during sex. 

We didn’t have sex until a month or so of dating (I think she knew and understood I was nervous and never pressured me or anything) and have only had sex a few times since (this is more on just bad timing to be honest). When we have had sex, I genuinely feel like she’s lying to me about how I’m doing. I won’t even count the first time because it was so embarrassingly bad on my part. But still, it just seems like she’s showing too much enthusiasm, like she just wants me to think I’m doing a good job. 

Im realistic with myself. I still have very little idea what I’m doing and I’m far from “gifted” if you catch my drift. And while she says all these wonderful things, her body has never really seemed to align with how excited she acts.

Through high school I was studying in a Social Sciences class, meaning I barely had any Maths, mostly Literature, History, Geography and so on. 

I decided to take a leap of faith due to the facts that programming interests me and they are also in demand.  
That's where I feel like I messed up. I have way more Maths than any kind of programming, at a level that's just beyond me, they don't even teach Programming in a way that's engaging, just a dry, raw mess of education.  


I've thought about dropping out and instead learning through an online Programming course, but I don't know if I'd have any chance of getting a job then. I'm at a point where I don't know what I wanna do in my life, I just don't see the point of 4 years of suffering to get a diploma with which I can get an entry-level job.  
All I want in life is a job that I'd enjoy and has an above average pay, as do many others.   


If anyone has any ideas or options I perhaps don't realize, my interests include programming, digital art/graphic design, languages (I speak 3 currently, German, Hungarian and English) and video editing/entertainment.

A friend of mine close by would frequently throw house parties. At one of them I met and developed a crush on a girl utterly out of my league. I got to know her somewhat as we sat together and talked at these parties, always passing a bong between us. At the end of one night, she suggested that we meet up soon to smoke together and go on an ""adventure"". It will come as a bit of an anti-climax, but I never ended up hanging out with her one on one. I just couldn't work up the nerve. I ended up running in to her at yet another party, where I witnessed her doing cocaine with her friends. I was worried about her and put off, and decided to cut myself off from the situation. At the time it felt like a hard decision to make, as I had come to like this girl a lot.


Fast forward three years to today. I'm busy at work at your generic locally owned grocery store, and I hear someone behind me say ""hey"". I turned around, and there she was. My stomach didn't do a flip like it might have at one point, but I was still speechless. I asked her how she had been, and in a sort of detached tone she told me that she's currently admitted to my city's mental hospital. That she's currently considered ""mentally unfit for work"". I could tell that something about her was off. My guess is that she might have had a drug related mental break, but I couldn't be sure. She was acting very quiet and detached and for moments at a time just stood in front of me without saying anything, before asking me about work, or if I was still smoking a lot. We talked for several minutes before I had to get back to work. I told her to take care of herself, and that I was a bit worried about her back when we had stopped talking last.

God I'm a horrible person. Started a new job recently as an intern. In my industry its hard for females to find work. But I found this place and the boss seemed awesome but kinda dorky. When he offered me the job I was thrilled!! The work so far has been decently challenging and I'm overall happy with the place.

Things didn't start going south until last week. And by go south I mean in my head. Not for reality. We have a lot of blind corners at my job. The worst being the restrooms. I was heading to the ladies room last week and accidentally ran smack into my boss. He laughed, but I had to steady myself by grabbing onto his arms. Mistake numero uno. The man works out. I think that's the moment where it went from hes my boss to holy shit hes kinda fukkin hott.

Ever since then I haven't been able to get him out of my head. But hes married. He has kids and a kid on the way. Never met his wife, but he talks about her constantly. I'm one thousand percent sure nothing would ever happen. But is it bad that I kinda want it to?

392,"Hi everyone, so I’m in my second year of college and so far, everything’s been pretty good. 

Last year, I met my current roommates who are all good guys, with somewhat annoying quirks. But hey, everyone has those.

Now I tend to get stressed pretty easily, but do a good job of hiding it. I don’t voice my real opinion often because I’m afraid disturbing whatever harmony I have with people.

Lately, I’ve been having short fits of rage where I get annoyed by anything my roommates do. Twice now, I’ve unexpectedly yelled at them for something that wasn’t a big deal.

This is very unlike me and I feel terrible about it. I’ve already lost most of my high school friends due to different paths in life, and prefer not to lose my college friends for my dumb outbursts.

All I can think is that I’ve spent years bottling up anger and now something is triggering it for whatever reason.

Most people know me as the quiet and shy individual, so you can imagine their shock at what I’m doing. 

I greatly appreciate any help or similar experiences from anyone. Thanks in advance!

393,"Hi, I'm a full-time student currently taking 5 classes. I recently started a part-time job at a food place. I went into cutting my hours off at a certain time so I wasn't available to do closing shifts because I have tons of school work to do, get up at 7 AM every morning and don't need to be extra tired by staying late. I wrote this down and verbally said it multiple times but they ignored it and once I started I was closing twice a week, working 4-5 days a week. About 2 weeks ago I finally decided I couldn't do it anymore and told my boss the adjustments I wanted to make, in text, so he could save it and reference it later when making the schedule (he's VERY forgetful)..he responded saying he'd try to keep what I said in mind, needless to say he didn't for the most part. He keeps scheduling me 4 days a week, 3 shifts in a row on friday-sunday which are my most valuable days to get work done. I had to get two shifts covered last week because I didn't have a way to get to work and on this weeks schedule he's not only scheduled me to work friday-sunday but saturday I have a 10 hour shift. It's the exact time combination of the 2 shifts I got covered previously so I think he's trying to make me make up for them which I'm not sure why, I don't owe them hours? And I just got done telling him I can't work as much. I understand there are people out there with tougher situations and they make it work but personally I can't handle it. I just wanted it to make some side money and feel more productive, now I'm overwhelmed because I'm trying to handle 5 classes where 4 days out of the week my entire day is spent in class and/or at work and the exhaustion then carries over to the days I don't work and I end up up having the time/energy to get things done like 2-3 days out of the week which is way too little for 5 classes worth of work and my grades have started to fall because of it. I don't want to quit, what do I do? I thought of telling him straight up I can only work 3 days a week from now on, 2 being between monday-thursday, one between friday-sunday and that's it. I'm scared he'll fire me or get really angry but school is my priority.. well I'd like it to be. ",30Oct2018,1

396,"Hey everyone, this is my first post here. Hopefully this is a good place to ask this, if not please let me know.

I'm a 24 year old female and my ex and I broke up a couple weeks ago after being together for nearly 3 years. I was/am utterly heartbroken. I was living in another country while living with him, and am now back in the US living with my parents until I can afford a place of my own. I have a couple friends here, but they work a lot and don't have much time to hang out. I'm starting a seasonal job soon, but I'm not sure how many hours I'll be there per day.

Honestly, this is just a really awful situation. I feel incredibly lonely and isolated, and like I'm having to completely start my life over again. It sucks living with my parents after having been on my own for the last couple years. I'm not even close to ready to start dating yet, and the only worthwhile thing I'm really doing for myself at the moment is trying to lose weight, as I have quite a bit to lose. Even if I was ready to start dating again, I likely wouldn't because I'd like to lose this extra weight before I start meeting new people.

Naturally I'm a pretty introverted person, but I really miss the comfort and company of spending my free time with my ex. I am seeing a doctor tomorrow to talk about going on depression medication (as I do have diagnosed depression) because although I've been dealing with it on my own unmedicated for years, it's really starting to get to me with everything that's changed in my life.

Does anyone have any advice?",30Oct2018,1

That job offered me over 100k with overtime, pension, 401k 457 and full benefits. It was the perfect job. Fast forward to now I started going to the gym in February and am in the best shape of my life and I decided to go back to school in September because I didn’t want to feel worthless.

My first option is a psych degree. I like studying psychology and the idea of being a therapist but that requires a master's degree and I don't want to do that...so I could have a lower level psych job? But I also have extreme anxiety and paranoia so I don't know if it would cause me to become more suspicious of people or try to read their intentions more idk. 

My second option is banking. The degree I'd need for that I guess would be business. I don't mind being a teller that only requires hs. With a business degree (even just associate's) I could probably get a nice banking job. Or become a manager somewhere...and I like the idea of being a personal banker. And I like benefits &amp; going home at 5pm because I'm paranoid about going outside after dark. But I don't want to become bored and feel sad about my life bc of a paper job.

My third option is early childhood education. It deals with psychology and development which I'm very much interested. But I have zero experience with small children. I don't know how to talk to them, I'm sure it's like talking to a dog somewhat, ask questions etc. But disciplining children that are barely 2-4 years old seems like a task Id find confusing.

401,"26 yr old female here, I don't know how to proceed with this situation without making it worse. Please any advice is greatly appreciated. 

Back story: I am the supervisor at my job, frequently I give my employees my personal phone number in case they need to talk to me outside of work. I do not have a company phone. It comes in handy for many employees but obviously there are some bad apples in every bunch.  Along came this woman who we could tell was a bit unstable, she would blow things out of proportion and constantly fight with and bully people. She would also frequently try to get me in trouble by going over my head and calling my boss to complain anytime I said one little thing she disagreed with. Never got me in trouble, my boss could see through her crazy.

Why did we keep her on the job? No good excuse. We were short staffed, desperate, and frankly my company gives bad employees way too many chances before they are let go. I feel the need to add she came from a temp agency, and she was never hired full time under our company. Eventually she resigned out of the blue one day. Good riddance. She change her mind and called the main office asking for her job back less than a day after she resigned, we of course didn't hire her. Did not hear anything from her for a couple of months and pretty much forgot all about her. 

I never answer numbers that I do not recognize. I get A LOT of spam calls pretty much every day, and have been for probably at least a year. The usual: we have important time sensitive information about your student loan, car warranty etc. I know this from the voicemails they leave, not from picking up when they call. Funny because I never had a student loan (Never went to college) nor a car warranty. I know a lot of people get these spam calls so it's just one of those things. Anyways, my point is that I am no stranger to random numbers calling and I know how to handle them to an extent. 

So roughly 2 weeks ago I get yet another random number calling, ignore as usual and I go back to sleep. Well this one leaves a voicemail and it's crazy lady that used to work for me. First she calls me by  the name of another one of my employees, let's call her Nadia. She basically says ""Hey Nadia, I miss you, where you been girl. Call me let's talk"" or something along those lines. The only weird part about this is that when you call my phone and get my voice mail it says: ""you have reached the voicemail of My full name"". 

I told one of the other supervisors about her and he pointed out that she was probably trying to get me to call her back and tell her I have the wrong number just so she could get me on the phone. Possible, so I went back and blocked the number that she had called me from. I also told Nadia that crazy lady called me looking for her. When she did work with us they were sort of friends. Nadia said she had no interest in talking to crazy lady and hasn't since she quit.

 Today I get 3 calls in a row from another number I didn't recognize. On the 3rd one I ignored the call and of course it was crazy lady and she left me a voice mail. Still  ""thinking"" that I am Nadia and that she has been trying to get a hold of Nadia, really needs to talk to her, etc. 

This is where I need advice. At what point do these calls become harassment? When, if they continue, do I report this to the police, or should I? Should I call her back and tell her this is not Nadia' s phone? Even though it clearly states my name when you reach my voicemail...? I can't tell if calling her will make things worse or if she really believes she has the right number. Thank you for reading this, hope someone will know what to do. ",30Oct2018,1
402,"Might sound like an overly dramatic statement to make, but hear me out:

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger and first discovered the internet, it was magical: to find out that not only were there other people out there who shared my interests, but belonging to a community of people who create and discuss things with me. As a socially awkward child who loved Pokemon and drawing, I loved it. (Probably too an obsessive degree, but more on that later...)

&amp;#x200B;

As time went on, I would come to enjoy watching: video game lets plays, reviews, fan animations, remixes, fan art and such. I promised myself that when I was more skilled and confident in myself, I would give back to those I enjoy by making my own content; like the ones listed above. While I would have loved to turn it into a potential career, I understood that was unlikely and i'd most likely settle for doing it as a hobby. It didn't matter to me so long as people enjoyed my stuff!

&amp;#x200B;

But, (as some of you may already be aware) Europe plans to implement a new copyright directive and it includes the all too controversial ""Article 13"" which sees every website being liable for user uploaded content which could be considered copyright infringing and would require implementing a filter. While the article no longer specifies that websites NEED to use content ID filtering, it seems like the only feasible way to monitor the abundance of uploads. For example: 300 hours of video content is uploaded to YouTube EVERY MINUTE! This is bad as copyright filters are known to make mistakes; so even perfectly legal content could be blocked.

&amp;#x200B;

People point out that: ""maybe it won't happen"" or ""maybe it won't be so bad"", but all research I do seems to point towards me having every reason to be scared of this article 13 because it essentially impacts not only what I consume online but everything I wanted to make and contribute to. I guess I won't really know the impact this could have until it's possibly implemented and how it will actually affect me, but it's hard to remain optimistic when such a disastrous law is so close to become a reality.

&amp;#x200B;

It may sound over dramatic, but this has left me laying around the house; depressed and unmotivated: What's the point in trying to pursue creative avenues when people probably won't even be able to SEE what I create? I can't even enjoy the things I like because there's this nagging voice in the back of my head that reminds me: ""This might be at risk thanks to article 13"". I don't know what to do with myself anymore; the internet is everything to me; what else do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose it's not definitely going to happen, but one thing is for sure; I have 2 years until it's possibly implemented. Should I even try to make content now?

403,"I have been in two long term relationships through my 20s. I am 29 now. I recently ended an engagement. I am having trouble being happy long term. I truly felt in love with my ex but as the wedding approached his inability to help me in all aspects of life became more apparent to me. I was scared to deal with the bad for the rest of my life. I am the type of person who holds on to a relationship for as long as possible until it becomes obvious it can not continue. Though I seem to be the one to come to this conclusion every time. I find myself feeling that I will never be happy with someone longer than 5ish years as that seems to be my threshold for trying to hold on to the relationship. 

I know people tell you to hold out and that relationships have ups and downs. Which is true. I know I should try and fix as much as possible but I seem to get broken down where I stop caring about myself and only worry how they feel. My family told me I broke his heart and that this is my fault. Which is true. I did. I know I did. But I had been feeling uncomfortable about marriage up to that point and if I didn't say something wouldn't it have been worse? November 3rd would have been our wedding date and I have been increasingly more down due to it coming up. I don't know how to tell when something is worth sticking to anymore.

I put them before me so many times and I never seem to get the same back.

I have a lot of mental issues due to the way life and people treated me, but most relevant is my anxiety. I’m not on any meds because I’m too damn anxious to bring it up to anyone. 

I’m in a musical “branch” of high school and my main instrument is the voice. There are three classes where I need to sing; choir (which is fine because we are about 60 people singing at the same time so no one can hear me), band (which is going terrible, but we don’t get a grade for that, so it’s okay), and one-on-one singing lessons (which is a major issue).

I’m just so terrified of singing when someone can hear me. I’m not good, I’m not bad, I know that if I actually sing I can improve. But when I try to sing in front of anyone I just can’t. I’m terrified that they’ll think that I’m bad, and seeing as the teachers I have also are professional opera singers it’s even harder because they are the epitome of perfect technique and voice. 

I have been told that I have a very lovely voice by many, but due to previous life experiences I can never see my self as good enough and as a result nothing comes out when I try to sing.

I wish I could take my time, but if I don’t sing I won’t get a grade and that would open a whole can of worms. :/

It's a very wealthy area and things like burglaries, muggings, etc rarely happen. When they do, everyone hears about it. My mom is pressuring me to buy a home in the area. The only issue is that it's extremely expensive, both with property values and HOA, which runs $300+ a month. I am frugal and would much rather buy a home in a cheaper area. I'm not going to have kids, so the schools are irrelevant.

But cheaper areas = lower income = more crime. I'm okay with that. I rarely go outside which makes my risk much lower and the first thing I would do if there's a risk is fortify my door frame.

Though my mom is adament that I should not buy a home in an area that has a reputation for being lower-class. I know I don't need her approval to buy a home, but I'd like to have it. If for no other reason that I know if I move to an area she doesn't like she will never stop giving me shit for it.

420,"Idk I got in a weird mindset when I was high earlier. I feel like I'm bad at contributing to conversations. But I don't know if I'm overreacting.

Like in sixth form my group didn't speak a lot, like we hung out and chatted but some days we just sat there not really speaking much.

Now I'm in second year of university and I feel like I'm pissing off my housemates. Like if I'm sober ill be able to make some conversation, there will be times where its silent but I never pay attention to it. But recently when high I'm always thinking if I'm being too quiet. Like does my housemates hate hanging out with me because I don't speak much. Like since I started thinking this way Ive actually spent more time in my room. My housemate is usually in the living room and my rooms downstairs. Like is it okay if I leave my room without saying anything to make some food or have a cig.

I am a shy person, I've tried joining a society at my uni and at first I could barely speak, but I'm feeling more conformable making some general conversation. Like one of the guys is in the gym same time as me well chat for a bit before going off to do our workouts. But again should I leave it as that or try speaking to him later on. Idk I just don't want to annoy anyone.

Its just my mind goes blank when I'm with people, I'll usually say the first thing I can think of and sometimes I just can't think of anything. Especially if I'm high I can barely keep track of conversations so I can barely contribute.

Again Idk, Idk if I am too quiet or if I'm just paranoid of nothing and really it's okay if no ones speaking.",30Oct2018,1
421,"So there is a middle aged couple I know. My relationship with both individuals is pretty equal. The wife has been having an affair and the husband found out but she lied and said she stopped. About 6 months later she's still having an affair and the husband doesn't know (but it seems almost everyone around the couple does, mostly because the wife is a HUGE attention junkie) and the husband had starting talking to a female co-worker about the relationship problems with the wife (the ones he was aware of, they both do stupid stuff that causes problems but the wife in particular is actually really mean to him and in all honestly I believe is only still with him because she has to be and just purely to use him and his income) and the wife found out he had been talking to the woman and just talking. She flips out and they have a huge fight and somehow by the end of it he was guilted into taking out a loan to get her a boob job to make up for it. They have never been very well off and always try to live out of their means. For example the other day the wife told me that they are not making enough money to pay rent but still just took out a loan for her boob job. But I found out even after the husband took out the loan ( but the surgery hasn't happened yet) she is still sleeping with someone else and he doesn't know. Part of me is telling myself it's just not my business and the other part of me is saying that if I was in that situation I would definitely want someone to tell me. I have known them for years and the husband is a pretty nice guy, the type that would do anything for anyone who asked but the wife is really a pretty awful person. I know it sounds like I'm being biased but she's just the worst and not just because of what she's doing now. But what would you do in this situation?

434,"So my(f19) husband(m22) and I recently went through a very big ordeal. Long story short, I was sexually assaulted while stantioned overseas and he was back in the states and I became pregnant through said assault. I didn’t find out I was pregnant till late in the pregnancy and so I wasn’t able to have an abortion so I gave the baby up for adoption. Obviously this was a very traumatic experience for me and my husband and since we were separated for so long after I found out and told him, it just made things worse. He got really depressed and started drinking a lot to where he would get piss drunk pretty much every weekend till I was able to come back to the states. I’ve always had full trust in my husband till this happened. He would often text while he was drunk and I would ask him what he was doing, where he was at, etc. sometimes he was with his friends at a girls place. He wouldn’t give great details about what happened because he was so drunk and didn’t remember much. I would ask him what he did that night and he would say “nothing, just stayed home with..” but he obviously didn’t since he told me wasn’t the night before and even sent a snap of his friend driving. He also admitted to getting a girls number but throwing it away. My mother then tells me that I need to prepare myself for the worse because this has been such a toll on him and he could have done something stupid. That doesn’t help anything. Anyway I’m finally back in the states and everything is fine. After the birth he seems to have gone back to his old loving self and I’m very happy about that. But I still can’t stop thinking about before. I had told him that it would be okay if he just admitted it and he didn’t confirm nor deny it but just got annoyed that I suggested it. I was still pregnant at the time so I didn’t press because I was doing my best not to upset him in his already fragile state. The other day I went through his phone... I know, I know. I made myself that girl and I hate being that girl. I just couldn’t take not knowing and driving myself crazy. So I got his phone while he was asleep (it’s password protected), got his thumb and opened his phone. I looked through most of his stuff (I didn’t get to look through his pictures and snap because he moved and I got scared so I put it away) and some red flags stood out. 

1. A girl who he never mentioned before but apparently went to high school was messaging him. He was saying how he wished he had pictures of them together and then she sent some of them together but he looked younger so nothing recent. Then she said that they needed more for when they “got married💕” nothing about there conversation seemed like they were joking and most of it seemed pretty flirty.

2. I went through his twitter messages with another girl he went to high school with who he’s mentioned and that was the worst that I saw. Every time she changed her profile pic or posted a photo he would tell her she looked good. And I don’t mean just “you look good!” It was more flirty and then she said something about shooting his shot with another girl and he said that’s he’s trying with her(the girl he’s messaging) and she responded “you got a girl papa” and he responded with “I know, I need counseling or something.”

I know I must sound crazy but I just need some advice. I know the situation really wrecked him but it wrecked me too and he was acting more like a victim then I was. I’m still going through the trauma but acting like I’m fine because I don’t want to send him over the edge. I know he’s definitely not cheating currently because when he’s not at work he’s home and I know his work schedule. I just want to know if it did happen. But I broke his trust by going through his phone. I don’t like how he talked to those girls because I know he wouldn’t want me talking guys that way. Idk I’m just at a very low point in my self esteem and just life right now. I’m getting help but my appointment is not for a while and I need someone to tell me that I should either forget about it or confront him. We’re going back home soon for a few weeks and I know there’s going to be times that we will be separated because we’ll want to spend time with our friends. Well all my friends are females back home and some of his friends are the ones he was texting. My trust in people has diminished throughout this ordeal so I really don’t know what to do.

435,"I have known FormerFriend for a few years but she is a long-time friend of my fiancee. FF is nice but not great, kind but not generous, asks for help but often forgets to offer, scared so she doesn't try, has low self-esteem, and is envious that her own life isn't as good but won't work hard to make it better. I'm sure you know the type, lazy and messy but with potential. She's all these things but not actively a bad person, if you follow me.

PROBLEM: ShittyHusband seems to be manipulating FF. He sees her kinda-obvious weaknesses and exploits them. He knows she's a homebody so he keeps her home. He knows her friendships are weak so he drives a wedge. They got married and she didn't even *tell* us despite being her ""closest"" friends. He says the n-word and homophobic slurs, steals, called a gay friend of ours a pussy for his eating habits, (we believe) he has cheated on her, and he encouraged FF to drink at our engagement party until she passed out in front of my entire family.

I *know* that she's in a manipulative, unhappy marriage and she *may* be depressed and she *may* be latching on to someone who she sees as a strong figure in her life but is actually sucking her dry. The fact that he hasn't hit her yet (to my knowledge) doesn't mean that he's not a real piece of shit who's actively exploiting someone with weaknesses to make her weaker and more dependent.

So my question is how far should I go to help her figure her shit out?

Tl;Dr: I believe a casual friend is being manipulated by her obviously shitty (but not violent) husband. Odds are she won't even listen to me as I believe she's being fed lies about us to turn her against us. If she happens to read this post, she'd feel offended instead of reflective. She seems to have no help, not from her family and certainly not from herself. Does being weak mean she doesn't deserve help? Weak people are the ones who *need* the help, right?",30Oct2018,1

About half a year ago I applied as an surveyor at my countries government. I have 2 degrees and 9 years of experience in the field  I applied for.
Nevertheless I was only second at the end of the auditions. Someone else i never got to know was chosen for the job. The guy from the government told me the guy who got the job was equally qualified but was only chosen due to a closer place of residence. I may also note that the job I applied for makes me about 25% less money yet because it's a governmental job is super safe!

Today I learned the other guy was some newly graduate with low to none experience. The head of the governmental office was not pleased with his performance and therefor he will not be working in this position furthermore.  I have strong suspicions that they had to choose him because of some relations (that's something super austrian!)

The usual, not my “regular” account, the names and situations have been slightly altered for privacy. The problem is the same. 
Anyway on to the problem. 

I had a great life. My friends and I have a business together. Have had for almost 15 years. And all this time things have been good. Really good. We all do holidays together, eat dinner at each other’s house. The works. 
Until about 2 years ago.  I started to notice changes in one of the friends. We will call him “a”. Small things like forgetting little things and a lot of unnecessary anger. It’s covered up a lot by his partner. But still the business functions the same. Life is good. 
About a month ago my partner, we will call her “b” is having a not so great day, not terrible, so that someone would notice, just off. Well A starts problem with B. There is a large screaming match and A comes to me and says the B is a problem and has been for a long time, A is sick of the bullshit. Uhg, ok??? I was confused to say the least. 
B says to me later that day that she didn’t realize there was that big of a problem. B takes it upon herself to get counseling and meds!  Ok that seems a lot extreme, but she is proving to A that if there is a problem, she is on top of Fixing it. 
So here the real strange part and the part that is eating me alive. All of them have effectively burn noticed me. I have no info on the business, no say in how things are ran. (That used to be my job almost solely). No one is talking, about anything, A refuses to even set foot in the door if B is here.  And now there is talk of dissolving it all together. 
This is my passion. I love this place and have literally put my blood, and life into this place. But because of the rift between them, my job is no longer?  I am left confused and scared. If this dissolves I can loose my house, my car, and I have a kid at home still. 
I am so confused as to why grown adults want to act like they are in high school and can’t just have a civil conversation. Just because you don’t agree with someone is not a reason to be this extreme.

She is very aggressive with messaging. She sends multiple messages and gets upset if I take a while to answer. She was pressuring me to talk with her over the phone and was stuck in an incredibly long call with her. It was mostly her talking, she never really let me speak and I didn’t really know what to say anyways. I finally make up an excuse to leave and hang up. Not even a minute passes before she blows up my phone with texts. 

She’s moving so fast. We met a couple days ago and she already is making plans for me to go visit her family and stay the night at her sister’s house and she already talked about me to her friends. It’s overwhelming. Also, she admitted last night that she had feelings for me. We have barely talked, and it’s making me very uncomfortable.

The biggest thing that stands out is that she brags about being in a gang and has anger issues that she is trying to control. I don’t like that, but she also doesn’t really respect me. She talks over me, she disregards my identity, and just doesn’t seem to care at all.

I know there are tons of red flags and I want to end it now. My friends told me to just ghost her but I find that unfair and rude and will only make her angry and upset.

I will leave a message or maybe phone when I am leaving so they know that I'm gone but I want to do something like call 111 in case that they do contact the police.

Also I'm in the uk and if I need to go to another country is it possible to be able to apply for any jobs/to be able to prepare for moving countries from this one without having to do anything in post etc that would give it away to my family?

There's two years between me and my best friend, I'm in university and she's in her last year of school. I've been feeling kinda bad recently cause she hangs out with her other friends without me. I understand that we don't have to hang out all the time but I don't like hearing all the things she's doing cause she never even invites me. The first time was when she was hanging out with a guy called Michael and then when I saw her again she said he'd invited his friends along but she hadn't invited me and I felt kinda annoyed. Then she told me about a party that her school has this Friday and I hinted that I  wanted to be invited but she didn't say anything. Then today she cancelled us going to the gym cause she's going to the cinema with her friends and again she didn't invite me. I know she doesn't mean to hurt my feelings or anything but I'm feeling left out and annoyed that she talks about things she's doing with her friends without inviting me.
Should I tell her how I'm feeling or should I just accept that she has other friends and she won't invite me to things? I'd be grateful for any advice.

\-My mom was 47 when she gave birth, and I know she had a lot of trouble getting pregnant.

\-My mom is one of four girls, but none were able to have children naturally (all adopted, I have no biological cousins).

&amp;#x200B;

I was reading online that the odds of having healthy children with your own eggs after age 45 are less than 1%... yet here I am.  That coupled with the fact that IVF was used, and some possible genetic factors (both my parents have light eyes and mine are brown, I'm taller than both my parents, and I have a 'cleft chin' which is supposedly dominant, yet neither of my parents do), I'm starting to seriously suspect I'm not biologically related to them, or my mother at least. I had always assumed that she did IVF with her own eggs, but now I see that its pretty unlikely.

&amp;#x200B;

The more I think about it the more it makes sense that I wouldn't be related to them, and at this point I can't stop thinking about it. I'm nearly certain they wouldn't tell me if I straight out asked them, but I really want to know for sure and I think I have a right to know. I just don't want my ancestry to be a lie, and I do plan on having children down the road so I'd like to know my genetic history. I have asked before if I'm really related to them, and the answer is always ""yes"".  I don't think they plan on telling me.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends have said I should take a DNA test (like ancestry) that shows your relatives, since I know a lot of my family has taken the test and they would show up if we were related. Am I being crazy about the whole thing? What should I do? And if I do find out my parents have been lying...do I confront them? ",30Oct2018,1

I was a terrible child growing up, enabling parents. That equals terrible person. The thing is that I don't know how to be selfless or offer help at all. I deliberately avoid the house if I know cleaning day is coming up or if I feel like that's something we're about to do.

Haven't offered help once.

I don't know what's wrong with me. Looking at my youth and who I am now, I see ASPD written all over me. I can't be a good person, I'm too selfish.

455,"Apologies ahead of time as english is not my first language.

So for about two months I [20M] have been seeing this girl [18F]. Everything seemed to be going amazing, we both liked each other a lot and both seemed to think the relationship was going to last a while. 

This last weekend she came over to talk and we did our normal routine at first, talked about our days, what our plans were for the week, cuddled for a bit, etc. It all seemed fine.

Then I asked her what she wanted to talk about, she wanted to wait a little bit and keep up the good mood but I pressed to discuss it at that moment. She went on to tell me how she doesn't think shes in a place where she can give me 100% and that she didnt think it was fair to me for her to be with me, this was all because she had residual feelings for an on-and-off ex. She said that she wanted to be with me but didnt think that would be fair to me, and wished she didnt have these feelings for her ex.

She said that she wanted time alone to work things out for herself, to which I agreed to. 

I requested that we talk in the next few days as the break up has been tearing me apart and I was caught off guard. This is the first girl I've felt a real connection with since my last LTR ended 2 years ago. Shes the only girl I've met since who I thought it would be worth it to start a relationship with and I was looking forward to building something meaningful with her. I want to tell her these things but I'm not sure if I should, I dont want her to feel like I'm guilting her into choosing to stay with me. 

Any advice on how to go about this conversation? Should I tell her what I wrote here? Anything to avoid?",30Oct2018,1

I'm a male grown adult. My brother is born when I was 16, so we have a huge age gap. We have another brother who's just 8 years younger than me so we have 8 years gap for each. During my lil' baby brother's entire babyhood/toddlerhood, I was like the third parent(Mom&amp;Dad both alive), as I took care of everything like feeding him with formula, having him midday sleeps, taking him to doctor, playing with him etc. So I have very deep bond with him as I enjoyed spending time with my little brother. But as he grow older, he started to complain about me that how I was still treating him like a baby. And I was joking to myself how I'm like those  ""I still see you as baby"" type parents, but I'm just a big brother. One day, before the week his middle school starts, he started to yell at me with ""Don't get involved in everything!"", after I protected him against the silly jokes that my dad made which make him very angry. And I was like super mad at that point,  he was bossy and grumpy, and I told him back ""I'm not gonna forget this attitude of yours"", and he went like ""Like I so care""... Since that day I started to act bitter and cold, but like in bitter way that I act towards my other brother. Like scolding him about wrongdoings, being strict, talking with distant tones so they don't cross the line of respect. Before that I was treating him like fragile baby, I probably spoiled him very very much. I want him to understand his mistake, but I'm also feeling like I am going too far, I might be drastically too cold? But I don't want to be end up in the same situation where he goes with the same disrespectful attitude,  I don't want to be yelled by 16 years younger kid. My mom even criticised me for how I am being so harsh against him. I don't know what to do at this point. Of course he's growing, he should be having his space, but I don't accept those disrespecting bossy attitudes which not even my other brother has ever dare to do to me. Be brutal at advising people, if I'm the problem.

TL;DR: I spoiled my brother who's 16 years younger than me for his entire life. He yelled me claiming as he doesn't want me to get involved everything, I got butthurt and started to act cold, bitter, strict against him instead of super loving big brother.",30Oct2018,1

I tried to close but the phone wouldn’t allow it, I guess because the call prompt kept popping up. I tried to shut phone off but it just gave me the loading circle and locked. When I opened it back up and went to Firefox focus the website was no longer there. I then typed in a website normally and it gave me a 503 error, tried again and everything has been fine since.

462,"He's a first time manager but he has been at the company in another role for a long time.  I've been here about 1.5 years.  He's been my manager for the past 8 months or so.

Basically, he provides almost zero positive recognition and genuinely seems to want me to fail.  The lack of praise wouldn't bother me so much, except that he fawns over and praises three other people on our team, and practically ignores the other three (I'm in the ""ignore"" camp).  I didn't mind being ignored, but it often feels like he actively roots against me, and doesn't want me to do well.  If I make a mistake, even a small one, he immediately goes into a speech about ""This mistake does not meet the expectations of your seniority level.""  He will do this with one-off mistakes as if they are longstanding patterns.  For example, I made a scheduling error about 4 months ago that had minor to no negative impact.  He gave me the ""expectations"" talk which freaked me the hell out, I apologized profusely.  I mentioned the mistake to my coworkers, who thought it was so minor that it didn't even deserve a conversation.  Then just a few days ago, I made a similar mistake and he brought up the example from 4 months ago as if it happened the day before.  Again I apologized and took total responsibility, but he still sent me an email detailing that ""this mistake does not meet the expectations of your seniority level.""  It feels like every mistake is a 5-alarm fire, and I don't even make mistakes that often.  I asked my coworkers about the 2nd mistake and they again didn't think it even warranted an email, let alone a meeting to discuss it.  

Meanwhile, my positive contributions?  Almost no recognition.  Around the office by other people, I'm seen as a good performer.  More junior employees have asked me to mentor them.  I'm always looking for ways to do better.  But my manager and I recently had a 1:1 and I was so excited to share all the things I accomplished that week.  He merely nodded and then said he was sleep deprived and tired when I asked him if he was OK.  

Meanwhile, he seems to have a few ""golden children"" on our team (usually single young women, not saying that's the reason but it's what I've noticed.)  He will chat with them, joke around with them, and praise them even for the most minor of accomplishments.  One of them told me he has never once given her constructive feedback, which is honestly shocking considering she's fairly new and still learning.  He frequently discusses his personal dating life with them, makes personal jokes with them (nothing illegal or sexual, but stuff that one would do with a close friend- meanwhile me? Barely speaks to me.)

As for the other people in the ""less favorite"" pile, one woman is repeatedly in tears due to him repeatedly criticizing her.  She's developed PANIC ATTACKS that she wasn't getting prior to working with him and now needs to see a therapist.  It seems like he is constantly raising the bar on her and is never happy with her work no matter how hard she tries.  He repeatedly says demotivational things to her that make her think she has no hope.  That's how I'm beginning to feel.  It sucks.

I understand I have made some mistakes that were worth mentioning, and there are things I could do better, but isn't that true of everyone?  There's NO way I'm the only one on the team (other than the girl with the panic attacks) who's double-booked something, or forgot to send one email.  Why does it feel like I'm the only one getting crap for these things?

If this were my previous manager, I'd deliver feedback directly.  But my manager isn't a good listener.  I've tried to talk to him about how anxious I feel about my performance and he goes into this scripted mode that doesn't help, it almost is like he's actually not hearing me.  But I'm also afraid that speaking to his manager (who has an open-door policy for this kind of thing, so that actually wouldn't be super inappropriate but it is a big move), or speaking to HR, would be causing drama that wasn't there in the first place.

I know the panic attack girl has spoken to HR, but I'm not sure where those conversations have gotten her.  So HR already knows there are issues with this manager- I don't know if a second person coming forward would make a difference.  Anyway, I don't want him to be punished, I just want to be treated fairly!

I should clarify that my company doesn't fire anyone without a performance plan, and people get fired very rarely (I've never seen anyone get fired for performance related reasons, honestly) but I can't deal with this constant stress and anxiety.  I'm constantly on edge dreading the next time I have to interact with my manager.  It sucks.

What should I do?  I love my job despite not being my manager's biggest fan, and I don't want to look for a different job.

464,"I KNOW ITS LONG BUT I REALLY NEED HELP OR MY FRIENDS MAY TURN ON EACH OTHER.

My friend group(8 people)is very tight, but accepting of new friends; something I am proud of and take most of the credit for(since I make most of the new friends). But recently, we have encountered a problem(s), there has been a lot of unnecessary drama. 

It all started a week before school; I dumped this girl because she was really clingy and annoying from her texts the days after I said it, she seemed to think it was for the best, too. Well, I’ll get to that in a little while. Fast forward two weeks, and on Monday, one of my friends stops talking to another one of my friends. You can tell he’s angry at him, I do more poking than I should have, and then he explodes on his girlfriend and this other friend. Since these are two main characters, the guy who was angry I’ll call Gary, and the guy who was exploded on is called Zander., These may or may not be my hamster’s and my dog’s names.

Anyway, Gary is mad at Zander for flirting with his girlfriend, and our friend group (plus some other friends outside of the clique)is divided into two factions for the first time, with me and my best friend staying neutral and ultimately deescalating the situation. Gary’s girlfriend is dumped after this situation. 

I make it EXTREMELY clear to Zander that this girl is off limits, you can’t do that to one of your best friends; he says he understands and lays off for a bit. Oops, a week later the tension is so high you can cut it with a fucking butter knife. Gary decides being angry isn’t worth it, and completely cuts ties with his ex, evolving her into the stage two Pokémon of crazy psycho bitch. She relentlessly flirts with Zander and hates Gary, who is now going through a sad time. One of my friends from elementary school, who we’ll call Rose, is moving and changing schools. Rose is really nice, funny and honestly, really fucking hot. I’ve never liked her, but Gary did, even during his relationship. This information was learnt by his ex and drove forward into the whole flirting with Zander thing. 

Anyway, Gary won’t talk to anyone again, but this time it’s because of Jaylyn. Our PR with the main girl friend group is rapidly deteriorating, and only me and my best friend are trying to bail the water out of the boat. I start realizing this boat is sinking, and I’m not going down with it. I make closer connections with another friend group who was much more stable, anti-drama, but still a lot like us. This is around the first week of October, just to give a timeframe.

As I’m making connections, shit goes south between Zander and Gary over a whole bunch of stupid shit they were emotionally attached to. He starts saying his ex was Zander’s girlfriend, deteriorating PR even more. As I’m repairing these relationships, over the course of two weeks, I realized something, that I was start ping to like a girl(I still do), but I ain’t getting into that. So long story short, my plate is really full, and I can’t deal with all of this. Before I get to the next thing, there is another little problem that has been around since elementary school, Zander is a ladies man, but without the confidence in the end game. So as Zander gets all these girls to like him, he doesn’t have the fucking balls to ask them out in the end, leaving them pissed. This has picked up pace recently, and has started to become a root for all these problems(lots of minor incidents I have put mentioned, too)So I devise a master plan to fix all of it; find out what ales Zander so irresistible. 

Now, I’ve been thinking about this since last May, so I conducted a closed experiment at my summer camp, follow the Zander method and see what happens. It fails miserably and I lose my rep.

What’s that about my reputation? Oh yeah, remember *MY* crazy ex. No? Well she’s still here anyway, insulting behind the scenes without me knowing. So that’s why people have given me weird looks around the school, eh? Well I had a talk and she came out mor episode. So my reputation as the cool and confident guy just went in the shredder. So my master plan is down the drain. Now I have to use a girl I have been friends with since the 2nd grade to understand what makes Zander so appealing. 

High risk, High reward. I may risk my standing with the entire school, possibly even the teachers, to save my friend group. I really love these guys, and I think it may be worth it, but I really need to lower the risk. 

How can I do that? Do you see another way that involves much lower risk? I need your help because I’m standing alone and looking at either a deep and hot hell or a golden castle, and there isn’t any in between. Remember I’m not here to debate if, only how. I’ve made up my mind on if I’ll do it, I just need more(outside) input. Everyone I ask has feelings attached to it, and I need to go off of what will work. 

Please help. Thank you for reading.",30Oct2018,1
465,"Long story, she hit me up a few months prior and we started hitting it off again. We never were all that serious in college, but that was mostly me being unavailable and dumb. I knew she had recently broken up with her bf of one year (she told me), so I didn’t want to rush up to visit just to be a booty call (she lives a few hours away, and I’m not that type of person).

We texted/talked daily for a couple months, and she made it very clear she wanted to see me. I figured after a few months, odds are that she has had enough time to move on and neither of us would be taking advantage of one another. 

Also she had just moved out of her parents house and now had a place of her own, so everything seemed to line up. She took a couple of days off of work, and I ended up visiting for a long weekend. 

We had fun, but only had actual sex on one of the three nights. It was after a fair amount of drinking, and I don’t exactly remember the entire night. I didn’t wrap it up (I know, I’m an idiot!), but I don’t remember finishing and I’m pretty sure I would have if I did. We both got a little sick over the next couple days, so we spent the rest of the trip mostly cuddling and watching movies. 

Cue to me leaving, we hug/kiss goodbye, and continued talking over the next few days about meeting up again. Everything seemed good, but we texted less and less over the next week, and I started to feel she wasn’t all that interested (no big deal, that’s fine). She expressed that she wasn’t being distant because she was uninterested, she said that something crazy just  happened in her life and she was trying to deal with it. 

I understand as my life has been pretty crazy this past year or two, and I tell her if she needs to deal with this issue herself, then that’s what she has to do. I ask if she wants to keep in touch as friends, and she seemed hurt as if I was the one who wasn’t interested (so I thought I F’d up). 

A few days after that she deleted me on Snapchat, so I figured that was that. Either she was lying or she did still have feelings and didn’t want updates on my life (we’re still friends on Facebook but I hardly ever use that). As I said before it doesn’t really matter why, I just knew she didn’t want to talk to me. 

I’m a little hurt from being ghosted (sort of), then fast forward a few more months and my friend sends me a link on FB of her pregnancy announcement. The post had her bf tagged in it, but the due date was too sketchy. Cue my mini heart attack (even though I’m 99% sure the kid isn’t mine, that 1% is still way too much for comfort).

Obviously this kid (her bf/ex) had some say in what they did with the pregnancy, as she did name him the father (thankfully). I doubt she told him that she fooled around within weeks of their child’s conception, and that is something I would really want to know if I was about to have a kid with someone. However, I don’t want to insert myself into this whole mess.

Should I tell him something happened? What should I do?

466,"So a little back story first. I have a bachelors degree in Economics and Finance already, with which I graduated in May. Upon graduating I realized I really loved the mathematics of finance and economics and want to go into financial engineering. That being said any decent masters program requires a strong math tool kit so I decided to go back to school for a second degree in math. 

I have been looking for a part time job and recently a full time job as a financial analyst at a large company (Fortune 75) kind of “fell into my lap”. The position is more of an FP&amp;A role so not necessarily what I am interested in. That being said I like company and the salary is good. 

However, the trouble comes with schedule. While I can go school part time, I am more than half way through this semester and will likely have to withdraw from my current classes due to the start date of this job. And yes I have already asked them to push the start date as far back as possible. This further I would most likely only be able to take 1 or 2 classes moving forward and effectively have to start over. This would double the amount of time it takes to graduate. 

My ultimate decision is not financially motivated as I have enough savings to get by until I graduate. It is really between the dilemma of getting experience in a professional environment within a tangential field from my ultimate goal or turning down the offer and finishing  school sooner to peruse the industry I am more interested in.

467,"Probably going to come off as a rant or a ramble, but I'll tell anyway.

I have a low income family. It's me, my dad, and several other siblings. 

Here's my situation. My father lives off of checks and help from the government, and refuses to work even though he can. He got a part time job once and quit two weeks later. 

I have much younger siblings, that if needed, could stay with some family that live only a few minutes away, while my father could work. 

Getting nice new clothes is rare. Food at home is always scarce. 

What happens, is, my dad gets a paycheck. He goes shopping once a month and buys a lot of groceries. 

Because we have such a large family with very little income, and we almost always have no food, we will quickly eat the food, because we never have any around. 

The food lasts no more than a week. And my dad doesn't even buy stuff like Ramen Noodles (that would really help) because ""it's unhealthy, and has too much salt."" Which it does, but starving and getting really little nutrients is also unhealthy.

My older brothers are old enough for jobs, one has a job, but they don't help, they don't even try.

Even when having the breakfast and lunch the school provides, it does very little. School lunch is garbage and unhealthy, and even when being teenagers, we get the same proportions as kindergarteners. 

My father is also an alcoholic in denial. He would much rather spend the child support money feeding his alcoholism, than feeding his children. 

When I try to talk to my dad about being hungry, and there being no food, he goes off on an angry rant. 

I get so hungry to the point that I get horrible headaches, which I've never gotten before. 

The school I go to is very shitty, so I don't know how much they could help. Should I still try to talk to a counselor or teacher? ",30Oct2018,1

469,"I am going to try to make this brief and am looking for suggestions and not judgment.  My marriage is basically over; neither I nor my husband like each other but have to stay together for a few more years for financial reasons so I am not looking for judgment or morally based answers.  I have never cheated on my husband prior to this.  My coworker is unhappily married as well but has cheated on his spouse before.

I am a 33 year old female who has worked with a 40 year old married male for almost 10 years now.  Throughout the past 10 years, my coworker has repeatedly made comments about how he finds me attractive and wanted to ask me out when we first met (and were single).  Recently, the comments have increased and finally I gave him my number to text me.

For the first 5 days after giving him my number, my coworker texted me nonstop.  I never initiated the conversation.  He would also come find me at work to visit.  At work, he is also constantly touching me (like hand between legs under the desk, touching my breasts, my butt, etc.) when no one is watching.  Eventually, we discussed sleeping together and were both on board with the idea.  Then he stopped texting.  The touching while at work has continued and is still frequent though.  I have asked him to meet me to sleep together a few times now but each time he has made an excuse.  Finally, I told him if he had changed his mind, that is okay but I would like to know.  He told me he didn't change his mind and that he still wants to sleep with me.  

I decided I was sick of waiting and have not texted him in over a week.  He has not texted me either.  Common sense tells me he changed his mind and does not want to continue otherwise he would have made it a priority.  My questions are:

1.  Do you agree he changed his mind?
2.  Why does he insist he didn't and continue to touch me all the time?
3.  Why touch me if we aren't actually going to sleep together?
4.  Should I text him and ask him wtf happened or will that make me look pathetic and I should just wait to see what happens and continue to not text him?

I would have to be interviewed of course but she said she wanted me for that position. I’ve heard the pay is good ($17-$20 an hour). The hours are scheduled by the us (there are people already in that job but one is quitting soon) telling her what we can work and her filling out the schedule. 

My questions are: Is the money worth it if I dread the job? Should a 19 year old have a job with many responsibilities involved? And what would you do if you were in my place?",30Oct2018,1
472,"Hi, this is my first post on Reddit (discluding the repost on r/relationship_advice, so please bear with me).

I have known this friend since we were little and she's someone I really care about and really wanted her to be a part of my life after high school. Let's call her BF. Unfortunately, after the events of the last month, I'm not so sure on how things are going to work out.

Now I just want to make a clarification before we start, mental illness is a very serious issue and I don't want to downplay any of it. However, my friend (BF) has had a habit of saying things like this casually to many people and then refusing to talk about it and answer any questions on it, making it seem fishy considering other evidence. But please read the story before commenting! Thanks!

BF is crazy smart and both of us have relied on each other whenever we were stressed, so I've seen her upset before and vice versa. However, BF goes on a 2 week bender that seems out of the blue. This happens after she throws me under the bus for something (this is important!). BF says she's ugly and that her mom told her that as well and advised her to get plastic surgery and BF believed that would fix all her problems. BF also stated that she felt insecure dressing nice because she didn't like that people would compliment her because it brought attention. BF stated that she hated being around our friends or going out with them because they wanted to take pictures and they were pretty. BF then goes on to say that no one will ever love her because she is ugly despite having a boyfriend who really cares about her (not to mention, a score). Being a friend, I consoled her by pointing out how she had friends and a boyfriend that loved her and weren't trying to be mean and that she was not ugly. BF dismisses my claims and tells me it's not a big deal, but she starts to act very strange, and other people pick up on it (she cut out our friend group and yelled at them). Obviously, I'm worried and another friend (let's call her CC) tells me more erratic things BF has been telling her. Apparently, BF has been sneaking out of the house and drinking, BF has said she's on meds for anxiety and that her 5th grade sister has SAD (seasonal affective disorder), and BF is broke. All this information that CC told me was all new, and I was shocked BF hadn't talked to me about it considering I had known her for very long. I had just been through an EXTREMELY rough time in my life, so I was emotionally checked out with the dumpster fire that was going on around me. CC and I are BF's closest friends and CC didn't buy some of it, and to tell you the truth, neither did I mainly because of the way she told people. With all this information, she would just drop it as if it was no big deal and she would tell a lot of people about it, even going to the extent of tweeting about it?

&lt;p&gt;In regards to BF\&amp;#39;s mother telling her to get plastic surgery, I've known her parents very well. They love their daughter very much and wouldn't tell her to get plastic surgery. Although, if I have to give the benefit of the doubt, parents can be aloof and say mean things but I have a strong feeling I'm being lied to (she has a habit of lying). In regards to her being broke, both BF and I live in a town where under 1% of the population lives below the poverty line. Her parents recently purchased a Mercedes and they can afford to travel on vacation every year. In other words, although I don't know their exact financial status, I'm 99% sure they aren't broke. In regards to her drinking, I really doubt that she would drink alcohol (she's not really part of that partying crowd, so no access, also v tiny so I don't think she can process it without any of us knowing) and moreover, there's no way she snuck out of her house at 3 am to do this because her parents would notice. Although I think she has talked about meds once and her sister being sick (not having SAD), she's never really described anything in detail, which I get, but it's like anything she says now feels strange. What sucks about this entire situation is that there are people that BF and I both know closely that are struggling to go to college or actually don't have friends they can turn to, so I don't know why she's saying stuff like this. Since I've known her for a while and sense that this is not normal, I decide to talk to BF about it. I text her a paragraph 2 weeks into her weird behavior (this is where it goes wrong, I try to walk the very fine line of trying to understanding what's going on with her but also trying to let her know that it's a little fishy -- maybe I shouldn't have done that and I let my emotions get the best of me). The para goes along the lines of: ""hey you're not a burden and I love you. I felt disrespected when you threw me under the bus. and if I have to be honest with you, I'm tired of having to advocate for your behavior to other people because I don't know what's happening. It might be hard to open up, but we can either talk about it or do something about this because whatever is going on is not ok"". She texts me back with an apology saying that she was on a bender but she's fine, but fails to answer any of my questions regarding what she said. This is when sh\*t hits the fan. She tweets a whole twitter thread on me and how I made her feel like she was a burden, despite talking to me normally in school. I'm extremely confused and I need help. I really don't want to cut this person out of my life, but I don't want her thinking that I meant to hurt her, because I really did not mean to. If whatever happening is somehow true, I want to be there by her side because she's my friend. But if I'm being lied to, which CC and others strongly feel, I'm very upset and I don't want an apology, but rather an acknowledgement that it's not ok and she needs to stop.

I need advice on what the best thing for me to do right now is? Also for anyone who made it to the end, you a real one!

TL;DR: Friend starts acting strange, I think I'm being lied to but also I am concerned. I let friend know how I'm feeling. Friend tweets about me without talking to me. I am very confused and I don't know if she's telling the truth, making me feel like an ass for telling her my concerns, or if she's lying to me.",30Oct2018,1
473,"Hey guys! I recently moved from one country to another and I feel like my friend is trying to phase me out of their life. 

This friend and I were incredibly close. They even wrote me a heart felt letter before I left and said they wanted to stay in touch. They said they wanted to do it through letters but where I live the postal service is unreliable so I send her texts instead. 

I was friends with this person (Friend A) and another one too. The other person ( friend B) left me on read about two or three times when I texted them things like “hey! I hope you’re doing well! What’s new? About two or more weeks apart. I already stoped trying with that friend and it hurt because I didn’t think this person would freeze me out like this. I’m scare the same thing is happening again. 

About a month ago, I sent Friend A a text detailing what has happened in my life and asked them questions about their own. The friend saw the message and said “I’m gonna respond so don’t think I left you on read. Friend A did respond... two weeks later. 

I waited a while before sending Friend A another text. This time, they saw it but didn’t bother to write anything back. It has been a week.

I feel like I put effort into our friendship for nothing. I don’t know if Friend A is just flaky or doesn’t want me in their life. I’m afraid to ask because I don’t want to make them feel like I am ganging up on them. I just want to know if Friend A really does want to stay in contact and if not, why? 

Idk, I feel like I’m being ghosted by someone who I considered my best friend and it really hurts. Everyone thought this friend was nice other than one other really good friend of mine (Friend C). I am now starting to regret defending Friend A so much against Friend C.

Should I try to stay in contact with Friend A or do something else? What should I even say to them? I’m feeling really lost and kind of lonely. 

Also I am visiting the city I moved away from in a few months and I want to see Friend A, but not if they don’t want anything to do with me.

TL;DR: My friend keeps leaving me on read, idk if I should confront them or just stop talking to them. ",30Oct2018,1

475,I know most moms are different in a sense but mine really seems to be way different from other moms. My mom(41F) is the only person I(15M) live with along with my 3 year old brother. My mom is a bitch all day about 5 days a week. One thing happened at school today and really put me in a bad mood. As we were driving home I was trying to tell my mom about it but she couldn’t seem to stop interrupting me. Finally as we got home she interrupted me again and I just said “ok I’m done talking” got out of the car and walked inside and went to my room. Then as I’m in my room I hear her slamming the door pissed off and walks outside my door and says “You better stay in your room all day or I’ll probably kill you with my bare fucking hands.” This has happened for years and years of my life and my sister finally got away (f19) she’s in college currently not far from home but rarely sees our mom. My mom likes to blame it on the fact that she has pinned up anger and that it’s mostly our fault she lashed out like this. I don’t know what to think or do so any advice is appreciated.,30Oct2018,1

""Don’t talk about me again you have no right I do everything for this family. What do you contribute? Nothing.""

By the way she has a job and pays for stuff.

And then I replied with this:

""Money isn't everything. by that logic what does [little sister] contribute?""

Then later my mom picked me up from therapy and said that she would talk to my sister but she 
Was bawling her eyes out and that she thinks that we aren't greatful for everything that she does. (Which is her go-to move to take up for my sister)

And then she continued the text with this.

""Yeah I don’t just contribute money""

And I texted:

""Oh yeah, you also contribute a shit attitude.""

477,"So, I have a few things going on in my life right now and just want some advice on getting things back on track.


Basically, I'm just going through one of my lonely periods. I am in my early 20s and only have a couple of friends who I chat to every now and then by message. I work in a small company, where we are all fairly close due to the nature of the job and working away together regularly, however everyone is much older. Being so close though, we get to points were we just can't get along, due to disagreements and different mindsets.
I don't have a girlfriend, never have and I'm not really the social type, I'd much rather spend an evening at home, than go out (I also don't drink, so that doesn't help my socialising). 


Right now, life is tough, I'm struggling working with my boss due to differing opinions and really don't feel like it's the job for me anymore some days. I love the work though and some colleagues in particular, it's just I get so angry about everything going on, it's extremely difficult to keep positive, making it easy to be negative all day with my colleagues.


I come home to a loving family, but can't help feeling lonely. I chat to a few friends sometimes, but feel like I'm bothering them. Then occasionally my colleague messages and feel the same.

I want to get back in touch with a few old friends, but after 4 years I feel like it would just be too awkward. I tried getting back in touch with one guy about a year ago and feel he was living his own life now with new uni mates and living with his girlfriend and didn't really want to keep in regular contact anymore.


I want to feel more positive, I have been told that I appear to be looking for happiness in others, when I first need to be happier in myself. I need to not let all the little things in work bother me so much. Is there any advice I can find online that is recommended for boosting positivity?


The other thing is I would like to be a little more social, but putting everything together, it can be extremely difficult. Also, my family would wonder what's wrong with me if I tried to go out and meet people, they think I'm happy in my little bubble and would likely joke about it if I starting going out more.


Honestly, just finding myself a girlfriend, I feel would really be a boost that gets me out of my comfort zone a little, but ultimately just someone who I can tell everything to as and when it happens - a true best friend and comfortable together no matter what.

But before that I need to boost myself, I feel stuck. ",30Oct2018,1
478,"I guess I should start off with I’m new to reddit, I discovered that there are great communities on here and everyone has a place. If this doesn’t belong here please let me know and I’ll remove it within 16hrs (sleep and school)

Now that that’s out of the way. I’m (M18) and for the past month I’ve had a crush on a foreign exchange student (we can call her G) at my school (she speaks English extremely well). We’ve been talking (mostly in person) for about a month and half. We have hung out a fair amount. Three weeks ago we went to a haunted park thing and one of her close friends told me to wrap my arm around her and all that while we waited to enter. And then during she stayed close to me, held my hand and tucked her arm in mine. Two weeks ago one of her close friends told me that “G likes me but she doesn’t know what to do because she’s leaving in a year and she’s conflicted because she had a thing with a guy about two months ago. She doesn’t want a relationship right now, but you never know what could happen” literally those exact words. G knows I like her, and it’s obvious she likes me however in the past week it seems like she’s lost feelings. I know that you never know what’s going through someone’s head, but that’s just based off of actions and all that. However I do know that we are supposed to have a movie marathon this weekend, and she was so excited. 

However...

We don’t really text that much. But thats my fault because I’m definitely an awkward texter. I never know how to keep a conversation going. I’m better in person, but still not the greatest. However I keep trying to improve myself, and every time I try and start conversation over text with G it seems like she doesn’t really want to talk. I know that it’s impossible to tell what someone is feeling over a phone. But it seems like she doesn’t even want to be my friend, even though we have that movie marathon. Do you think she feels like she’s committed to it and has to follow through with it?
I’m definitely analyzing this way too much, but that’s just who I am. 


Honestly I just want G to be able to have a great time in America, and I want her to be able to do what makes her happy. So if we have to remain friends I’m perfectly okay with that. However, everyone in my group keeps telling me to live in the moment, and see what happens. That’s not really my personality type though. 

Reading this whole thing is probably so confusing, and I’m so sorry but I don’t know how else to explain anything without feeling too uncomfortable, as I am pretty reserved.  

But what do y’all think? How can I actually hold a good conversation? If she likes me and I like her should I try like cuddling her during the movie? Normally, I would never do anything unless the other person says it’s okay, or they start it. But again everyone is telling me to. Any advice is appreciated and helpful. Thank you in advance. And if clarification is needed in anything please feel free to ask. 

Thank you.",30Oct2018,1
479,"A summary:

-I'm a contractor with a positive work record

-i broke the chain of command last week

-my previously friendly boss did a 180 in her treatment of me, put me on final written warning despite never having any before, 

- I strongly believe she is seeking to terminate me

-I was put in a call with her and HR, where I felt the HR person listening was a non entity, just there to take note that yep, she fucked up let's FasTrack this. My words did not matter.

-Boss put me on a performance improvement plan(PIP). much of the statements are false, misleading, exaggerated, or were mistakes i made during my first days of employment and, until this week, had not been brought up again

Example

**What my PIP says:** ""there was disagreement with a team member regarding someone sitting in [my] office. Our seating chart comes from the government and is non-negotiable.""

**What I luckily kept record of after she whined to me last month:**  ""When I said the new employee would probably share an office with you, I thought you made a sad face. But maybe I interpreted that wrong!""

Anyway long story short, I'm looking for new employment because this woman is not trustworthy. BUT! Until I get fired, I would like to mitigate this as much as I can. I kept heavy record (read: bitched about work in my chat) of work events, so I at least have prior journaling that contradict many of her statements (ex. **PIP:** mesmiro's work is often *below average*. **Message I sent Oct 19th:** lmaooo my boss insisted I was a perfectionist and that the govt wants to implement some of the documents I wrote because the other contract writing team sucks ass. Heavy hints that she wants me to i could get a raise over this 🤩 )

The problem is that I'm wondering if this is wasted effort. If I show she was dishonest 90% if the time, couldn't she just focus on the 10%? And I fully admit that I've made mistakes and needed correction - it's just that this doesn't feel done for my benefit, it feels like she's searching for a replacement.

I have six pages, single-spaced, of quotes, comments, and work that indicate her complaints are off, but realistically would HR care? Is this something I could fight? Even if I sent this to the hr anonymous hotline, what would it matter? Is there a positive outcome possible?

Last note, I messaged the company hr, saying I did not feel my side had been considered and that I had documentation contradicting what was said about me. HR responded my cc'ing the HR lady I just said seemed biased towards my boss and ignored me 😟
Should I take that as a sign the company is not on my side",30Oct2018,1
480,"I’m a 18 years old guy so I’m pretty young, never had any homosexual relationship but lately I started liking this guy, can’t really explain why, I’m still attracted to girls, I guess I’m curious. First of all I don’t like the LGBT environment so much: don’t get me wrong I LOVE everyone and I’m all for gay rights, marriages etc.. I just don’t like that “forced positivity” kind of vibe (don’t know how to call it hope you understand what I mean). I said that because he’s very much into spreading “positivity” and  going to events etc... and I find that kind of stuff  obnoxious (I do still think he’s lovely though don’t get me wrong).
The main problem though is if I get close and have some sort of thing with him people would talk about it a lot, I mean, everyone is pretty tolerant but we’re not quite there yet, I’m not afraid of judgement but I’m afraid that if I decide to have a girlfriend in the future she will mark me as homosexual, and also, on a more immediate perspective all the people I know and all my friends would treat me differently. 

Please don’t just tell me not to care, life doesn’t work like that I need to think about the consequences and what’s better for myself.

481,"So, I applied for a job. We live in a VERY small town. I am wanting to move out of the career  I have had for the past 6-7 years. The company I applied with is an international company but runs an office in my town. 

I had a phone interview today with the potential new company. The headquarters is in another city which is why I didn't have to go to the actual building for the first interview.

Upon ending the interview she mentioned the second interview and who it would potentially be with. It hadn't dawned on me at the time but thinking of it now, I have  come to realize the in- person interview would be with my current bosses spouse.  The name is very rare in these parts of the country so it is easy to narrow down and guess who it could be.

What do I do here? My boss is well known for trying to make your existance at this company miserable if information like this comes out. We recently had a coworker apply for a job a couple months ago and  it was nothing but drama with my boss. So I have seen first hand what can happen.

Does she have a right to fire me for something like this? I live  in Canada but do not know what the laws  are for something like this. Or maybe I am over reacting and should just leave what will be happen?

482,"I’m using a throwaway due to my career literally being laid out, but here’s the rundown:

I’m currently filling a contract that I’m 90% sure will turn into a permanent full time position when it ends in a few months. I have a specialized set of certifications that are required for the job so even though I’m not currently part of the company’s union, I will likely be able to land the job if/when it becomes permanent. The job pays 65k/year, capping at 75k.

A new contract came out for another company, higher paid and with a portfolio that would really boost my resume. However, the contract is only 16 months long, and once it’s done I’m not sure I would have a job to fall back on because it’s a competitive industry with few positions. This job starts at 75k/year, capping at 89k.

I’m torn because:
A. Even though I have a good shot at getting full-time in my current job, I’ve seen co-workers burned by union politics and I don’t trust anything until everyone’s signed on the dotted line.
B. If I don’t land full time in my current job, I’ll fall back to part-time at a significant pay loss.
C. The new job would boost my resume and is a step above my current position, but is a short-term opportunity.
D. I’m also trying to buy a house, but may not be able to because of the instability of my career at the moment.
E. My current job is in a less than ideal location, in an area that I could never see myself living, but the contract is closer to where I see myself settling down.

It's my second year of college and although i'm doing fairly well, I really don't want to be here. I've explored two majors already that lead to high paying careers although not in direct correlation with my passions. This is due to the fact that my passions don't really require a college degree; I love to write (poetry,stories, creative articles), I love to act (although I haven't taken classes in a long while), I love makeup (but I don't buy a lot since I spend the little I have outside of school fees on clothing or skincare), I love hair , and although I don't have a camera I love photography. I spend almost all my time studying so I haven't even spent time on my passions for the past year and a half.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Another huge factor is that I have strict parents. Previously I let them know about how I felt so I took only one class one semester but had to take a part time job since they said they would not be providing for me if I didn't focus solely on school. I hated my part time jobs; I worked in high end stores, regular retail store, and a restaurant. The work environment in those places was just not for me, so I went back to full courses the next semester.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even focus in school anymore, I spend my time looking for paid gap year opportunities, study abroad scholarships etc but because my parents will not be helping me pay for anything including if I go to school for a major they don't approve and since I wasn't allowed to have a job when I was younger, my personal funds are extremely limited .

490,I bought a few bikes from a guy I had previously picked a few up from off of craigslist.   I was on vacation at the time when he contacted me so I just sent him payment over Venmo as I've done business with him in the past.  He had a different phone number for the first one I purchased from him and a second for the other 5 I purchased from him.  I paid for 4 of them and we planned on touching base at the end of the month so I could pick them up.  I have been to his residence before and know when he stores them.  They are in the basement of his housing unit which isnt locked.  He did however say that he would lock them up until I picked them up.  I shot him a text the other day saying I would be available to pick them up today.  I gave him a call today but the number is no longer active.  I paid him $280 over venmo in 3 transactions.   How should I handle getting these bikes from him?  Should I simply drive to his place and knock on the door to see if he is home?  I no longer have a means to contact him.

I know love is a strong word, but over the course of our relationship she sat another dude’s lap right in front of me, acted like I was a stranger for a week because she was “confused about her feelings”, led another dude on who was obviously in love with her so we could meet up and I could punch him in the face. She told me she was in love her ex once, broke up with me and changed her mind the next day, she even told me I was her second choice after another dude when she realized he had a girlfriend. Regardless of all this crap, I stayed with her and treated her well, I was understanding. But after calling her out for the first time ever for flaking out on a compensatory date she asked me out on for sitting on another dude’s lap, instead of apologizing and trying to work on her behavior, she dumped me. What I realize now is that I gave her so much of my energy that I made about three friends at this school. A month and a half in it’s a lot harder to make new friends because everyone has already found their people. This relationship kind of wrecked my life. I lost interest in weightlifting, lost a few friends and I can’t let my guard down around  women anymore. It’s been two weeks since we broke up and I’ve moved on, but I still have to see her, her friends and the school in which I harbor fond memories of our relationship 5 days a week. How do I heal from something like this?",30Oct2018,1
493,"A girl is friends with my long-term boyfriend. They met after we got together. This girl is single and tells my bf that she had a rough week.

Bf says: **How can I cheer you up, no I won't say eating ice cream LOL.**

Seconds later, the girl sends him a screenshot of a dating app and it shows a picture of a random dude with a blue border. The blue border means you are super liked by someone. The girl says; **the blue border means they want to eat ice cream :)** Boyfriend responds with: Lol So I hear you are a Tinder professional.

494,"So im dating this girl. We're both 17. We're both introverts. We're both into each other. We just aren't officially together yet. We're working on it.

Now my problem. I normally don't have a lot to do. Im bored often. If someone messages me, I usually answer within 5-10 minutes. Sometimes even sooner. But this girl? Damn she takes her time sometimes. I genuinely think she just isn't on her phone all day. I know people have stuff to do. They have lives. And that's cool. And her answers are always very sweet. It's just that she takes a few hours to respond at times. And that makes me feel...like she isn't interested in me. 

Eventhough I know for a fact, or im atleast 99% sure that she is interested, I still feel this way. I can't help it. And  when im bored I tend to overthink all this stuff. It becomes so bad that after a while I think she isn't even into me at all anymore. And it makes me feel miserable, like a loser who gets attached way to quickly. I don't want to be that way. I want to be independent when it comes to happiness. Because Ive been too dependent before, ive been attached to quickly before, and that lead to a long, very unhappy and depressed time in my life.",30Oct2018,1

I find it arduous to talk to most people, but with her its easy. She said she really enjoyed talking to me, too. We started hanging out - a lot. Like we spent most of our evenings together and stayed out until 2 in the morning. At first, I was just happy to have a friend that I really enjoyed spending time. Then the other night, we watched a horror movie and got really close to each other. I started to develop a little of a crush on her. I also got the impression that she was interested in me, too. Her roommate even texted me and said I should go for it. So yesterday, I asked her if she would want to go out to dinner. She asked if I meant dinner as friends, and I corrected her and told her I meant it like a date. She said maybe. We haven’t spoken since. I saw her today but I think she walked to the other side of the street to avoid me. I think she is under the impression that I only hung out with her because I just wanted to go out with her, but the truth is that I just really enjoy her company (why I hung out with her to begin with). I texted her something funny that happened to me today, but I haven’t heard back (but to be fair she’s a busy person). I don’t know what to do.

500,"My little sister, aged 14, is now in some sort of breakdown. Last week at school, she turned herself in anonymously for bringing my parents' vodka in her school bag and was given 30 days in DAEP. The next day, my parents found a stash of weed, a weed pipe, and my dad's prescribed hydrocodone pills. We believe that this is in part out of spite towards my mother for being on top of her about school and making sure she is doing well. Another possibility that I find less plausible is that she is doing this for some upperclassman boy she likes. By the way my mother is fantastic and is doing this because she cares about her future. Our family has never had anything like this in the past so this is all kind of a huge, scary shock to us. She has been verbally abusing my mother, calling her a ""cunt,"" ""whore"" etc, threatening to ""ruin her life"" and also more recently threatening to hurt our dog. We don't know if that is an actual threat or just trying to scare my mother who loves our dog dearly, seems like the latter. My parents took her to a mental health center today to get her checked and apparently she was at an ""extremely high suicidal level"" and ""severe drug addiction"" which I'm assuming is the hydros (I don't have all the information as I'm out of town for college). This is all such a terrifying situation for my family and I and my parents are doing everything they can to fix it. This has absolutely crushed all of our hearts (my mom's the most as you can imagine) because she has always been so sweet and this is not her. I, being away for school, am kind of having a panic attack and I am not sure what I can do to help. I have told my older sister and parents that I think if my older sister or I could say the right thing to her to ""breach"" this weird outer shell and get to the real her, we could maybe appeal to her emotions and she could snap out of this. I specifically think I can get to her. My parents are obviously parents so they are much less likely to get to her and my older sister has a good relationship with her, although they would always have sister drama, but I have always kind of been the ""cool older brother"" who has never had much drama with her.

504,"I had quit my job a while back and my mother said if I don't get a new job she'll kick me out. I have no problem with it cause I'm leaving anyway, I'm ready to leave right now actually. Not sure if I should tell my family I'm leaving or just make it seem like they forced me out. 

If it's important I never had a normal relationship with my parents, I love them cause they're family but if they were anything other than that it'd be difficult to even be around them. My mother taught me a lot especially to only rely on myself. My father taught me to stand on my own and be a man. I appreciate them both, I'm very thankful for all they've done for me. 

So now I'm not sure what to do. The way my mother is if I tell her I'm leaving she'll just be angry and go on the ""we don't need you around anyway"" rant and that would suck cause I'm not leaving out of spite, it's just what I've been planning to do for years. But if I make it seem like she forced me out it'll be like she tried to help me but she needed to do it. So in a way its better for her right? 

My dad probably won't care too much, he's always supported the decisions I make cause ""I'm my own man"" we usually just talk and laugh about this kind of stuff. So I have no worries there. What should I do about my mother though?",30Oct2018,1
505,"Okay, so, despite being 19 years old, my mom still firmly believes that I am not an adult in her eyes. Meaning, I have a 10pm curfew (we don't live together, I'm in student housing at the University I attend), I can't go on any vacation trips without her, etc. This is why I'm paranoid about this whole thing, because if my mom was a regular, American parent, she'd probably understand that adults do adult *things*. 

&amp;#x200B;

She came by earlier today to drop off some things she thought I would need like she does every couple of weeks, and I completely forgot that I had used said ""toy"" earlier and washed it in the bathroom, then left it on the counter to dry. Usually, if she drops stuff off, she doesn't even come up. Today, she told me she needed to use my restroom, and with my being the dumbass I am, I let her in without a second thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

When she exited the bathroom, she didn't say anything regarding the toy to me. In fact, she just asked me if I needed anything else and explained some of the stuff she brought me, like usual. I even told her about my Halloween costume, etc. Nothing seemed odd to me.

&amp;#x200B;

After she left, I went into the bathroom myself and saw my bra (which I had also left in the bathroom, I'm lazy) was on top of the toy, as if to hide it. I didn't put it there, so right away I knew she had. I was mortified and completely embarrassed. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's a chance my mom doesn't know what it is, but it's pretty slim. The fact that my bra was on top of it, like she deliberately put it there maybe to ""warn"" me about it, makes me think she knows what it is. I'm more surprised that she didn't immediately confront me about it, and take it away/throw it away, because of how strict she is.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, however, I'm worried she still *will* confront me, and I don't know how to respond. It's possible she's going to discuss this with a friend or someone to see the advice they give her before coming to me, and if she does, I have absolutely no idea what to say to her.

506,"So, my ex gave me herpes.
He told me he had it 11 months into our relationship.
I found out I had it the next month and broke up with him.
He was ignorant and thought it couldn’t be transmitted as long as he wasn’t having an outbreak. (It can, and it’s not always apparent when there is an outbreak). We didn’t use condoms (I thought he was clean and I was on birth control), and he wasn’t taking medication.

The amount of psychological turmoil this has caused me since we broke up (6 months ago), has been awful to deal with. Depression. Anger. So much anger.
I’ve never known I was capable of feeling this angry, for this long.

My friends think I should press charges on him.

So... any advice?? I have a couple of leads on a lawyer but I haven’t reached out yet.
I don’t want to go through the whole process if my chances as a woman in Texas aren’t good.

That may sound mean but she has said that, ""I didn't raised you that way"", or,""I thought I raised you to care more"", and stuff like that. Usually I can handle that but I can't anymore. Today I went into Quick trip to get drinks for us, ""you know what I want right? The unsweetened tea ok"". I go in and I remember her specifically saying that she didn't like the flavor of it last time so I added a little sweetened tea so it didn't taste like garbage. I go outside and she tries it. She then says,""did you sweeten this?"". I said I did and she got extremely pissy. She flopped her hands on her lap and gave me a sour look. She told me that she specifically wanted no sweetened tea and that she told me 3 times. She proceeded to bitch all the way home and brought up a assignment of mine that is late and that I still have to do. Over half of my class has not finished it yet and I've explained to her why multiple times. Yet she went on and said that ""I'm old enough to remember little things"" and that ""it's a pattern"" of me forgetting stuff. And when I told her that she kinda hurt my feelings she said,  and I'm not even joking,  ""you think this doesn't hurt me to?"". Then told me that I'm frustrating and its annoying how I do this. She always turns the argument in her favor and makes me feel like shit. And when we get home she's all buddy buddy and asking me why I look pissed off.

It hurts me really bad when she puts it on me in a argument. I want to tell her to fuck off but she'll probobly find another way to pin it in me. I don't think she realizes what she's doing but I don't know how to tell her too stop without hurting one of us emotionally. ",30Oct2018,1
511,"I’m currently in an a cappella group at my uni and it’s been a lot of fun. The group is generally really supportive and I’ve enjoyed my time there.

513,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in the process of joining the military, and the main reason for me doing so is because I'm not sure what I want to do with my life, and I will probably run out of money within four-six months if I don't have a proper job lined up by then.

&amp;#x200B;

After university, I (like a lot of people) thought I would walk into a decent job because that's what parents/teachers told me. Now I know it's a bullshit lie, I don't blame anybody but it is what it is. I've worked shit min-wage jobs since graduating and been just about getting by. Too over-qualified for some jobs but not got enough experience for others.

Military seems like a good option for a single man at my age, as I get room and board all subsidised, and will hopefully pick up some skills to help me later in life.

514,"Hello there, I have never posted on reddit before and I am generally only here for entertainment/information purposes. This time is a little bit different and I was hoping some kind soul would be able to offer me some advice. I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible.

I’ll start from the beginning: I grew up a pretty happy and well-behaved kid, for the most part. I was often considered “gifted” as I was a standout athlete and academic for much of my early life. Everything just came so easy to me, it was as if everyone else was slowed down or being held back in some way. 

However, this all drastically changed around 9th grade. For a few years it seemed like people had been “catching up to me” in a sense and I wasn’t as capable or smart as I used to be. Anyway, this manifested in the fact that I absolutely could not understand math. I remember at the time taking a physics class and geometry class, and I literally could not wrap my head around what was going on, even with extensive help. Everyone seemingly caught up to me and I was just watching them pass me by. At the same time, I began feeling extremely depressed at times and this caused a lot of friction between my parents and I. Fighting soon became the norm.

Eventually I got so far behind that I was being bullied and was completely embarrassed to go to school. I quit all three sports I was playing, stopped going to school, and was essentially a dropout. My parents did not know what to do to motivate me, so they just yelled and screamed. I usually reciprocated and it would become a huge yelling war. Once in blue moon these arguments turned violent. I begged my parents to explore different options for school, at least while I could figure out what was happening in my head, but it never really got through to them. 

After a short while, I began to smoke marijuana, which proved to be the last straw for my parents after they caught me red-handed. After this incident, my folks immediately had me picked up and “delivered” to what is known as a “behavioral rehabilitation facility.” It doesn’t sound too bad, right? Well, in my opinion, that’s where you’d be wrong. 

This place became my personal hell for nearly 9 months. It was considered a “level 4 facility,” which lies somewhere between the juvenile justice system and a “group home.” There were 20 foot tall barbwire fences, you were dressed in the same boring clothes as everyone else, and most importantly, you couldn’t leave.

I didn’t understand why I was there. I had never been charged with a crime or “sentenced” to a place like this, unlike the majority of people there. Other reasons for being there included severe developmental/intellectual disabilities and the absence of a child’s parents/guardians. I had never really exhibited any deviant or criminal behavior up to this point, besides smoking pot twice (not “criminal” in my eyes but to the law it is, so...), had never showed signs of an intellectual issue, and had certainly never experienced life without my parents. I never met anyone in a similar situation at this place. I just didn’t fit there and I didn’t understand how it was supposed to help me.

In my 8 and 1/2 months time there, my depression seriously worsened. I began cutting my wrists and thighs, abusing drugs, getting into fights, and having suicidal ideation. On top of this, the place was not exactly conducive to changing behavior for the better. I couldn’t ever sleep because my roommates were too busy snorting Ritalin to stay up all night or using me as their human punching bag. 
At the same time I felt like a guinea pig due to all the medication they had me on (1800mg of seroquel a day, is that even ethical?). I had a couple seizures in this place, and the rest of the time I felt like a drugged-out zombie. 

Furthermore, when I was released back into the real world it seemed as if there was a positive effect. I was motivated again (probably due to being medicated for undiagnosed adhd; oh Adderall), doing well in school, and somewhat happy. Our family fighting had all but stopped for a while.

Upon discussing this with my therapist recently, she thinks it was a mistake to brush it all under the rug and to hop right back into life as if nothing happened. Yes, at first it seemed I was my old self again, but things quickly changed. I began smoking pot again, started engaging in actual criminal activity, and the tension between me and my family was back. I eventually landed myself in jail at 19 for simple possession of weed. My parents left me in jail for nearly a week, which I think was justified, before they bailed me out. This turned my life upside down and I am still being punished for it (trying to expunge it) &amp; paying the money back to my folks. 

I tell you this for perspective only, as the real issue is fairly recent. After a couple-year period of civility between my parents and I, things have become problematic again. I am in my final year of college (it’s a miracle I even made it here) and, as a very independent person, was planning to move to a big city to pursue my dreams. My folks don’t agree with this and want me to return home to help them run their business and eventually take it over. The problem is, I was already in college for something completely different when they created the business. Idk what to tell them, I’m not coming back to the middle of nowhere. I have ambition and specific goals in mind. 

Now comes the true dilemma. I have become extremely resentful of my parents because of the fact that they voluntarily put me in a place that made me want to die, and they actually paid thousands of dollars to do this. That, to me, is extremely unethical because I was truly a sad and troubled kid, not someone dangerous to society. It felt like my family didn’t love me and wouldn’t deal with me. I was very confused and I certainly needed help, but not this type of help. The cherry on top is that I have been learning through my behavior courses, as a psychology &amp; biology major, that this method of treating adolescent behavior problems is very controversial. This is because it completely removes the individual from the target environment. Therefore, the individual can only exhibit the coping behavior or positive behavior in that setting. It doesn’t teach them how to use these tools in your natural environment, aka society. It is known to be not only unethical, but also highly ineffective. So why?

With that being said, my parents have tried to make up for this by being very financially generous (albeit no overt apology or anything). For example, at 22 years old they still pay for my health insurance and car insurance (though that is all). They also have offered to help me pay down some of my student loans, as their new business has been successful enough for them to do so. Initially I thought this was great, but since the fighting has been reignited I feel a lot of cognitive dissonance. 

I feel like to really heal from this, I need significant time and a break from my parents. When I look at them, I don’t see my parents anymore. I only see hatred and betrayal. My dilemma is whether this is the right decision. My dad claims that this would be “emotionally abusive” to them, but I see it as the exact opposite. I’m removing myself from the situation to heal, so that I don’t become emotionally abusive. I don’t want to hate my parents. Even the thought of that makes me very sad because my folks are already at odds with the rest of our extended family, and I am an only child. The thing is though, I want to be happy at the same time. It’s been too long since I’ve felt peace.

(I only just started feeling like this btw, probably because I just began attending therapy again, taking medicine, and rehashing my past.)

My question is: is it worth it to try and figure this out on my own? I feel incredibly slimey accepting financial help from them if I simultaneously resent them and can’t even hug them. I want us to eventually have a good relationship, as I deep down love them both more than anything in the world. 

I believe if I work hard and put my best foot forward every day, I would be able to financially support myself. I have a few thousand dollars saved, which would give me a bit of money to find housing in a city while I find a good job. I’m very confident in the skills I’ve learned and in my personal ability. I just feel like it’s wrong to do what I’m doing, feeling how I feel. I think I need to fly from the nest entirely before I can establish a genuine, adult relationship with them. There doesn’t seem to be another great option.

Also keep in mind, I live and go to school about 8 hours from my parents so any intensive family therapy is out of the question for now. I do realize it’s a convoluted and messy time in my life for all this to be happening, which is why I’m struggling so much here. I’m definitely overwhelmed with school right now as my courses are pretty difficult (thank you o chem...), as well as figuring out how to transition smoothly into adult life.

Any and all advice is welcome. Thank you.

517,"My dental assistant teacher had asked the class to write a note or email her things we do and do not like, also out over all feeling of how the past 9 weeks in the program went. I had already had a note written out because I was going to give it to her anonymously because we have a “professionalism grade sheet” and on that list it says -50 points if you have an attitude and so I didn’t not want her to misconstrue that letter and come at me for “having an attitude” (sad right? I can’t just express my concerns) but since she asked us to tell her our opinions, I gave her the note. in this note I basically said (I will sum it up) that the rules on our professionalism sheet are only fair to an extent. All the basic rules (call if you will be absent, appropriate clothing, respectful, Work until the end of class, etc) are all understandable and completely fair but ironing our clothes and bleaching our shoes are kind of over board in my eyes (I could be wrong and this could/should be acceptable bc it’s a program to prepare me for a dental office) so whatever (she asked for my opinion so I’ll give her it) but also she has that we cannot wear nail polish unless it’s light pink. Well, one day she literally complimented a girls nails that were bright blue with diamonds on them and the girl asked “are these too much should I take points off?” And the teacher replied “no they’re okay they are cute” like WHAT TF? It’s all or nothing that’s how it should be right? so that pissed me off bc if she’s going to stress this grade sheet then why would she let a student get away with blue nails? but yet she’s going to stress us about ironing our clothes and putting that in the grade sheet?? Then another situation was when a girl in our class had a staph infection and so we disinfected the whole room for 2 hours then she started organizing and scrubbing random things and using all of the students to do this when had already sanitized everything (which I was perfectly fine with doing bc I DONT want a staph infection) so then she came up to my table and asked us to organize a cupboard that a girl had already organized so we said a girl already did that, and she walked away then came back and asked us to clean this crusty cupboard out that hasn’t been touched in a year probably. So I said no because I’m studying and so did the other girl, so then she said again “will you clean it” and I said “do I have to? I don’t feel good.” And she said “yes :)” so I went and cleaned it. (While other girls were sitting there eating, and some were just pretending to look busy by touching stuff) then she announced to the class “make sure if I ask you guys to do something that you’re doing it so you don’t get points taken off” (Cleaning a crusty cupboard has nothing to do with this 9 month dental program that I’m paying $6k to take and pass in 6 more months so yes I’d rather study) so I never addressed this situation with her until the note. Fast forward to the last situation which is almost my least concern but it leads into the climax. She started collecting our cell phones and putting them in a box under her desk. mind you she puts on a real attitude as she takes our phones also. So one day she counted 9 instead of 10 phones and she asked “who’s being a sneak and not putting there phone in here?” And it was a 45 year old woman she had left her phone in her purse. But she didn’t argue or even talk, she just got her phone and put it in the basket. (That sort of shows it is weird to take adults phones and put them in a basket. The woman obviously felt weird. in college they either kick you out of class or make you out it in your car which is how i think she should handle it instead of hiding them behind her desk.) so after handing this note in, the next morning, she collected everyone’s phones (again with an attitude) and I didn’t give her mine I said to her “did you not take anything into consideration that I said in my note?” She said “I did, but you’ve been on your phone” so I said “I would much rather leave my phone in my car” and she said “well then go put it in your car” And so I did. then when I came in we took our test (which I probably failed because I was so heated and so stressed) then after that she says “tomorrow morning I want every one to give a 3 minute speech on why our professionalism sheet is useful for in a dental office or here at school. (So basically I felt attacked personally, because the day before this I gave her a 2 page note about that professionalism sheet, and the next day she’s having us give a speech on how the sheet is right. So basically she didn’t like what I said in the note so she wants me to stand up in front of everyone and say why it’s all correct. No idea why she asked for our opinions in the first place if she’s just going to do that. she could’ve easily just talked to me one on one about it after she read the note I’d think that would be the mature thing to do.) so then the last thing to happen today was while setting up for a bite wing X Ray I accidentally dropped a disposable syringe and so I threw it away and forgot to put new gloves on, so she watched me set up my entire chair and everything THEN came over and said since I dropped that and didn’t change gloves that I have to scrub everything and take it all down and start over. So out of curiosity I asked her if she saw me do that when it happened, and she said “yes” And so I asked her why didn’t she tell me right away so I didn’t spend all that time infecting everything with “floor germs” and she gave me attitude raised her eyebrows and said “um because I was up front with someone else” (well if she saw it she could’ve said something. we are in a very small classroom and she’s said things to other students that have been by the chair while she’s been up there so???) (then we were running out of time and she told the girls beside me to finish doing there x rays tomorrow but yet made me set up my stuff again and finish doing mine. LOL.) 
so, yes, I have been to the office multiple times today to discuss this with a woman who is in charge of the adult Ed programs. Also with the principle too. They swear they’re not bias, but all they continuously said were things to defend the teacher like “it could all be a misunderstanding, you’re gonna work with people you don’t get along with in the future, fair doesn’t always mean the same, she’s new, she’s still adjusting,”) etc. so at this point I have no idea what the hell to do. Who to talk to. How to even defend myself at this point. any advice? Please. I am stressing a ton and I am dreading giving that 3 minute speech tomorrow.

520,"So I (31F) work at a dive bar, 3 years now, afternoons. 98% of my customers are daily regulars mostly 55+. I’m extremely close with my regulars, we spend time together outside of work all the time, a lot of them call me their adopted daughter, and I’m always kinda tired so I prefer their company over people my age. One of my closest couples that I see daily had recently turned into a single. The husband (62M) hasn’t been feeling well, but refuses to see a doctor. His wife comes in daily and updates us: what/if he ate and if he got out of bed. It’s been almost 2 months since I’ve last seen him and even then he had lost a lot of weight on top of being kinda skinny to begin with. And at that time he was drinking a lot slower than usual, he won’t admit it but he has trouble swallowing.

His wife insists he will not see a doctor and she says she can’t force him.  A few weeks ago, another one of my regulars called and had an ambulance sent to the house. The wife answered the door and said he doesn’t want EMTs to come in and sent them away. 

Now, my regulars want to reach his brother whom none of us know. I found a number online but it goes to a full voicemail. 

Is there any service or agency we can call to check on him? We’ve even considered trying to call an ambulance there when she’s here at the bar so he’d have to answer the door and hopefully they’d see he’s in distress and take him?  Any advice is appreciated.

524,"I'm 25 credits from graduation and have basically been a straight A student. 

I've been in college since 2008. Due to treatment resistant depression, I was unable to complete many semesters, gave up for about 1.5 years before going back in 2017 after getting the right kind of treatment. 

Now, I can barely walk as I am too weak, often can't feel my face as it goes numb, and get easily confused. Yesterday, I finally fell down for the first time in my kitchen when walking and then later couldn't get up from my chair and crawled my way through the kitchen to living room, where I fell down again, and then crawled up the stairs to my bed. This stuff started the second week of the semester and has gotten progressively worse. 

It looks like I have to withdraw again because of this. I really wish I didn't. But those are the rules of the game.

(When I've been able to make it to class, it's almost comical when students can't answer basic questions. I feel like I am surrounded by the laziest group of people ever. And yet I know these people are going to graduate, have successful careers, and have relationships with human beings.)

Since my withdrawal looks imminent, I will again be owing money for this semester that I was screwed out of and I may not be able to return to school ever again.

525,"Last year after my partner and I got engaged, 4 people in our rather large friend group became quite vicious. Without going into too much detail, there were threats, blackmail and violence. 

We had confronted each other several times after the incidents but then it got to new years and they pulled this behaviour again. My fiance and I decided that unless they admitted what they did was wrong and made attempts to fix the relationship that it wasn't ours to fix.

Since then I have not spoken or seen these four people.

As I mentioned before, our friend group is rather large and the other people who were affected by their behaviour were not ready to avoid these people altogether. Which is completely fair. 

So when parties have come around throughout the year, if any of the four people are invited I have strictly decided not to attend and get on with life. 

After all the drama they inflicted on us, even when they get brought up in conversation I start to have an episode of anxiety. For instance one of the people contacted me whilst on holiday and I was a mess.

Now that you're up to speed, this weekend is one of my mate's housewarming party. I really want to celebrate with him as buying property is a huge deal, however, these people have also been invited.

My initial reaction was to just say not go so I could avoid the chance of running into them or being anxious altogether, however, I'm doubting my reaction and wish I could be stronger to celebrate with my friends but not let them being there affect me.

How do I do this?

tldr; 4 people in my friend group threatened, blackmailed and inflicted violence on me and my fiance last year. We cut contact for almost a year as a result.

526,"Hey, everyone! 

Today has been kind of a tough day for me and I would really appreciate some advice.

I am a 19 year old psychology student and today I had a presentation about social anxiety (the group for which I had to do my presentation was really small and only existed of 4 people), I chose this topic because I am suffering from it myself because of past events in my life and I wanted to talk about it to show the effect that it can have on your life.

The past events that I am referring to is that I used to have a habit of speaking way too fast which made it so that people had a hard time understanding me which made me very insecure, luckily I got a good speech therapist and I just got older and wiser but the fear of thinking that nobody understands me still remains, I know that this does not make any sense for my current self since every time that I am in a video I talk normally and I have even been complimented on my voice.

The biggest problem of today was that I completely froze up during the presentation, I thought that I was speaking way too fast and nobody could understand me which made me feel really unwell so I took a seat and asked if I could just do it next time.  What happened next was quite nice since the people who were listening to me did not notice that I was speaking too fast and actually were really enjoying the presentation, this showed that it was just a dumb unneccesary insecurity which still managed to latch onto my everyday thoughts.  Hearing that did convince me to give it another go and I got a good grade even though I am still embarrased by what happened.

This evening I made a few video’s of myself to show to myself that I can talk normally and while a part of me is willing to accept that, there is a still a part that finds it hard to let go of this insecurity.


I would like some advice so that I can be done with this annoying part of my life and be confident in all areas.",30Oct2018,1

528,"I've worked in the dental field for the last 4 years for a dentist who was great, he just couldn't provide me with the hours I needed. 

So, I found a new job with more money and more hours. I started last Monday and initially all seemed well but I began noticing that this particular dentist does A LOT of major work on patients. Almost every single patient that goes in for a simple cleaning and exam walks out needing crowns, excessive fillings, invisilign, periodontal work, etc. I've also noticed excessive credits on patients accounts. I'm talking 50% of patients on a given day have some sort of credit ranging from $10 to a few hundred or more. This appears to be due to patients overpaying and then their insurance picking up the bill. When I asked about it they simply said they just leave it on the account. 

Those are two major things that just don't sit well with me. 

Then there's other stuff, like TONS of advertising, calling patients from literally a decade ago and seeing if they want to schedule, sending letters offering incentives... And to my knowledge, these don't work. No patients have returned calls that I'm aware of. 

Does any one else find this suspicious, or find this ethically wrong?

529,"I live in a mid-size Queens apartment building and most of my neighbors are elderly and mainly South American immigrants. 

One of my neighbors, who I will call M, took a liking to me upon the arrival of my first child.  She loved having my son and I over for tea, and as my son became a toddler he would play at her apartment once or twice a week for 30 min or so.  While I appreciated the break, there was always something a bit ""off"" about her, which I mainly chalked up to a language barrier.  

Other elderly ladies in my building were surprised by our ""friendship"" as she isn't well liked by them and they basically told me this. I sont like her so much as appreciate her.  I enjoyed having a casual ""grandma"" figure for my son and giving a lonely old woman an opportunity to socialize. I even had her over for Xmas lunch as she would have otherwise been alone.  

But weirdness started about 2 years ago when she began complaining about the people above her making crazy sounds at all hours of the night. She continually complained to management who put in carpeting and would end up evicting the tenant over the noise complaints.  However M said the same thing was happening with the new tenant.  She began behaving erratically with the new tenant telling me that M constantly knocks on her ceiling with a broom yelling about noise while the tenant sleeps.  M began being known as ""the crazy lady"".

Recently M moved down the hall in hopes that the noise would die down but only 2 weeks into her new apt, she said that the people from upstairs have followed her to the NEW apt and she can hear the noises again.  She complains of discrimation and elder abuse. Its gotten where I can't really support her any more.  Its obvious to me that while these sounds are obviously real to her, they are likely in her head.

She moved to a whole different building in hopes of escaping the sounds. I saw her yesterday moving some of her items out and I asked her how she was doing. She said very depressed. I asked her where she was moving to and she couldn't recall the address.  I'm very concerned for her. 

She has no family in the USA as far as I know.  I want to help her, I really do but I also have my own load of BS (including dealing with my own elderly handicapped mother, a current pregnancy, work, a pre-schooler, etc) and I don't know if I have the emotional energy to really help her on this.

533,"I know i should talk to friends and family first before asking strangers on reddit but recently ive not been feeling that close with my parents (which is a whole other issue) and i dont really have many close friends i feel comfortable talking about this with.

Background nfo:
Last year i started a new college to help further my in animals and so i did an animal care course and i made a few friends and quickly bonded to one of the girls in my class. After about 3 months of knowing each other we ended up talking almost daily on snapchat after college and almost constanly facetiming during weekends.

By now she has pretty much told everything about her and she is always consulting me for advice on other guys, issues with her family and even her friends i have never met and im always gonna be there to help her but its just recently when me, her and a couple other friends got pissed up that i realized that she was all i was thinking about and i was just hoping it was a quick crush that would be over as this had happened before where i became best friends with a girl and she confided in me with everything and she eventually found out i had feelings for her and i didnt know how to handle it as she the first person i had felt that way about before and ended up screwing up our friend ship, losing a bunch of friends and ultimately leading me to going to a new college as i felt horrible being there.

Everytime i see a message from her i get panicky and all the thoughts start going through my mind of is she going to tell me she likes me, does she have a boyfriend now, does she like someone else, is she moving away, does she no longer want to be friends, etc... 
And that shit honestly kills me, like it genuinely hurts when i open the messages only to realise i worked kyself up over nothing and she justs wants to facetime for a bit and chat about college and stuff

I think one thing which has mainly stopped me from talking to her about this is that shes constanly getting guys trying to ask her out, and ive seen the way she shuts them down even if she did like them as a friend before and im just sat there thinking ""fuck me i know what hes going through right now as its the same as what im going through with the same girl"" and i do t want that to happen to me or to her as shes one of the closest friends ive had in years and i honestly dont know what id do if i fucked up ouf friendship like that. Like i know we wouldnt be able to got back to the way we were and id feel like a cunt everytime i saw her or something that reminded me of her.

Anyway, over the past couple weeks my best friend has told me she has a crush on someone at college, which has utterly killed me as she seems pretty serious about it but at the same time im so happy shes happy. But heres the plot twist, she has assured me and the rest of our friend group that she is definately straight, only to tell me her serious crush is the another friend of mine who is a lesbian.

Then to top that off, lately ive been feeling kinda shitty cause of the whole scenario and we're not talked nearly as much as we used to and i feel like thats entirely my fault. Which is leading me to think im gonna end up losing her either way which is like my worst nightmare come true.

Now im not quite sure what advice im really asking for here but i felt like i needed to just write about this instead of thinking about it with myself alone and in the dark.

2. Stay teaching until I find out how my interview with Exxon goes ( I interview November 13th but wouldn’t start until February or May, around the same pay i make now)

Option 1 is really a stop gap, unless I could move up into a management role. Even so I’m still going to be actively searching for a career if i take option 1. Teaching has been so stressful for me, and I’ve been getting more and more depressed the longer I’ve taught.

If anyone have grandma tricks, or tips they learn when they were students ( like me ) I am here to test them!   


  
By the way the building is pretty old ( around 1800) so not the best, if you need picture to have a clearer idea just ask.

540,"First off a little back story, there are 6 of us living together as sophomores 3 upstairs 3 downstairs. Us in the basement each have our own rooms, 2 upstairs share a very large master with beds on opposite sides. All of us pull our weight with chores except one we'll call them Tyler. 

We have decided on designated days for dishes and all of us stick to doing unloading them in the morning and starting the wash at night... Except Tyler, he waits until it's night and all the dishes pile up and yell at us for not doing the dishes.

 We also put everything immediately into the wash so we don't make more work for the others.. except Tyler, whenever he does a dish he leaves it dirty in his room or sets it full of just water on the microwave and leaves it, dirty dishes are not something he deals with.

Whenever we ask him nicely he either completely ignores us, says he's busy, asks why it matters, or says ""I do whatever the fuck I want""

Worse than that he smokes kush bang 420 in our garage which is attached to our house. We sat him down and the rest of the smokers in the house and everyone agreed and has stuck to not smoking... Except Tyler and whenever we ask him about it he says the same things as the dishes.


Overall he is a lazy piece of shit and it constantly creates tension and pointless drama in our house.",30Oct2018,1

Over time I've realised I've strong enough feelings. I've put them aside for the last year because this person is in a relationship but recently they have been flirting with me and giving me signals they're interested as well.

547,"Both in professional reviews, and introspecting, I've heard the same thing. I am a relatively young (25) doctorate level physical therapist.

When starting a new position, or after recovering from burnout, I constantly hear that I excell at my position. This fuels me. I take on more and more work until I can barely take the stress and inevitably relapse into my depression from an outside (family, etc) catalyst. My work, timeliness with documentation and quality of care suffer for a short time, and then I recover and bounce back.

I have seen this cycle a few times already in my young career. I would like to nip this habit and set healthy working boundaries, but a) I know that's an area I struggle with personally and b) it's even more difficult in the healthcare setting I work in.

548,"Bare with me, I'm still in panic mode. 

The first time happened yesterday. I got a message from Instagram (I completely forgot I even had an Instagram account and hadn't touched it in years) saying someone logged in and changed stuff basically. So I immediately go to change the password, and check the account and the username and email was still correct and everything looks fine. However, I then realize all of my pictures from my phone were loaded (or at least looked that way) and I flip out since I never uploaded any pictures there (I don't have any risqué content on my phone, but I did have pictures I took of medical bills recently) . I disabled my account first, then realized I should just delete it since I never used it. Well, because I disabled it, I had to wait a few hours to go back in and delete it. When I was able to get in again, I went to check the photos again, but the gallery was empty. I still deleted the account, and I'm hoping the photos I saw earlier were not actually on the account and what I saw was maybe the screen asking me if I wanted to upload any pictures. Still feeling sick about it. 

I couldn't get into contact with any customer service either which really sucked.

Then just now I get an email from shutterstock saying there was irregular activity. Again, haven't used it in years, didn't even have anything on there, but now I know I'm being targeted.

549,"This is such a dumb situation, but I’m posting here out of desperation for safety. 

I work for a real estate developer. We own a tract of land that we are currently in the early stages of building a subdivision on. It is in the middle of a large residential area. 

There is a school bus stop just outside of my land where a k-8 school drops their kids. The kids have begun to walk through the area after school on their way home. I know this didn’t happen before we began to develop the land because there used to be brick walls up around the property that we had to remove for construction purposes. 

We have installed (per city regulation) a temp construction fence, signage and all other mandated safety measures around the job site. 

I have been able to catch some of the kids for the last few weeks and ask them politely to not walk through here anymore. I have explained that it is because this job site is not safe for anyone that doesn’t work there. 

We are currently digging trenches and there are are open trenches, machinery and other equipment everywhere. Sometimes there are workers present while the kids are walking through. I’m not trying to be a dick, it just really really is not a safe place for anyone, especially kids! We are a hard hat, steel toed boots kind of place. 

The response I have received from the kids has been lukewarm at best. Most kids keep doing it, some yell at me and tear down the trespassing signs. My polite asking is not the answer,  obviously.  

I feel like I have a few options here but I don’t know what the right answer is. 

1. Contact the school. I know what school they come from because it says it on the school bus that drops them off. Not sure if they can do anything. 
2. Follow them home and try to talk to their parents. This seems a little creepy, and time consuming since I’d be potentially dealing with 15 or more separate homes. 
3. Call the non emergency police and try to have a cop meet me there at the time the bus comes by to try to show them I’m serious. 

If one of the kids were yours, what would you prefer? If you were a cop, would this be a ridiculous ask? Help! 

TLDR: I work at a construction job site. Kids walk through it on the way home from the bus stop. I can’t figure out how to stop them. It isn’t safe. ",30Oct2018,1
550,"I'm a 15 y/o super picky eater and I'd like some help on how I can go about changing this. As embarrassing as it sounds my diet consists of: Mostly chicken fingers I get frozen and some potato based product like fries or mashed potatoes, if not then I will eat canned corn beef hash, Ramen which I eat 2 packs but not very often because it's Ramen and Hot Dogs when we grill stuff. I will eat a good amount of fruit, some veggies but I won't try meat or nothing, seems like the issue for me is just the psychological effects of me just gagging no matter what like when I had real chicken tonight. Tonight I manned up and after the first 2 terrible bites I went back because I felt as if I needed to and it wasn't as bad.

It doesn't seem like trying things over and over is a problem it's just how can I get into the mindset to eat more new/I don't think I like this stuff but sure I will with more bites. When I try things over and over and like it I'm usually proud of myself but will go very long without trying something even at least once again. Any way I can overcome this really shit picky eating habits I'm about to start wrestling in a week and need to get into the habit of eating at least a little better so I can lose weight and just not eat chicken fingers all the time.

She did this after she tried to break up with him and he threatened to kill himself. She said she regrets what she did and it wasn't worth it at all, and that she wouldn't do it again. I can kind of understand that she cheated; she felt trapped and needed a way out or a way to feel good. However, I keep obsessing over this and I get paranoid that shes going to cheat on me. 

She hasn't told me a lot about it because she knows it'll bother me and give me anxiety, which honestly is good because I don't really want to know. But at the same time, I just have these thoughts where I'll see someone in public and think ""Maybe it was him"" . Ill be the first to admit I'm insecure and sometimes, when shes with a guy friend or out doing something, I get paranoid and anxious.

556,"For a couple of years now, I’ve been having thoughts about killing myself and recently they’ve been getting to the point where I think it might happen. There’s also a tiny part of me that keeps subtly trying to reach out for help but I always diffuse it before I ever get to the point of talking to someone about it, which is why I’m writing this post. 

When I was 18 (now 23), I developed a gambling addiction (blackjack and roulette) and over the past 5 years I’ve lost my six figure family savings because of it. I’m now 2 months without any gambling and have only £5000 left of debt to pay off but I feel like my history with the addiction is still continuing to mess with my head. This is still only part of what’s going on in my head so to avoid going off on too many tangents, I’ll leave this part here but can discuss more in the comments.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve never been happy with myself. I’m a 23 year old guy but I’m 5’4”, look about 12 and I don’t have the personality to make up for it. Because of this, I always had a history of lying and making stuff up in a desperate effort to try and get people to like me. I’ve always had a group of friends but I’ve always felt like an outsider within our friendship group, constantly feeling like they’re saying one thing to my face but not actually liking me.

Fast forward to just over a year ago, I got a decent graphic design job, in a nearby city. Because of this job, I moved away from my parents and in with a friend from school who’s a bartender in the city. My works going incredibly well and I currently think it’s the only thing that’s keeping me alive. I’ve made new friends with a couple of the people I work with and it’s the first time that I feel like people genuinely want to be with me. There’s one that I get on with particularly well and I’ve tried subtly reaching out to him to ask for help but I always stop myself before it gets anywhere. I recently mentioned it to him when I was drunk and the next day he told me that if I was serious then he was there to talk to but I just responded saying that I say a lot of stuff when I’m drunk and not to worry about it.

Due to my flat mate working opposite hours to me, whenever I’m at home I’m on my own. I’ve been staying at the previously mentioned friends because ‘it’s convenient for work and we get to hang out’ but realistically I’m just staying there at the moment because I’m scared of what I’ll do when I’m on my own. I’ve been throwing myself into my work and working hours later than I’m supposed to because when I’m concentrating on my work then my mind forgets about everything else and it’s almost blissful. 

I’m not entirely sure of the reason for this post but I think I just wanted to write it down and get it out there, even if the people who know me don’t find out. I think part of me is looking for advice and support but there’s also part of me that’s looking for the motivation to do it and that scares me.

562,"Yes, a throwaway. 

I've been a news producer at a small TV station in a small town for about four years. I've been hoping to move to New York, and make it ""big"" on a network since I was a kid. Obviously, in the TV industry, national network TV pays more than local news and is more prestigious - it's the ""major league.""

I scoured all of the networks' career pages for about 8 months. I finally landed an interview in New York, and it went well. The pay would be decent, benefits are alright, and all that good stuff. And, I'd be living out my goal: to produce network TV. The problem? 

It's at Fox News. Their divisive rhetoric is objectively playing a part in shredding this country apart, and now I'm torn on what to do. The position on the newsroom side, so it's not like I'd be writing Tucker Carlson's or Hannity's talking points. I'd be working on the news stories in between the pundits bickering and opinionated shows. So, I can't decide if I should:

**A)  Jump at this opportunity, get some experience and move on to bigger and brighter things.**

**B)  Stick to my day job (and my morals) and wait for something just as good to come along. Even if it never does.**

I'm not ultra-liberal, and obviously not ultra-conservative. I'm just one of those weird nerdy types who genuinely loves news and producing TV. If you've happened to watch at all, you know that every so often, the news shows (Shep Smith, Brett Baer, etc.) crank out a piece of critical, hard-hitting journalism. Again, in between the toxicity. 

That being said, **I'm scared**; scared of being viewed as a sell-out and a propagandist by those in my life and by future employers, scared of what that place might actually do to me, and scared I'm straying from the true intention of this dream I've had since high school.

PLEASE HELP ME! \*kind, constructive comments only as i may show this to him\* im genuinely worried about the dogs well being. please comment about WHY HE SHOULD BE NEUTERED.
