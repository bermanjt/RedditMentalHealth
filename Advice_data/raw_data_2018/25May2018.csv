But I’m pretty sure this dude thinks he is amazing for being a doctor, and I should just fall head over heels for him. But I need to tactfully deal with this, as it is work related. And I don’t like being mean. And I will have to work with him for another couple years. It is making me uncomfortable, but it’s nothing super overt. It’s subtle. Could be defined as “harmless flirting” which I hate. But it’s noticeable enough to my other coworkers. ",25May2018,0
1,"My bf is very unlucky in work, hard worker and is praised for his work. Last two years he worked at this shitty job and finally found a job that has benefits. He puts in his 2 weeks, gets fired. He starts the new job this week and they promised him full time and now they tell him he is on call because the owner's son wants to work there along with a friend.

2,"So I just finished up my senior year of high school and my mom has told me I need to get a summer job, because she wants me to have spending money for college. As a family, we do not need the money and that has nothing to do with my mom's standing on the topic. So I go down to an ice cream parlor near where I live and talk to the manager, we have a quick interview which went well, and a few days later she calls me to let me know I got the job.

The issue is that I am a highly competitive athlete, and I have been invited to train with a very prestigious team this summer, I am extremely excited for this opportunity.

There are two big conflicts with this situation. Firstly, I would be done training an hour and a half before my shift would be starting, which is the latest shift available. The place is an hour away from where I live with very light traffic. I would also need to go home and shower before going into work. I don't know if it will be possible to make it into work on time everyday.

With this current schedule, I have almost zero free time as I would be leaving around 6 am to go to practice, and I would get home around 10pm after working. I feel like the mix of high intensity training and working will be very physically and mentally draining, I dont know if I will be able to handle it. This is also disappointing to me because I would like to be able to hang out with my friends and enjoy my summer, because it is my last summer at home and we are all going off to different colleges in the fall. I would not be able to do this during the week or weekend with how my work schedule looks, which the manager has already made compromises to fit my practice schedule.

Secondly, included with training with this team, there is a trip to go compete at a national level event, which is a week long trip towards the back half of summer, which on the complete other side of the country. I am worried that I won't be able to compete at this event because of the job, which would awful for me because this sport is the thing I am most passionate about in my life.

I really did not want this job, or any, this summer because I knew what problems would come of it. I can't find a way to convince my mom to let me not get this job, even though my dad is neutral on the discussion. I have no clue what to do as I am supposed to start working, as well as training with this new team next week.

I absolutely will not give up this opportunity and I just don't think its possible to have a job while training with this team and still being able to enjoy my summer. Im not worried about the money, I  honestly couldn't care less as it is something I can go without if it means I can make the best out of this opportunity.",25May2018,2
3,"We were able to get her coverage before open enrollment ended this year, but she constantly gets calls from independent health insurance companies seeking her business. She’s tried to get taken off of their call lists. She’s polite every time they call, explaining that she’s already covered now. Today, a representative from Allied Health called her. She kindly stated that she was already covered and has tried to be placed on their do not call list, to which the man responded, “that mythical thing? (Laughter) Yea, good luck.” Then he hung up on her. She didn’t pay attention to his name.

I guess we’re trying to figure out what else we can do since the do not call list option isn’t working. Does anyone else suffer from this?",25May2018,1

6," In terms of whether I have depression, I don't really know. From what I've heard, depression generally induces low self esteem and a fall in enjoyment for previously exciting activities among other conditions. I can't get a diagnosis at this moment in time and so can't confirm anything, but I know I do not associate with the low self esteem part, and instead the lack of enjoyment part. Given the conditions I suspect It's burnout. For almost 12 months now \(for the first few I spent It In a dark room\), my routine has consisted of watching movies \(whether at home or at a theater\), TV series, playing video games and surfing the web. I don't have much else I can do \(but all suggestions are welcomed since I could have missed something\) but what I'm doing is definitely a scheme for burnout.

There is no way to prove my innocence. This happened 3 years ago but people believe that I'm guilty of every incident even remotely related to my wrong doing. I was using drugs to cope and escape, but now I have a DUI and am on probation so that is no longer an option. That's all I was living for was drugs. I don't want to kill my self because I know my family would be devastated, but I can't live my life sober. Is there any way I can stop panic and anxiety while being drug tested?

10,"Sorry if this is in the wrong place, but I’m not quite sure where to turn. 

My mom works at a hotel in the sales department, and frequently goes to trade shows and such. This past weekend a man walked up to her, looked at her name tag, and said “Hey, I know you! I sent you a letter.” My mom has never met this man in her life, nor has she received a letter from him. He said he works for a lighting company and gave her his card. He proceeded to return to her booth another 4 times throughout the day, being very awkward and just strange. My mom, being professional, said that he should visit her hotel and she could give him a tour. (At this point, she thought he was just an awkward guy trying to reach out.)

Anyway, so now today she received a card from him (5 days later). The card has two pictures in it, one of my mom and I at my prom 3 years ago, and a picture of me and my boyfriend from a year ago. Both of these pictures were ONLY posted on my mom’s private Facebook account. The message accompanied with it was just... weird. He said something to the effect of “I would love a tour of your hotel. You should know you are very appreciated. Would it make sense for me to visit?”

My mom showed her co-workers and HR. Everyone agreed that it was bizarre and not ok in any sort of professional sphere. HR said there was nothing they could do, except put it on my mom’s file for future reference. 

My mom plans to give him a call to let him know
that the card seemed threatening and she didn’t appreciate it. But she also doesn’t want to encourage or antagonize him if he’s going to do something crazy. Should we go to the police? How should we proceed? His business is legit and has some good reviews online, which makes me feel a little better, but why would someone do this? Both of the pictures have me in it, and I feel uncomfortable. Any advice would be much appreciated. ",25May2018,1

13,"Sorry for the long post in advance and any unnecessary information, it is my first time posting here. 


My boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) are on our gap year. I currently work at a sandwich/coffee shop while my boyfriend works at a pub/restaurant. 


My boyfriend has previously mentioned how he enjoyed the exclusive friends he has at work and was reluctant to hand in a friends CV because of these friendships which were separate from other friendship groups. He has since recommended a close friend to work there alongside him and seems to enjoy it. 


Recently work has gotten far too stressful for me and I typically leave frustrated and sometimes in tears due to my managers, especially now that I have reminded my manager that I would like to go part-time once University starts. Due to this frustration, I have asked my boyfriend about working at the same place as him. He never really encouraged it, although he is typically quite passive. When I asked him about it, he said it’s because whenever I brought up working alongside him I didn’t seem serious. Last week, after a day that was particularly hard on me, I sent my boyfriend my CV and asked if he would be able to hand it in. He has loosely mentioned handing it in, but I believe hasn’t actually done so. 


I’m too scared to ask him about it in case I pressure him to hand it in, but I’d also like to know if he has or not so that I can start looking at my options for this summer. 

What should I do?

14,"So there's this girl I want to be friends with (emphasis on FRIENDS, don't give me dating advice) but I'm having trouble finding a way to talk to her. Could you guys help me out here?

Some context: I go to one of the largest highschools in America, classes are held across 26 buildings. The class I have with her is quite a distance away from the building my previous class is in. On my way to that class, I always pass her outside the building we're coming from, because she is waiting for her friend (who is also in that class) to exit the building so she can walk to class with her. I always get to class slightly before her because of this. The class itself is not a social environment. We all are silently working on the computers, and there is no chance to talk to anybody. Around 6 minutes before class ends, we all stand up and get ready to leave. She walks over to her friend's computer and chats with her, while I sit at mine, or stand near the door. A minutes before the bell rings, they move over to the door. Once it does ring, they walk together to lunch (I have the same lunch as them).

It's really important to me that I at least try to befriend her. I just can't find a good way to do it. I can't  just walk up to her, say ""hey"" and randomly force a conversation. It's also would be pretty hard to start a good conversation with her while she's chatting with her friend.

So here's where you come in. I'm going to try talking to her tomorrow, guaranteed. There is a 50/50 chance her friend will be absent because she's on a Memorial Day trip. I want you guys to give me something to do in the event the friend is there, and in the event the friend isn't there. Also keep in mind, if possible, I'd really like to become friends with her friend too, though not as much, and I don't think it's as likely.

Thanks in advance.",25May2018,1

19,"Long story short I was sexually assaulted and the case is awaiting trial. The prosecuting attorney wants my input on what I think a fair consequence should be. During the assault I was pressured into smoking more weed than I was comfortable smoking. 

Because weed was involved, I think I can ask that requiring he be drug tested and be sober be apart of his requirements. Knowing this guy does a lot more than weed and would struggle staying sober, I could very easily make his life hell if I were to require this of him. At the same time, I feel like I’m abusing the system.  I personally don’t believe sobriety is a legal issue and is rather a mental health issue. But I’m so fucking angry inside I want him to suffer.

26,"So this is going to be long so bear with me...

Earlier in the school year I made bad financial decisions and needed to get a job. I applied everywhere and for everything but nothing was working out. I eventually decided to apply for this tutoring-like position at this company. For it I did a few interviews and demonstrated my teaching abilities and got the job. 

I realized early on that there was a lot of disorganization going on but figured that I needed it and could live with it. I was informed of my salary and how my pay worked. I was not given the opportunity to set up a direct deposit, was not told when pay day was, did not fill out the general tax forms you fill out when you start a job, or given the necessary forms I would need to fill out every month to get paid. 

So....in my offer letter they basically told me how many hours a week I could work. But still required me to fill out a form. At the end of my first month I asked for the forms as they hadn’t been given to me and I figured they wouldn’t be until I asked. By time I got them both it was the beginning of the next month.  I submitted the forms and received no other correspondence about my pay or whether they had received them or not.  At the top of the forms it asks for address and name. I did not see that originally, however my email is my entire first and last name and i sign every email with my name. So I doubt it could pose an issue. My address also isn’t ideal for sending money or anything else. 

I waited two weeks before I asked someone about it. They said they would ask the person who is responsible for this kind of thing about it, but I still decided to email them myself. I am waiting for a response, but my question is what should I do? It’s about to be the time where I have to submit more forms for this month and my program with them ends in a few weeks.

 Some things to note. 

I didn't work my contracted shifts because the staff made me uncomfortable and I hadnt even signed a contract!. Management had joked infront of me about trans people and one manager said she wouldnt hire a woman because she was transgender even though she was qualified. Other staff had made comments about stuff such as kicking dogs and fake IDs. The whole enviorment was unprofessional and shocked me. I wasn't trained and left alone on checkouts. Honestly after being in a staff room where a group of people including the store manager laughed at queer people for a bit. I had to leave.

38,"I am a 22 year old male who lives in Alberta, Canada. I have been at University for four years and only have one semester (3-4 months) left of school before graduating. During these four years, I have worked as a security guard at a company who have treated me absolutely amazingly. I am now returning this summer for a fifth year in a promoted position of supervisor for security and operations. I am working alongside a very good friend of mine, and we have been through extensive training and have taken on this position together. This is where my problem comes in:

I am sick and tired of my routine, and I am beyond fatigued at the thought of not knowing where I am going in life. I hate the concept of having to work my way up the ranks of a business world only to barely break 6 figures a year. I get sick at the thought of working this job for another summer, and barely making any money to support myself or do the things I want to do. I have been doing a lot of research and found a job that I think I would love and could see myself doing for the rest of my life. IFR Air Traffic Controller, who makes a median salary of $150,000 (after experience) is something that really interests me. I know that this is a rigorous training process and a stressful environment, but I handle stress very well and believe I would thrive in this. This is where my problem starts:

I want to apply with NAV Canada and go into training asap, essentially quitting my job on the spot and not returning to university to complete my degree. But I have a huge problem with this, because my parents have paid for my university and I feel obligated to finish my last semester, having worked so hard and spent so much time on it. I know the right thing to do would be finish this degree, work this job for the summer, and then go after ATC, but something inside of me is screaming at me to get on this now and just quit everything else. 

I feel like I can't quit my job, or quit school, because other people are relying on me to do this, and it's terrifying. Any advice is truly appreciated

40,"Tldr : Ive hit a point where im in a 4 month relationship with this girl.  We met on tinder and hit it off pretty well and have talked almost everyday a month after we met.   But after we finally met she doesnt talk the same anymore and is distant and cold.  What should i do?

She kinda moved pretty fast i want to say. But  She has to keep up with school and keep a 4.0 gpa and claims shes constantly busy.  She said she didnt have time for a relationship (and has *never* had one) during school, but i said i wouldnt mind it.  She said ok, and so we decided to meet after school, since our schedules never lined up and were at different colleges.  We initiated some dirty texts and pics and i figured we were basically in a relationship.  

Until then we talked sooo much it was wake up and text until we fall asleep.
Time comes around for us to finally meet up. She says she has one day and an hour to meet up. We decide a coffee shop is a good 'date' spot (if you wanna call it that) and we meet up.  We talk for the time she has and everything seems good.  She doesnt seem uninterested and dismissive, and afterwards we text and say we both have had a good time. I didnt try and force a hug or kiss or anything strange so i dont think i creeped her out.  

The day afterwards i expect my usual morning text but i dont get one... this proceeds for next couple of weeks and im about to leave out lf state for a month for vacation.  I tried once to initiate conversation but she was dismissive.  I told her but even on her day off she hasnt even texted me about after i asked her like she casually forgot.

This my first serious relationshil not for sex but for love, so is this normal or should i cut my losses?

41,"I’ve worked at this job for a while now and I have a difficult coworker. Sometimes he’s alright, other times not so much. He often complains and is negative, and regularly won’t come to work or leaves early. I would say this happens on a monthly basis or thereabouts. This guy has a knack for being snappy and rude, but I always took it on the chin until recently, when he made a snarky comment and I kind of lost it at him.

The story is, I’d gone to his department to help him with something, and out of nowhere he starts condescending me and being rude. This has happened many, many times but this time I’d had enough. I lost it and maybe used a few expletives, went back to my department in a rage. My boss asked me what had happened and I told her. I didn’t speak to him for two days after this, and later found out neither had the boss. Anyway the situation has gotten awkward and weird now, the guy hasn’t been coming into work regularly due to sickness and mental health issues. We had a somewhat mutual apology earlier but I didn’t feel much was resolved. He said I was causing his mental health to turn bad and causing him stress.

This morning he came in, accused me of trying to take his job and turning management against him. He then left again. I called the boss later to ask another question and mentioned what had happened, and I got the sense that they were planning on firing the employee. I could be reading into it too much but that’s how I perceived it.

Should I feel bad? I didn’t want him to get fired, but at the same time I was sick to death of the constant condescending and rudeness. I’d held it in for some time and finally erupted. I got the sense that the boss was more upset with him then me over the incident.

Anyways I feel really terrible, the whole situation has just gotten totally out of hand and it’s affecting my day to day at work. Can anyone give me some feedback or advice?",25May2018,1

44,"I walked into a housing situation under the impression that it was going to be just me and my suitmate (A), only to find out that there would be two other suitmates living with us (B and C).

Suitmates A, B, and C have an established friendship amongst themselves, making me the outcast and feeling a little uncomfortable. Ultimately, with some time I think I can get over this and not have it bother me.... truthfully I just wish I had been given a heads up prior...not, on move in day.

My biggest concern right out is with suitmate C and her religious beliefs. I used to practice her religion when I was younger, but as I grew up I started following agnosticism. I don't have any family... I consider my two best male friends my family since they're really all I have. They come and visit me roughly everyday for breif moments - an hour or two at most. Because my roommate practices islam, she isn't allowed to be seen by males that aren't in her family 'uncovered'. I think she was under the assumption that our dorm wouldn't have males so she walks around without her hijab. I think she is starting to get annoyed and upset with me....I've noticed she doesn't really speak to me or say hello much every though I say hi.


I've tried asking her for her number or to find a way to communicate that there are males present in passing, but we haven't been able to establish anything yet. When I do have males over, I'll do a quick check to make sure the 'coast is clear' before letting them in, and if she is there, letting her know I have a male friend with me so she can cover herself.


When my friends ARE over, I have started restricting them from leaving my room and roaming the apartment freely... including bathroom breaks, which makes me feel like a horrible person because now I'm trying to cater to someone while treating my friends poorly.

I don't know what to do.... please help? I'm very anti-conforntation. I have extreme anxiety problems with depression which makes me feel like im a horrible person for putting everyone in this situation ...and always try to be a people pleasure.

TLDR: Muslim roommate doesn't wear hijab around college apartment. She can't be seen without it by males if they aren't family. I have male friends that come for short periods of times daily to visit. She's starting to get annoyed because they visit and she doesn't wear her hijab.I try to be respectful and keep friends from roaming around apartment too much so they don't bother her. I always give her a warning, or do a coast check to make sure she's in her room before allowing my friends in the dorm. I feel torn on what to do. She's starting not to like me - tried talking to her about trying to set up a way to warn her via text or something but hasn't been able to happen yet. I'm starting to treat my friends poorly due to restricting their freedom at the dorm when they visit so she feels more comfortable...",25May2018,1

48,"Hi thanks to anyone reading this I'v recently been struck with dilemma. I'm 15 years of age, and have a older sister who is 25 years of age, and lives at home with us. The reason why she does is because she has mental issues, and other issue's that I don't really want to get into. So about a year ago my Mom gave her a tablet, and she had a computer, and everything was fine until she was doing some stupid stuff \(Porn and talking to older people and doing other stuff I don't know about ect.\), but i'm not internally  sure that's what was going on I was quickly pushed under the rug and no peep got out about what actually went on. Then she went to a mental institute to get help, after a few week's she said she was fine and refused to go get help. Fast forward a couple months later we got an Xbox one S for Christmas, and before that she had no access to the internet. Fast\-Forward to no and shes doing the something talking to random people on the internet, so my mom mad it so she could talk to anyone on the internet to help protect her because she can't tell the difference between good people or bad people that was also anther main reason she restricted the internet from her. So I thought I would be nice and let her use one of my extra accounts and just chat because I felt she was pretty lonely sometimes, And I found out who she was texting and chatting too. I told my older brother because I needed advice on what to do, tell her to stop, tell her the danger of this guy, tell my Mother? Ect. The person she is talking to though doesn't seem like a peave but she is calling her like baby and such and she hasn't meet this guy who's she been chatting online with.

 So this is what I need advice on\(Sorry for all the extra background I just wanted to make sure you kind of understand the situation\). Should I tell my Mother or should I leave this a secret between me and my brother and handle it myself, but the reason I'm having trouble with that is I still want her to trust me just in case because I think she super depressed and suicidal but I don't know\(that why I can't block her account\). and the other question I ask myself is she doesn't have much happiness in this world and everything so what if I just monitor the situation and leave it as be \(then she doesn't know that i'm monitoring her and she will still trust me\). 

Thanks anyone that made it this far and mybye understand the situation I'm faced with. If anyone doesn't understand just ask and I will try and explain it better. 

Thanks again so much!!!",25May2018,1

55,"Hello all,  


My situation is a little complicated, I'm going to simplify it, but I'd like to hear your opinion. I've been wanting to change my career by taking a bootcamp and become a fullstack developer, but my fiancée and I have been living abroad and it hasn't been sustainable for me to enroll in a bootcamp until now.

My fiancée is Korean and we're currently living in our countries of birth. We've been apart for a few months now, I use to teach English in Korea when we met and shortly thereafter fell in love and have been living in foreign countries together since \(as we can't simply visit the US\). We've decided that we want her to immigrate to America and it'll take approximately a years time for us to get in the appropriate documentation for the correct visa. What we have decided boils down to two situations:  


Situation A: I move to Korea, teach English again, and get married!. I love Korea, and it's her country so I need/want to embrace it. I'll get to spend more time with her family, and she could potentially get experience in a new job with transferable skills to America \(she just started a bootcamp\). Con \- I want to change my career, I've been wanting to do it for two years now, but haven't because we had moved to Australia.  


Situation B: I enroll in a bootcamp and hopefully get a decent job. Then, she moves to America and we get married! Con \- she will be unable to work for 8 months after marriage, and this may involve longer intervals of time apart.  


We're open minded and are preparing to do either. I've applied for jobs in Korea and have been looking into bootcamps. She started a bootcamp and wants to do whichever will *work*. I'm just concerned if I don't do a bootcamp **now**, then they will become obsolete and the job opportunities in a years time will become worse. Although, I love teaching English and living in Korea, I feel as though I've already done that and I need to do the next thing in life. But she is my life, and I want to do whichever is better for *us*. Any thoughts?

83,"I work at a nail salon and apparently we're all going on a trip out of town for 3 days ""for fun."" I'm pretty introverted and it doesn't help that I work 6 days a week, so having more than one day off makes me want to take time for myself and do what I want and get things done around the house (I live with my bf and 3 dogs, I'm constantly making to do lists). I want to have time to knock things off my list and also rest and relax, something I don't get to accomplish very often. I don't drink, which is what they will be doing for the most part. It doesn't intrigue me whatsoever. Plus I'm not super close with them so I have no reason in my head I can think of that I could convince myself to go.

They planned this trip and decided not to go because my co-workers started slacking and my boss (who I'm related to) was pissed. However, she already booked the hotel so she decided and assumed we're all going.

I'm bad with confronting people, and I'm not sure how to tell them I'm not going.  It doesn't help that my coworkers (one in particular) is ecstatic about the trip, and I'll most likely be asked questions and put on the spot in front of clients. I've basically been pretending I'm going this whole week because I don't know how to say no. I feel guilty, then I feel guilty for feeling guilty because I can do whatever the fuck I want, right?

84,"Me, 24F, living in my own little world. 

fuck. 

That time of the year when your boyfriend’s-bestfriend’s-girlfriend’s birthday party is tomorrow night and you have to actually go out and socialize. Am I friends with the boyfriends- bestfriend’s-girlfriend? No. Was I sort of friends with her when me and boyfriend started dating? We tried. We’re so different. It wasn’t meant to be a besties type of thing. She’s drama. She’s annoying. She’s really friendly. She’s full of confidence and you’re lacking that heavily. She has a BUNCH of girlfriends. Who are all going to be there having a great time which will be mostly spent on Snapchat or Instagram or getting that perfect picture with her number balloons. 2-6. 

I’ll be the odd one out. I’ll be the awkward one. I’m way out of their loop. I’m on a different planet, alone. 

What do I fucking wear to not be boring or simple. How do I do my fucking hair with the stupid bangs I never should have gotten I don’t have the right face shape for fucking bangs but you have fucking bangs. The length of my hair is awkward — not long, not short. 7 months it’ll be long swears my hairdresser BUT ITS TOMORROW the parties tomorrow and you don’t look the way you want to look. 

What do I fucking wear. What do I fucking wear. I have no clothes I need to buy clothes. Where do I want to buy my clothes? Expensive stores. I just paid off my credit card but NO OTHER STORE seems good enough to buy my outfit. The parties fucking tomorrow so I need to buy my outfit tomorrow. 

I don’t want to go.
I want to cry and stay in bed. 
I don’t want to be around these fucking girls. The girl who ignored me for an hour straight. The girl who’s annoying and loud and whiny. 
But I want them to like me. Want them to talk to me and tell me how cute I look. Just for one night.

I don’t want to fucking go. But I have to because it would be weird if I didn’t.

88,"My boyfriend (well I mean my now ex) was caught sending pictures of his dick to two other girls which was really shocking because no one really saw that coming from him. All my friends got really mad and some wanted to beat him up but I won’t let them. When I initially broke up with him he couldn’t speak louder than a faint whisper. Some people started telling me “he has another side” and so I decided I would like to hear it. I met up with him and I asked him to tell me the entire story from start to finish and so he did and told me he didn’t send anything. Then I said “okay I also had a conversation with Jessica(fake name) she explained to me that you sent her pictures of your dick as well” at this point he stopped trying to lie. 

(A little backstory in my last relationship I would go on the internet and find guys and send them stuff to piss off my boyfriend because he would yell at me for everything and that’s no excuse and I’ve learned and grown from it. It was a extremely toxic relationship but it needed to happen so I could learn from it. I told my most recent boyfriend about this to show him how people can change and grow while we were still together because he was mad I was friends with a person who got into some trouble with this awhile back.)

After I told him I’m not getting back together with him he said “I thought you would understand because you did the same thing” so I told him “I had to learn from that mistake and so do you” I feel awful because it’s a valid point and all but I don’t see myself ever taking him back because I don’t think it would benefit either one of us.

89,"This is a throwaway account just because some people might recognize my original username.

The fast facts:
- me and my roommate have been friends for about a year and a half
- i've confessed to having feelings for them about a year ago but was gently let down
- we both dated and hooked up with different people for awhile
- but now i realized i still have major, major feelings for them
- several people have told me or hinted that it's obvious they are into me but i'm not totally sure
- they are leaving for lebanon in about three weeks so it's highly probable i might not see them again and if i do, it won't be frequent at all

So I guess the thing I'm struggling with the most is deciding to tell them or not how I feel. On one hand, I think this could easily crumble our relationship if they don't feel the same way, especially since they're moving so far away. On the other hand, I (unfortunately?) do have a glimmer of hope in it being reciprocated, and our friendship could possibly fade away anyways. So i have nothing to lose.

90,"Hey,

Just wanted to ask for advice because:

- My family is poor
- I'm going to be a senior in college but my grades are generally garbage 
- I squandered most of my opportunities and ended up with a bullshit major
- America is going down the drain and I want to live in Europe before I see it happen (I'm black and there's too much hostility and corruption here for me to accept) 
 - I need to move to the city this summer but I don't know how to make money because I have an unpaid internship that I have to be at all day 
- I've aged terribly from long-term Adderall use so I look 35 even though I'm 21 and I'll probably never have a husband 
- I'm depressed and hopeless, and just want something to look forward to again

So yeah, fuck my life, right?

My three main goals (from most to least urgent are to):
1. Move out and get my own place this summer
2. Find a prospect for my future (either applying to grad school in the humanities or getting a job in finance) 
3. Find a way to emigrate to Europe despite the fact that my grades are garbo and I don't have tech skills

So yeah...help?

I don't know whether I should quit my internship and move somewhere nicer (like London or California) to work on my depression, figure my life out, and do applications for grad school. If I'm going to move out on my own I almost need more time to work, because my health is bad and I can't exert myself too much. In London I could live with family rent-free, but I'd have to pay for the ticket and I probably couldn't legally work all summer. In California it'd be more expensive but I'd be really happy (it's my favorite place) and I might gain some distance and be more productive. At the same time, this internship might be a good idea- the only problem is they already hate me because I got sick at the beginning and that pissed them off (it's finance so that's how they are.) I was mainly doing this for a letter of rec/references but if I won't get those I don't know if it's worth it to spend my time this way. If I'm going to leave I have to figure things out soon.

My dad is healthy, he just chose to live here because it was cheaper. He doesn't mind me leaving, and in fact I'm not supposed to be here but I had to come because my mom is abusive and I can't live with her.

I suffered (still do to an extent) from chronic pain, lack of motivation, and memory loss due to my depression, so showers, brushing my teeth, washing my face, etc etc all kind of went out the window. 

I already chopped off most of my hair because of how damaged it was, and while I typically have the *motivation* to do the actions, I’m just struggling to *remember* to do it. I would just set alarms, but because they’re all separate activities, it leads to me having 10 different alarms, and then I forget what the alarm is for.

It wouldn’t be a big deal, except I tend to spiral back once I realize I forgot to do something (a coping mechanism I’m trying to work past), and it makes me feel like I’m falling back into what I was, which is a very very frustrating feeling.

95,"So I am 22, boyfriend is 24. We live together and been together for 10 months. I have always known that he loves his guitar and I am proud of his passion and commitment to it. But lately I am scared that this is starting to become an obsession. He no longer wants to work. We are in a position where our living situation is very affordable (uni students). He does not want a job and wants to invest his full effort into playing guitar and busking. This idea slowly came out every time we’d smoke weed together, but this time he’s very serious about it. We are young, so I am in no position to attempt to persuade him against his dreams but I can’t help but feel this change of attitude is not healthy (please correct me if this is paranoia). He seems to be obsessed with this idea of sharing his passion with the world, bent on this idea that he does not need to work under anyone after years of working in hospitality/factory doing mundane work. He claims if he fails he will work, at least after a year or two of trying hard. I’m worried that this may change (Should I even worry about the future?). 

He is the kind of person who does not care for material possessions and wants to follow his own path and make mistakes in order to grow. I am worried that this attitude reminds me of a lot of people who get into a rut and lack motivation, although on the other hand, is this just healthy behaviour that perhaps I am not used to? 

I am also very fearful as I lost my brother to suicide and before he died he was full of energy and passion, exhibiting similar behaviour to my boyfriend now (who has a very bad sleeping pattern and thyroid condition). I also want to point out that boyfriend is very good around the house, cleans and cooks for us.

I am not sure what to do because I want to travel with him and be with him because I love him dearly, but I can’t help but feel something is wrong (or am I reading into it too much as it is not a lifestyle I am accustomed to?)

108,"So I've been kinda hesitant to post about this but I think it's time I actually ask for advice about this situation.

I'm gonna start off by saying I was once I guess friends or acquaintances from last year \(in their terms\) with this person because we would talk on and off every month or so and just chit chat about whatever sometimes or what happened between them and a mutual friend \(This person is from online\).    
I will also mention that this person told me that they are a transparent / very blunt person about how they are. \(I will call them O\)

Well in April of this year we talked more than usual because of somethings they were saying in a chat that we were both in and the stuff they were saying intrigued me and I took it upon myself to talk to them because of this and it kinda started from there and ended kinda shitty.

So some drama happened in this chat that we were both in for awhile ,some of the people in the chat got word that me and O were talking  , basically the chat kinda took it to far by saying some false info about me and O in the process so that O wouldn't want to talk to me anymore. Because of what the people said that we considered friends were doing this. I guess I can also mention that O went off on me saying I was going around saying we were something when I never did. 

After we stopped talking O has went around saying to his friends and whoever else that I was obsessive because of somethings that were said in our past conversations that actually don't matter anymore. Also I haven't contacted them since May 6th and this was after they told me they don't want to talk anymore.

The reason why I am making this post is because of the fact that O has recently been more paranoid than usual since  I became friends with one of O's friends \(I'll call them A\) well A started to hate me for awhile because of what O said about me but I cleared the air with A about telling them my side of the story. And A told me about what O was saying , we'd talk about stuff going on and the whole drama in the chat we were all in. Basically both me and A found out that we found common ground and we've been hanging out for awhile.

So now I'll tell you what O has been saying about me and I honestly would like help getting this person to back off of the idea that I'm something that I am not.

So now O is basically trying to act like they know everything about me when they do not \(This is a claim that O has made about me\) , O also claims that I am obsessive , that I latch onto people , that I am using A to get to them. O has said to A ""They are obsessive , they can't live without me."" O has also said ""I don't care what that dumb cunt says I know that they are lying."" and told A ""I am glad you took them off my hands and they like you now."" Basically they also think that I want them and what not when I clearly show no interest and A realizes that and all O does is say"" I don't care."" when clearly that's not true considering how much time and effort they put into talking about me in a bad way. 

I literally never did anything to cause this response from them , I was always nice to them and I tried to show that I cared about them as a friend nothing more before all of this",25May2018,2

112,"For the majority of my work career as a dishwasher for a 4 1/2 star resturant, ive worked by myself getting on average 70-80 guests on weekdays and 100-200 on weekend/holidays. In short ive been overworked and all my coworkers knew this and helped however they could.

About 2 months ago they hired a new dishwasher (going to call him Robert so its easier to follow) which i was happy for! Finally i get more help! But in the pass 2 months Robert still puts dishes in the wrong places and sometimes dirty. He also doesnt touch any of the heavy duty cleaning (like soak for 2-3 hours then scrub your heart out) or that anything that requires heavy lifting. Ive been telling him to 2x check, scrub harder, let soak, etc. But nothing seems to be going through to Robert. My supervisors have seen these patterns and ive also brought it up to them, so they spoke to Robert. He started to scrub more but not as much as you think. We still get some dishes still dirty but a lot less than before. But! Robert still doesnt do any of the heavy duty unless told by supervisors...

A server came up to me to talk about Robert, she told me that he may be special because she used to work as a teacher for special ed. So she can see the patterns. But if that was the case, my boss would've known at the interview that he is special. But he doesnt know...

Recently my supervisors have been training me to be a cook. They want to move me up, so i haven't been in the dish pit as much. But every night i get in there, because im still going to help. Theres a Huge Load of heavy duty dishes that is just sitting there... Robert usually works with the dishwasher, and the heavy duty dishes sit in the sink.

But heres what bothers me... today! Even though this wasnt the first time this happened. There were about 20 guests that came in. So on average there will be about 80 dishes (plates/bowls) total. That means even if you work 10 dishes per hour, you should be fine. But Robert had a wall of 40 or so dishes with heavy duty dishes that has sat in the sink all day without being soaked or touched...

Then I few days later (today) when with both managers the previous manager let’s saw manager 1 said and I quote “You’re terrible at interviewing. The only reason you got the job is cause of him.” Not in a teasing tone very frank and the other manager is above manager 1 and said “no we felt you’d be a good addition to the branch”. I don’t know if I should talk to them about it cause it honestly really hurt my feelings. Rather just not get the job then get it and be told I’m not qualified and stuff.

115,"I need advice. Badly. I’m feeling suicidal and I’m not gonna do it right now, but I’m always on the edge of almost planning it. I need a way to stop feeling suicidal so I don’t make a mistake.

About a year ago my boyfriend of 7 years left me for a 17 year old girl after seeing her behind my back for a few days. We were both 23 and it was a huge shock and a blow to my ego. I am about 30 pounds overweight on a small frame, while she is young and thin and undeniably more attractive than I. She’s  confident and edgy too, while I see myself as plain and dorky and average looking at best.

The two of us had been long distance most of our relationship, but we drove to see each other every weekend ...and he never chose to move closer to me, instead he chose a college far from the one I was already going to. He cheated on me several times, but always felt bad after and said he regretted his actions and that he always wanted to work through our problems and get married someday. 

However, when he met the new girl, he dropped me in a flash. A very short time into their relationship, he moved out of his parents’ home to get a place with her, they got a cat, he drove her to high school everyday and she payed half of his rent with her child support money. They bought furniture together and basically started to live out the life we had planned together, while I was stuck recently graduated, unemployed, and for the first few weeks of their relationship I was not even sure if our relationship was over. I just thought we were fighting and he was punishing me with the silent treatment as per usual. Meanwhile, he had professed his love for her within days of meeting her.

We ended up trying to work things out a couple months into their relationship (before they had lived together) and broke up again when he lied to our counsellor (I made counselling a condition to us trying again) and I couldn’t control my emotions. I was a wreck. He left me crying/hyperventilating in my car in the parking lot as he drove away and I called him when I got home to end it for good. It was one of many occasions he had left me someplace or hung up on me instead of fighting things out. I just never wanted to feel so helpless again. They got back together about a week after that. 

They aren’t together anymore. In fact, they went on and off about five times as he tried to cheat on her with me or leave her thinking I’d take him back and she came at me via Facebook accusing me of trying to steal her man because I talked to him. I never even saw him in person and just kept telling him we couldn’t talk if he was with her, but I felt guilty for their breakup nonetheless, even though I knew it was the best thing for her. She knowingly dated my boyfriend when he wasn’t available, then she accused me of trying to sleep with him and steal him when they were together and called me a bad person. I hate her but am just happy to see her more settled now. She actually has since started dating someone a bit closer to her age, and I think that’s great. She’s a terrible person, but she’s just a kid, so I am glad not to have to feel guilty anymore over her unhappiness. 

The problem is figuring out what to do now. Even though he’s treated me like trash for a long time now, I don’t want to lose my oldest and best friend. As many bad things as I mentioned here, there are just as many good ones. And I’m not innocent in all of this. I was depressed and developed a medical condition that made sex excruciating so I hardly ever wanted to have penetrative sex. I did pelvic therapy for months to fix that condition, but it was too little too late. I wasn’t his “sex goddess” anymore and he cried over my not letting him inside of me often enough. I didnt compliment him enough or wear the sorts of clothes he liked. I had a short fuse with him and would raise my voice. I even hit him a couple times after finding out he cheated. I have no friends left from prior to his involvement in my life and since graduating university, none of my more recent friends are within driving distance. I have work friends now, but work isn’t the best. Those relationships aren’t enough for me to feel secure. 

He would still want me back if he could have me. He’s willing to be my friend as a second best option, but I know when he gets a new girlfriend it will ruin me all over again. I’ve tried explaining this to him several times. I’m trying to explain that I worry I might become suicidal if that happens and I’m not ready, but he’s not willing to promise that he’ll be single for a while until I get myself together. 

I feel as though I don’t have much to live for right now, but I don’t want to kill myself because it would hurt my mom. She’s annoying and addicted to the casino and she makes my dad miserable, but I love her so much. I want her to be happy more than anything, and she’d do anything for me, but I don’t want to spend time with her, because she’s crazy and she makes me crazy too. So I just want to stay alive working a steady job and trying to support myself about an hour from where she lives. Best of both worlds because she’s close enough to me if she needs me, but too far to make visits convenient. My life is standard enough that it’s not too disappointing to her, but killing myself would destroy her. 

My boss hates me but doesn’t have the power to fire me, so she makes my life hell at work. The hydro in my apartment has an issue where the lights won’t turn on or spontaneously turn off about 50% of the time. It’s also too small for me and my two cats but I can’t afford anything bigger so it mostly smells like cat poo every time they use the box and I go everywhere covered in cat fur. So work sucks and home sucks too. It’s lonely and shitty.

I wanted to learn to rollerblade to try and keep the weight from piling on, because I hate exercising and love food and this was the one healthy thing I decided interested me ...so I got excited about it and bought two pairs of skates and started to try it. I’m terrible at it but I was having fun anyway... and I was rolling down the sidewalk for the first time, looking very obviously like a beginner trying to smile and just focus on getting off the sidewalk if people were walking or riding bikes and just as I was starting to feel like I might be able to start putting my muscles into it and do it for real, a car honked at me and ever since I just haven’t had the confidence to try again.

I don’t know what to do now. I feel like I want to be dead most days. I used to love singing but I don’t feel like I want to anymore, even in the shower. I used to live my life for the weekends and for spending time with my ex, but now every happy moment with him reminds me of what I’ve lost and that soon I will lose this friendship too, when he moves on. 

I did see a guy for a couple months when he and the high school girl were solid, and I thought I was ready to leave that part of my life behind, but the new guy came on a bit too strong for what I was ready for and it scared me off ...and he wasn’t as smart as my ex, and it just made me miss him more. I don’t want to date anyone now, I don’t want to stop being friends with my ex, I don’t want to be friends with him and suffer through watching him fall in love and become successful without me. And I definitely don’t want to hurt my mom by ending my life. What do I do? ",25May2018,2

I started to think about her often.  Not so much feelings I genuily wonder what her life is up. I'm mildy curious too because I unblocked her and looked up her name and her last name changed but there docent seem to be a partner evolved or a relationship status. 

I don't have a lot of experience with relationships under my belt and I know there a strong stance on that kind of thing where you keep in touch with an ex or not.

How do I deal with this?",25May2018,8
119,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.

I'm making my way through college right now, on my own money, and I come home every summer to try and save some money. As I was growing up, my parents were both very strong, in good and bad ways. Grades under a 95&amp;#37; were never allowed, and I obtained a very strong moral compass from them. At the same time, I was never allowed to go to somebody else's house, and was not allowed to leave alone until I went off to college. My mom was afraid of technology and germs, and just about anything outside \(we put on sunblock to get the mail. I wish I was exaggerating\), as if she were 90 years old \(I'm still not sure why this is, but she barely uses anything electronic, despite both her parents having smartphones at this point\), and my dad cannot ever be wrong, even if somebody Googles something and shows him. He will BS his way through absolutely everything. Because of the rule of not leaving the house without a parent, I spent nearly every waking hour outside of school with my parents, and obtained a lot of their personality traits. I also put up with incredible amounts of emotional strain \(I hate to use the word abuse, since it seems overused anymore\), and minor physical abuse.

Now that I'm in college, I've been enjoying my newfound freedom \(very responsibly actually, despite how protective my parents were\) and have made massive amounts of new friends who care very much about me, and I revel in the companionship that humans can have with each other, as I wasn't really exposed to it much until now.

Coming back for the summer is a huge drain because of this. While my friends are usually realistic, optimistic, or slightly pessimistic, the one thing I noticed the most when I came back was a level of negativity so great, I cannot believe I noticed it before. It didn't matter what happened, there was always something bad. Things like ""dinner was excellent,"" were met with ""no, the chicken was low quality."" ""It's so great to see the sun again"" was met with ""rain is better than melanoma."" I haven't heard one positive thing yet. It's Murphy's Law on adderall, and it really brings me down. My friends commented after I returned from summer and winter breaks that I was ""not as fun to be around.""

While the simple solution would be to walk away, it's a little more difficult than that. I am financially independent, and pay for everything I own, except for things like insurance, that include a legal obligation to be paid by the parent. My dad makes upwards of 160k a year, but not a single bit goes to us as children. We are still claimed as dependents on his taxes though, and he uses what he gets back from that to boost his retirement fund. Because of that, and other political reasons, I do not receive any scholarships, as my university does not give out merit based scholarships. I currently can't afford to pay for an apartment over summer because my school work knocks work hours out of the park. My summer work barely pays for 10 months of rent as it is.

HERE'S THE MAIN QUESTION: There's not much I can do in my current situation. However, I'm stuck in a moral dilemma. I image it would feel so great to just cut my parents off after I graduate from college. They joke about me paying for them to live in a nice home someday, but I can't see myself doing that after the way they've acted. At the same time, I know that revenge and bitterness don't normally lead to anything good. I'm already a very cynical person because of how I was raised, and I don't want to worsen this. What do you think I should do? Should I try and find it in me to forgive someday? How would I go about finding that level of forgiveness?

Sorry for the long winded post.",25May2018,2
120,"My only friend is an online Hungarian guy who I’ve been friends with for about 4 years now. He and I have gone through many things together.

However, he is disgustingly racist. He sometimes says the n word for no reason, he often says that Japanese people are “Chinese” and then when I correct him he says that “it’s all the same” and also makes sexist comments about women and the like.

For example today I sent him a meme from an anime and he referred to Japanese as “Chinese” even though he knows very well that anime is Japanese as he watches Girls und Panzer. I said “it’s Japanese and you know that every well” and he responds “Japanese and Korean is just another type of Chinese to me.”

I’ve very directly confronted him multiple times saying; “Korean people and Japanese people are not the same as Chinese people. You have to stop saying they are. I am fucking serious, dude.” To which all he responded is “I’m serious too.”

Another time I don’t remember the context but I asked him; “Do you hate Indians, then?” To which he responded; “You could say that, my mother and I noticed they were basically the blacks of London when we visited the UK.” I asked; “So do you hate me? I’m Indian” to which he responded; “That might be so but you’re a fine gentleman.”

Like ok cool but you still said something disgusting about my country of origin so...

I have a really close relationship with this guy, maybe not emotionally because he’s not a very emotional person \(unlike me\) but we frequently share passwords for accounts and personal details and we Skype each other all the time... we’re as good as best friends IRL, if you ask me. Even though we’ve never met, but I’ve always wanted to.

But this is a really big thing for me. I’m heavily into Eastern culture and I learn both Japanese and Chinese and take my progress very seriously and I often learn about their history too etc, and his purposeful ignorance really bothers me.

Yesterday I was getting ready to visit my sister who was recently admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit. I brought my mini backpack and put $90 cash in it. 

Upon my arrival, me and my dad were told to sign in and hand our phones to the head office. A couple hours later, the same nurse noticed my backpack and said he had to take it behind the nursing station (this is a safety regulation, which I understand, but rather silly that he didn’t mention to remove personal belongings at the beginning of my visit). 

The backpack was in the nursing station for about 1.5 hours. I left the hospital in the evening and got home really late. The next day, I was heading to the coffee shop to get some work done, and as I was looking for my cash to pay, it wasn’t there. 

I have no clue what to do about this. I remember 3 nurses who were in the nursing station the most during that period, but with such little evidence, I feel rather helpless. 

I think what bothers me the most is that I had to trust my belongings with these nurses in order to visit my sister. And through this exchange, my trust in them via (letting them hold onto my backpack) was betrayed

135,"I recently moved into a new apartment and have a roommate so we can split the rent. We have all of the same common interests which is mainly computers. He's been showing and teaching me a lot of what he knows and I've been showing and teaching him a lot of what I know. There's a great exchange of knowledge between us. The two of us both work remotely from home so we don't leave the apartment very often unless it's to buy more food when we run low. Since we don't ever leave there isn't really any reason to keep up on hygiene. We're both guilty of it but I understand the importance of a shower, brushing my teeth and making myself presentable before going outside or if someone is coming over. My roommate showers maybe twice a month at most and usually just changes his clothes once every few days and sprays on some shitty cologne like it's a canned shower. He looks and smells homeless. Here's the problem. I met a girl online. She wants to come over tomorrow night. I asked my roommate to help me clean today. We tidied up, dusted, sanitized and picked up all of the crap we had lying around. I made my bed and changed the sheets for the first time in months. We also opened all the windows to air the place out. A couple hours of that and things looked like when we first moved in. I also followed a guide for removing foul odors from your home so it smells faintly like cinnamon and not sweat and crusty cum socks.

He was fully behind the cleaning and was very helpful. He most likely thought at the time that I just got tired of living  in piles of our waste and trash and not because I don't want to gross out a girl I just met. I need him to shower. Our apartment is small so it's inevitable he'll come within smellable distance. You can easily smell him coming. As such after we cleaned I asked him to take a shower tomorrow morning and brush his teeth. He asked why since I'd never asked him to do that before so I told him a girl was coming over tomorrow night and I'd like her to not be grossed out but I said it more politely. He got defensive and said he'd change his clothes tomorrow morning. I told him clothes don't mask your BO and that he needs a shower ASAP. He scoffed and said okay but I would bet money he's not going to do anything. Telling him to stay in his room doesn't work because his computer is in the same room the tv and couch is in and he's always on it unless he's sleeping. You cannot get him off of it no matter how much you beg him. I legitimately think he's unaware of how bad he looks and smells. How am I supposed to make him bathe? Dumping a bucket of soapy water on him? We worked so hard cleaning and he's going to stink the whole apartment up again and waste all the time we spent cleaning. ",25May2018,1
136,"I am a former US Federal employee who was unexpectedly retired early for medical reasons. I am in my early 30s. My condition is not life threatening or debilitating, and now that I'm not working my job, which required a lot of physical exertion, I am able to manage it very well.  

I did not want to leave my agency, but they were unable to accommodate me or give me an alternate duty that was comparable in pay to my prior position, which I had held for about 10 years. So, I was let go with full benefits and 40&amp;#37; pay indefinitely, which is normal procedure for a Federal employee in my circumstances, a generous program indeed. 

This was about 8 months ago.

Despite the 60&amp;#37; drop in income, we are able to still live comfortably. My wife \(a stay at home mom\) and I own our home \(it was an inheritance\) and so existing on 40&amp;#37; of my previous income is very doable. We don't need a lot and were never big spenders, so I was saving a big chunk of my income over the five or so years, giving us about 50k in savings plus another 50k in the Thrift Savings Plan. 

The problem is that I have been feeling guilty for not having to work. Don't get me wrong, I have been busy since being let go, doing lots of home improvement projects \(at a pace compatible with my physical limitations\) and working on hobbies, et cetera. I have enough long term projects lined up to last me the rest of my life, I will never be bored and life is fulfilling. I've enjoyed having time to just sit and read or play with my kid, something I rarely had time for while I was working.

But the retirement I am receiving seems like it was designed to help me transition into a new career, as it goes away as soon as I am re employed in a new career making at least 80&amp;#37; of my previous income. The problem is...I have no desire to seek a new career. I loved my previous job but can't medically do it any more, at the end the pain was getting so bad I couldn't sleep at night.  We don't need the money, and I don't know what I would do even if we did. 

 So I'm here, in my early 30s, enjoying a retirement that people normally work 30\-40 years to earn and I only contributed about 10. I'm living my life with my family happily while my friends and former co workers are still working themselves to the bone. Why was I so special? I know these programs are to help people like me, and I'm so grateful for it...but I can't help but feel...I don't know, abusive? 

Right wing talking points about ""welfare leeches"" ring in my ears and while I don't agree with them or even think they apply in my situation, it's hard not to feel like less of a man than when I was an average joe working a 10 hour shift. I'll earn more money NOT working over the course of my life than I did when I was working.

I think about ways of giving back, I want to volunteer more, and want to produce things to help people. But even being able to do these things feels like a luxury. Am I being too hard on myself? I didn't choose this, this was forced on me. But  I am the one choosing to not seek employment and stop being a drain on the federal retirement system. 

I'm not sure what to do with these feelings. I just feel like a weird shame/guilt for being handed a golden ticket out of nowhere. So few people get to live a life of relative freedom and I don't know why I get this privilege. I'm going to work hard to give back in other ways, but can't shake the feeling that I'm somehow a leech for not trying to find a new regular job. 

Not sure what kind of advice anyone can even give, but a place to vent does help. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

 (F21) I’ve know this guy (M21) for the past 7 years and from the moment I met him in high school I knew I wanted to be with him. He was popular and I was quiet but we were best friends. Every night we’d talk on the phone. Eventually we hooked up etc but he was still going around with plenty of other girls. Once high school ended he finally decided to give me a chance. We dated but he couldn’t stay committed. He’s a fuckboy. Despite that I was still with him everyday and his family loved me as their own. Truthfully he didn’t treat me well because he knew I loved him enough to never walk away, which I wouldn’t have. A year ago he officially left me once he had met a new girl who was richer and had the same social status as him. His friends reassured him she was a better fit (white, pretty, rich etc) over me. He bought into it but would still see or talk to me secretively. He wasn’t faithful to her but seemed to treat her better. She (F21) eventually got pregnant and he felt as if she did it to tie him down and keep him. He made it seem as if he didn’t want to be with her. She is 6 months pregnant now and he seems to have done a 180 for her in the sense that he’s living with her, paying for everything and treating her like a queen. I was so sure he would’ve came back to me because their relation is toxic but now he seems happy.

Basically, on the app whisper someone always posts creepy things, most often revolving around lusting after young, teenage girls.

The app always pings him as living .1 - .8 miles away from me, but that’s what it says when I look at my own posts... I don’t think it can go any lower or accurate than that.

A few times I’ve noticed my neighbor sitting outside , alone, in his car during the middle of the between 12:00 to 2:00 AM

When I first noticed it I thought it was weird but wasn’t too concerned since I didn’t have whisper. Then, I downloaded the app and noticed pretty quickly that a very creepy person lived very close to me. I was hoping that the app measured distance based on a radius and he might be relatively far away from me. It was always a concern of mine though that it could be one of my very close neighbors

Well, now I’m pretty positive it’s my next door neighbor. I saw him sitting outside tonight on his phone at the very same time the creepy user was posting things. He also fits in the age range of the user.

He seems to revolve around 3 standard posts: 

Any shy girls down to open up and answer embarrassing questions? 

Any dads who can’t help but look at their young daughters and her friends in the pool? PM me. 

Any step dads who can’t help but check out their step daughters and her friends? PM Me.

I really don’t know what to do. He hasn’t posted anything illegal. I’m also very concerned because I have a young sister (17 years old but she could pass for 14 - 15) I’m leaving for college soon so I won’t be able to keep an eye on him. I haven’t noticed any weird actions between him and any of us in my house but you never know what someone could secretly be plotting.

Should I tell my parents and sister about this? The police? Would the police even do anything or could they make it worse? I don’t want to cause any problems because even though I’m pretty sure it’s him, I don’t know for sure. I plan on continuing to watch when the user posts and watch what my neighbor is up to. 

He’s also married idk if that’s relevant.

146,"Long story short, I have a friend that means the world to me. And they are in a relationship(I am not attracted to them in anyway, so to clarify) but from a few observations I think it could be toxic to a extent(the girl in questions has told me all of this over Snapchat). 
1. When they Skype, even if she would get a text message from her mom saying that one of her sisters was in the hospital, he would get mad and freak out
2. They got into a fight over me being her friend, as he thinks she can’t have friends at all(whether male or female) , then she harmed herself because of that fight
3. She was drunk the other day and he thought that she was talking to another person on the phone
4. Due to #3, he ended up calling her a slut
Despite all this she loves him

However, there won't be any adult supervision, save for the neighbors who have been asked to keep and eye on us the whole week.

149,"I am in grade 11 currently and I am in desperate need of advice. There is a girl in my Physics class who is struggling to understand certain concepts in it. I'm lucky and fortunate enough to be able have a great understanding of these topics, so I try my best to explain things to her. Now, without humble bragging too much, I consider myself a nice person and will always help out those who ask for it. But this girl is a special case...

In my early years of middle school I was in a terrible place mentally. I could of done something very drastic to myself if it wasn't for this girl's friendliness that got me through it. Years later we kind of stopped talking after I got out of that phase of mine, but I never did stop liking her (some would call it a tiny crush). That is why I became baffled when a friend of mine told me that I said to her that if I was as dumb as her, then I wouldn't be doing Physics. I don't recall saying anything along the lines of that, but because I have trouble understanding when I am saying hurtful things (I have mild Asperger's so analysing emotions is difficult for me) I didn't disregard this as a possiblity. This isn't the first time that I have made a seemingly harmless remark to humour my friends that offended someone by interpreting what I said as condescending. I am a highly emotional and apologetic person, so I tried to find her to sort things out as the thought of me hurting someone (especially someone like her) to be unbearable.

I started by sending a message on Snapchat asking if she wanted to talk in person about what people are saying I said about you. She didn't even respond to it, but only saved the message. The day after I finally was able to talk to her alone after avoiding me for the majority of it. I started of by asking why she thought I said that. She simply responded by saying ""because you did"". I then tried to ask for more information of this soul-crushing scenario in my attempt of a poorly executed apology, but she didn't even give me a chance to talk. She kept on telling me that it doesn't feel good to be put down like that and that I just kept having a go at her when she told me that I what was saying wasn't nice. Before I even had the chance to talk, she just walked off leaving me to feel like utter shit. I told my friends about what happened and they all told me to ignore it because they/I know I would never say anything like that. The trouble is she knows everything I've been through with my troubles socially interacting and understands that I need things spelt out sometimes. That is the thing that is troubling me the most right now to the point where I'm struggling to find a reason to keep pushing forward when the reason I was able to do in the first place is because of her.

Sorry about all the text but TL;DR: I have upset a close friend of mine who won't accept my apology no matter how hard I try. How do I get her to help us sort things out before I lose the will to continue moving forward?

This is my first Reddit post BTW so sorry if this was the inappropriate place to ask these kind of personal questions but I really need advice ASAP!",25May2018,2

Something where I might not be loosing my jobs (usually working 2-3 at any given time) every few months and maybe something that gets me out of the repetitive cycle of moving from one living situation to the next every few months (though does not usually line up with getting and loosing jobs). I live out of a duffle bag since I move so much and tend to just more like be somewhere without ever really living there. I usually sleep with someone, abide by their house rules, eat and prepare food how they like it and do things in their styles and move on when I’ve overstayed my welcome.

No student loans or debt and often live in some pretty unmentionable situations but my health has been poor since my childhood and I don’t make much... It sounds like I should be able to put money aside but its not how it works. I have worked briefly in many fields and gone to different parts of the country to do so. No kids. No spouse or significant other. 1 dog. That dog I swear takes care of me.... and a relatively lacking professional skill set. In twenty’s and have lived said way since I was about sixteen. No credit. No credit cards - I can’t spend money I don’t have.

I don’t know how much is really even relevant to say... I never seem to get responses/answers on anything I put out on the net or from anyone I’ve known in person... I wonder if I just don’t present the material well or if there are really no answers... More than likely no one cares enough to bother and I don’t blame them. I don’t think much of myself or having much ability. I always did feel like I would forever scrape along just continually depleting myself mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually until the day I just don’t wake up. I’m just waiting for that day... it’s not for lack of trying; but for lack of results and repeated exhaustion.  I’m so tired and as far as I can tell out options.

Still kicking. Thanks for your time. Cheers

153,"Around 2 years ago I met a really great girl who I fell hard for, first crush I ever took super seriously. I messed up a lot and didn't know what I was doing, and needless to say I messed up a little bit. Nothing bad, I mean in that I couldn't gauge her interest in me nor did I realize how stupid I sounded at points etc. Either way, I asked her out twice. First time she gave me a maybe, set up a ""date"" and that fell through because she nearly immediately met a new guy after who she started going out with. Ouch, but I didn't realize that maybe was just a nice way of saying no. A couple months later, they break up, and I asked her out again, and this time got a yes... which then turned into a no. She told me she was still getting over the way that relationship ended, was still a little anxious over finals, and really didn't think she could be in a relationship with anyone at the moment, which included me and 2 other boys who had just asked her out. Maybe it's naive, but I actually do believe this one because she cried during it.

It's been around 2 years since then and we've had sporadic contact. We're still friends, but we don't message often whatsoever, occasionally we will to say thank you or something. I'm pretty sure she's got a boyfriend now, too. Either way, I still think she's an awesome person to have as a friend, so I'm more or less over the fact she turned me down. It's her loss, anyway.

A couple of weeks ago I got back into an online game me and her both played together a bit and I noticed she's online a lot in my friends list. It got me thinking about some of the fun we used to have playing the game together, and I really wanted to message her to see what's up, but my anxiety and bad social skills got in the way of my judgement and said don't message her.

One, it's out of the norm, the last time I messaged her was months ago. Two, I don't want her to think I'm trying to ask her out again, she's got a boyfriend and I'm not even interested in doing so. Three, I don't really know the best way to start it out if I did message her.

So I'm really just looking for a couple pieces of advice. Put yourself in her shoes - how would you feel if I messaged you asking what's up? What would be a good way to start out messaging her? Am I overthinking what a probably small interaction is?",25May2018,0

159,"I am going to try to explain my situation without giving any identifying details (I don't want to get in trouble), but my first question is going to be: is there somewhere else I can ask this where I am more likely to get specific expert knowledge? Please let me know if you think there is somewhere else I can ask specifically about this sort of stuff in my industry.

Okay, so, this is my first job straight out of uni. I work for a big 4 accounting firm. They are doing a project for a big corporation. I don't work at the big 4's regional head office or anything. I'm a contractor on this sort of non-awards contract. I don't actually work for the big 4 firm but rather I work for an employment agency that the big 4 firm hired for most of its staff for this project with the corporation that hired the big 4 firm.

I've been working for 10 months. The first contract was only for 6 months but they kept extending it as the project hasn't finished yet. Full time hours, on ~$23/hr. Non-awards means no sick leave, annual leave, and no pay on public holidays. Basically, no benefits. It's basically been hell. I've been working my ass off and it's basically for nothing. When I used to work casually before uni I used to get paid more.

I try to keep myself future oriented and tell myself that it's about the jobs I will be able to get in the future with this experience, but it's been tough. On one hand, I want to ask for more money with the justification being that management has explicitly said that I'm more experienced and able to handle a higher workload. 

On the other hand, I am afraid of screwing up what I've already got. Frankly, I've been looking for work elsewhere and that just seems safer. A future with a big 4 seems attractive, but the shit way they treat me at the base level really crushes my morale. They have a lot of meaningless feel good nonsense they try to use to motivate us (which is really just such insulting and cheap bullshit), but my motivation comes from inside because I am a hard worker. Didn't they study Maslow's hierarchy of needs? I am not going to be motivated by esteem or whatever while I am still living paycheck to paycheck. I am not wasteful. I am very frugal. I managed to save a few thousand dollars despite almost two thirds of my income going straight into bills (rent, internet, gas, electricity, water, &amp; phone). But recent medical expenses brought those savings down to almost zero.

Anyway, I don't know. I just feel so fucked.",25May2018,1
161,"There’s this cute guy who had been my chatmate for quite a long time now. It’s been like two years. We first met during a new years party dating service we joined many years ago. He is sweet.

The only problem with him is consistency which I believe matters the most. His inconsistency made me so confused. We have been chatting on and off for almost three years. Yes, you read it right--- on and off. It’s like, you will be bombarded with his sweet chats today and then he is nowhere to be found the next day.

162,"Before you say “don’t act like an asshole” I’ll stop you right there. It’s who I am. But just read till the end. Psychoanalyse it to your heart’s content but I love saying offensive stuff - sexist, racist, homophobic, whatever - I love saying it. I get a kick out of it.

I’m absolutely brutal to my closest friends. I greet them with “hey slut” or “what’s up dickhead?”. It’s just the way I am. And all of my close friends know that I don’t mean it. In fact, I’ve had three people, each from different friendship group who don’t know each other say to me: “if we actually thought you were being serious, we would never talk to you”.

People who know me see through all the shit I say and know I mean well. However, I understand I’m a volatile personality to be around and sometimes I can be a bit much. I’ve spent a year with some new people since starting college and I have a rep.

In my football team, I have a rep (whether as a joke or not I don’t know) for being offensive and my flat mates have now, put indelicately, got tired of my shit. To be honest, I would be if I got abuse 24/7 for a 6 months. They’ve got cabin fever.

It’s exam season, everyone’s stressed and tired so I’m not reading too much into it when people call me an asshole. However it did get me thinking. What if they still think that after exams are over and everyone’s chilled?

I heard a quote saying “if you can’t literally rip the shit out of your best mates and still find it funny, you need new mates”. So here’s my question (finally):

Do I - as a self proclaimed pretend asshole - just try to be nicer (although I’ve tried before and I was miserable)? 

Or do I simply ditch the friends who get too pissy and offended by my personality?

So for a bit of back story

We've had A LOT of ups and downs in my short 19 years of life, i have not been a perfect or even great daughter, went through a period time where i didn't care abt my parents or how i hurt them and was constantly lying and going behind their back. However for the last like 6 months or so I've made a change for the better, i've been building their trust and fixing how i talk to them (my mom especially) and I'd like to say i've come a long way. 

My mom isn't trying at all though, she doesn't hesitate to say things that hurt me and this has been an issue for most of my life. She takes things from my past and throws them in my face when we argue, or takes mistakes Ive made and brings them up even when it's not relevant to our conversation just because ""she can"". 
I've tried to point this out to her on countless occasions and she'll apologize and be remorseful but does it all over again when we fight or something and half of the time she doesn't even realize that what she says hurts me, she just doesn't think before she speaks. 

I'm not perfect but i really have tried and change a lot about the way i treat my mom but she seems to not be making any efforts and I don't know what to do about

172,"So, I am a 14\-year\-old boy who is right now more than ever trying to figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life, and I know it might sound overly dramatic for my age but the earlier is better and this thought of the future isn't generally affecting my social, family life etc. it's just generally in my head. I'm just going to give some overall context of how my life has been so far in a nutshell. 

So, a few years back near 2010\-2012 my dad showed me the movies Iron Man and Back to the future \(not back to back they were just the movies that affected me the most\), and at the time those two movies really intrigued me. I know I was very very young at this time but I started researching and like ""designing"" my own Iron Man suits and Time Machines that I would make when I got older \(now at this point you might be thinking I was scribbling on some scrap papers trashy pictures of DeLoreans and red metal men, but no that’s is far from the truth \(as I had impressive artistic skills for someone my age I also had a stage where I wanted to become an artist\), I looked at how the thrusters would work to make the suit fly, how fast it would go and how a time machine would hypothetically function etc. but enough rambling about that\), part of this was my inner child thinking how cool it would be to travel through time and fly around travelling the world going sightseeing also also shooting bad guys, but also my overly smart brainy side wanting to later design my own technologies and become a famous inventor like Doc Brown and/or Tony Stark. Then a few years later this sort of faded away as I started to hang out with people at school that I felt my previous ideas and desires would be considered ‘nerdy’ to them so I also began to get influenced and think it was ‘nerdy’, and the side of me that was drawing Iron Man suits and studying simple physics concepts in 2010\-2012 was gone. I blamed this on my parents from what I thought was a lack of support from my them, but I had no one other than myself to blame and my choices. 

But then a new phase began, I started working on creating computer games as a project for school and I got really into it, so then I had a dream to create my own indie game that would one day be popular and purchased by many people, so I got started. I first drew animations of characters and objects I wanted for my game, then I began to learn to code \(GML\) and I started a major game project in early 2017 and I was really into it at the start and had made a great beginner game but as I started to go into more of the complicated coding concepts which was very difficult to get my head around it started to slow down my progress, but things got worse when my laptop screen broke so I was taped to a desktop screen on a desk every time I wanted to code made it much harder to enjoy making my game as much as I did. Although I continued my project I was working on it much much less. So then late 2017 I started to watch a lot of movies and then an idea popped up in my head to record a movie at my house and edit it with some really cool effects like the movies I was watching on the tv. So, then I got started AGAIN, I got the DSLR my dad gave me a few years back and started to film a movie where I'd edit in me disappearing and appearing around the house and having a clone of myself and some really cool but beginner after effects etc. After a couple of months, I completed that movie and was really proud of it, then I planned another movie where I scripted it out and all but never started to make it. 

So Then 2018 hit me harder than ever, instead of the more optimistic thoughts about the future I has having back in 2012 I was having existential thoughts like what's the point of doing a basic job like engineering 7 hours a day then coming home eating and then sleeping in this endless cycle where I didn't enjoy what I was doing in life \(the idea of becoming an engineer was just common influence by older people around me convincing me that because of my intelligence I can make it into a high end job if I put the effort\). So, then I came to remember how much fun I had with imagining being like Tony Stark and flying around in an Iron Man suit and how if in my lifetime I achieved this I wouldn't ask for more because of how highly I put this goal. So I dug a little deeper and without over complicating it I sadly found out that creating a suit like Iron Man's or anything similar would be impossible as the energy required to power a suit like that to be created in such a small confined space would create enough heat for a devastating explosion, this pretty much ruined that childhood dream for me \(time machines were ruined a little earlier but they were way too complex of a hypothetical machine to be created and function anyways. 

So, following this I realised well if I can't be Iron Man well... Robert Downey Jr \(The actor who plays Iron Man\) isn't actually flying around in an advanced metal suit but he is acting... ACTING. The idea then came to my head that I could become an actor and serve my other great passions like making people laugh and making use of my strengths like confidence and good vocal projection, this would allow me to travel the world doing acting and maybe even be in a superhero movie one day. And what brightened things up even more was the fact that starting young is better. But then I delved deeper into the world of acting and realised the chance of fully making is very very slim and requires some requirements that I simply do not have. 

So then I was back to the start of 2018 thinking well if I can't make my dream of making a suit like Iron Man true, and can't become an actor then what's the point of working a job like an engineer, scientists, basic jobs which I have no interest in the repetitive nature of, even though I would like to say I am pretty smart so I can study hard and become any of those jobs I know I won’t be happy. I've always wanted to be something different than everyone else but every time I get onto something I get thrown back to square 1. So, what I really want to know is, are the feelings I am experiencing common among people? And I want someone to lead me in the right direction because I feel the existential thoughts I have been having will not lead onto good places down the road, sometimes I get that moody and down I can’t even pick up my phone to reply to a friend’s text or to simply do something like watch YouTube videos, what is going on and what can I do to fix what’s going on in my head feeling things start to feel pointless...?",25May2018,25
175,"* **He put me on a speakerphone when I called in sick to humiliate me.** I had an asthma attack a few weeks back and had to call the emergency services. They referred me to a hospital appointment once my breathing went back to normal. I had hardly any sleep that night so slept right through until my alarm went off half an hour before my appointment. As I was in a rush and not thinking straight, I forgot to call in sick. When I get to the hospital I had 3 missed calls so I called him back and apologised saying I was ill. He asked what was wrong and why I wasn’t at work. I said I was at the hospital as I had an asthma attack and was waiting to see a doctor. He didn’t say “I hope you’re OK” or anything, just a skeptical “How ill are you? Is it serious?” When I went in the next day, a coworker of mine asked how I was and I said “Oh, how did you know that I went to hospital?” She said it was because Alan had put my phonecall on speakerphone in the office where about 5 people are at any given time and where members of the public could’ve heard private information. I could’ve had a really embarrassing illness or a family death and he put me on speakerphone without knowing the issue.

* **He called me on my day off to let me know I had made a mistake even though it wasn’t my fault.** I sold a product that the warehouse said was in stock and not reserved (only they can see if its reserved). It turns out the product was reserved and the next day when I was off the customer who reserved it came to collect the product that I had sold. They were angry as they had paid $1k for a product and it was not there. Alan sent one of my coworkers to a store that was 1.5 hours away and had it in stock to get the product for the customer. He then called me up an angrily said, “You know that product you sold the other day. IT WAS RESERVED FOR A CUSTOMER. Why did you sell it?” I said, “I’m really sorry but the warehouse said it was fine to sale so I did.” He didn’t believe me and said, “Oh really, then who told you to sell it?” I didn’t know as I was only speaking to them on the headset and didn’t really pay attention to who it was at the time. I apologised and said “I’ll see you tomorrow.” He just groaned and put the phone down.

* **He berated me in my review for chatting with coworkers when it was quiet even though he does nothing himself and my coworkers talk to each other with impunity.** A coworker who had been on paternity leave returned the other day and came other to say “hi” when it was quiet. I was literally chatting with him for 2 minutes before Alan sent over the “Team Leader” to tell me to “Stop fucking talking to other people. You’re here to work.” Meanwhile, a group of coworkers who are friendly with Alan and the Team Leader were all chatting and joking about as they had me on my knees dusting shelves.

* **He expects me alone to do the tidying and allows his friends to just stand around.** Towards the end of our shifts we have to clean the store and tidy the shelves. I like doing this as I love organizing things. So I do it quite quickly and thoroughly. I had tidied about 10 aisles alone whilst the other stood around chatting and as soon as I stop for a break and chat to somebody he comes over and says “Ron, stop chatting and start tidying.” I said that “I already have!” but he ignores it, looks at me and puts his arms up as if I shouldn’t question him. 

* **He sends me on lunch early all the time.** He will send me on lunch at 11 a.m. on a 9.5 hour shift that finishes at 6:15 p.m. He does this all the time. Once he sent me on lunch at 11 when I started at half 10. I got pissed as this was the fifth time he had done this and said that “I’m pretty sure it’s illegal to send me right at the start of my shift.” He got really pissed off at me and I walked into the staff room and heard him call me a “little cunt” to the assistant manager. He then took me to one side and said what I said to him was “out of order” and he “never wants to hear it again.”

* **He ignores me when I talk to him unless it’s about a sale.** He will either completely blank me or just show complete disinterest and walk away. For example, the other night when we were closing the store, he was walking past where I was and gave me eye contact. I was tidying found a pair of busted headphones. As he gave me eye contact, I showed them to him and said that “it looks like someone has tried to steal these!” He looked straight through me and responded to someone over the headsets we have to wear. Another example is when I was leaving the toilets and he was entering. I hadn’t started my shift yet so hadn’t seen him so I said, “Oh, hi Alan!” and he completely ignored me.

* **He just talks to me with such contempt.** I can sense people’s feelings quite well and he loathes me. The way he looks at me, talks to me and treats me.

The Team Leader Bob is just as bad. He:

* **Took me out back to complain that I didn’t sell insurance to a couple who own a property management business after they had told me they had specialist house insurance that covered electronics.** I had given them great services, hit a few add-on targets, set them up a business account with the company and made a $4k sale. But because I didn’t sell the insurance they didn’t need, I was threatened with a disciplinary and wasn’t even congratulated for good service and a big sale.",25May2018,1

180,"He's really sweet. More mature than most other guys his age. All about feminism and what not. All my friends love him and think I'm very lucky. But sometimes when I pull away while kissing or making out, his hand will move up from behind my neck to behind my head, pull and hold my head down on his. Sometimes he won't stop until I've said it thrice or very angrily. But I wonder if these are just ""in that moment of passion"" things and I'm overreacting. He seems to get really upset when he doesn't get what he wants when he wants it and I end up feeling guilt tripped. But maybe he's just a little spoilt by his parents. He apologizes and promises to be more careful when I bring these things up, and sticks to the promise for a while before forgetting about it.

    I’ve been told a lot of people make friends or meet guys at work. I work with all wonderful women, close to my age, the problem is that they are all married and either have kids or are expecting kids so no one has time, or they hang out with other couples. I have tried to initiate doing things but nobody takes me up on it. The really tough part is they are always talking to each other about how they met their spouse, how sweet they are, little surprises they do, etc. I can’t join in and it makes me extremely lonely. 
    I’ve joined a gym which is good to be around people but it’s hard to make one on one connections. I’ve tried volunteering but ended up with a bunch of old people. There aren’t many classes or groups, like I said small town. 
   Online dating. I have nothing but horror stories but I keep trying. The last 5 dated I was supposed to have I got ghosted. I’m cute but not gorgeous. A lot of guys just look at the outside before they decide if they really want to get to know you. And it keeps being a no for me.

186,"I am 18 years old, I live with my father mother and brother and have been for the last 18 years in the summer and attend college in the fall and winter. My mother was born and raised Malta and my father was born and raised in Detroit. They got married approximately 25 years ago. My father runs a business in the heart of Detroit while my mother works a part time job at a library 2 days a week for 4 hours. 

My mother does not like talking to people, associating with people, having anything in the house, and only goal in life is to clean. My father on the other hand enjoys talking to people and living life. When my father gets home everyday it’s like playing a game of Russian roulette. She will either be super happy or extremely upset and depressed. She swings moods very quickly and goes from very happy to yelling at my father for random reasons saying how her life was ruined ever since she married him or kicking him out for no reason. As time progressed it seems to be getting worse She would rather put clothes on a bed for them to be organized and sleep on the floor next to them every night. She removes the toilet seats and other things around the house so it will be less for her to clean. We are not allowed to go into the kitchen and are only allowed in the garage and basement. We have offered to help take care of the house but she says we do not do it right and ignores us. 

I don’t know what I should do anymore my father is at the point of giving up, he has worked everyday Monday - Saturday 12 hour days for the last 35 years of his life and am worried about my 15 year old brother who comes home to a mother who doesn’t seem stable.

187,"I’ve been part of a raiding guild ever since its starting days. Back then everything was fresh and all of us were just trying to figure this stuff out. Mistakes were made by everyone, we were all improving, and felling each boss together was a great experience. As time passed by we got to know each other better, people kept improving at the game, and the community as a whole grew.

The problem is that I’ve mostly plateaued a while back whereas other people were getting better and better, to the point where we’ve done pretty much everything the game’s raiding experience offers. Now, I’d like to think that most of the time I’m good enough to not be an outright burden or hindrance to others, but I keep making stupid mistakes which are sometimes serious enough to slow everyone else down considerably. As we’ve been doing some of this content literally for years, I doubt that things will improve on my part. The fact that I’m somewhat visually impaired doesn’t help much either. I don’t play that card often, and it is only part of the overall problem anyway.

Here’s where things get uncomfortable. As we’ve done everything a million times already, the leadership is pushing people to perform better, clear the content faster etc. Sure, people still dick around, but every time anyone makes mistakes they’re scrutinized and analyzed. There’s really nothing left to prove at this point, but certain people insist that everyone, even the people who don’t muck stuff up, should be performing better. It’s always “This and this was good, but you can do more damage / be quicker about this” etc. Everyone gets this feedback whether they want to or not, except the person who is giving it and who is objectively the best player in the group. As I’m one of the worst-performing people in the group, and objectively the worst one if you take into account that I’ve been at this for quite a while, the brunt of the remarks falls on me.

I need to emphasize at this point that the atmosphere is never toxic or demeaning. No one gets insulted or wrongfully criticized, although there are people who are quick to (legitimately) point out others’ mistakes while downplaying their own. Most people actually don’t give a crap as long as thing gets done, and they do get done since I’m not an objectively horrible player, just an unreliable one in a group of skilled people. 

Nevertheless, I’ve begun dreading the experience. A couple of years ago raiding was a time to unwind, laugh at people’s jokes and take the failures in stride. Even though I’m sure that this is no one’s intent, now I almost always approach these evenings with a sinking feeling in my stomach and an inner voice saying “What will you fuck up this time? What more or less insignificant thing will you have to answer for again?”

So why didn’t I just leave already? On one hand, these people are as close to a group of friends I’ve had in a while. When the atmosphere is relaxed I really do enjoy the camaraderie and being part of the community. On the other, what does it say about me if I back out just because I don’t have a thick skin? 

So what do I do – throw away a couple of good friendships for the greater good of the guild and my own mental health, or go on and try to make the best of things? Any and all advice is appreciate.

190,"Here is my situation:  I left my country and moved to a different one because where I live is not an ideal country in terms stress, wages, financial and political stability and for your future unless you are born rich. Also I have really bad experiences in this particular country in terms of people. I have severe anxiety disorder for 3 years. 

So me and my partner have decided to leave and apperantly my partner got a job from one of our possible locations where we would like to go. I left my job thinking I could get a job in this country which my partner has found a job(although we have different expreiences we are in the same line of business) did my homework got my necessary certificates etc. And we left with hopes and smiles.

A year later it turns out that unless you hve to have a NES passport it is nearly impossible to find a job in this butthole. And believe me I’ve tired so hard; dressed sharp went to interviews, smile while they talked shit back to me, acted like I’m one in a million, went out, walked around  and left my CV. Fucked over by pople. Nothing. Just nothing.

Rght now I’m in this country jobless and with loads of stress.  We are trying to get by with one salary.  We both in our 30s so we are not in a “backpacker” mentality which you basically live like crap for the sake of travelling. 

Finally we got a job in our country which we left before. It’s paying triple the amount of money plus the benefits. So in few months I’m going back to the place where I hate the most for the sake of money. 

My partner naturally gets affected by my mood and that makes me even sadder. My anxiety’s back again and right now I’m sitting in a bar drunk while everyone else making plans and having fun with their futures.

Sorry about my text it’s just a mess without a structure. have you had anything like that before? What to do? I’m a grown ass man but I really just one go to a dark place, cry and destroy something. It wouldn’t be a problem if I was single or a fresh university graduate or something like that. I’m in my 30s man which my friends are getting married and become successful, earn shitloads money.

191,"Gonna try and keep this short and sweet.
I’m a rising junior in college so this would be my second summer home before embarking off again for classes in the fall. Thinking back to last year, the first week back home from finals week is great. No more tests, no more getting up early (atleast on days where I’m not working) and no more academics in general for awhile. I can relax and kinda do whatever I want. But I get bored. And I am bored already yet I have many more weeks to go before coming back to school. What do you guys suggest I do to productively occupy my free time here at home in an enjoyable manner?

Like I previously mentioned, I do work and have already started but the bulk of my hours don’t arrive until atleast a week or two from now. I’m working to buy a car this summer so with that, I can’t drive myself anywhere. I’ve grown away from my high school friends and I live in a secluded town that doesn’t really have a town infrastructure. Just trees and roads, nothing much to do in walking distance.

So for the past five days my time has consisted around playing with my dog outside daily, eating, showering, playing videogames, playing fantasy baseball and watching the Mets game to conclude every night.

194,"So, my fiance and I come from different cultures. In my culture \(and I thought most\) it is customary for the bride's side to throw the shower. The shower is meant to be about the bride getting together with friends and family close to her, or so has been the case with every shower I've been to. 

My FMIL insisted on throwing a shower right from the start. The shower would consist of all my FMIL's friends and of course I could invite people \(but I don't have anyone to really invite\). I reluctantly agreed at first because I was put on the spot \(not something I wanted ever\) but then told her I don't think it's a good idea. I also told her my mother is hurt because my sister is my maid of honor \(but she's like 13 years younger than me\) so my mom thought it would be our family's thing to do. My MIL backed off for a bit. 

Then a month later, I get a text from my FMIL telling me to send her dates I want for the shower because her friends want to throw me one. Now, I don't know her friends, but my FMIL said that her ""crew"" throws showers for each other's children. Without going into too much detail, I reluctantly said ok again because if I don't my FMIL will throw a party after our wedding for her friends to attend. So I'd rather just get it out of the way now. I did tell her I wasn't sure if my mom would feel comfortable going and that there wouldn't be anyone on my side going \(my friends are all out of town and if my mom isn't comfortable going neither will my extended family\). 

My FMIL told us where she was thinking of doing the shower and it's a place with a lot of meat, barely any vegetarian options. My fiance and I are both vegetarian \(he will be attending\). He told his mother not to have it at that place and she should look into a place that is more vegetarian friendly. She didn't. She ended up still booking it at the place she was asked not to without asking. 

Summary: 

Reasons why my mom doesn't want to go, which I also think is justified: 

1\) Culturally the bride's side throws the shower and she feels like my FMIL is stepping out of her boundaries. Also, FMIL doesn't have the common courtesy of including my mother in any of the planning at all. 

2\) Religiously my mother does not drink alcohol and doesn't feel comfortable around it. All my FMIL's friends are drinkers so there will definitely be alcohol. I personally don't feel comfortable around it either and am not a drinker. My fiance is actually a recovering alcoholic but my FMIL still drinks in front of him.

3\) My mom can't eat meat unless it is prepared in a special religious way. Yes, my FMIL knows this. So not many options for her to eat either. 

4\) My mother doesn't do well in social settings, especially around people she doesn't know. 

If my mom doesn't decide to go to the shower I don't know what to say. I was going to say the truth. I don't want my FMIL's friends to think my mother isn't attending because she doesn't like my FMIL because that is not the case. 

My FMIL is excluded from a lot of events from her husband's side of the family because they don't like socializing around her. At first I thought it was because they were biggots since my FMIL is Jewish. But now I get it. I think it just may be her that they have a problem with because she is very very pushy and won't stop till she gets her way somehow. My fiance doesn't want the shower and gets why my mom wouldn't want to go, but I'm curious if others, like my FMIL's friends would. ",25May2018,8
195,For all my life there was nothing like coming home from school and just kicking back and being by myself. Ever since I turn 16 I started noticing this issue. I come home from a long day of school or work and I know I want to relax but when I do it feels wrong being in the house and just chilling.

197,"My constant frustration with art has reached such heights that now I'm starting to think that I'm really depressed. Let me put down the whole story, and hopefully some you guys will be able to ease my state. 

Never in my entire life I thought I would one day say: ""I wish I could turn back the time and return to the middle school,"" because I really detest that period. But it's where it all started. I wanted to be a filmmaker at that time, but I discovered some indie cartoons on YT, and I was like: ""you can do this on your own, without the whole staff from a movie set? Wow, I want to do this."" So I started drawing. I was terrible at it, total 0. And I was 15 at that time. 

After research on how to get into the industry, I realized I had to be a good at life drawing to have a chance of making it. So, when I was 18, I joined a private class of life drawing and painting. It was there where I really began to learn art, to discover art beyond just stupid cartoons. And I fell into the spiral of doing more and more realistic stuff, and less cartoony stuff. I quit the class after over a year to fully focus on upcoming high school finals. But as I had no portfolio, I had 0 chances at going to an art school, so I convinced my parents that I could self\-teach myself, as portfolio is all that matters, not a degree \(100&amp;#37; true btw\). And I will be forever grateful that they let me do this. So I moved to a city to live with my brother. And I've been living here for almost 2 years now.

Over this time I've made great improvement, and I took some online courses where I discovered that I'm ahead of my peers. But despite kind words from instructors and other people, everything has begun to collapse... I have never been really passionate about what I do. I rarely work more than 4 hours a day \(laughable, I know\), and I worked only twice for more than 12 hours during a day. I always have to force myself with schedules, etc. I maybe didn't realize that before, but now it's starting to hit me, that lack of passion. When I screw a drawing or a painting, I feel very depressed and literally hate art. I know mistakes are the only way to improve, I started from complete 0 after all. But now when sth doesn't go the way I want, it really messes up my psyche. It makes me really miserable. I was never like that before.

Maybe I am good for a student, but still far behind any pro. I have never made any bucks from art. Funnily enough, I made some money from designing some stuff, and I've never learned design. 

I mentioned middle school earlier, because I often think about it now. Now I wouldn't have chosen art. I would've gone with music, filmmaking, writing, YouTube, or sports \(running\). But for sure not art. I never envied other people, but now I do. I envy music producers, for example, who sit in their studios for 14 hours straight, because that's how passionate they are. I envy YouTubers who have managed to make good living off it. The list can go on and on. I am aware that a lot of people may envy my art skills, but it doesn't make me happy.

I don't want to disappoint my parents, but I don't want to be unhappy anymore as well. I invested A LOT of money into learning art, and this fact doesn't make it easier to quit, too.

I feel even worse, because I begin to imagine myself in some shitty jobs. I fear such life. I don't want such life. But it's too late to switch disciplines, and art makes me miserable...

199,"So I’ve been seeing this girl for about two months now, for the past 3 days she’s had a friend stay with her. She text me last night and said
 “if there were no sexual nor flirtatious favours involved what would you say to me having a sugar daddie” 

Apparently her friend has a few sugar daddies that put money into her account every month and buy weed for her etc.. 
I was obviously flabbergasted and asked her if she was being serious or not, I told her “yes I fucking would mind” and she then stated that she feels bad taking money off people she cares about aka me, and would feel much more comfortable scamming some bloke online. We’re both young me (19) and she’s (18) and she’s wants to go to a lot of festivals in the coming months but simply can’t afford it. I myself have quite a good job and make okay money for my age so I’ve always told her money isn’t an issue with me, and that if she needs to borrow that I’m here for her but she refuses to take it, fair enough! 

SO I obviously got very defensive and told her if she’s wants to go find men that will look at her in that sort of way, and PAY her money because of it she can because I’m gone. 
She apologised and said that it wasn’t a serious question and just  wanted my opinion on it, I ignored her messages for a couple of hours and she then got back to me again and said the way I handled the situation was bang out of order??????
I’m the jealous type and that fact that she would even ask me that made my blood boil.. 

PLEASE tell me I’m not off my head.  ",25May2018,1
200,"Hey friends! 

I'll be pursuing a Master's degree starting this fall! I'm very excited about it. Right now, I work full-time in a job that's technically 8-5 M-F, with a decent amount of flexibility. I can be at work as late as 8:30 without being tardy (as long as I work the same amount of time after 5), I can skip lunch and leave early, or leave early one day and make up for it in the next day or so. I like what I do (payment processing for an e-commerce firm) and plan to continue at my job until I finish my degree. I'll attend school part-time and keep working full-time. 

I've told most people in my life about my plans to go to school, but I have not yet told my boss. She lives in another country, and we are not connected on social media. 

I was advised to not tell her until I had finished a semester of school, to send a message that I was serious about this degree and not letting it affect my work. However, I'm almost 100% certain that this will affect my schedule - I'm pretty regularly at work at 8am and leaving at 5, but I'm sure she'll notice if I suddenly am modifying that on the same days every week. 

I'm about to register for classes within the next few weeks. Should I let my boss in on the open secret? Or should I prove that it won't affect my performance first, and then tell her? ",25May2018,1
201,"I'm in need of assistance peeps, for I know not how to feel or what to do. Long story short, and it's still a bit long, I knew this girl since 6th grade. I instantly loved her, but we keptbit friendly and I never said a word. Fast forward to senior year, dated people between then but now it was just her and I. We went to each others dances, hung out all the time, I mean there was something there, but we never discussed it. Then I left for the navy, and she went to college, occassionaly keeping in touch. I would come home and we'd pick up where we left off. Fast forward about 3 more years to where I'm close to getting out, and coming home. I was on leave already and she called me up to come with her to a grieving friend whose boyfriend had just died. Said friend hasn't talked to either of us in two or more years, didn't even know I was living in Japan. Needless to say, it was a little rough so we went to get a drink with another couple who came with us that night. I took her home and that's when it happened. We FINALLY kissed and I was so ecstatic and happy. I told my mom about it, who is literally my best friend and favorite person. The next night, she and I meet again to talk about it, and I couldn't hold it in any longer and spilled the beans, I told her I loved her and I didn't expect her to say it back, but I wanted to be upfront and I just couldn't help it. Too much at once, yes I agree it was, but when I loved someone for that long, I just had to get it off my chest. Anyways, next day she gives me a letter saying how she just couldn't really see herself with me, and I understood. I mean it hurt, but I'm used to having women turn me down. But here's where it gets shitty. I go back to Japan, and my mom gets really sick. By July that year I'm on deployment by the Philippines and she's got lung and colon cancer so bad she's bed ridden. I go home and two weeks later she passes right there by me. I didn't know what to do, and two days later I had to go to Washington to process out for two weeks. I got a text from girl saying she was sorry and hope she pulls through when she heard my mom was in hospice, but that was all. Two weeks go by and she simply says I'm sorry for your loss. When I got out, three months passed before she said anything, and we met up and I got no closure from it. I was so angry and upset, how could you not be there the one time I needed you as a friend for the countless times I needed you? Even she was there for exes, and we took dinner to the girl who hasn't talked to us in two years and lost her boyfriend, and all I got was a text. She's comes into town regularly, and I want her so badly to text me to meet up just so I can ask and confront her about it, and to tell her how hurt I am and angry with her I've been for almost two years now. I think about it on a dail y basis and have forgiven her countless times to myself but I'm still so distraught about it all. I just want some closure but is that really the best thing?

205,"I started a new job this week in NYC at an amazing company. The salary is good, there's a lot of paid time off, co-workers are nice and the company treats employees well, with morale being very high. The office is in midtown Manhattan, there are good opportunities for advancement and career growth, a lot of young people work there, etc. 

I graduated from college last year and have worked a few decent jobs in different fields (not in NYC) and I'm still young (22 years old.) 

The problem I'm enduring is that my new job includes A TON of social interaction and walking around and meetings, etc. 

My problem is I suffer from severe social anxiety disorder that I've swept under the rug my whole life because until now, it never effected me in a way where it felt like it hurt my future/work performance. (In college/other jobs, I was able to make a few friends and get by ok without my anxiety becoming something that would effect performance.)

In moments where I don't feel anxious, I've always been charismatic and been told I have great people skills. But as I've gotten older, those moments have been more and more rare. It started when I was younger I would only get anxious in certain moments and it's slowly taken over my life to the point where I feel anxious all the time, even around family.

In the week that I've been working at this new company, my anxiety has already clearly effected my performance and ability to adapt to the job, and people are noticing that I'm nervous/anxious already. 

I feel like this opportunity has really brought me to a place where I finally realize I'm going to need to get help if I'm going to be ok in life long term. I need to address my issues through therapy or other means in order to be able to succeed in any career and also in life in general.

But I'm worried I may never get an opportunity like this again. My major in college was communication (very hard to find work) and I don't want to leave an incredible opportunity like this but I really feel like things will only get worse for me mentally as I stay and I won't be successful at work anyway because of it. With my commute to work included, I'm pretty much not home from 7 AM to 7 PM every day so not much time to address issues outside of work during weekdays.

There's also the pressure of when my family and friends ask me why I would quit something like this. I'm not comfortable talking to people about my anxiety, I've never told anyone in my life. Most people just assume I'm ""awkward"" when nervous because they don't really even know what social anxiety is or don't make the connection. 

Would I be stupid to leave this job behind and regret it? Or am I just repeating the same mistake I've been making for years by staying and not addressing my problem? Should I try to stay at the job somehow and address my problems? 

It's a tough decision, and even though I'm still only 22, I see plenty of people older than me with better resumes and skill sets struggling to get a decent job or wasting away for a low salary at a company they hate. I would hate to be like that in 5-6 years and be looking back on this job that I left.",25May2018,1
207,"Apologies in advance, as I'm going to vent a little bit too. 

A few months ago I was still working for a hospital 'chain' in my area. At the time we just got a new colleague, I'll call her E for now. She stood out to me from the beginning, but nothing more than that, as I was in a relationship at the time still. About a week later though, that relationship ended. 

A little over a week after said break-up, E and I were tasked to lead a team of hospital employees who were there to help us out. (For context, we were hired to test all computers across three hospitals to ensure the new patient filing system worked correctly). Overall I had a really good time with the team, and E and I worked together really well. I was starting to like her, a lot.

Over the course of the next few weeks we worked together a few more times. We grew closer and always had a good time.
One of these times, E, two co-workers and I went to one of the other hospitals to finish things up there. During the conversation, my break-up came up. The two co-workers responded with the usual 'sorry to hear that' which was nice. E responded differently though, she seemed relieved almost, yet a little distraught at the same time. That's besides the point though, as she sent me a LinkedIn invite, after which I checked her profile. It turns out we went to the same high school, except she did 7 years before me. This means she's probably ~26, and I'm 19. 

I let it go, partially because of this. I thought I was just an emotional mess and that my feelings for her weren't real. The project (and therefore our contracts) ended, so I haven't seen her since the ending of march, nearly two months ago. I'm now mostly over my ex and doing fine, so when it all came back to me recently (I don't know why to be honest), I found out I was still feeling the same about her. Since I haven't seen her in two months this really confused me. I thought the feelings would fade.

First off, I just don't know how I feel about the age difference. On the one hand I think it's just a number, on the other though, our lives are vastly different. I still have to go to college while she already graduated years ago, for example. I'm scared I look like a literal child to her, similar to how I view 14 year olds for example.
Secondly, should I go through with it: The team agreed to meet eachother again sometime, so I can always arrange for that and hope she comes too so I can get a better feel for all of this. Alternatively, I was thinking about just telling her how I feel or asking if she wants to meet sometime, but I'm not sure she feels the same way. I don't even know if she's single... 

Any advice would be very welcome.

TL;DR: Found out my feelings for a former co-worker are real, don't know how to feel about the age difference or what to do if I decide to try to pursue her anyway.",25May2018,1

211,"I'm a 16 year old girl and I've grown up with Christian parents. My dad has become agnostic in the last year or so, but my mom is still pretty strongly tied to her beliefs, which are often quite evangelical/conservative. I came out to her as bi and agnostic a long time ago, and she is slowly becoming more progressive, but on the subject of dating and sex she is as conservative as ever. The only person she ever dated was my dad so she is uniquely perfectly ""pure"" sexually and seems to think everyone should be like her. She is paranoid as hell, and is even uncomfortable with me cuddling my friends who I'm not interested in romantically at all. This is a really bad influence on me because I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and her judgment haunts and gives me a lot of stress.

I was in a long term relationship at 14 for a whole year and mom was so apprehensive about it I felt like I couldn't have much fun and I spent a lot less time with my partner than I wanted to because I was scared of mom. My partner and I experimented sexually (yeah, I know I was probably too young) but I had so much anxiety because of my sexual shame I couldn't truly enjoy it or really live in the moment during those experiences. During my relationship mom had a discussion with me where she said I couldn't have sex while I was in her household and I did a crazy thing and pushed back. I told her I was probably going to have sex before I'm 18 and she should just have to deal with it. She didn't agree but I didn't get in trouble.

Currently, I am in the process of beginning a relationship with an absolutely wonderful boy, and I don't want to hide it from my parents but I also don't want to have to fight with mom about closed doors and going over to his place and deal with mom's trademark Look of Judgment every other day. I just want to openly talk to her about relationships and sex without her shaming me or grounding me or barring me from him completely, but I don't know how to open it up.  I don't even know if I want to have sex with him, honestly all I want is to be able to spend time with him without thinking about how mom is going to interpret everything. ",25May2018,1

She is very strong willed and I had hoped she would not do it again....but sadly she has once more...and even worse the second time. She has been battling suicidal thoughts for awhile now and they are slowly starting to get to her. A few nights ago, she claims I saved her life because I managed to talk to her for 6 hours and helped prevent her from picking up her knife. I'm scared.

It would drive her closer to the edge to try and force her to go to something like that. What are some alternatives?

I worry that I will just continue brooding about every bullshit I experienced in the past and won't enjoy it as much as I would like.

217,"I'm 23 and I want to get myself together. I dropped out of high school in 9th grade because I'd gone to so many different schools and lost all self esteem to the point where I wasn't prepared for my classes and distracted myself too much with videogames and goofing off trying to impress my peers and be their clown. I don't know when the laziness started but most of it is out of fear. I used to be a really fat kid and when I dropped out I laid around my parents house and ate myself to 418 lbs and was depressed thinking I had wasted my life. My father was distant and abrasive but a hard worker and good provider, and my mother coddled me(they were both in their late 40's when I was born and fought, a lot and often put me between them, neither really cared how I did in school, my dad would just scream at me or my mom and its clear that they never wanted to be together, he told me he didnt want to raise a son)...I tried to leave home at 18 but they told me not to and I stupidly wanted to stay in my comfort zone. The only positive thing I've done with my life is drop back down to 262 lbs(still losing), the lightest I've ever been but I struggle in a battle with bulimia because I honestly think I'd rather just kill myself before I get as fat as I used to be. My mom made me afraid of literally everything though I suspect it's because of her own mental illness as she's a very paranoid and nonsensical person. I never did sports because my mom thought it was too dangerous and convinced me I'd get a head injury or die of heat stroke, when I liked my first girl she made me stop talking to her because she was 'from a bad family' and I was a good boy. She tells me I'm losing too much weight even though I'm still fat and even now as I'm trying to leave she tries making me feel guilty and says I'm betraying her. She's 60 now and shrieks and carries on like an infant so it's kind of a mind fuck to listen to her maddening ranting when I'm home from work...I work with my dad but he's not going anywhere, neither will I if I try and pick up the pieces of his failing business. He only started giving a fuck when I turned 20 and would work with him, he wants me to take over the family business despite making no effort to teach me anything about it as I grew up as he devoted all of his time to work. There were good times but he was the kind of dad that would come home and I'd just be afraid an uncomfortable if he was in a bad mood. He always said we couldn't survive without him and treated us like burdens but provided all the same, one of those 0-100 people who could get angry and raise hell at the flip of a switch. I want to be better than this...I live in my childhood bedroom and it's torture, I'm surrounded by junk and trash even though I go to work every day and strive to better my body, I dont even feel like a human being sometimes. I feel like an animal that's trying to claw itself out of its own filth. I cant make a decision without being paralyzed with fear and doubt. The only thing I was ever good at was art but I quit, I put down my pen and pencil for more than five years when people kept telling me it wouldn't make me any money as a kid. I want to be an Animator but when I think about getting my GED and going to college, I'm stunned by the overwhelming feeling of inadequacy in my lack of education, I couldn't even get a grip of algebra or long division when I was in school. I cringe at the idea of becoming an Animator because my art skill has deteriorated so much over the years all I can think of is how shit I'd be. I'm seriously thinking of joining a job program to get experience in a practical field even though that's not exactly what I want and get my GED but I also feel like I need to join the military so I can become a more complete person and crush the overwhelming fear and laziness in me. I really don't know what to do with myself, I feel like a ticking timebomb ready to explode and not in a funny way. The lowest I've been is smoking pot every day from morning to night until I felt numb, and drinking so much I threw up and shit myself while limp in bed.

My folks are worried about the cost and the intellectual rigor of the school, which doesn't require the GRE; they want me to take the GRE as a backup plan, and defer for at least a year before going to graduate school.

Now, I strenuously object to the deferment: I've already spent a year doing nothing after undergrad, and I don't much like it. Another year would be catastrophic for my career and future prospects.

227,"I have a fairly long background of getting bullied since primary school. My thoughts on why i was bullied is that i was an easy target i was fairly thin and weak and also i had a poor background which didnt really help. I have always woundered about primary school why i could become friends with someone and then suddenly they would suddenly stop being interested in being my friend. I remember once in secondary school, i had alot of friends in the start and i wasn't unliked in particular. Suddenly after i visited one of my friends birthday party the following day we went from friends to him bullying me for no apperent reason. Keep inn mind im fairly shy and i dont say rude or inappropriate things. There was no action from my side that should result in him wanting to suddenly bullying me. Problem is that this actions have done a big impact on me on how to get and keep friends since i dont have alot of knowlegde around it. Sure i did have some friends, but it just grew thinner and thinner until i just really had one friend until upper secondary school. And he really liked to put me down any chance he had. Not really a friend but it was all i had at the time so it was either him or nobody. In upper seondary school i did get some friends and the bullying stopped. I did get some friends there but it was pretty long distances from the school and home so visiting them often wasnt possible. From what i have remarked about myself is i tend to avoid people even though i know them and should say hello, i always wait until they say something first. The friends i've usually had up through the years have all been highly social people then tends to approach people and therefore easy for me to be friends with them. Problem is they usually have alot of friends and i tend not to be their first choice for doing something since im not that social. Now im taking higher education and i'm still in between where i am socially. I got some ""ordinary friends""  that i go out with from time to time and socialize with and i'm living with a very outgoing and social person that i met in my first year. Problem always seem to be the same since i usually go with the social guy and the knows everyone and talks to everyone and im kinda in the background and people tend not to notice me too much compared to my other friend. I do have a girlfriend and we are doing nicely but i fear my lack in social ability could be a dealbreaker now that we are moving in together in a new place and i will have difficult to find new friends. 

So in summery i really don't know why i've always been choosen from early age to be bullied. Maybe it was because i was an easy target or cus people knew i was poor( it did come up from time to time). And now i fear my early childhood has put a fence between me and having friends. 

I would like advice from people how you meet people and stay in touch. It's been a looong time since i've been someones best friend and having one.

233,"I know this is really dumb, and I'm not sure why I feel it.

Essentially, when I worked it out, my car has been costing me about $50/week, and I use it maybe once every week or two. In my area, public transport is great. I work from home (that's likely changing in August which is stressing me out a bit) but for essentially any job I get, it'd be easier for me to use public transport than to drive. My brother's GF is going to buy it for $5.5k

The only time I really drive it is to get some food with my girlfriend (who I live with), visit her parents (who we can also train to), my parents (train), or to go get groceries. Groceries are freaking my out a bit as it might be a little convoluted without a car, but I'd still be saving a lot of money.

I started driving as soon as I was allowed to, 16, got my first car (my nan gave me her's when she wasn't able to drive anymore) at about 17, that car ended up totaled in an accident a little while back and I've had this car about a year and a half. So I've essentially spent 6 years always having a car, and my entire adult life with a car...

So with that said, the thought of not having a car absolutely terrifies me. Knowing that if I wanted to just go for a drive with my girlfriend, I couldn't. It's been a LONG time since we've done that, so we rarely do, but what if I wanted to?

I'm also an extremely sentimental person, so I love the idea of driving at midnight to go get shitty fast food or whatever, and I know that's such a dumb reason to hold onto a car.

So I guess what I'm asking is, have any of you gone through a similar life change? Are any of you super sentimental about things like this and how do I learn to let go? 

Does anyone have advice for situations like this where you know the answer and what you should do but can't accept it? I know that if this situation was a friend of mine asking me for advice on whether to sell the car, I'd tell them it's a no-brainer, so why the hell can't I feel that for me? Why does this feel like the biggest decision of my life and I don't want to regret selling it?

80% of the time, she’ll say no to me going out. 

Two weeks ago, which was the last time I hung out with a friend of mine, I had to BEG HER for 3 hours to let me go to Toronto and she only complied when she got my location (from share my location on IPhone) and my friends number. 

Then, when I asked her today if I can go to the movies with my other friend she said “I always go somewhere new every week” as if it is a big problem having a social life and enjoying it, and so she said no. 

I am very annoyed and angry that she thinks she can control my social life this way when I am 20 and haven’t even gone out for 2 whole weeks (I’ve been home dying of boredom), like she’s been doing since I was born. Which is also why I have like two friends, which she STILL won’t let me hang out with. She is being irrational because I don’t even go out once a week, more like once in a while.

239,"This is embarrassing, and I needed to just vent (via throwawaway). I'm asking for guidance and kindness.

So, my parents got divorced when I was 4. They get along okay, and I went back and forth between houses when I was little. Both of them are great people.

I have good relationships with them now, at 21 years old. But something really weird came into my mind that has been bugging me for the past few days.

I remember when I was about 7 or 8 years old we moved to a new house, and I have a really weird memory of me taking a shower with my dad, BOTH in bathing suits, at that age. I'm not sure how many times that happened, I only remember once, but for some reason it came into my mind yesterday and really weirded me out. 

There was never anything inappropriate in terms of touching, I just remember my dad being in swim trunks and me in a one piece and taking a shower. I think 7 or 8 is way too old for that, but I genuinely don't think it was meant to be creepy. My dad's always been an upstanding guy, absolutely never hurt anyone or done anything to raise suspicion. I think this was a lapse of boundaries, but the fact that I remember it makes for a very embarrasing memory for me.

Other than that weird memory, there have been no issues and I've always felt comfortable with my dad and never ever felt like there was an issue of physical boundaries.

My question is, how do I deal with this memory resurfacing? I've been dating my boyfriend for the past 5 years and since I've been dwelling on this weird memory and unsure how to handle it,  I'm afraid that not mentioning it would be like I'm hiding it, but at the same time, why the hell would I mention something so weird? Not sharing this isn't being dishonest, right? I think I've been overthinking lately.

Also, I don't want to bring it up to my dad because something that happened almost 15 years ago just...yeah, I feel like that'd be a REALLY weird conversation.

We first met in middle school and I would describe our relationship as acquaintances at best. We didn’t date and I wouldn’t consider her a close friend but we were always friendly to each other. I had always found her attractive though and I asked her to a slow dance at one of our middle school dances but nothing developed from that. A few years later she went to a different high school and I haven’t really talked with her since.

After High School, we’re friends on Facebook and I occasionally see her pictures pop up on my timeline. This is when I started to dream of her. It would be an alternate reality where we had been together. Sometimes we were in a secret relationship or maybe an intense kiss. Sometimes just physical. The dreams persisted. I started dating my now wife but the dreams didn’t stop. I had to unfollow her on Facebook so her pictures would stop showing up.

244,"This is a pretty long story that spans over approximately 5 years, and I will try to condense it greatly. I started a college in 2013, where I soon became the top student in my class. I helped everyone, and everyone loved me. This attention made a person in my class approach me with a job offer, to which I sort of rejected, but said I would let him know. This person soon started to flirt with me, and play around with me as if they were attracted to me. I was very attracted to them, and they knew this because I would blush and stuff, and they would comment on that. We spent 2 years in college together, and I never really got to know this person, but I did know they were a convicted felon from years prior, and this prevented me from getting to know them well, I believe. Over the course of the 2 years, I got depressed and lost all enthusiasm for my work, ultimately self destructing. I battled with this depression in my mind every day, and the stress was so \- indescribable.  This depression was due to my attraction to this person, and the apparent attraction they presented to me, and I wasn't comfortable with my sexuality enough to act on it. What is even more depressing, is how later I would express my true feelings to this person, only to never hear a word from them \- as if the problem wasn't even real.  Yes, I am a man, and this is about a man I was attracted to. He is 10 years older than me.   


I decided to contact this person about 5 months after graduating, in 2015, he was engaged to a girl he met while we were in school, and they shared a Facebook account, but I wanted to apologize for anything I may have done, and for not accepting the job opportunity that this person offered me. This person read my messages, but never responded. I attempted several short conversations, to which none were replied to. This person did however like my pictures, and somewhat keep up with what I was doing on FB, even wishing me a happy birthday. I was pretty annoyed that my conversations weren't being replied to, but they were obviously looking at my profile, and were online most of the time...  


I got fed up one day, about a year after our graduation date, in 2016, and sent this person an e\-mail confessing how I felt about him \- literally everything I felt. I described how I felt for him, how I knew he was a felon, and that he lied about it to the whole class, how I felt like he manipulated me,, and ultimately how he was a large part of my decline during that time. This message was read, and I then blocked them on FB, thinking I could go on with life without knowing what was really going through his mind during our time together.  


In 2017, I sent him a birthday present after I learned where he lived. I know this seems odd, but I was still trying to see if he liked me or not. Oddly enough I never heard anything about the gift. I know for sure they received it, but never got a thank you or anything for it... They know I know where they live, and I still can't get him to talk to me??? There was no knee\-jerk reaction, no threats, no anything...I was amazed.   


Fast forward to this March, in 2018, a little over a year later from my first message, where I send them another message saying I really wanted to discuss this issue I am having, as I was still thinking about it often, and that I really needed some closure. I got a text message about a month later in April from the guy's Fiance, who tells me that I can't talk to this person, and that I needed to explain myself to her, which I did. She understood my problem, and said she was sorry about it, but nothing else ever came \- no message from him, no explanation for anything. Nearly 5 years of suffering, for literally nothing in return....She knew about the gift I sent, the prior messages, and everything. It's like they act as if this kind of thing happens all the time?? I was so confused and annoyed, but I told her that I was fine, and that I had met someone who was helping me deal with the situation, and that we didn't need to talk about it anymore.....It was really, disappointing how flat this whole thing has fallen....Almost disgusting.   


How do I get over this? I've been so angry and upset over it for so long. I keep thinking about how my feelings were basically ignored, and how this guy ruined my college experience, and how this guys fiance basically screened my whole conversation and then probably generalized it to him, which takes out so much of the emotion and meaning.   


It just doesn't make any sense to me at all, how I could receive no communication about what I perceived to be a life changing problem, and something that still effects me today...  


Why did he not say anything? How can someone not even seem to care about something like this? How does someone learn to be this way?  


If someone came forward to me with this kind of emotion and feeling, I would go out of my way to tell them that they were atleast in the wrong about it, and they shouldn't feel this way. ",25May2018,0

But let's faster forward and I got close to abby and she got close to me but she was getting distance to me and I was worried so I asked her why she was getting distance to me and she said it was because she loved me and she was scared to say because I might not feel the same way, but I did, I really did I loved her so much.
And I know some people say I can't or wouldn't work or how come an online person have such a impact, well i'm telling you she really did, the good day were mind blowing she made me feel so amazing and happy and loved and valued by someone.
And we both loved each other so I gave her all my love and affection because not only was she my best friend online but she was also the girl I loved, truly loved the last 6 months were some of the best I've had in year, Yes there were some bad days with her but that wasn't her, she would always think it was, but it wasn't.
She made me unbelievably happy and I love her so much.
But,
she started getting distance again and I was worried and confused because she was in love with me and wanted to be with me, I said to her "" will you be with me?"" and she said ""not now but I will"" and she says it's because she want it to be perfect but she has said stuff like ""I really love you"" and "" I really want to be with you"" but the last few days it's been really rocky with me and her but I'm not ever going to give up on her because she means so much to me and I've been there for her everyday the last 6 months, I messaged her saying ""I really love you abby"" and she just said ""nice"", I replied with ""why can't you say it back?"" because she hasn't said it in the last few days, then she says ""I can't be in love with you"" and I of course froze and was scared and panicked I asked ""why ? what's happened?"" and she says she has a boyfriend, and she never told me at all the entire time she was saying she was in love with me and loved me.
So I was speechless and scared and confused, I said ""what about me ? don't you love me ? or were you lying?""
She said she loved me more and would do something about him and she wanted to be with me.
But I was so hurt I couldn't think straight there was too much other family problem and my own problems and now the one of the few people who really made me so truly happy and I loved might have lied the entire time, so I tried taking my own life.
She found out and was asking for me to stop and saying she would leave him for me and she loved me way more, so I realised what I had done and was so scared I went to get help and have now bandages it up but am in a bad way.
But today, I just can't.
She rang me saying that it just isn't working and she just want's to stay ""friends"" even though everything we have both said to each other and how much I love her.
And the thing is I really don't want to lose what I had with her, playing games, talking, messaging and watching stuff together it was so amazing and everything made me so happy, but I'm scared i'll become another online person to her and i'll lose everything I had with her.
My other best friend has been talking to her but not much said.
All day I've been just sat at the beach confused and scared and I really need help.
I really want to keep her in my life and be with her.

249,"I simply fear that I would come off as condescending. My intention is to easily communicate and to improve their comprehension of what I am saying, rather than using complicated words as a display of my apparently more broad vocabulary. 

On the contrary, I would justify myself using simpler words because of my belief that, “Language’s purpose is to convey ideas.” So if simpler words will do the job, and at times more efficiently, why not use them instead?

E.g. Exquisite vs. very nice looking 

But I want to be considerate and like treating people equally. In order to do that, I would have to utilize the same diction while conversing with anyone.

Sometimes I feel like the person has trouble understanding some words, just based on their facial expression when I say a relatively complicated word. But I do realize I am assuming what they are thinking, as I have not inquired about their current thoughts.

However, this person also seems rather uncomfortable when I use relatively simple words.

Personally, I don’t like exerting the effort of reciting any definition. I just want to express my ideas and comprehend other people’s ideas.

Would it hurt their feelings if I used simpler words? Would it hurt their pride or dignity? What should I do? Should I mix in just a few relatively complicated words in a conversation as a means to not be construed as condescending?

250,"Hello 

So for the past few months my 55 y/o mom has had bad hip pain. She has been resigned to the living room couch and only gets up to go to the bathroom. My dad waits on her. 

She had to leave work in February I believe and I’m not sure if there holding her spot or not but I guess she’s getting unemployment checks.

So apparently she’s been to the doctor a few months ago but has neglected any follow up/ physical therapy appointments. She says that it’s painful for her to walk, so she can’t leave the house to go to the er or doctor or anything. And we don’t have a car so we couldn’t get her there if she wanted to. This is so stressful and hard on us and none of us know what to do any help is valued deeply",25May2018,1

256,"My family and I have been through some rough patches in our lives. When I was about 6 my oldest sister passed away at 19. My parents split up and my dad left about a month later. Basically all that’s left is my mom, my sister and I. My mom and I used to have a great relationship. I’m 21 years old now and that’s all gone. I used to tell her anything and everything... that is until she started using things against me. Like, id tell her my friends have been too busy to hang out with me and during an argument she’ll say things like “you’re impossible maybe that’s why your friends don’t want to see you.” Almost two years ago when I got into my first real relationship, she started using anything I vented about him against me. When she found out I lost my virginity, she thought I had lost it right around the time I found out, and not a year prior like it actually happened. Upon that happening, my ex-boyfriend and I went through a rough patch and split up. My mom told me he left because i finally gave him what he wanted and there was no need for me anymore. My mom has called me a slut. She attributes my depression or my lack of motivation to spend time with her to my boyfriend or my friends. She recently found out I smoke occasionally and is treating me like a druggie. Lately everything I do is wrong. She loves loves loves using the phrase “if your sister was here she’d be so disappointed in you” and even tries to hit me still. She’ll yell at me constantly and I don’t say anything back, then she’ll leave and start sending me angry text messages. she’s started wanting to track me. even when I try to apologize or fix things and go hug her, she starts yelling at me again. She’s made fake social media accounts to try and see my tweets, pictures, posts. She doesn’t let me breathe and I don’t think I can do this anymore. I love my mom more than anything but lately she’s just lashing out at me. She’s extremely toxic, I don’t know what to do. I can’t do this anymore. ",25May2018,0

265,"   I recently got out of a VERY toxic relationship with a woman. She was a pill and alcohol addict who I tried to help get clean for too long, and the camels back finally broke when she came at me with a knife for confronting her about some mini wine bottles behind the dresser. I tell you this to illustrate she is a loose cannon(I’m okay and my life is great, don’t worry). 

Anyway, I recently opened an older laptop she was still logged into gmail on(I know I shouldn’t have snooped anyway, but in fairness she was terrible and it gave me a good bit of closure to her terror.) apparently she cheated on me ALOT, which in itself I’m rather ambivalent to. I already suspected it and she downgraded so oh well. What bothers me is I looked him up on Facebook, he was a co worker so I know him by name, and the affair overlapped with his marriage, the conception of his child and birth of his child. Given the emails I’m also certain his wife has no clue. 

Under no circumstances do I want this horrible person back into my life in any way whatsoever. Butttt my sense of justice makes me feel the need to let her know what’s up.

I guess my question is: is it morally right to tell her, possibly breaking up their marriage, letting her kid grow up a child of divorce, etc, or do I let her be blissfully ignorant( they look like a happy family at surface level on Facebook ). She’s technically a message away and I just am at a loss of what to do.

TLDR I know about a cheating husband and don’t know what to do with the evidence.

291,"Buckle up this is a long one

To give some background about me: I’m 17 and turning 18 this June. I’m 5’11 with shoulder length light blond hair. I’m on the skinnier side of the scale for my height but not sickly so. I’d say I’m average in terms of looks. I’m nothing special but I know I’m not ugly. I’m also considerably shy but am good at hiding it in most cases.

 To start off I go to a small Christian High school (400-500ppl)  where I’m now a senior and the girl is a junior. I used to go to a big public school (3000-4000ppl) and decided to switch schools before the start of junior year. One of the first things I did, as most 16 year old boys do, was see which girls I thought were cute. I only saw a few that stood out to me. The one I thought was the cutest I simply dismissed because I thought she was a freshman. I always kinda kept her in the back of my mind as the “what if” girl and had a small crush on her. I'm not saying she’s a “drop dead babe” but I thought she was cute in her own way. I never met her though and only saw her in passing.

One day (still in junior year) I found out she was actually a sophomore, which was only one grade below me at the time, so I started to have a little bit more of a crush on her and it solidified my view of her as the “what if” girl. I never full on went for her because 1. I did not know her in the slightest and 2. I was in a complicated situation with a girl on my track team.

Over the last 2 years I learned more about her, not intentionally but just from overhearing things in the small school. I learned her name and and found out who some of her friends were. I learned she was pretty shy but outgoing when surrounded by friends; this caused me to like her even more because I could relate. Disclaimer: I’m not a stalker you tend to learn a lot about a stranger in such a small school and I only probably retained the information because I always liked her. She seemed like a nice good hearted person and I also know she hasn’t had a boyfriend (at least since I started going to that school).

My current predicament started last month during prom. I went there with a group of friends, and during the dance my minuscule enduring crush turned into a full on one when I saw her there. Something clicked in my head, I realized that my Highschool days were numbered. I will likely never see her agian once summer begins and I graduate. I will always regret it if I don’t find a way to meet her. Prom was a month ago as of posting this question. My goal in the last school day before graduation is to turn the “what if” into a “maybe”. I’m not looking to start dating her but I want to at least meet her and get to know her to the point where I might be able to ask her out over the summer. I don’t have any mutual friends with her that I know of and have no idea about how to go about this. I’ve never dated or been with anyone but from what I know neither has she. I don’t even know if she knows I exist. We’ve never met, don’t have any classes together, and rarely even pass each other in the hall. All I ask for is advice on how to deal with my situation. I also want to know how to go about this without making her uncomfortable and coming off as weird. What should I do?

294,"aaaaaand just yesterday I developed an extremely unhealthy crush on someone new for the first time in a while. 

I am completely aware that my (obsession) with him is completely unhealthy despite this only having begun yesterday. 

Details:
1. He is (almost) completely my type, I found him on tinder, and his soundcloud was linked on his profile.
2. Naturally being a little curious as I have a stupid weakness for singers I went to check it out and.... he checks out. 
3. We haven't made any sort of correspondence yet
4. I f*cking stalked all his social media accounts.
5. I am (trying hard to stop myself from) planning to go see him on one of his upcoming shows.
6. and also, I'm completely aware that the chances of us getting together are very very very low 

Anyway, annoying as it may be, I find it difficult to stop myself from wanting to obsess over him and/or possibly see him despite me knowing that at least 15 other girls want him (although he is single), and that our compatibility is not very good. I also know that limerence may or may not fade away on its own after a few weeks or months but do you guys have any advice on speeding up the process? My friend has already tried to tell me about annoying/mildly grotesque things about him or stuff like how he kinda resembles some unattractive person we know but to no avail. ",25May2018,2

297,"So my great-grandmother died several years ago. We weren’t close, but she was the matriarch of the family and I admired her and her remarkable life. She lost four brothers to both World Wars, survived the Great Depression, traveled all over the world in her youth and lived independently in her own home until the day she died. 

After her retirement she took up painting as a hobby until she couldn’t hold the brush any longer without her hands shaking. She liked to paint landscapes and the occasional portrait. When she died, we were all given a painting. Somehow I ended up with four. I think she felt I would appreciate them more since she knew I was an artist.

But here’s the thing: my great-grandmother had a good eye for colors and detailing, but in general they’re very...Bob Ross. As in, they’re aesthetically pleasing, but nothing special. I don’t fault her for this; she never strove to be a professional artist. She just painted what she liked.

So now I’m sitting here in my very small apartment with four medium to large oil paintings in very ornate gold frames and wondering what the hell I do with them. They don’t fit my personal style at all, but I would feel awful if I just gave them to Goodwill. 

Looking for some direction, I guess. Where could these go where I know they would be appreciated (even just as background)? I doubt I would be able to sell them. ",25May2018,2
298,"So my mum found my sex toys. I’m a 19 year old female currently living at home due to long term illness. I’m gradually trying to get my A levels done. My illness means I’m in pain all the time and I’m home all the time mostly. I’ve been on these new meds and they have been affecting my memory lately, now I curse the day I took them. 

Basically I was washing them and left them for some reason I can’t honestly remember. My mum unfortunately found them and proceeded to confiscate the away from me saying I “shouldn’t be doing this” and that “this is not okay”. I managed to convince her to give them back to me but she wanted me “to think about what I am doing”. 

My parents are from an African Christian background, just to give some context. My mum wants me to list the pros and cons and also wants me to do counselling as well because of this, so I’m “not like that anymore”. She said she wouldn’t discuss this with anyone else, I hope. She then proceeded to tell me “this is really hurting her”. 

This situation has really put me on the edge emotionally and just dealing with the pain is already a lot. I’ve even got exams now which I feel like I can’t sit and already know that I’m going to fail, due to the pain being so severe. As a result I haven’t been able to put in as much work as I could. I honestly feel like an embarrassment and failure. I don’t even want to be at home anymore, but I feel trapped here. I know this isn’t anything that I should feel ashamed of but now I do. I really had a good relationship with my mother but I feel like I’ve completely ruined it.

299,"**TL;DR:** ***Friend is offering me to replace a gifted guitar using his insurance money. I'm struggling to accept his offer.***

I’m starting to get back into playing the guitar. Every time I’ve moved, I tend to leave things behind and gift them to make the move easier, among other things. I gave my entry level guitar to a very good friend of mine \(he played guitar too\). It was a Red, Dinky J22. After the big fire, the insurance took everything of his and after telling him that I wanted to get back into playing, he offered to replace my old one from the insurance money he got. He told me he figured I’d want to get back into playing again some time and kept it to himself if I ever wanted to pick it up again. I couldn’t believe his offer.

I’m struggling to accept this. It’s just too kind of him. He’s been such an amazing friend to me, an older brother, and all. You can’t ask for a better friend, really. For sure, like anyone else, given my budget is restricted to that of a typical university student, you’d accept his offer in an instant, but I feel morally obligated to decline. I know I would do the same in his shoes but being on the receiving end it’s different. I’ve done this to people in the past. A few of my friends wanted to get into paintball and didn’t have gear of their own, so I’ve gifted them gear and other things for them. I did this to a former friend of mine with all my old gear when I left to return to university \(over $1000 worth of gear\). As much as I’d love a new guitar, I’m really struggling to accept this. That’s a lot of money. It may not be a lot to some folk, and relatively speaking it's cheap in comparison to decent guitars, but...I don't know. I'm struggling to accept this.",25May2018,0

I got an interview for a traineeship position. A traineeship program for Software Engineering.

***How different is this interview going to be as the position name is an unconventional one?***

It is a fulltime position but it is not like an internship and it is also NOT like a regular software engineering/development position. ***What kind of questions should I expect?*** I am almost a hundred percent sure that they are going to ask why I want to leave my current company. But what else should I expect?

My REAL answer to ""why do you want to leave your current company?"":

\(1\) I am working for a gambling organization and I don't like it.

\(2\) The company culture is horrible: They talk down each other and my bosses are bullies.

\(3\)The computer\(s\) which I am working with/on are extremely old and it disturbs me that others in the company have much nicer things. It is not that company is poor.

\(4\) The one of the important ones: IT IS NOT A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT POSITION FOR GOD'S SAKE. I always want to develop a career in the direction of software engineering but I always got rejected.

I had been working a shit job while I went to school and wanted to get out as soon as I could. When i graduated i took a job in Dallas Texas thinking it was the right thing for me. I got there and hated Dallas and the job. I got fired after about 6 months and moved back home to live with my parents again. I've been living with my parents since and have been miserable the entire time. I decided after the experience that i didn't like my field of study (computer networking &amp; security) I thought half way through that maybe i should change it but ended up saying fuck it I might as well finish the degree. Last bit of back story I was born in California and moved to Michigan when I was young when I found out where I was born I always wanted to move back i visited when I was in high school and feel in love with it. Now that im older I want to move back but I know its pretty expensive so I thought maybe I should try other west coast states such as Oregon or Washington. So with all my rambling in mind I would like some people that arnt my family's thoughts. I have recently applied for a small university about and hour north I have been accepted i was going to try to go to school for something different . At the same time I really want to follow my dream of moving west even if its a bad idea i feel like i should try. my current shit job doesn't offer me enough hours to even make enough to pay all my bills at the moment and there are not many job opportunity where im at. I have some money saved but i haven't been able to add to it since moving back. I bought a car that was going to be fine if I was making the money i was making in Texas but now that I am back making sub 1000 a month its crushing me. So the path i feel im stuck on now is go back to school and see if i can get another job or two and get my self potentially into a boat im not really happy about or Follow the dream and potentially have it blow up in my face.

He did not take that very greatly and that is what initially started his thoughts. But, now he has a pending felony charge for his drug use and is scared he is going to lose custody of his child and never see him again. He grew up without his dad and knows firsthand what its like to have a dad that is detached from their kids life. He knows that he will create a bad household for his kid and doesn't want to give him that kind of life. In my opinion, the first step and the hardest step to fixing his life is to recognize the problems and he has already done that, I think he just doesn't know how to fix it. I tried calling the suicide hotline already but they told me there was nothing I could do aside from give him their number and talk him down when he gets emotional. He told me yesterday that he tried to overdose on pills a couple days back, but they only knocked him out. I really don't want to lose him. How can I help someone who doesn't want professional help and does not know how to change? My S/O's brother sobered up from meth abuse and distribution and works with his girlfriend now but my brother in law does not seem to think that he can do the same. What do I do?",25May2018,2
329,"Hello reddit, this is my first post. I am turning to you in a time of confusion, as I feel like need an opinion on this from someone who doesn’t know me, and is therefore at least partially unbiased to my situation.

Some background: I have only had two serious boyfriends ever, the first was in high school (lasting 2 years; let’s call him Jordan) and my second and current relationship which began 2 years after Jordan and I broke up (we are approaching 3 1/2 years; let’s call him Austin) 
Jordan and I were best friends, I don’t mean that in a corny way at all, he brought me out of my shell, introduced me to so many people and basically helped me become the person I am today. We had more fun with each other than any other couple at our school and had the most amazing sex. But our relationship was so much more. We have so many shared interests, I loved his family and they loved me, and we were really active and out there with everything we did. He was super manly and still is. He was also a year older than I was and two years in, completely out of the blue, broke up with me at the end of my senior year of high school because he was in college and “wasn’t having fun being in a relationship anymore, and wanted to see what single life was like,” even though his feelings “had never changed for me and he still loved me as much as he did at our peak.” We hooked up for another year or two, basically up until I met Austin. 

Me and Austin met when I wasn’t looking for anything, but I fell for him so quick. We had the same sense of humor, music taste, knew a lot of each others friends, and above all had an amazing time together. I can be completely myself around him and he makes me feel comfortable and happy even if I was having the worst day before I’m with him. I feel like I am a part of his family and I love him to death. We also have amazing sex and I feel like he is half of my life now. He is the better choice all around, (sweeter, more caring, perfect family, amazing values, loves me to death and would do anything for me) and I feel like I will never find anyone better than him at any point in my life. I want to marry him and I want to make him happy for the rest of his life too. The only issue is that I think I might still love my ex.

My ex and I went to the same college and I just graduated but he stayed longer because he is double majoring. He is majoring in engineering and environmental science, the latter being something I am minoring and am therefore very passionate about. He has always been respectful and has never made a move and always asks how me and Austin are, but about 6 months ago he told me he was still in love with me, that the only reason we broke up was because he thought if we didn’t break up then, that we never would and that was a scary thought, and lastly that if me and Austin were ever to break up that he hoped he would be the first person I would call. He’s not a bad guy at all, I trust him more than almost anyone and we ended for such a stupid reason and I never really felt like I had closure because I never really understood until a few years ago. I thought I was over him, but hearing that he has still always loved me and regrets losing me has been messing with my head. 

I know that Austin is the obvious choice and that is who I love and want to be with for the rest of my life. We share almost all of our values, but Jordan and I share all of our interests and we had a passion for each other that was out of this world. 

I don’t know what to do and I’m going crazy. I can’t talk to my friends because they’re all so in love with me and Austin together and say I seem so much happier with him than I ever was with Jordan so I know they would try to talk me out of any thoughts. I really want to get the thoughts of my ex and I out of my head and I don’t know how. 

What should I do? 
Thanks in advance, I’m really struggling",25May2018,0
330,"I've always had self image problems. It has to stem from when I was a child \(5\-9 years old\) and my dad wouldn't let me eat when we spent the weekends at his house. He would let me eat breakfast and dinner. My brothers could eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks in between. If I wanted seconds he would tell me no, but let my brothers eat. He would stand me up against the wall to take my height and compare it to my weight, all the while giggling that I had a ""double chin."" Keep in mind I have never been even close to overweight, even as a child like I was then. 

I developed an eating disorder in 4th grade that lasted until I was a junior in high school when I went to the mental hospital and got help for a bunch of different internal struggles that were going on. Since I got help, I can understand what unhealthy behavior and what unhealthy thinking is and how to cope with it and distract myself. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean I'm confident in myself or happy with my body in the slightest.

I know I'm healthy \- 5'7"" and 130 lbs, but I'll never have the ideal body I want. I've starved myself for my ""ideal"" body type when I was younger which obviously isn't okay. I have since worked out, ate healthy, the whole nine yards and I am trying to come to grips that I'll never have that Instagram, super flat tummy, large but not too large hips, teeny tiny waist, small lil' perky boobs, and nice butt body. It's just not possible for me. I'm thin but I have naturally larger hips. There's not really any meat on them, the actual hip bone is just really wide across. It looks super weird to me because I have wider hips and fairly flat butt which almost never goes together. I've done squats and other exercises that target glutes and it made my butt more tight, but not the way I want it to look. Everyone claims certain exercises will guarantee this perfect butt that's ""in"" nowadays but it's just not possible for my body I guess. 

I had a therapist once tell me to write down a list of things I liked about myself and a list of things I didn't like. The only thing I put on my like list was my hair and eyes. My dislike list had almost every part of my body written down from my hips and stomach to how big I think my feet are. I've had multiple therapists give up on trying to deal with my body issues and try to focus on other problems instead because it seems like an impossible war to fight. 

I'm a lot better off than I was before I went through treatment, but the past week has been torture for me. If anyone else has been through something similar, please tell me what helps you out. I need it. ",25May2018,10
331,"I have known my friend for four years, but only became best friends with her in the past year and a half. We are in the same grade, and graduation is next Thursday. I will be graduating, and she will not.

Here is some backstory. She has depression, and many other issues emotionally, with friendships, and does not like school in any way possible. I have DPDR, emotional trauma, and have been through situational depression, so I understand how brutal it is, but at some point you have to start pulling yourself up. Her family and I have been trying to get her to school but all efforts have failed. I’ve even gone to the extent of waking up early with her at her house in the morning to be by her while she gets ready. In the end she missed so much school that they took her out of the system and her parents had to fight to get her re-enrolled from where she left off. Whenever I talk to her family about school she completely taps out mentally and shuts down. I want to help her, but I can’t, and I know that. But I also want to be able to talk about a very normal experience that I go through without feeling guilty. Is this selfish?

I found out a few days ago that she actually isn’t graduating. She will be taking summer classes to finish but she will not be at the ceremony. Her sister told me she is very upset and I am going over later. I don’t know how to console someone when I was trying to help them the entire time, y’know? What do I say? I know saying ‘I told you so’ is completely inappropriate and pushing the fact will not benefit anyone, but its also hard to comfort her when she got herself into the mess.

I’ve come to realize socially she uses me as a crutch. We don’t have any classes together so she doesn’t know who my friend groups are. I tend to float around and can blend in to a lot of groups, but she never sees this to realize it. During prom I had to drag her around as a third wheel with my boyfriend and it was really ruining my night. She detached herself, was distant to me, and didn’t try joining my group of friends at all. I know both of their humor, so I know how to make it so both parties connect but she never takes it up. I ended up ditching her because it isn’t my job to babysit her. She was dragging me down the entire night and if she wasn’t going to cooperate, I wasn’t going to be with her.

Am I wrong for leaving her during prom? Should I console her about not graduating? Am I selfish for thinking this way? ",25May2018,0

333,"I get anxious, stressed and worried that she’ll cheat on me.

I’ve had bad experiences with people who drink since I was a child, seen people cheat on TV and heard people using alcohol of a justification for cheating.

For as far as I know, I have no reason to have “trust” issues but I just can’t help it.

334,"My fiancee is moving to Canada with me to start the sponsorship process at the end of June, we would like some advice on the following situation, the perimeters are:

She lives currently in California: She has a 2 year child with her ex. They were never married, they were just common law. The child is with her most of the time. (3 weeks vs 1 week). Upon conversation with her ex about her wanting to come here with me in Canada, he said that he would like to give up his primary rights to her. Also he is signing a document stating that she can bring him across the border to see me with child. So what would we would like to know is, are there any obstacles that would get in our way. There seem to be a lot of different scenarios. For example: The form for allowing the child across the border always seems to have a depart AND return date, if she has no plans to return with him, is there another option for us where there is no return date? Basically what I would to know is, how can my fiancee safely and LEGALLY bring her child to me to live, if the father is cooperating and agrees to it. What specific forms would we need, and is a lawyer needed. If possible we would like to do get this done without lawyers and just a notary, if possible. I can clarify anything if need be.

335,"Long one. But I really really really need advice because what do I do? I’m not her relative, and her relatives don’t care.

It’s not common to care about mental health in my country, and I don’t really know the signs, but I think this is it. 

She’s my old friend, 25 year old like me, we have known each other for a long time, since school, then we went to universities, graduated and found jobs and we didn’t really have much time to see each other frequently.
About her:
She has not graduated because she failed the exams and didn’t get a diploma, and she’s so stressed about it. She doesn’t have a boyfriend, doesn’t have any friends except me. She also recently deleted social pages because there she saw her old classmates achieving something like: they get married, found jobs and she feels like she failed at life. She feels miserable. She feels like she’s nothing and not worthy. She said: I don’t have anything interesting to share.

I always gave her money or support when she needed it, I love and care about her.

Her family is not supportive, she lives with her mum and there is also grandmother. Her mum decided to end her career and she retired, she said to my friend that now she has to financially support her and grandma. But my friend didn’t know her mother wants to retire and she recently resigned too. So she was looking for a job for 3 months to support grandma and her mum, she was so unhappy and her mother was harassing her every evening. Like she’s not worthy, she’s a disgrace to the family. I didn’t know that, we didn’t have contact for several month,

So there she is without a job, degree, friends, boyfriend. Completely broken, so she called me. She was at the point of crying, saying she’s miserable so miserable, there is no escape and the interviews for a job don’t go well.. That she doesn’t see any perspective and this is the lowest point, the end. Nothing about suicide, she was just very down,

I found her a job the same week, just because I knew somebody who can take my friends for a job.

I thought now she will be happier and I think I was wrong.

Her mother still hates her. My friend is saving up to live separately, but it’s expensive to rent, but she doesn’t have another chance.

Here is how I started suspecting that something was wrong with her:
We went out today. She was happy to see me, we went to the park to have a picnic.
Good weather, she was happy and smiling and sun was shining.
On the way from supermarket to the park she became quiet and suspicious, she started to speak very quiet and began to whisper. I said
-what’s happening? Is there something wrong?
-No, I will explain to you when we get somewhere quiet -she whispered.
I instantly got scared, I thought there is someone following us. I started asking if we are in danger, I was so terrified. Because her face was so scared and so strange... I thought maybe it’s the guys from supermarket following us, they tried to talk to us in the supermarket and they were drunk. I was terrified to look back. 
It was so fucking strange. 
When we got to the park she told why she was acting like that, she saw her old classmate. She was abusing my friend at school and now she is successful, she owns a business. Now I look back at it, I cannot remember if I saw anyone, I even screamed at the whole street there is no one there, jokingly. I think she was hallucinating, it’s impossible to meet someone, we live in a big city with 5+mil people. And I am sure she didn’t look at “her classmate”, her gaze was like a glass, like she’s closed from outside. She didn’t pay attention to anything what I said between when she got scared and when we arrived to the park. 
I brushed it off and we talked and talked. It was nice sitting on the grass, enjoying the sun and talking about life. Again she said she needs to get out and start living on her own, that she feels she failed in life and everything I shit. I reassured her that she is now better and it’s starting to get better, she now has a job.
But I feel like these 3 moths at home looking for a job fucked her up.
Then there was the thing that scared me the most:
She said He is following her. She said it like that: that he’s following her. Not that it’s strange that she saw him. He’s following her. A man, who she dated in school. It was so long ago. 
She said she seen him in his car near her work when she went out to smoke many times. That he has two cars. That she saw his girlfriend in his another car parked near her house on the photo on social media. But when I offered to find this photo she said she doesn’t remember this girl account, and he deleted his social. That’s too much coincidences here. She remembers her name, but it’s very common so we cannot find her.
She was so terrified and shocked when she was saying it.
I instantly was concerned and said she needs to get help, that’s she’s imagining things. She said no without a doubt that was him. I think her reaction is very strange.
Then we went to go to subway, she was again “closed” , eyes looking nowhere. And she answered “yes” or “no” to all so said. I don’t think she listened to me.
And there was a guy sitting in his car parked near us and as we were passing I joked about that “is it him?”, she became scared again. And she said she thinks he’s masturbating, his head was tilted back, so we decided to shame him and got back. His head wasn’t tilted and he was not doing what she thought. 

I got home now and I am sure she needs help. I am sure she’s not doing drugs. And now I have one question: what do I do? I’m the only one, her family hates Her, she doesn’t have a boyfriend or friends. I have to do something. What do I do??",25May2018,0

* I have an associates degree in Liberal Arts
* I have a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions after 2 years in the military \(Because I got in trouble by the law off\-post some time ago\)
* I was convicted of Soliciting a Prostitute, but I got that conviction expunged and my probation removed
* I'm not looking for any lectures on why/how I got in trouble. I've already received enough of that already from various people in my life and I'm really trying to leave that dark past of mine behind me.

So, I don't know what job I want, but I'm willing to work in almost anything with the exceptions of anything involving a lot of hard math, science, or anything construction/blue collar related.

I'd like to work for a company or organization that gives me a pension at least. I'm very frugal and having that pension means I'll never have to work a day in my life ever again after I retire.

But working for the government in some capacity \(whether with a local, state or federal agency\) is what I'm mainly trying to aim for. 

Also, I'm not even going to bother pursuing a bachelors degree right now since I can't afford taking out a loan unless I have a career to pay it off in the first place \(I didn't qualify for the G.I. Bill to cover the cost of schooling because of a General Discharge\)

339,"Hey, Reddit. There’s  a guy at my my school who is generally.... off.  

A little backstory: So this guy has issues, to say the least. He generally has no filter, and that can lead to some unfortunate situations. For example, he’s been known to be kind of pervy around girls. I know that when you’re young you start discovering yourself and find out who it is you are attracted to and all that shit, but this guy just has the worst approach when it comes to girls. He’s been known to hug girls without their permission- up until a few months ago- and made this comment to a girl, who was, according to him, wearing “loose” leggings: Leggings are supposed to be tight so you can see what you want to see.” Let me remind you that we are all 14.

He’s also made some negative remarks about religion. I once heard him tell a Jewish girl that her religion was only an excuse so people could get a day off work/school. Another situation- which happened today, actually- was when he made a remark about Catholics. Now, I gotta let you all know that I’m half catholic, which will help you to understand this story. So, the guy said that Catholics were bad, and I just gave him the stink eye for that. But then the guy proceeds to say that Catholics are either homophobic or secretly homophobic, which is when I step in. You see, I’ve been questioning my sexuality for years, and I’m also a huge supporter of the lgbt community. I say to him that I am half catholic, yet i go to my school’s gsa (Gender Sexuality Alliance) and I have gone to catholic school for a few years. An old friend of mine who went to catholic school with me was able to back me up on the second comment. However, the guy says my case doesn’t count because I’m half catholic, and not wholly catholic. After the whole situation went down, I wrote an email to the vice principal, requesting that we discuss the situation. (Yes, I have talked to teachers and other adults about his behavior, but i don’t know if any action has been taken.)

I also think the guy has been verbally abused at home, which might be why he acts the way he does. One classmate of mine recalls that he had seen the guy and his mom yelling at each other as the guy was dropped off at school. Also, the guy once blurred out that one time, his mom got into a fight, and his mom made him walk about 3 hours to school. Another friend of mine had a strange encounter with his mother as well, but I’m not going to get into detail with that. This guy also has a history of being suicidal, and he recently told his only friend that if he were to lose her, he would have nothing to lose- needless to say, she immediately went and told an adult.

Also, he also tends to ooze and drool over cute couples and girls. I know that everyone has couples on tv and online-trust me, I have mine as well- but this guy seems to take it to another level. As I stated above, this guy is pervy around girls. He once sent a creepy love confession to the girl who had the weird encounter with his mom at midnight (again, not going into detail) But it seems like he wants to have a relationship like you would see on tv or in a movie. But while these relationships on screen seem more or less perfect, they aren’t real life, and the guy can’t seem to understand that. For example, my friend told me about a baby gender reveal turned into a proposal. Well, the guy steps in and say that you can’t do that. When my friend and I ask him why, he says that you are supposed to get married, then get pregnant. Well, I brought up that Pam and Jim from The Office- which we are both fans of- got pregnant before getting married. He simply remarked that the office wasn’t real life, even though the Pam and Jim situation was a very real situation.

I guess why I’m posting this is to get the story out there, and some advice. I see this guy as a ticking time bomb, and there’s not a whole lot you can do to disarm it, because words don’t do anything to him. I’m afraid that in the future, he’s going to get a girlfriend, but he’ll abuse her and not allow her to leave him. If you guys could give me some advice, that would be great.

She shows up late, takes long lunches (has also taken a lunch then leaves for a second lunch), is on her phone texting all the time, She takes off when she feels like it, She complains about the majority of our coworkers and puts them down after they leave the room (I wonder what she says about me) she is so explosive and rude when anyone tries to tell her to do anything and she brings her kids in which is extremely fucking annoying when you are working and its super busy and the kids are hanging around at her desk which is right near where I sit so I am distracted. She complained to Nate that he and our coworker Pete are too easy on me. Anyways, one day Nate has a conversation with me and told me I need to keep off my phone at work (which I completely understand and abide by since then it goes in my purse and in my locker), during this conversation I mentioned to Nate that I thought to have kids in the room was counterproductive to the department. I wasn't against the kids being there just not in the room (there is a break room where other employees have had their kids sit and do their homework or something).

I love my classmates and friends for class, but truth is that we have only school in common. Each will go to their own way afterwards so except for my small circle of close friends I won't keep in touch with others probably... Which is a shame.

I will prefix this  by saying my girlfriend is the most careful and gentle person and  couldn't deliberately break a phone if she tried, so i don't think this  was user error.

Her computer also  randomly sparks out sometimes, freezing, stopping and shutting down.  Even when she's not using it \(when it's just on\). Same with her laptop.

This  could be coincidence, that's what i would presume, however she always  complains how slow and ""laggy"" her phone is. I have witnessed it and it  is bizarrely slow for such a good mobile phone \(Samsung mid\-high range\).  However when i use the phone it's normally find and a usable speed.

Her phone also emits this weird buzzing sound whenever she plays songs or anything to do with audio, kind of like interference.

The  phone recently ""broke"" again and we sent it into repair. When the  repair sheet came back, a bunch of random things we didn't even realize  were broken, had broken. One of which was the microphone. This i  presumed was faulty and that's what was causing it, it was replaced. So  now I'm thinking I'm not completely mad, well now sat here a mere two  weeks after the repaired phone with a new internal mic has come back, my  GF is stressed out and the mic is emitting the same interference.

There has also been other random situations like if she walks near a radio it will just turn to static no matter the radio. etc

Is  this at all possible? Does my girlfriend emit some kind of higher  frequency static electricity compared to the normal human? Or are  we  going insane? We'd really like this solved because it's becoming super expensive. Since i've known her she's gone through about 9 phones. 

TL:DR \- Either im nuts or my gf has the worlds worst super power i need to know which.",25May2018,0
352,"First, I apologize if this isn't the most appropriate sub for this kind of question but I wasn't sure where else to post it.   
  
For the last three weeks or so, I have been receiving extremely bizarre phone calls on a daily basis, sometimes several times a day, sometimes late at night. The calls come from different numbers and different people, but they all have more or less the same content: I answer the phone and the person asks why I've been calling them, and then they quickly become VERY agitated and start screaming or making threats when I say that I haven't called them. Or they'll start off the call as if I'm the one that has just called them. A typical call goes something like this:  
  
Me: Hello?  
Them: Hello, this is x, how can I help you?  
Me: ...uh, you called me?  
Them: I didn't call you, YOU called me! My phone rang, I answered the phone and it was YOU! This is a fucking BUSINESS! Call this number one more goddamn time and I'm calling the cops, bitch!   
  
With some of the calls it's almost like the person on the other end of the line isn't understanding or hearing what I'm saying. Like, they are unable to give answers to the questions I ask (""What number is it that called you?"" ""YES!""), making me think that at least some of these are recordings of some sort. But is that really a thing, and if so, then how can I get it to stop??? I am sick of waking up to 10 missed calls every morning and being harassed all throughout the day. Could it be a scam of some sort? ",25May2018,0

355,"I have been doing temp admin work, and am well liked by the staff; originally I’d considered myself a temporary fill-in while they look for a ‘real’ admin/executive assistant, who left in late April. I was asked 5/17 if I’d consider applying for the full-time position, by the team leader I’d be EA-ing for and a regional HR/Accounting person. I’ll admit, it is not my field of interest necessarily, but I’m more than capable of doing the job and it pays a great salary, (especially compared to the low hourly temp wage I am currently making) and I like most of the people I’d be interacting with. 

I interviewed 5/18, and was not offered the job or any follow up interviews. 

That Friday, the next Monday and the rest of last week I have been being trained in more and more higher level intricate work; classified financial information, higher level spreadsheet and accounting work, and Executive Assistant assignments/expectations all day long, in addition to my normal admin duties I’d been doing already. Perfectly fine, all work I am capable of, but it is of course for the same low temp hourly wage I’d been getting to answer phones and do light office work. No mention of the interview, no mention a follow up. 
At what point do I ask what is happening? I know this company has policy of not ‘hiring out of fear, but hiring the RIGHT person for the RIGHT job’ and if I’m not that person, that’s fine, but 1. that has not been communicated, and 2. If it is the case, it seems like my temp pay should reflect my new skill level and responsibilities. I arrive early, I stay late, I’m friendly and not dumb. But I feel dumb right now.

356,"What to do?
As I sit here, watching a film, wondering how my next 5 years are going to pan out, I can’t help but think, I’m not going to choose the path that everyone is expecting me to.
For a bit of a back story, I applied to become a Warfare Officer in the Royal Navy around a year ago where I’ve gone through most of their stages to join up. I had to lose weight to be at the acceptable BMI number, and I have waited and waited to for the next steps to be booked in and there’s been a lot of frustration in waiting around. I have told almost everyone, including people I don’t even know, that I will be an officer in the Royal Navy. What a load of shit that is. I feel over the last year or so, that I haven’t really wanted to join up, merely tell people that I am, to sound like I’ve got my life together, and that I’d make my family proud following in the foot steps of my great grandads.
I feel that I’ve made a bit of a circle, I think I did want to join the Navy right at the beginning of the process, and then I would go in and out of wanting to join, but now I’ve gotten close to the time of joining, I really don’t know what to do. I went and sat on the hill and made a list of the pros and cons of joining up or starting a business (we’ll get to that in a minute). I think the biggest drawback that I could think of, apart from having to cut my hair, would be my lack of freedom. Obviously, training would be arduous and hard, which I’m not afraid of, but it would severely decrease my ability to get up and go do something that I want, be it going and watching a film at the cinema, or anything really, the Navy would stop me doing that. Also, I found out that even the weekends that I would be allowed to come home on, they would be able to say, no, you must stay here now, which would bugger up any plans I’d have. I’m a big believer in having the freedom to do what you want, and yes, I know by joining the Navy I would literally be signing a contract which basically states that I wouldn’t be able to bitch and moan about whatever and would have to do as they say, but I would have thought there would be a slight bit of improvement on their end.
But the Navy can’t be all bad right? Otherwise why would it be an option for me? I think the travel, which is probably the reason for most people joining up, is the main thing that draws me to joining, and being able to see the world and get paid for it. I also like the large amount of responsibility I’d be given as an Officer, and especially as a Warfare officer, as I would oversee navigating the ships when the captain isn’t on the bridge, therefore I’d be responsible for the safety of all the crew onboard. There are other parts of it that I think are interesting, but I can’t really be bothered to write about them now, as I’m rather tired after being at work all day, and just ingesting a copious amount of KFC!
So, what is the other option I’m considering then? Well, it’s to start up a business and become an entrepreneur. I don’t mean selling stuff on eBay to make a few quid, I mean start something that can really make a difference and grow it as much as I can. I’ve been listening to the Richard Branson autobiography audio books lately, and he has inspired me greatly in the way to look at business and how to conduct myself in that environment. If I’m quite honest, I haven’t got a clue what I would start a business in, but I think for me to keep an interest in it and have that want to grow it, I would have to be passionate or really enjoy the product of service that I’d be selling. I feel that my uncertainty of what I’d start the business in is the biggest con that I found for this option, as I don’t know how long it would take me to think of something, however I feel that it’s a direct counter to the biggest con of the Navy, I’d have my freedom. I’d be able to do exactly what I want, and I’d be able to be with my gorgeous girlfriend and probably move in with her sooner than we thought. 
What am I to do? On one hand, I could join the Royal Navy, have good fun going around the world, but I’d be away from my loved ones for long periods at a time and I’d lose my freedom in the process. Or do I give entrepreneurship a go and try and find my way in the business world, which could lead to a lot of stress and could be a failure if I can’t think of an idea that I want to push forward with or could set me up brilliantly to make a difference in the world and make a few pennies along the way.
I’ve just read this through again and I can’t help but think that I’m being slightly one sided in not wanting to join the Navy. It may be that I’ve just listened to some more of Richard Branson and I’m pumped to start a business, or it could be that I don’t actually want to join the Navy, I can’t decide, which is a terrible trait for any leader, indecisiveness.

She was a bit annoyed, saying that everyone goes to their graduation, etc. But my university offers to just take pictures which I am completely ok with doing.

362,"So I've never been the best at asking people out. Everything else I'm fine at in terms of relationships. I can talk to anyone and I'm really sociable, but I get really nervous when it comes to asking someone out. There's been times in the past where I've been talking to girls and they show interest in me or even say they like me, but when I've asked them out they've either tried to lead me on (I learned after the first time this happened when I was about 14 to just leave them if they try and keep you on the hook) or they've simply just said that they're not interested, which is fine of course. You don't have any responsibility to say yes to someone that asks you out, but I guess from previous experiences it's made me cautious about even asking now.

I've had a few girlfriend's since I was about 15 and got out of my first serious relationship nearly a year ago. Since then I haven't been in a real relationship, but now I'm thinking of asking out this girl at work who's 25. 

Normally I'd be nervous anyway, but because of the age difference it's even more nerve-wracking. We get on great and we talk a fair amount and have a laugh together, and I get the feeling she may like me. How much so I'm not sure? We work together at the moment as I've been transferred onto her team to help out, so I've only known her for around 2 weeks, but I want to ask her out for a drink. I know she doesn't have a boyfriend from when we've talked so that's not a problem, but I have this overwhelming feeling that she is going to say no, perhaps because I'm a fair bit younger and she might see me as just a kid.

How do I go about asking her out, and if she says no, then how do I avoid awkwardness in the office as there could be some tension because after that she'll know I like her. Luckily she's only here for a couple more weeks so eventually that wouldn't be a problem, but it's still terrifying to me.

367,"Not usually the questions you see on his sub, but I really could use help.

I’m a female in my 20’s. I have had long hair for almost all of my life. Recently, within the last few years, my hair has been thinning and falling out more frequently. The same thing happened to other women in my family at this age, so I’m not super worried about it, as all of those women still have their hair, but I think it has something to do with my hair care routine.

I wash my hair probably every other day, and only condition every week or so. I have very oily hair and so using conditioner every time I wash would make my hair appear constantly greasy/wet. 

I also wash my hair with the cheapest store brand shampoo because that’s the most inexpensive. Plus, women’s shampoo can be waaaay overpriced and I don’t want to spend that money (with long hair, I have to use more shampoo and can run out pretty quickly). 

So, I guess I’m here to ask — is it worth it to invest in better hair care products? What is a hair care routine that might bring back thickness or strength to my hair?

Any luck someone has had with store-bought products, or at-home remedies is welcome.

368,"I do graphic and web design for a small business (&lt;15 people) in my home town for nearly a decade. It is my first and only job and I'm very loyal to our boss who is a great guy. I actually work remotely nearly 12 hours away in a different state and then I work in the office when I'm in town visiting. It's a great setup honestly. I don't make great money, but it's very low stress and I get to work from home.

My boss has confided in me that he's all but confirmed selling the company to an ad agency that we've worked very closely with for years and years. My job and remote position are, as of right now, secure. The ad agency knows me and wants to keep me on (as well as most of our staff, including our boss). However, they have a very different office environment; it's very competitive with a lot of drama and infighting, while my current company has none of that. We'll actually remain a completely separate legal entity and the potential-owner has indicated that they'll try and keep the more relaxed atmosphere, but I worry it'll ""leak"" over (especially since they're right across the road from us).

I'll definitely wait until the dust settles before deciding if I truly want to stay on of course. And the buyout has some perks, like a 401k, better benefits, and more potential earning. But it definitely comes with some downsides: more structure, micromanaging, drama, less flexibility, and just a more rigorous office set up I guess you could say.

This also seems like a perfect time to start looking around. Obviously I could look for other design work in my state and I definitely will, but in the past I've also put serious thought towards changing directions. I wouldn't mind a change of pace, but I don't have any other work experience and my degree is in design.

What I really love is making children's books. I'm good at and enjoy it, but I have a hard time working on them after having already spent 8+ hours at my computer that day already. If I could find something out of the house and not at a computer, I'd be able to devote more time to it.

I just don't know what kind of stuff to even consider. I love nature and animals and gardening. I've always loved the idea of working in a greenhouse so that's something I'll consider. Or with animals. Or just some kind of trade job or skilled labor that I could learn.

 Being with my friends doesn’t feel the same anymore. I feel as if I’ve grown into a very passionate person within the last year or two. I’m pretty much a cliche artsy kid. I create all types of art from music to visuals. 

 Now my friends want to participate in the music and we’ve worked in the past and have been pretty successful. However, lately I feel as if they lack passion and motivation. They don’t want to create nearly as bad as I do. They’re more in it for the whole “get rich and famous” thing whereas to me, it’s a form of therapy. 

 Besides that, I feel as if I’ve grown into a completely different person than I used to be relative to my friends. Everything feels so dull. I can’t talk about my breakup with them because that’s just not how our dynamic works. 
 
 I constantly ask myself what should I be doing right now. It’s currently 7:06 PM where I am. Just got home from hanging out with them. There’s still daylight. I want to do something productive, not sit in a room while each of us is being completely separate on our cellphones. 

 Since the breakup all I want is human connection. I can’t find it anywhere. 

 I think about my ex going out and having fun, doing her thing. She’s happy to be away from me. Yet I sit around all day not knowing how to be a person. I know part of this is my ego talking, and I know things will work out eventually. I just need some direction right now.

370,"WARNING LONG!


So for the past two months, our neighbor got another dog and this dog just barks all day. Recently, my semester ended so I have been home and can witness this dog barking all day. (I would have a job but I am waiting to get my nursing certification and the testing dates took forever to schedule.) This dog just barks non-stop all day. If we let our dog outside to lay out or do his business, the dog is at the fence barking. It gets worse when my parents come home and the whole house is opened up. The bark is loud, mean and aggressive. It isn't a friendly bark. Just now I sat at my patio and the dog barked for a straight ten minutes. Maybe I wouldn't be as angry if this neighbor didn't have a history of not taking care of animals. Two incidents that just make me so frustrated.


She also has like a little yorkie dog. One day in the WINTER, my mom was leaving for work and the yorkie managed to get out and was in the street in COLD, DECEMBER weather at around 7:30 in the morning. My mom hand to grab it with a towel cause it kept biting her and place it back in its yard. Second instance is that throughout last summer, this dog would dig holes in the fence line and find her way into our yard. Maybe she was digging holes cause she was kept outside for so long! This is just with the yorkie who barks alongside with the super loud one I described earlier.


I am really frustrated because I hear this dog all day and all night. It barks from about 5 AM to 11 PM. The worst part is, the neighbor is home all day! She just leaves them outside. 


My issue I run into is that I am just a 20 year old boy. This is my parents house. I'm about to get my nursing assistant license and hopefully will not be home to hear this dog bark during the day. I am wondering how should I tackle this. My parents are definitely annoyed and I think they would agree that we should contact the city. I even checked our city ordinances and there is one under ""Animals"" that says: 


""Harbor any animal which constantly cries, barks, or makes other loud noises, or is an annoyance to the neighborhood or persons passing to and fro upon public streets and highways. Any person who fails to maintain adequate sanitation for any animal may be cited by authorized agents of the city for maintaining a public nuisance.""


I guess I answered my own question but I just wanted some advice because this should probably be my parents issue, but once 5 AM hits and my mom is up, I can hear her complaining about that dog. I feel like maybe I should stay in my 20 year old lane but this neighbor should not have dogs. It may be too late to bring this up but I think she only has them cause she has two daughters, but she only gets them like every other weekend from my observations.",25May2018,1

372,"There's this girl at work that I like and there was a time this past Fall when one of her friends told me that she was planning on inviting me to be her date to her sister's wedding. Around that time, this girl was giving off pretty obvious signs that she was into me, like constantly helping at work, saying hi/bye to me all the time, constantly staring at me, etc. She would also refer to me by my nickname, Ty, as opposed to my real name, Tyler. This is a nickname that most everyone at work calls me by. As it turns out, though, her sister's wedding ends up being cancelled because the groom got cold feet and left the bride.

In the couple months after the wedding and her plan to invite, she still keeps calling me Ty, but around March is when she suddenly starts calling by my real name. She'd call me Tyler and I was thinking in my head as to what it could possibly mean. Could it mean that she doesn't like me anymore and she just wants to keep things formal at work, meaning she's using my formal name now? For March and April, she'd still call me Tyler, but she'd also give off the usual signs that she likes me. But this past week, she goes back to calling me Ty.

Does any of this mean anything, at least from the perspective of how she feels about me? She seems to change up how she refers to me and I'm driving myself crazy trying to interpret what it means.

377,"Yo so I had a super lucid dream where I had a sex change (I had to, the killer was only taking out men and I didn't want my penis to be bit off) anyway it was done by a pretty bad surgeon and my vagina was a bit odd but this whole experience begs the question 

Should I get one just 2 see what it's like then change back if I don't like it, could they freeze my penis and sew it back on after?",25May2018,0
378,"I am posting again about that guy I met because I remembered he said something that kinda irked me and I don’t know if this is just me or whatever

The first part is here if you want to know the background and a bunch of details https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/8kj8vx/how_can_i_accept_rejection_and_just_move_on/

Anyway, I started liking this guy I met online but he rejected me because he finds dating a waste of time and he has 'really high standards' for the girl he wants to date etc

(If you read the original post there are more details though)

It's perfectly fine to reject someone who acts you out/wants to date, whoever they are but then he said something that irked me and I could tell why.

He told he also rejected a few girls who asked him out (idk how much he knew them actually) and he didn't care much about it (he said something like 'I don’t like breaking someone's feelings but I cannot lie') and he reacted coldly when I told him I liked him.

In our last convo, while we talking about the topic of dating in general he told me 'It's hard for the average guy to get a girl they like here, rules are really strict and if a girl says no it's no, they are generally proud' or whatever 

I don’t get this logic tbh, you are allowed to reject every girl who express interest in you online or in real life because you have high standard or dating is a waste of time for you but at the same time if a girl rejects you (maybe for the same reasons), then she is 'proud' and 'it's hard to get a girl you like'

Does it apply gender reversed then? 'It's so hard to get a guy you like, if they are not interested then no is no'

This sounds contradictory to me honestly...am I overthinking?

379,"It's been 16 months since I've been myself. For the first few months after I met him I felt like a better version, more happy &amp; hopeful. I thought it was my time to feel what true love actually was like. I was so happy.

I was so happy that I pushed down that intuition, that gut feeling, the things that didn't add up or feel right. I let him soothe my mind with his words ""I've never loved someone like I love you.""

I remember the shift I felt when things suddenly were not okay. I realized I hadn't seen my friends in months, and all of the ""jokes"" he made about me were never actually funny, they were just mean. I wanted him to stop pretending like he was going to hit me or charge at me in public. Something wasn't right.

Timelines between his last relationship and our relationship were no longer adding up, I discussed with my therapist. After reading a numbered list of things he did that made me feel less...she suggested I press him for answers. ""Don't let him make you feel bad for wanting the truth.""

One night he got a call and proclaimed he didn't know why a unknown number would be calling him so late at night. I asked him to answer it. Before I knew it he was in the other room. It was his ex, and that night I found out not only had he been hiding calls from her, but that early in our relationship he told someone else he was dating that we were in a open relationship. This was a open relationship I never consented to. He didn't give me a choice.

God I can't tell you what the next 9 months were like. He yelled at me for feeling suicidal even though he told me to confide in him if I ever felt that way, he pulled my car on the side and the road and got out and walked away after I told him her was being controlling because he tried to tell me what to wear that day. And then one month after my mom died I found out there were so many more lies. He had cheated on me at least 7 different times with multiple people, and indeed the timeline between his last relationship and ours was completely false.

I tried to leave last week to stay with a friend but was barraged by texts from his friend saying that I had been the abusive one and that he was going to call the cops on me. When I asked my boyfriend to explain what was going on he said ""why does it matter if you are leaving, he can think what he wants"" And so I had to stay in order for him to give him friend even a washed version of the truth. If I leave he will tell people I'm abusing him, even though he is the one abusing me. I've been captive.

In secret I've applied to a apartment and I've gotten accepted. My move in date is July 1st.

It's going to be so incredibly hard to get away from him, and to convince myself he is not worth this. I want to feel like myself again, I want to love myself again. I want to be free of lies. I want to believe there are people out there who will love me and not lie to me. I want to believe there are good men.

Please, please tell me I am doing the right thing this time.",25May2018,1
381,"Tl;dr: My aging mother (65) has no job prospects, no money, no life experience, nowhere to turn except to me, her underemployed only child.

She and my father have had a Typical Marriage for 29 years in which she worked out of the home for several years and played the ""wife and mother"" role for the duration. He kept their finances more or less secret, he paid all of the bills and made all financial decisions, he was in charge of any retirement funds etc. She has arthritis in both hands and knees, poor hearing, and slowly declining sight, and didn't graduate from high school, so she has been unable to work for a few years and will not be able to work in the foreseeable future.

At best she is looking at 30k plus 2k/month alimony. (I don't know how long the alimony will last.) I am the only family who will be capable of helping to provide for her, but I am 28 and underemployed. I love her and she is a sweet, well-meaning woman, but she is essentially a child. When the divorce is finalized she will be depending on me more than she should, and she is coming to realize this. She has basically told me that she will do whatever I ask of her, whatever I think is best.

SO. ... What the fuck am I supposed to do? There just is no way that this money will last her until death. She would have to find the /perfect/ job because of her disabilities, and even that could only last so many years. She's turning 66 this year, so she just can't be working for much longer.

My only thought is to use the 30k to buy her a nice trailer to live in and use her alimony to pay for me to finish college. I would get a degree in nursing and then continue my studies to become a midwife. I could reasonably expect to make ~100k/year, which would be enough to support her and myself with the added bonus that when it comes to end of life care I will be a RN and can ensure her medical needs are being met. This is honestly the only plan that I have come up with that has a longterm component to it. Every other plan boils down to ""and wait for the money to run out.""

Any advice or general support would be appreciated so so much. She is still a few years away from being ""elderly"" in the truest sense, but the time is coming on and I feel completely unprepared.",25May2018,2
