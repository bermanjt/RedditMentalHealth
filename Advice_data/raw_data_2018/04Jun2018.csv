2,"Sorry if this gets long.

So back in the beginning of February, my sister \(18\) ran away. She had failed a drug test at school for pot a month before and had been put on a sort of probation by the school and by my mom. They were going to test her again but my mom wanted to do one on her own to know if my sister was still smoking it and my sister failed that one. A huge fight broke out between them. The very next day, she packed a bag and left without saying anything to anyone. Just walked out the door and left. She left a note on my mom's bed leaving snarky comments about how she's always being compared to me and my brother \(I'm the oldest at age 23 and she is the youngest\) and that she doesn't want to be a part of our family. We finally figure out that she's staying at a friend's house and she stays there for the next month, coming back to our house for just a couple things like clothes and stuff but we only let her come in when someone else was in the house. When she came back, things were really tense and I was really pissed off at her and still am. My mom is a single mother who I feel like has given up a lot for me and my siblings and I feel like my sister doesn't realize that because she was too young to remember what it was like when my mom and my step dad \(my brother's and sister's biological father\) got a divorce.  


My sister has always been very emotional and will be fine for a little bit but will quickly turn into a straight up nightmare at the drop of a hat for no reason. My grandmother has been diagnosed with BPD and I've started to wonder if my sister has it, too. We don't really have a lot of money and my mom and sister both don't have any health insurance so it's hard to get my sister in to see a doctor and get her medication.  


The biggest problem is that since she came back, I feel like none of us are allowed to say anything to her about her unacceptable behavior. My mom especially just wants to try and forget that my sister even ran away and doesn't want me or my brother fighting with her. But she stays home all day now that school is out \(she's hopefully going to get enough financial aid to go to a university where she will live in the dorms but we haven't found out for sure yet\) and she has a boyfriend that she was secretly seeing before she ran away and they just spend all day at our house not doing anything. This boyfriend is 22 and was friends with my brother before my brother found out they were dating and now wants nothing to do with him. This boyfriend also has a kid that he doesn't really see. The whole time him and my sister have been hanging out at our house, he's only had the kid with him once. He supposedly also has a job and yet he is always at our house and eating our food that my mom pays for \(again, money is tight in our family\). My mom has tried to tell my sister that she needs to get a job but my sister is barely trying, just waiting for a babysitting job to fall in her lap or something. My sister also makes messes and never cleans them up \(for instance, she left a soda in the freezer too long and it exploded and she just left it in there for someone else to take care of\). And the worst thing is that sometimes she will sneak into my room and steal stuff. It usually isn't anything that important, like an air freshener or some clothes or something, but it still bothers me. A couple weeks ago, I noticed that I was missing my copy of Overwatch. My sister likes playing the game and has asked a couple times if she can play it since she's gotten back, to which I have always said no because I am still angry with her. So when I noticed that it was missing, I asked her if she took it. She said no. She doesn't have a PS4 of her own, but I still thought maybe she took it just to spite me. Today, I come home and she has a PS4 in her room that her boyfriend supposedly gave her as a graduation present. And what's inside there? My copy of Overwatch. And I know it's my copy, despite her trying to say that her boyfriend bought it for her. This bothers me a lot more than the last times she's taken stuff because it's the first time she took something and then lied to me about it when I asked her. And she still is trying to say it isn't mine, so she has every intention of keeping it. But of course, I can't press the issue because it stresses my mom out and my sister will have a meltdown. Am I taking this too hard? I know it's just a game, but it bothers me to think of what else she might steal and it upsets me that she would even steal from me in the first place. I've put a lock on my door that needs a key but sometimes it gets unlocked from my brother and he doesn't always lock it back.  


I want to say something to my sister, but I don't want to upset my mom who tries to make excuses for her by saying she's young and hormonal.  


tl;dr: I feel like my sister is selfish, ungrateful, lazy, and a thief with a loser boyfriend but I can't say anything because it stresses my mom out. How can I survive until she hopefully leaves for school and what do I do if she ends up having to go to community college and stays at home?",04Jun2018,3
3,"Long story short.

I recently fell hard for a girl which I won't see for at least a few months. I'm estimating at least a year to be honest. She went to study abroad for a year and left &amp; now I'm stuck here at home.

Today I talked to some friends and I thought about telling her that I have feelings for her. The thing is though, I don't know her really well but I've tried just getting over her (or the idea of her, cause as said - don't know her too well) but that doesn't seem to work because we text every few days/weeks.

The way to end it or at least help my feelings of sadness would be to tell her how I feel and have her say ""ok nice thanks buddy"" (that's the 99% chance) or ""yeah same"" (1% chance).

Does anyone agree that I should tell her so I have a 99% of just getting closure that it'll never work out with her? I keep daydreaming about her and think about her daily, now after we texted again.

I'm also seeing someone to help me become more aware of my feelings and stuff, so that's a problem already being tackled.

any help or advice is appreciated! Thanks in advance and for reading :)",04Jun2018,1
4,"Anyone know where I can get a pair of thin comfortable gloves that only expose the pointer and thumb fingers? I've tried looking online but they seem like very bulky sports gloves.

5,"So, started talking to this guy through tinder. I was searching for a FWB. We talked about a lot of sexual interests and decided it was bound to be a good fit for both. About to exchange Snapchat info, when he says he is “kind of” in a relationship.. he says kind of because they haven’t had the exclusive talk. He mentioned our “friendship” would need to be discreet since he wasn’t exactly sure of his status. Immediately I backed up and said that if she wasn’t going to be aware that she wouldn’t be the only person he was having sex with, then I wasn’t interested. We were both pretty bummed, and decided maybe just a photo swap was not a big deal. (I was hesitant on this as well, but figured it really wasn’t a big issue... he’s really fucking hot guys.) I’m feeling pretty guilty now, because he deletes me on Snapchat when he is with her, then adds me back when not in her presence.. again, they aren’t official, but he feels he has to sneak and I feel disrespectful towards this other woman. Maybe this should have gone into the r/confessions sub instead, but I do want some advice. Am I making a big deal out of nothing, or am I a total asshole for participating in this sneaky picture show? ",04Jun2018,1
6,"I can really struggle to have fulfilling social interaction, even with my best of friends and mum &amp; dad.

The lack of connection is enough to make me feel like poo as you may imagine and the biggest reason I struggle is because I just can’t find anything to say. This has lead to self esteem issues because it can make me believe I really am empty without even the imagination to continue or begin a simple conversation.

Luckily, I do have times of being better at talking and am more myself where I quench my often desperate need for natural conversation with laughing and fun. These times remind me I can do it, but the mood or state required is rare (although usually accessible through alcohol [which I don’t and won’t abuse]).

Basically, I’m asking for advice to make my life feel whole again, it’s sound melodramatic but it’s always on my mind which makes me even more inward!

8,"First time poster, 
My friend’s family is very very hard on her, and I was wondering if there are any hotlines for help with dealing with difficult family members? 
Her parents seem unnaturally hard on her, and here are a few examples 

1. They told her that they’re kicking her out when she’s 18 
2. Her grandparents don’t display photos of her because they said she’s a disappointment
3. Her parents regularly call her disappointing/their least favourite child 


Thing is, it’s not like she’s a bad kid. She’s an A student and does sports and things. 
Another thing to add is this is purely from her perspective, and although she’s never been known to lie she could be exaggerating some aspects

She wants him to break up with me. She found out about us by going through his phone.

16,"He frustrates the hell out of me. We’ve been inseparable for two years. We go out 4, maybe 5 nights a week. He gets jealous when I talk to anyone else but won’t do anything about it. He sends me suggestive messages but then tells me about bumble dates. He hates when I’m not around bc he knows we’re literally perfect. If I leave early he panics. He’s protective of me- the second I say a dude is making me uncomfortable he takes care of it. Hes told our friends that I’m like family but it’s “something so much more.”

I care deeply about him. When my friend got sick I called him and he dropped everything to be there. We are in a relationship without calling it a relationship. He confides in me, I confide in him.  I’m the only person he trusts. We bicker like an old married couple. We host parties together, movies together, run together, cook together.  Our friends push us to be together bc I’m the only one that can put up with his batshit ass. Hes told people he wants to sleep with me but cant even make a move.

He won’t step up and say what’s really going on. Even when I try to...he shuts me down and changes the subject. 
 One day hell have to acknowledge that he does in fact have emotions and hell have to address them. In the meantime...

I’m done. I think the only option is taking the space I need from him so maybe he’ll realize how much I mean to him. If not, then I’m better off anyways. I’m not waiting for him to grow the fuck up anymore. What else can I do? I just don’t get the back and forth all the time. Do I have any other options?

We have placed a sign next to it warning to keep away dogs and not to walk one the ground around the hole. My mother and I are worried because the mother hasn't come back.

1. spend next year (my last year before high school) at my current school.

upsides: no new people/i already know everybody, good teachers

downsides: i’ll probably be pissed all year because i don’t like anyone there, with could lead to lots of drama and trouble and shit nobody wants to hear about or deal with




2. move to the closest school.

upsides: lots of new people, new environment, new experience.

downsides: i know some people there and they dont like me, lower rated school with lower test scores, almost too far away walk/bike ride.




3. move in with my dad in a bigger city, but this part is complicated.

upsides: my mom could regain her sanity and stop taking out her anger on me (she’d also get a break from me), totally no chances i’d know anyone there since i havent actually lived there and the population is like 350,000, new environment, new city (bigger too, alot more things to do there), many more people to talk to, may be able to repair the shitty relationship i have with my brother, more to learn since theres many more culturally different people then my current town (which is most white people)

downsides: my mom may need me here, i dont know though she isnt good at expressing emotions, the apartment my dad lives in is quite small, my mother may not be able to afford certain things without child support from my father.


NOTES:
- me and my mom can’t move cities or apartments since we can’t afford to.

- i really don’t want to stay at this school because my friends and peers are actually driving me crazy (my friends do not stop poking me, touching me, saying stupid shit, etc. and everyone else already knows alot about me, stuff i don’t want them to know like my phobias, personal issues, financial status, some leaked secrets, etc.) i can’t just ask for it to stop because ive tried before and nobody really cares. i have to take action.

- i don’t want to hurt my mom’s feelings, but i am not happy here and im sorta freaking out if it isn’t obvious.

31,"   I’ll try to condense this as much as possible—I had a crush on my guy friend for the longest time. He lives long distance but I truly valued time with him when he visited. He and I could talk for hours, and he trusted me with personal stories he had never told anybody outside of family. He made me feel safe and valued.
   We hadn’t seen each other for some time, and sexual tension had been mounting. He knew I was a virgin, and asked if I wanted to have sex. Wanting him to be my first and feeling most safe and comfortable with him at the time, I accepted. He was excellent—he took his time to hold me, making sure I was okay the entire time. He didn’t roll over to check his phone afterward—he cuddled with me and was very affectionate. I was aware that he wasn’t looking for a relationship and was okay with that for the most part, but I did think he liked me. He made it clear that he wanted to sleep with me again in the future.
   Nowadays the meaningful conversations are gone, and he snubs me if I want to know about how he is doing or send him something I think he would like. The last time I heard from him, all he wanted to talk about was lewd sex. I know he expects to have sex again in the future, but he doesn’t enjoy talking to me anymore.
   I’m okay with not being his girlfriend. That’s all right. But I really did value having a connection with him, even on a platonic level. I liked listening to him and hearing his stories. I liked being a more meaningful figure in his life than a piece of meat. I’m trying not to let it hurt, but it really does. Badly. I’ve been trying to keep myself distracted by seeing girlfriends, exercising and teaching myself new skills. Because I still think he’s a beautiful man and still do have those pesky biological urges, but am aware that in the long run, it will hurt me further if I allow it to continue. I don’t want him to be upset with me if I tell him that this is painful for me and that I cannot be sexually involved with him anymore. What would you do?",04Jun2018,1
32,"I'm not going to include a TL;DR for this because if anyone really wants to give me advice, I want them to read through this all.

I'll start off with who I am. I'm a high school student, graduating in June, who lives in Canada, Ontario specifically. For my entire high school life, I've been pursuing Computer Science, and I told myself that I wanted to go to University of Waterloo (google it if you don't know what it is, popular CS uni) for Computer Science, and I told myself I'd take a co-op program so that I could get work experience.

I've been fine most of my life, I've had high averages, usually in the top 5 of my current high school (around 95s), until this year came around. My last year, I kind of lost all motivation in a way.

I had 97s in math before. Now in the two math courses I have, Advanced Functions and Calculus, I'm averaging 70. I retook course to boost my average to get into unis, but all the universities that I originally applied to deferred me to programs that were irrelevant to the original study (University of Toronto deferred me to physical sciences, Waterloo deferred me to Geomatics, McMaster completely rejected me).

I applied to Ryerson University in late January as I saw my marks were seriously low, and that I needed a backup most likely. I've been put on their wait list, even though I have around an 85 average, because their program was full since I applied so late.

So here I am now, I didn't accept any of the alternate offers I was given, and am waiting on the Ryerson wait list. It just hit me that, if I don't get accepted, I have no back up plan. I'm applying for jobs, and considering taking a gap year, and today I thought to myself, what if I don't want to go into computer science. Here's where the information gets a bit more personal.

I have a strong passion for video games. Everyone likes video games, but I'm very competitive. I played League, peaking in Challenger (highest tier in the game if you're unfamiliar with it), before dropping ranks and I stopped playing completely. I played Overwatch, reaching Diamond in pretty much the first week I played, and I also stopped playing that game. I played PUBG, Fortnite, all the new popular games, and I'm way above average at all of them, but I just lack the motivation to pursue further in games. I told myself I'd become a popular streamer, and make money like that, but I don't have the motivation to aim towards this. I tried it, and it got me nowhere.

So here I am now. I'm graduating in a month, and I won't know what to do. If I don't get off that waitlist, I have no future planned. I don't have the motivation to pursue something I have a passion in, and I don't know what to do anymore.

33,"I'm twenty two and I'm really starting to realize I have issues but I don't know whats causing them?

A) I don't enjoy anything and its not like I hate the things I'm doing, its that I just can't enjoy them. It's like everything isn't good enough. I want to enjoy this stuff so much, but when I do them, I just can't. I'm always waiting for the next thing/person that is going to interest me or change everything.

B) My mind thinks itself in knots. I just question everything and relate it back to me somehow. Let's say I was watching a movie there was a makeout scene, I would start thinking "" Hmm, I wonder if I could do it that good? I wonder if I'm a bad kisser and don't know it. Ok, lets look up a video on how to kiss right so you are even doing it right in the first place. ok, they seem to opening there mouths a lot, ok, look on google for the question ""Do you open your mouth a lot when making out"". It depends? No. I need a solid answer, I can't have this grey area. Ok, look up, whats the best way to makeout?. And it just keeps going from there and there  are lots of tiny triggers that set this off and I can't control it. I just can't control it. Sometimes it goes so deep, that the only way I can explain it is like the movie Inception.

B) I'm always in a state of discontent. It's just like my mind knows something is wrong and its always trying to figure out what the issue is.

""why am I not able to enjoy this like others? What is wrong with me? Is it because I'm thinking too much like right now? Or maybe its because your depressed or something? Or you know, maybe its ADD""

I don't feel miserable at all, but I just always feel ""off"". This feeling of knowing something is wrong with me, but I don't know what can make me sad, frustrated,irritable, etc


I have been like this my whole life, however, when I was 12, my problems just tripled overnight and I've been trying to figure out why I just feel off all the time.",04Jun2018,1
34,"Background: Last year this girl with a boyfriend (since middle school, we’re now mid college years) hit  me on my twitter DMs about some politics (I’m a political junkie), we got to talking, we started sharing music when we found to have similar music tastes, then we started sharing memes, talking about our goals, giving life advice, sharing professional opportunities, anything relatable, etc. We get a long very well, and we ended up adding each other on Snapchat and Instagram, through which we talk just about everyday as well.  We also shared each others phone numbers but continue to communicate through social media. Eventually her boyfriend hit me up to play in his band, which I did and I  also wrote a song with his band and played a show with them (to which she came through to watch). I’m pretty observant and I just noticed that they didn’t really seem to be enjoying their company all that much.  I don’t know much about their relationship dynamic.

As the girl and I have gotten sort of closer, we’ve shared deeply personal experiences and so we eventually hung out and it was chill, I’m not really expecting to hook up with her or anything and still am not — and wouldn’t because she’s in a relationship. Since we’ve hung out we’ve been talking quite consistently till very late every night, and we’ve made plans to hangout again. Our plans this time would constitute a date if she was single. 

I don’t really know what to make of this situation. Again, I have no expectation about it, everything between us has remained platonic and I’m fine with that, but I just have a feeling that if she were single, this platonic relationship would easily escalate into something more. What do you all think? I’m definitely not going to make a move while she’s in a relationship, but is there a way for me to bring this up without looking like an idiot or home wrecker? Is there anyway she is or isn’t into me?? I’m quite lost. I’ve never found myself in a position like this. ",04Jun2018,1
35,"This post is created in order to hear the opinions of other people, since I myself can't come to the right conclusion and I'm too young.

I’m 21. I stand in the way of choosing two directions in life. Be an entrepreneur or be an artist (music producer). I'm have potential in both directions.

I am convinced that in order to become top 1 in a certain direction, it is necessary to invest in it completely (maybe 80%+ time). I can also combine them, but I will quickly get tired.

At the moment, I make good money on my job. Every month I spend 10% of that money so I have enough to have a good life and do whatever I want (hobbies).

What I want from life?

1. Financial freedom

2. Interesting life

3. People around me (not to be lonely)

Here is the pros and cons of both directions:

Why music?

1. You are a creative person, you are something magical for the rest

2. Girls (because lack of them now and in childhood)

3. Working with creative and interesting people

4. Interesting life

5. Travels.

Cons of music:

1. You can’t do it whole life if you not top tier artist, always it’s just you make 1 music hit and than artist «die»

2. Money (after 3-5 years of course there will be more, but it's too much time)

3. The schedule of life (tours).


Why business?

1. Financial Freedom

2. Money, it’s like a game, scores = money

3. My brain works like «I’m an entrepreneur»

4. Travels (because money)


Cons

1. Boring

2. New friends, meeting with interesting people (I think they will be very few)

3. Girls.

Now I am  21 years old, my brain works like I'am 30+ years old (thought about everything (""life"")), but I want to have fun like a 18 year old. It's strange.

On one hand, if I choose to become an entrepreneur, maybe! I'll regret that I did not try to become the top 1 music producer. On the other hand if I choose music, then I'll actually come to the same money as entrepreneur (in 3-5 years), but it's a long way and I think I'll get bored of being on tour and travel to other countries only for 1 night to play my music here and so when I'm become top 1 music producer do I really gonna need these tours and popularity, will not I get tired of it in the process of 3-5 years ?

I think the right decision will be to make a good passive income and make music. But then I will be top 1 not in 3-5 years, but much longer. And do I need it at 30+ years? I don't think no. Maybe I wrong.  

So I decided to write my thoughts here, maybe someone came across a similar choice in life and regrets something ... I would be interested to hear you, thanks!

Is this weird? Don’t most people lose their virginity around this age?

Also, I want sex. Like super badly. I’m torn between waiting for the one and just fucking going at it in college. My friend said I should get experience and have fun as a kid and then settle down when I’m older. Not sure what to do with this situation either.

40,"I made my account just to ask this question.

I recently started a new job as a portrait artist (I do art so I thought this would be enjoyable work) at an amusement park that only pays 75 cents above minimum wage at 8 dollars an hour. I was under the impression that it was part time work. On the ad they claimed it was a part time position they were hiring for and that is what I was looking for for the time being. I don’t have another job but I help my grandmother who has dementia with getting groceries, house cleaning etc. so I was originally intending for the job to be nothing over 25 hours per week.

At the end of my first day my boss asked for my availability until June 10th, I said it was pretty open, but I think that may have been a mistake now. She sent out the schedule a few days later and I am working 5 days a week for 9 hours every day! (While my coworkers are working 6 hours shifts 3 or 4 days) Not only does this cut out most of my day but my commute is 30 minutes both ways. So I am effectively spending 10 hours out of my day either going to or being at work. This means my grandmother is on her own for most of the day, which worries me. I have kept my mouth shut for these first few days but I have also been sick with pneumonia and I don’t dare ask if I can have a day off. 

I would really like to ask my boss if I could reduce my hours to 3 days a week or 6 hour days instead of 9 hour days, but I’m afraid of what will happen. I know I could explain the situation but then I look like an idiot because I claimed I had “open availability” and I technically do as there isn’t a set time I have to be with my grandmother but I would like to have some time during the day to help her. 

As it is I wake up at 6:30 am to get ready to leave for work at 8, I drive to work and get there around 8:30 - 8:45 (depending on traffic) which gives me some time to get the stand set up. I get off of work at 6:00 pm but only leave the park around 6:30 and I get home around or after 7 pm. I eat something when I come home and then by the time I’m finished it’s already 8 pm and I can’t really do anything or run errands for my grandmother or even myself! Then I got to sleep around 11. Which leaves me with 3 hours at home.

This would be okay if I wanted a full time job, and certainly if the job paid well... but i don’t and it doesn’t. I’m considering quitting if I can’t work up the nerve to ask for different hours.

I’ve only been at this job for a week... is it even worth it to ask for fewer hours and explain the situation? It is wearing me down pretty quickly, but I can’t afford to lose the job as I have nothing else lined up. Is it acceptable to ask for fewer hours or 25 hours per week? They are hiring on new staff so I don’t know when they have them working because I am literally the only person there every day the entire day and I see no one else. My coworkers only work 2 or 3 days a week and that is what I thought I’d signed up for as well. ",04Jun2018,2
41,"I am an engineering student. I have a good GPA but have had absolutely no Internships and feel like I don't have enough marketable skills that would help me in the job market. I feel like my GPA is the only thing I have going on for me.
I am scared I won't find a job after graduating, and I cannot find anyone willing to take me on as an intern. Every time I apply they ask me about my past experience and previous internships I've had. Like, that's why I am here because I have not had an internship and I need to start somewhere, but apparently that doesn't apply anymore.

When I was together with my ex, which was about a year ago, he would get up everyday at around 9 am to get ready for work. This always ended up waking me up which I didn’t mind at the time. But then even after we broke up I kept waking up at these times.

Like i can go to sleep at any given time 4 am, 11pm whatever and I will always wake up at 9 am still. It‘s not even that I feel well rested after I wake up, my mind just feels to conscious to go back to sleep

There off and on through my childhood, would frequently try to turn me against my mother etc just trash all around.

46,"I recently just got hired (about 2 weeks ago) at a retail department and it's my first job ever. Usually, I get called and asked if I could pick up shifts and plan out my week or am told my schedule when I arrive at work but was not told anything about working today so I just assumed I had it off. 

I just now got a call from my assistant manager asking me if I knew I was supposed to work from 5pm-11pm today and I said no.

47,"I'm going through a painful breakup and everyone in my life is telling me that I need to start loving myself. I was fairly dependent on this person and he dumped me due to my drinking problem. My confidence and self worth are pretty low, but I want to change that. 

For those of you who once did not, what changes did you make to start loving yourself? ",04Jun2018,2
48,"My boyfriend swore to not be the drinking type, but once partying for the first time he is taking shots. Mentally I know this is completely acceptable, but emotionally I have been trained by my environment to know how bad it is. My mom is an alcoholic and is very toxic, I had to cut her off recently. From seeing how bad she is with it, I decided to never drink out of fear of being an alcoholic too. I never had a desire to, except a few times. Once I sipped wine coolers with friends but it was a very controlled setting with people I was comfortable with, and knew that I would under no circumstances get hammered. 

Now he is drinking and having a good time, but I am not only wishing I was there, but I am full on panicking about him drinking. My heart is racing, I feel like I will cry, my chest burns like when you try holding back tears, I feel nauseous, I have been out since 7th grade, and to adulthood all of my bi friends and I have had things for each other. Especially when you get really close to them. Hanging out all the time, telling each other everything, emotionally and sexually. Changing around each other. In some friendships we were fine being naked around each other. I am not sure if this is just me, but all of them have been this way. 

One friend I had a really big crush on but it wasn’t reciprocated and it was devastating. I was genuinely wanting to date her long term, but that simply wasn’t the case (thank god, looking back on it). I had to cut her off to deal with it. I lost my best friend, and romantic interest in an instant. For straight people, I feel like generally their friends and romantic/sexual partners are separate but for LGBT people its a little more blurred. So when you lose friendships or relationships, it can feel more devastating. A bigger hole is made in your life because one person was so many roles. 

I have gotten close to a friend, and as we got closer flirted a bit, considered dating, then once the infatuation of the idea cleared I realized that wasn’t what I wanted. My other friend and I have always lowkey flirted, just how we were from the beginning, and then later planned a threesome with her. She even admitted she had a crush on me initially. We are polyamorous and our partners know, but it wasn’t going to work. Also realized she wasn’t a good fit.

Its really sexy knowing that your friend who is really hot, smart, and vibes with you, also likes you a lot, but at some points I am just like, “Damn, can we just be one thing and thats it?” 

I don’t really have a point, but just my thoughts.

49,"This has been cross posted from another subreddit because I thought it might fit here as well.  

I'm a 24M and  have been taking weekly driving lessons since late February. My  instructor is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. He is very  patient and has safety very much in mind.

At that driving school, they hold driver's tests twice a month on Saturdays. While the tests *are*  held at the school, someone from the registry administers them, so any  potential conflicts of interest are avoided. Anyway, my instructor had  told me that he just might sign me up for the one coming up next, which  is June 9th, since he was beginning to sense that I was a safe driver.  Since he puts safety first, he absolutely will not sign you up for the  test unless he's absolutely sure that you're ""safe"". So, I had my heart  set on getting my license on June 9th.

However,  all hopes of that came crashing down during this week's lesson. To make  a long story short, i was at a T\-intersection and getting ready to turn  left. I looked both ways at least a couple of times waiting for my  chance to go. I saw an opening to the right so I started to go. However,  another car had come up to the left going in the ""eastbound"" direction from my vantage point. Although that car had stopped to  let us go, my instructor immediately stopped the car \(the car we use has dual brakes\) a pointed out my mistake and decided  then and there that I need more time to practice and he wouldn't be  signing me up for the June 9th test. Needless to say I was crushed  inside. Even more crushing is the fact that that had happened at the  beginning of the lesson and we were on our way to do a practice test in  anticipation of taking it. On the practice test, he said i did decently  well, but that there were too many ""little things"" to able to pass.

I'm  obviously very frustrated about this. So, how can I prove to him that  I'm a safe driver so that I can take the test so that I can get my  stupid goddamn license already?",04Jun2018,2

51,"Hi,
I'm 18 and live in the southern United States, also known as the ""Bible Belt,"" a region of the US famous for having so many religious people. My family is very religious. Catholic, to be specific.
I don't believe in God. Quite honestly, I don't really want anything to do with the church. At best I think the Church is factually incorrect and at worst I think it's a way to take advantage of people for their money (and occasionally bodies: see the countless cases of priests sexually abusing kids.) I'm not a militant atheist at all, and I would call myself more of an agnostic. I also don't necessarily have any problem with religious people-we can agree to disagree and move on, as long as they're not hurting anyone (and most religious people here are not.)
I have told my 5 closest friends that I don't believe. This is unrelated to my situation, but none of them actually believe in God either, and all except one grew up in a religious environment.
H
So here's what I actually want advice with:
I'm not sure when I can ever tell my parents I don't believe in God. They are very Catholic, and while I don't think they would ever ""disown"" me, they would be really hurt. I love my parents and I want to have a good relationship with them and I feel as if this could seriously hurt them. I am also genuinely concerned about them cutting off financial support. College is really expensive here and I want to be a doctor-that's 8 years of school and a LOT of money. They are not paying for my school entirely, not even close, but with the scholarships I have received and with me working a part time job, I will be able to afford to go to university. If they don't help me, however, I won't be able to go.
So there's my dilemma. I really WANT to tell them, honestly, just because I feel like it's important for them to know, and I am so tired of spending 3 hours of Sunday going to church, not to mention losing the money in gas I spend driving there. 
But also, what if they stopped paying for my school? I can't afford it otherwise and then I can't pursue my dream. And then what? Do I tell them after I take their money? That seems really shallow. I guess I have to tell them at some point because I don't want to raise my children Catholic, nor have a Catholic wedding. But when? I feel like I am just using them for their money and I don't want to hurt them.
Any advice would be appreciated and I am happy to provide more information.
Thank you",04Jun2018,1

53,"Okay so this is a really long story but here it goes;

I’ve been friends with this guy since middle school. Which at this point, has now been 10+ years ago. I was bullied a lot during middle/high school and he was always kind of part of that but never the main person. Even though he was mean with others around he was always really kind when we were alone. So, I started to like him. I had a crush on him for years and then finally I got over him. 

Once he realized I was over him he missed that attention and started to tell me he liked me. I wasn’t buying it. Our families were friends and so we were forced to spend time together and once we hit 16 we actually started to get close. It was a situation where we weren’t dating but everyone knew that we were both off limits to everyone else. He had lost a lot of friends bc of his attitude and no one understood why I hung around with him but I would always say that they didn’t see what I saw in him. He’s the kind of person to mess with your emotions and I never know when actually cares or when he just wants attention. 

Fast forward to about 3 1/2 years ago. He was about to go into the Army and I was about to move over seas and during that summer we started hanging out more. All the sudden we stopped talking and he shows up with a girlfriend who was a mutual friend of ours. 3 weeks after they started dating I met my now boyfriend of 3 years. Who I’m very much in love with. 

We distanced ourselves and we went on to lead our own life’s. He had a really bad accident while away and I contacted him then but other than that he never made an effort to contact me. 
However, last weekend he called me at 12 am and told me to come outside of my house. He had driven 12 hours from where he lives and showed up at my door step and confessed his love for me. Telling me who I’m with now isn’t who I should be with and that he wants me to move with him to where he lives. I was obviously really shocked and said that I couldn’t do that because I love my boyfriend and that’s who I’m going to marry. 

I want to be his friend because he really needs me but he has such a history of messing with my emotions and I feel like I’m doing something wrong by being in contact with him since he has told me all of this. So here are my questions;

1) Do I believe that he’s actually in love with me or is he just in search of the attention again? 

2) Am I doing something wrong by being in contact with him since he obviously has other intentions? 

3) He hurt me a lot when I was younger with what he would say about me, am I stupid to even try and be his friend bc of what he’s done to me?

She told him and the same day he ended whatever unspoken thing was happening between him and Lucy. After that we started to get closer again like we were before. Three days ago he finally asked me over text if what my friend told him was true. I told him yes and he said okay. The same day he confessed to my very good friend Daisy who rejected him. And so he decided to cut himself. The next day was the last day of school. This was were he and Daisy had a long talk about him cutting himself because of her. While this was happening I was saying my food byes to some friends who were graduating and leaving. Knowing we was probably never going to see each other again we all ended up crying. While I was an emotional reck he comes up to me and give me a long sensual hug multiple times. At this point I am extremely confused and don’t know what is happening. I’m am about 50% sure he’s using me as his second choice which I really don’t want to be. As much as want to hate him for dragging me through this mess I can’t and I don’t know what to do.

63,"So my mom doesn't care about me. She loves me, but is too selfish and self centered to care about anyone but herself, unfortunately.

Here's the deal: she has a shitty and abusive boyfriend who makes me really uncomfortable. He's way worse than her, and is very bad for her but she keeps running back to him and ignoring anything I say about it.

I still live with her and when she first met him she let him move in in two weeks. Not uncommon for her, but when I told her I wasn't okay with a strange man living in the house she told me that she'd already told him he could move in and wasn't going to tell him otherwise.

Over his time living with us he repeatedly made me uncomfortable and when I just told her this instead of reacting like I expected her to, she rolled her eyes and acted like I was lying. I've never lied to her about anything major in my life, so her reaction was off putting, but really sealed the fact that she doesn't care about me or what happens to me. There have been multiple instances before this that show her lack of compassion, but this really confirmed it for me. She loves me but has many mental illnesses and trauma, and at this point I honestly don't think she's capable of caring.

I need to move out because I can't take living with this anymore, her constantly having trouble with her boyfriend and taking her anger out on me. But I am juggling two minimum wage jobs and don't even make 10k a year, and I give her half of my income so I don't have much of anything saved up. So what can I do to try and get away from her?

66,"Hi All,

I'm looking for everyone's personal advice, if it's possible to shed light on a issue i'm contemplating. Last year I went to University to study to be a Paramedic, however on the course I got involved in a toxic relationship with a girl on my course who I also shared Accommodation/Dorm Living with. However, down the line with the course  I wasn't enjoying and I personally believe this is because I didn't give it  my all and didn't push myself when I was shadowing Paramedics on shifts. I also believe the constant arguing with the girl I was dating, was a factor to this as well. I'm now on leave and have one last chance to go back and start over from the 1st year of studying in September. But while I wasn't enjoying the course. I looked into 3D Game Design, and I have a chance to switch in September to this course If I want. However when talking to all my friends, who have previously studied this, the Degree means nothing in the gaming industry and it's a very competitive and job security is hard to come by.

However, Paramedic is very tough course to complete at University, but it leads to a very secure and promising degree and job after University especially in \(England\)..

P.S Bare in mind the girl  I dated last year at University lives in the hometown of the University I attend, but we are no longer  together or in contact. So she won't be a factor anymore, and she dropped out so she won't be at the University, I could bump into her in the city. also I'm 27 and i'm very scared of wasting more years of my life, and want to make sure I study and do what's best for me and my future. I also have passion for both of these Careers and  Degree's. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you all! ",04Jun2018,0
67,"I'm 19, living with my grandparents and mom. Going to college, but I've been fortunate enough to not have to get a dorm or anything like that since I live 10 minutes away from campus. That being said, I don't drive. I walk to campus every morning for classes; sometimes I bike.

Recently, I've been wanting to order some stuff online. Nothing illegal, but more specifically, er, fetishy\-type stuff \(if you have an open mind, and you'd like more details without judging, feel free to PM me\). Something you'd probably not want your close family knowing about lol.

My family is incredibly nosy, and I can never order anything without someone asking what it is. Normally, I'll order a game from Amazon, and occasionally a book or something, and I don't have any problem sharing that. However, that won't be the case this time.

It's definitely frustrating because I never feel like I have the freedom to order whatever the hell I want without feeling like I'm being inspected by the TSA whenever a package of mine arrives. This time around, I *really* don't want them finding out what I'm ordering.

So, thoughts on what I can do?",04Jun2018,1
68,"So I (m) had a very involved relationship, not labeled, with a girl for the past month. Everyday seeing each other, spending as much time together as possible before she leaves for college. (she’s a senior in high school, i’m a junior). This past Friday before she left for Prom Weekend she told me she gets very crazy when she’s drunk and anything that would didn’t mean anything,(we were extremely emotionally involved), and I expressed to her that her hooking up with someone else would kill me. I also told her that if she did I would be able to move past it (not completely true). As you can tell from the title she ended up doing it and texted me early in the morning talking about how sorry she was and how much of a mistake she made. She came over later and we didn’t say much. I sat there in silence while she cried on my couch. Once she left she started texting me saying that we weren’t exclusive and i should’ve made it clear that we were. (Even though i expressed how much i did not want her to hook up with other people). i’ve stopped talking to her for now but her friends are texting me talking about how bad she is atm and how she didn’t mean it and how she wants me back etc..

Quick summary:

I went to this seminar​ by company XYZ (if you know their name please just report them for fraud). They said you could make so much money with these types of trades and other bull shit.

I know they're​ a scam but my dad didn't see in time and gave them his credit info and signed for the amount. We have around 5 or 6 days left of the 10 day duration to cancel our oayment.

What should I do? Just cancel the card and get a new one? I'm in Canada so how long could this take or is it the same as reporting a stolen card?

71,"I've been going through a pretty rough time the past four months! I mastered out of a PhD program after a year and a half of misery and lack of support I couldn't take it anymore. I'm currently unemployed and living with my parents at the moment.  I've been applying for jobs the past two months and just went on my second on-site interview (didn't get the first one). I'm grateful for these opportunities, but I feel like I have no sense of purpose, maybe it's because there is a lot of uncertainty in my life at the moment? 

When all the school stuff started to unfold, I started to date again after a seventh month hiatus. I think feeling depressed and lonely sparked my desire for companionship/sex. Also, I think part of it may have been/may currently be me searching for validation. I've spent a lot of time working with a therapist on setting boundaries and self-awareness, but I feel like I used this as a negative coping mechanism. Anyway I've been hurt a lot by guys the past several months and have had a string of one-offs, which is very unlike me ( I only had one partner from a LTR prior to this). 

I think part of me is genuinely interested in new sexual experiences, but I think on some level I'm wounding myself.

I have felt very lost the past year or so. I was in therapy and until a month ago and have been taking Celexa (SSRI), both which have helped tremendously. I feel like I have been chasing my tail so to speak. I am aware of the problem, but am having trouble dealing with it and keep causing myself more pain and suffering.

73,"I'm not sure what factors are worth mentioning here but I believe I've analyzed myself well enough to understand why I'm so dysfunctional and self destructive. I don't necessarily blame anyone specifically for it. I totally own up to my mistakes. I certainly don't blame the people who dislike me, for disliking me. There are too many reasons I gave people to dislike me. I constantly wonder if I'm the most person blocked on FB, only a troll must have the numbers I do. 

I have made a lot progress with myself in areas I never thought I'd do better with in the past. I remain optimistic about what I can still accomplish. I continue to reach new highs AND lows. What I don't know is if I should care. If it makes a difference. I constantly shift between having faith in my optimism to just feeling suicidal and hopeless. 

I've reflected a lot on my mistakes and constantly do. What I fear is that I'm currently slowly self destructing and will continue to do so until suicide becomes like the more appealing answer.

74,"I’m graduating in 5 days. I’m super excited and ready, but not so sure about facing my classmates again. And i need advice on what to do. 

It started last Wednesday. On Facebook, i was added to a group chat called “Senior Kegger”. Okay, seems fine and dandy, just a normal ritual every class does. I proceeded to engage and talk with 50+ people in the chat about many things, from what they were gonna bring and what activities to do. I went to bed and continued with the week. Me and my friend had decided to go, and i was really excited. It was something to do with all of my friends and to socialize and stuff. The place they located it was pretty secluded and in the woods. One problem; it was down the street my boyfriend lives on. 

Now don’t get me wrong, i told him about it, we tell each other everything, and he has a past with drinking (not him himself, but family members). Him and i discussed it, and he asked me not to go, only because he knows i don’t really like that kind of stuff and he didn’t want me to get hurt. So instead, i went to his house on Saturday. Keep in mind he’s a junior so didn’t have interest anyway. 


One thing is that my boyfriends mom is very, very known in the community. Like an asb mom. She’s very sweet and all, but thinks she can spout stuff whenever she wants. My boyfriend told her about the kegger, so She has a role in the whole situation. 

The morning i went to my boyfriends house, some of the girls in my grade snap chatted me and asked me if i was going. I said i wasn’t sure and heard the party was known by parents so i didn’t wanna risk it, but they were still persistent but i still declined. In the photos i sent to the girls, i would include some of them with my boyfriend just making silly faces, so it was obvious i was hanging out with him. That is important too. 

So that night my boyfriends parents had to drop off his little sister, which required driving across the lake on the bridge that connects the two sides. They also said they were going to grab movies for a movie night, and we said bye and stuff. As i was watching him play battlefield or something, in the “senior kegger” group chat, a girl said “car accident on (the road name the kegger was on), be careful”. Me and my boyfriend looked at eachother and he decided to call his mom and let her know. I got worried thinking that it was one of the kids i know that got hurt. So i was waiting for more news, and then his mom called back and was like “oh my gosh we’re sitting in line behind the wreck and it’s so bad and there’s a fatality and life flight”. So i texted the group to let them know, and most of the kids on the way to the kegger were in the same line. So his mom gets out and starts to look in ever car, and she knows one of the girls. She grew up around her, so she tells her to go home and that “she knew about the kegger before hand”.

My phone vibrates and the girl that my boyfriends mom says “a parent knows” and then gave the name of my boyfriends mom. I was shocked. Me and my boyfriend looked at eachother like... so stunned. That hot heat that sears through your entire body just courses through me. I was mortified. 

So everyone starts spamming and my boyfriend calls her back and is like “SHUT UP” because she goes AND STARTS TALKING TO THE SHERIFF ON THE PHONE ABOUT THE KEGGER. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT WHY WHY. So I’m sitting there freaking out and texted the group “how?” because I’m stupid and i panicked. And then this bitch who i HATEEEE goes 
“abby she knows bc you lol”
I immediately start crying. I don’t know why i did, but being singled out in front of everyone sucks. Everyone believes her too because if you connect the dots, it would make sense. 

So my boyfriend calls her and starts to like yell at her and stuff. At this point people are taking pictures of her and saying “she’s right there”. But here’s the thing, every other parent knows. When she got home she was in a group text with all the other parents about it. 

I don’t know why I’m freaking out about it, i know it’s stupid, but i just don’t know. Do i go and confront people who are telling everyone it’s my fault, do i leave it alone because the kegger wasn’t even busted, or do i apologize or something? I’m just stressed and i don’t wanna go to school and see anyone even though i know it’s not my fault. I do this a lot with not being able to balance stuff, like the answer on what to do?

I've been asking her to let me cut it since seventh grade, and I'll be going into my sophomore year this fall. She knows that I'm transgender and doesn't let me cut it because of that. However, I think she's forgotten about it, as she hasn't mentioned anything about it recently. My dad is a more chill guy and won't get upset if I cut my hair. It took many months of asking my mom every day to let her cut it to my shoulders, and since then it hasn't changed at all.

The only thing that is keeping me from passing as male without testosterone is my hair and voice. I have been wanting to get short hair for a long time, I've shown my mom pictures of specifical girls with hair, and each time she says it's too 'boyish' and that it doesn't look good.

76,"My coworker, Sam, and I have been friends and coworkers for a few years. We have had minor disagreements in the past but never anything really bad or big until now.

Around December last year I made a big mistake that wasn't related to work. I have acknowledged over text (he won't talk to me in person) exactly what I did and didn't try to justify or excuse my actions. I wasn't defensive or angry. I honestly wrote what I did and gave a heartfelt apology. I told Sam that if he wanted to talk we can but I understand if he doesn't want to right now. He said to leave him alone so I've given him space this last 6ish months.

What I did was horrible and he has every right to be angry on a personal level. I have accepted that the friendship is over (I'm leaving the door open if he ever wants to reconcile) but it's affecting our time at work.

I have been pleasant (not overly sweet) and I greet him every time we are working together. He just nods and rarely responds to my work related questions or statements. There have been times when I needed his response and he hasn't given it. My higher ups do not know about the conflict and it's best that they don't know. 

I went to a mutual friend (Sarah) for advice and before I could say who I was having the issue with she interjected with, ""Is it Sam? Because I wouldn't want to be on his bad side. He holds onto stuff."" or something along those lines.

I understand why he is angry and he has every right to set personal boundaries due to that.

I had a pretty good group of friends before petty feuds and graduation killed that list. I've grown distant because I tried to keep most of them alive but no one really helped unless there was something in it for them. So needless to say, I'm in touch with hardly any of them and the small few I am, we talk once every few months and say ""oh we'll hang out"" but it's clear we probably won't.


I have 3 people I really consider friends.

1 is genuinely really good to me but he works a lot in hours that are the opposite of the ones I do so we hardly get to interract

2 started off strong but he's slowly turning worse. He makes plans he never keeps, and instead of canceling, he no-shows, he ignores all my texts and social media messages and when confronted he blames it on ""depression"" or dismisses me entirely. I try not to take it too seriously but as long as it's gone on it's hard not to be hurt.

3 is a minor friend. She and I kinda chat. She says she's always there for me but she's not, she's too busy finding new or more interesting people to talk to?


I feel so alone, I try to even make bs social media friends but I can't really. My area has no real clubs or groups I could get into without driving really far so I feel like I'm out of options.

The thought that IQ cannot be improved or that genes are responsible for 90% of my character haunts me in my nightmares.
I know such things take time but it takes too long.

read through tons of online exercises but I can't grasp it. The lecture wasn't much help either, unfortunately. 
I can't ask anyone at University because I don't have friends.

I need some advice. Im 24 years old and I live with my family who I sort of support financially.

Growing up, i've always put everyone before me and still do. I wouldn't spend $40 on myself for say a piece of clothing but if my family member needed it they'd have it in a heartbeat. I have dreams bigger than this small city i live in but my family is holding me back. Religiously I've grown up where everything I do is controlled by parents\- even now in a way.

93,"Sorry for the extreme walk of text...

So, I had a boyfriend on and off from 8th grade until the end of my first year of college. It ended because a guy I went to high school with sent me screenshots of my boyfriend, texting his girlfriend if she would like to hookup. 

I broke up with him, obviously. My heart was torn a part, he was my only guy, yeah we had a bad time keeping ourselves together but we had finally gotten our feelings in tact and we were in love..so I thought. 

Anyways, I go into turmoil over it, because he begs, pleads, cries in front of me to get me back with him. And I begin to feel regret, and guilty for breaking up with him and not giving him a chance. So I start talking to him again, we hangout a little before we go back to college but we were never confirmed dating. 

He came and visited me at school the second week in, and it was okay but I had still felt uncomfortable, like something wasn’t right here. And on my birthday shortly after he visited I asked if I could get some time and space, no communication. Because I was adjusting to a new world(I transferred to go away to school my second year.)  But he would text me everyday, looking to talk, like he was deathly afraid of me leaving him for good. 

And this continues awhile, and I would still remind him for space because he wasn’t giving it to me. And then my grandpa passed away let September and he was nice about it, but didn’t let me morn with my family, the day of the funeral he asked me to a movie or hangout, which I declined and asked to just be left alone. 

So things continue to happen like this and it gets ugly. And it’s tearing me a part, I get depressed, and upset. School work is getting effected, I’m nearly failing all my classes, I can’t focus on anything, I don’t want to even live at this point. So I tell him I can’t talk to him anymore, and he doesn’t answer me, and ends up driving all the way to my school to come talk to me. But I get scared and make him leave. 

This sends me even deeper into my depression and my anxiety, my heart hurts. And I’m just dealing with so many things, that I tell him no I can’t have this over just yet, but I need time to breathe, I still need space. Which was most likely a bad idea, because mid November I tell him I can’t do this if you don’t give me space after what you did. 

And within the spring semester I began to talk to someone and it was nice and I thought I could do this, I can move on. Until they stop talking to me and go back to their ex gf. So heart hurt again. 

Now, 7 months since I’ve had a real conversation with my ex. He will actually still text me every now and then, like on Valentine’s Day, or spring break, end of the semester, big soccer games he knew I’d watch, etc. I’m back to being torn up over it. I’m back home for the summer, and he’s all I think about. 

I have dreams about him constantly I wake up sad. And I don’t understand...he wasn’t all that great of a boyfriend, but I loved him, and there were many issues. Why am I stuck on someone who hurt me? Why do I still think about him? 

I’m not even sure I want him back, I just feel so lost...I don’t know what to do. Help. ",04Jun2018,1
94,"tl;dr - I’m a cis woman happily married to a cis man, but finally identifying as Bi. Should I tell people?

So while this has been on my mind for a while, June has really made me think about it seriously for the first time. I (27F) have always been attracted to men, and for most of my life assumed that meant I was straight. Growing up in the 90’s meant gay/lesbian characters were on tv but there was no mention of someone being bi. Even characters who “flipped” from a heterosexual relationship to a homosexual relationship were seen as just “finding themselves” and were never considered bisexual. 

In high school my best friend (F) and I were always talked about how it would be great if we actually were lesbians then we could just date each other. But we both liked boys and just figured oh well. Then in college I started having dreams/fantasies about being with another woman. A google search revealed an article that said heterosexual woman will fantasize about other women because it felt “safer” than thinking of being with a man (hindsight says that’s total BS). So again, I thought nothing of it. 

After college I met my (now) husband. While we were dating I ended up having a few sexual experiences with my best friend from high school - with the go-ahead from my husband (then boyfriend). Even then I had the idea “well this is just what girls do when they get drunk”. Well my best friend and I had a falling out. And besides the friendship, I also really missed the intimacy. And while sex with my husband is great, I still feel like I’m missing something. 

Finally I admitted to myself/my husband that I’m Bi. And my husband didn’t think much of it - classic “well girls liking girls isn’t weird it’s hot” kind of mentality. And I only discussed it with one other person - a friend of 15 yrs who is also Bi.

So I feel at odds. I’ve had other friends come out to me and I always try to be supportive but I never tell them about myself. Even my sister told me causally/hesitantly that she was thinking of asking out a girl and I was all for it. But I didn’t tell her about me. Part of me feels like I should let people know. But a big part of me feels like I don’t have the right to. I never dated a woman, I never had to handle people judging me for kissing my S/O in public. I never had to fight those battles so many LGBTQ+ have to. And now as a happily married woman, I feel like maybe it’s a moot point. Is it just attention seeking? And even if it’s not, will people see it that way?

Just had to get this off my chest I suppose. Any advice is much appreciated!",04Jun2018,0
95,"I met this girl through a club in school and I really like her. We share similar interests, she was very pretty and I swore every time I looked her direction I would see her looking at me so I though I’d try my luck and see what I could do. I organized a group to go bowling and invited her along and she seemed to have fun. I later asked if she wanted to go movie and we went to see Jumanji. A few weeks later we were going to go bowling, but stayed in a restaurant and talked for about 3 hours straight. With prom coming up I asked her if she would want to go with me. She said yes, but the next day she texted me “I want to be honest with you. With only 2 months of high school left I'm not looking to be in a relationship. If that changes things between us, I'm sorry but I really don't think we want the same things right now and I don't want to lead you on. “ Before this I texted every most days talking about whatever I could think of, but after the texts stopped and came really slowly. We went to prom and I had a great time and I think she did to (especially becoming the prom queen). She always seemed to wait for me an see what I wanted to do. I even go a slow dance or two in, but she wouldn’t make eye contact during the songs. At the after party she seemed to wait for me, but over time began to move away. This is where things go downhill. When I asked if she wanted to hang out at all she would ignore my messages and I had to get her friend to talk to her. He said that she really didn’t want to do anything with me. I’ve tried several times but I have had no luck. She invited a group to see Deadpool 2, but I wasn’t invited. I invited her on a camping trip with a group of friends and she seemed interested, but I’m afraid it will be awkward when we look at one another. She also is planning to build a computer and I was going to give her about ~$200 in parts and hopefully have her let me help so I can spend some time with her before she leaves for college. 

If anyone has the time to read this can you please help me out and give me some advice on what to do. I really like this girl and I don’t want to see her go, but I think I might be stuck in the friend zone. Should I give up and try to be just friends or keep pursuing slowly over time?",04Jun2018,1
96,"I went for drinks downtown with her last week and text her occasionally, and literally 90% of what she talks about is how she gets men to flock to her. 

She picks up random guys easily and parties hard, goes skinny dipping with strangers. Kisses men who she's known for literally 30 seconds. Always brags about how she gets guys to buy her drinks and text her. 

Like, that's cool and all. But overall, I truly don't think I want to live the same way. I mean, I do want a boyfriend but I'm also happy with my life enough to not want to go out several times a week and ""hunt"" for men. I'm fine with going out *occasionally* and doing that until I eventually find someone, but I don't get off on random attention 24/7 like she does. 

She always tries to fix me and train me to be like her in this aspect. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me, sometimes. But honestly I don't think her and I want the same things. 

Is that okay? Am I maybe lying to myself? ",04Jun2018,2
99,"In retrospect, the connection between my intense self\-hatred and a tendency to think of myself as a victim should have been an easy one to make, but somehow I haven't made it until now. 

It's definitely easier to think of myself as a helpless victim \- I can dodge any responsibility for my failings, get much\-needed social contact and validation through sympathy, and get what I want more often. But I've realized that this isn't a healthy way to think, nor is it fair to others. 

I think I think like this because I feel completely powerless to change my situation, and the attention it gets me stops me from feeling helpless or alone, if only for a short while. There's a lot of things I hate about myself, and how I live \- I have debilitating ADHD, I despise my body, and I because I can't stand myself, I've developed a fear of being in public/outside to the point where I have minimal social contact outside of my immediate family. But instead of taking the initiative to change my situation, playing the victim lets me project responsibility for my problems away from me and onto the world and my situation, so I don't have to acknowledge that they're there and fixable. I don't even know if I know how to help myself, at this point. It's a lot easier for me to pretend that I hate the world for making me this way instead of admitting that it's myself that I can't stand. 

What steps can I take to stop thinking this way? And how can I stop feeling so helpless and actually start to take initiative?",04Jun2018,1

102,"Since the class of 2018 graduated, I am technically a senior now. I can hardly believe it. 

I'm really excited about getting my senior pictures, going to college, hosting my graduation party, going on the senior trip with all off my friends, and all that good stuff. I am also really sad. There are so many people I wanted to connect with in high school, but never did. So many clubs I could have joined but didn't. It hurts knowing most of my friends now, probably will just be distant strangers in five years.

I go to a small school so I know everyone on a personal level. I can't deal with the fact that I will never see any of them again after graduation. I will never get to go to school dances, and look like idiots 'dancing' with my friends again. I'll never experience my classmates chattering and making jokes during class ever again. I can never help build a homecoming float again. I won't be able to skip class with my best friend to get ice cream anymore.  I'll never get to see some of my teachers, who I have bonded with, ever again. Most importantly, I'll have to leave my mom, and my home going to college. This really breaks my heart especially, since I am an only child, and am closer with my mom than anyone else. Things won't be as simple anymore either. It won't be like high school where teachers help you, and you can fix your 2&amp;#37; in a class up to an 80&amp;#37; in two days with extra credit. 

It's so hard to believe I am so close to being done. My heart hurts a little every time I think about it. I don't know, maybe with graduation, and watching some of my closer older friends leave, it has made me realize how  quickly  all of this is wrapping up.  I just feel so sentimental, man.

105,"So my 28 yr old sister still lives @ my parents house with her 14 yr old daughter, &amp; my mom has to work 2 jobs to maintain their lifestyles..(my dad is on disability &amp; doesn’t work). it’s tragic how much my sister doesn’t care about the people around her. She doesn’t clean around the house, &amp; she even purposely tries to leave the front &amp; back doors open so my dogs run away! My mother has even asked her to not do that because we could be fined from animal control. Also, how hard is it to shut the doors behind you?
In 2010, I found out that she dropped my dog off in the middle of a neighborhood &amp; I never found her. My little sister told me years later that she was there &amp; witnessed it but couldn’t stop it. She is just so hateful &amp; rude. My parents are still paying off the felony she got last summer, &amp; she constantly uses my mother’s debit card to get fast food/gas. I understand “helping your children”, but there comes a time when the lines are crossed &amp; it starts affecting your other younger children &amp; even your lifestyle. I haven’t been able to attend college as I wanted to because I can’t afford it by myself, &amp; when i wanted to apply for student loans I couldn’t because my dads taxes weren’t filed. I asked him to file them 2 years ago &amp; then he left jacksonville for 6 months. Didn’t hear from him once. For some reason it was very complicated to file separately because they weren’t divorced, so with all the stress of everything, &amp; depression, I never did end up going to school. My parents paid for my older sister to attend the x-ray program through college last year pretty much twice because she failed a drug test &amp; a couple classes. 
This year is the year I turn 24, &amp; I will be able to apply for fafsa without my parents. I plan on being independent &amp; to not suck my parents dry of their life/ money. It’s sad to feel such loss for people that aren’t even dead yet. I try to talk to them but they literally don’t say anything. I know none of them will change their ways. My mother is probably thinking that she wants to make sure the oldest has their feet on the ground, but my older sister has had so many chances..

109,"So to keep this brief; my (22M) fiancee's (23F) mother is from Spain. We received a phone call today from her tio that her abuelos health took a nosedive. Her parents have decided to fly all of them out at the end of the month in an emergency trip to see them one last time. My fiancee wants me to be there with her because she is taking this hard as she is close with them, and she has sent seen them in 8 years. 
Here in lies my problems;
1. I do not have the funds to just fly to Spain. I don't have a credit card and while I dont mind getting one; I'm concerned that I won't be approved in time.

2. I do not have a passport. I do not know details on the process, but I'm certain that it will take some time to get done. My other concern is that I've never left the continental U.S.

3. I just started a new job last week. While I'm certain my boss will understand and be fine with it (she is cool as hell, she legit vapes all day while she is in confrence calls and is just an all-around super chill person.) I wouldn't even be a month in at this place and already asking for around 1-2 weeks in vacation.

4. While I'm trying to learn with Duolingo, my Spanish is far from conversational. I can have choppy conversations essentially to get through a transaction at my old job and basic necessities but I would  be butchering the language at best.

5. I have never met this side of the family aside from her tio. I want to be there to support them, but do not want to be In the way and I feel that this may be worsened by the previous concern. This is me probably over thinking it but it is a worry of mine nevertheless.

Is there any advice that my fellow reditors would be able to help me with? I'm not going to try the lottery, but I'm just trying to find a way to get out there to be with/support my soon-to-be wife and her family.",04Jun2018,3

115,"I’m (21,F) am in a long term relationship with the love of my life. The problem is that I’m not allowed to date. My parents are deeply religious and would never allow that. My boyfriend is a different religion than I am so I know that would be a problem with my parents but I figured when it finally gets to it I’ll tell them. I have been a good kid all my life to them and have always listened to whatever they wanted. 

Growing up, my sibling gave them a really hard time &amp; I felt really bad so I told myself I’d lighten their load and just be compliant with them. I hardly went out with my friends because I was afraid of what might happen if my sibling and them got into a fight because it always ended really, really badly. I let them decide what I did after high school partly because I had an interest in the subject and partly because that’s what they wanted me to do. I’ve always been respectful to them and always did my best to just do whatever they wanted unless I was really, really passionate about something. 

I’m currently in school so I know that even if I say I have an interest in someone I’d be told to focus on my schooling first. When I want to hang out with my boyfriend I usually say I’m going out with friends but even then my dad will call me over and over again wondering what I’m doing or who I’m with. He has no reason to think I’m lying but whenever I decide to go out (whether it’s actually with my friends, or not), he starts texting or calling me asking why I’m taking so long or what I’m doing or something along those lines. 

The problem is more so my dad, not my mom. He is an alpha male, narcissistic man. He loves to joke around but it’s always on his terms. He thinks he is always right and it’s always his way or no way. I feel like the easiest thing to do would be to just tell them about my boyfriend but I know that I can’t do that...yet. How do I tell him to take a “chill pill”? He is very investigative so whenever he calls me or texts me when I’m “with my friends” I ignore it out of fear of what he’s going to say. He’s actually asked me to put my friend on the phone or take pictures once and since I wasn’t with her, I refused &amp; got in so much trouble when I finally got home. He does not like me or my sibling to be home alone at night and especially doesn’t like us driving either. Even me going to watch a “late” (9:30 pm) movie upset him. 

I feel horrible because I very, very rarely go out with my boyfriend because I’m afraid my dad will ask for a picture or something of who I’m supposed to be with and there’s no way that I could ever do that. I know it might sound like he has some sort of mental issue but believe me when I say he is completely fine. He’s hot-headed but definitely not sick. He’s just always trying to be  very overprotective and detective-y and I don’t know how to stop it.  ",04Jun2018,1

When I told him that my mom's breathing machine is bothering me, he said that's because people get irritated for days from drinking alcohol and it must be because I drink beer on the weekends.  But it always bothered me..

And he kept asking ""do you have anxiety?"" and I tried to say ""Well my brother has anxiety and I think his anxiety rubs off of me"" but he'd keep cutting me off and saying ""I'm not talking about your brother, I'm talking to you""

and now my family did the thing again

where my dad said REALLY loudly while drinking scotch while the kids are sleeping upstairs, ""DOCTOR [my psychologist's name here] TOMORROW, [my name which once again I wish I could say my name but someone on reddit threatened me once saying they could 'find out my first name if they really wanted to' and they kept threatening me about it, so I guess I shouldn't say my name.]""

Every time before I go, my parents and my brother keep mentioning him.

I told my parents that when I get this new psychologist (back before I got him like 4 months ago,) that I didn't want them to mention my psychologists name all the time like they did with the last one.  My parents always try to ""interact"" with me by mentioning my psychologist over and over again.

I told my mom that and she said ""STOP BEING SO HYPER [my name!!!]"" and my dad kept saying while drinking scotch, ""What was that about [my name] what's wrong with [my name]?""

My mom keeps harassing me.  I know she said that because my nephew keeps being angry and hyper and everyone keeps saying ""Hey [my nephew] er I mean [my name] sorry I always mix up your names"" and people in the family chime in saying they mix up our names all the time too, which makes me think of the one time years ago when my brother's ex-girlfriend came downstairs with an almost empty bottle of liquor of some kind, and she told me ""In your brothers eyes and mine, we both see you as younger than your Niece and she's 3 years old [well at the time she was.]"" and when my niece drew hamster drawings cuz we watched Hamtaro together, they'd always put her hamster drawings in with the pile of my drawings, I kinda assume they think her drawings are mine or something.

How do I tell my psychologist that my mom's breathing machine is bothering me, without him saying ""oh that's because four days ago you drank two beers?""  He says just two beers he gets woozy and he keeps trying to link every single thing I say to him with alcohol, and he cuts me off every time I say stuff, and he won't focus on the issues that I wish he'd help me with.

My dad loudly said ""[my doctors name]!!!!"" and I went upstairs and then he said ""[my name?]"" cuz I suppose he was upset that I didn't respond to that.  All he said was ""[MY DOCTORS NAME]!!!!!"" really loudly when the kids are sleeping, with his cup of scotch next to him, then he was mad that I didn't respond to that. 

So later I went down like I said and told my mom that I don't like when my parents constantly mention my psycholgoist's name calmly, and she loudly said to stop being so hyper and don't be ridiculous by caring about that stuff, and my dad heard my mom cuz she was being really loud about it and he keeps asking her whats wrong.",04Jun2018,1
118,"Apologies ahead of time for this being overly long, rambling and vague. My head's in a bit of a jumble right now.

Some backstory first. I'm a 21 year old Canadian of Pakistani descent. I live at home with my eldest brother, and currently my mom and one of my older sisters. My father lives and works in the Middle East, and my mother goes to live with him for a few months every year. I have another sister who's divorced and raising two kids in a town an hour away, and another older brother who this post is about.

My brother is 24 years old. He completed his Bachelors degree last year \(after needing a couple of extra years due to academic troubles\) but was unable to find work in Canada afterwards. He got an internship in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, in the fall, and currently lives there with my uncle and his family.

I've known that he's been unhappy since he went there, which surprised me because he always loved going to Pakistan, especially Karachi, and has old friends there as well. As I understand it, there's been some ongoing tension between him and my uncle \(the one he's living with\), but the specific details are unknown to me.

Last night I heard my older sister \(not the one with kids\) crying while on the phone with him. I figured they were having an argument and left them to it. About an hour later, I found my sister in the living room still talking to him. My mother was sitting next to her and writing stuff on a notepad, which my sister would occasionally glance at when prompted. I realized I should remain silent, and gestured to her to inquire what was going on. My mom scribbled something on the notepad, and passed it over to me. It said ""suicide"" in my language.

I decided to stick around and listen until the call ended, and then talked to my mom and sister. Apparently my brother had let slip to a friend of his here in Canada that he was going to kill himself very soon. That friend told my sister, who asked my brother about it. He denied it at first, before eventually coming clean. He intends to do it this month, even though he'd prefer not to since ""June is a bad month"". He's planning on getting a gun \(pretty easy to acquire in a city like Karachi\) and shooting himself. My sister asked him to wait until the end of the month, when her Masters degree will be complete and she can come visit him. My brother refused, so my sister said she was getting on the first plane to Pakistan. She asked my brother for help with the booking, but my brother kept on refusing and saying that he didn't want her to come as there was no point and she couldn't change his mind. As far as he knows, she's the only person in the family aware of his plan. Whenever my sister asked him to think of how devastated everyone would be if he killed himself, he'd just say that we'd get over it eventually. He wants his savings given to one of his friends after he's gone.

Fast forward a few hours, and my sister's on the phone with my brother again. This time it was a normal call, with my mom \(who pretended not to know anything and acted casual\) and my other brother \(who actually doesn't know anything\) chatting with him. I briefly talked to him as well and asked him when he was coming home to visit. There was a pause, and then he said he'd be coming back in July. When he said that, I suddenly found myself getting emotional for some reason, said goodbye and left the room. My brother's always been an expressive/exuberant guy, but he had this weird flat affect in his voice. He'd sounded like that earlier as well in the private call to my sister. My sister's plane took off about 10 hours ago. She's about halfway there I think.

Me and my mom are just discussing the whole situation in snippets when my other brother isn't around. We're keeping it a secret from him, my dad and my other sister, as all three are liable to act rashly if they find out, which we think might lead to him making an early exit. While expectations/pressure in my family aren't as high as is \(stereo\)typical for immigrant families, my parents do of course want us kids to do well, and so far that isn't happening for any of us save for the sister who just left. We think my brother thinks of himself as a failure, and it doesn't help that my father apparently has responded harshly to my brother's suggestions of coming back to Canada, saying that ""he wasn't worthy yet"". This btw was on a Skype call with my uncle and his family in earshot. My brother's always been much closer to my dad than he is to my mom, and takes everything he says to heart. He also has a lot of built up resentment against a lot of people in my family, which comes out during fights/arguments. I dunno if this is relevant, but he's very obsessive about certain rituals he performs \(shutting doors a certain number of times, angling random objects\), which I've always thought of as just an odd quirk, but he once vaguely suggested that it was a a big problem for him. Sounds like OCD in my uneducated opinion, but obviously I don't know for sure. My brother's always been very melodramatic, but his flat affect and matter of fact manner throughout these talks has us convinced he's serious.

Lastly, being Muslims \(as most Pakistanis are\), we're not just worried about him killing himself, but also about his ""soul"". In Islamic belief, killing oneself is basically booking a one way ticket to hell. I know most people on here might find that idea objectionable or worthy of an eye roll at least, but that's just what we believe, and I'm mentioning it because of how scared the idea has us. My brother was warning my sister on the call not to bring it up though, as he's always been very ambivalent about Islam and finds religious talk irritating. However, he is attracted to some aspects of Sufism \(basically a rather liberal and mystical form of Islam \-\- with emphasis on music, meditation, etcetera \-\- that my family avoids as we're rather orthodox in our beliefs\), so I suggested that they visit a Sufi shrine \(or other site\) in Pakistan to cheer him up. I also suggested that they cross the border to Iran, as that's a country my brother's always found interesting/appeal. Obviously, all of this is dependent on whether or not he even agrees to go along with her.

121,"I’ll try to keep this sweet and short. I’m looking for a job that pays around $15-20/hour. I don’t mind physically exhausting jobs, I am not looking for something that is food or strictly delivery based, I have a little bit of college experience, and I live in Michigan, USA (if that helps give an idea of what jobs I could go for). 


I’d like to find a new better paying  job for the moment, so I can move out into an apartment. 

Q1: What suggestions do you have in mind for better paying jobs that are not food based or having me do deliveries all day? 

Q2: What are some trade skills I could start looking into? 

I’m looking for a skill that wouldn’t require me moving out of state, or one that puts me in physical potential harm. 


Side note: I’ve been thinking about looking into becoming an electrician, but I don’t really have any experience at all in that field. That being said, I am a bit computer savvy (fast typing abilities, can function typing/photo/video/audio programs at entry level, etc.),  and I’d say I’m at an intermediate (at worst)  level of a handful of instruments. 


I just feel like the college plan is a bit of a stretch  for me. I was also attending community college, and I feel like a degree from there won’t look impressive. But if you have any ideas for degrees I could aim for, feel free to suggest any. 


TD;LR: 

Q1: What are some jobs that pay at least $15/hour that are not food/delivery related. 

Q2: What are helpful trade skills I could look into? Physically demanding is fine, but nothing that puts my life or physical health at risk.

Q3: What are potential college degrees I could consider before throwing in the towel for school? I am computer savvy and musically inclined, but I’d want to go for something practical (so please don’t recommend a music theory degree).

So. Here’s a more than likely long and incoherent paragraph that explains my situation. 

I’m a 18 y/o boy who has been in a relationship for over 2 years. It’s pretty serious. She’s deeply integrated into my family and I into hers. I love her. I really, really do (yes I realise I’ll be getting some “hours too young to know what love is, etc.). She was my first time having sex, I was her first time, and I wouldn’t change that for the world.

However the past year I’ve fallen into what seems like love with another person. Not like, ditch current girl and go to new one, more like I “love” them both. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to leave current girl. I don’t want to lose new girl. 

I’ve considered if new girl is lust not love and that may be a possibility. Current girl is my first. I’ve never had sex with any other girl. I’m curious. I know shouldn’t be but I am.

127,"As a preface: No matter how much I think about this I can't seem to organize it, so I'm probably going to do a fair bit of rambling in this post.

I don't really know how to address this. 

I am a textbook narcissist. I've never really had any solid, deep friendships. The relationships I have been in have been superficial and in the interest of physical and romantic gratification. I brag constantly. I am extremely insecure and do not like myself. I spend way too much money \(though I haven't managed to put myself into debt yet other than student\). I am always worried about what other people think of me, and I have a low level of emotional intelligence. Nothing truly bad has ever really happened to me yet I always treat myself as the victim in any situation. 

I just finished high school this year, and will be attending college the next, and I refuse to let this be how I turn out. I have been a consistently shitty person as I've grown up and I can't figure out how to get out of the negative cycle. In high school, I had ups and downs; some days were good, others not so much. I had a hard time making friends for obvious reasons, and the ones I did retain, I had multiple falling outs with. I generally got good grades, but this was mostly due to my obsession with the subjects I studied for the most part. I did the minimum amount of work to get an A, and used to manipulate my teachers, more\-so when I was younger \(in 8th and 9th grades\) than recently, to not get late points taken off. 

I grew up lying a lot. I still lie frequently. Sometimes I will tell extravagant stories — not usually about myself, but about miscellaneous things I read, sometimes the news, etc — for reasons of which I am not yet quite yet aware. I would lie to avoid getting in trouble, I would lie to get attention \(in 9th or 10th grade I told my friends that my name was Middle First Last instead of First Middle Last. Why? I don't really know. Probably to get attention, as that seems to be the usual source of my unsatisfactory behavior\). 

I don't take criticism well. Every time somebody gives me advice or constructive criticism, I argue back about why its wrong. I love to argue, and I hate that I love to argue. I instinctually turn down any outside thought as to how I could improve in any way, and I don't know why. 

I am *very* insecure. Back when I was dating, my SO was better than me at a lot of things, and *boy* did it bother me. I wish it didn't bother me like a NORMAL PERSON but it did. It was them that broke up with me, not the other way around, because I was so intensely reliant on them for approval and a feeling of significance. 

I want to stop lying to get attention. I want to stop domineering conversations. I want to stop pretending to myself that I am the smartest, the best, the most qualified and most capable. Only in the past two months or so have I really begun admitting to myself that that's what it is, but I have recognized this general pattern/stain on my being for most of my life. 

How do I fix myself? I don't want to be as lonely in college as I am now, and I don't want to live a long life with nobody in it. I don't want to act the way I do anymore but I don't even know where to begin. The internet has so far proven useless, as the general consensus is that either if you consider yourself a narcissist then you're not a narcissist \(which is obviously not true, here I am\) or that narcissism is incurable and anyone who is one is a horrible person and deserves to suffer alone. 

I'm sorry if this post seemed like I'm wallowing in my own misery or that I'm just sorry for myself, but to a degree I think I am, and that's what I want help for.

I have told him numerous times to stop coming in here to play at night and inconvenient times overall. So I stop dead in my tracks when I see this little chode sitting in my chair playing that stupid fuckin game then I’m like “really ?

3. He’s laughing at me with his friend 
4. He’s playing a game that I hate so much on my PS4

135,"I have had ongoing issues with alcohol for 15 years. When I was younger, it was drinking to excess and blacking out frequently.

138,"Well this has been picking at me for almost a month now, but anyways. Here is some background info. I’m and currently in a relationship with my girlfriend and we’re both in high school. We’ve been dating for 5 months now and it’s the happiest I’ve been in a couple of years. Our relationship started pretty quickly, maybe even too quickly. We met and started talking at the end of October and we hit it off great, and thanks to our involvement in the JROTC we were able to spend a lot of time together because of the after school activities. We would text each other day and night, and there never once was a break, a month and a half later I found myself asking her to be my girlfriend, it didn’t feel wrong on how quick paced it was so we continued. I can genuinely say I was falling in love with her everyday that passed, and I still am. Eventually we found ourselves getting intimate, and i think this is one reason why it’s hard for me to figure things out because of how deep our connections have got. And here is where it starts. 

In April there was a situation that her and I got into at school and because of it, this problem came to be. 

Later that week one of my teachers who I look up to and see as a mentor wanted to talk to me about it, eventually in our conversation we started talking about relationships. He showed me a way of thinking that I never thought of before when talking about relationships, he said, “Close you’re eyes and imagine that perfect partner, the one you want. Now once you have them in your mind think and ask yourself this, ‘Are you the person, that the person you’re imagining about, is imagining?’ Am I making sense.” But before he had even finished I had already thought of the person for me, but it wasn’t my girlfriend, it was my bestfriend. 

My bestfriend and I have known eachother for 2 years now and have never seemed to have good timing. Well throughout our friendship there was always a spark that would come between us that we would both acknowledge it but just let it simmer down and die out. Main reason was because she had a boyfriend and It felt wrong for me to feel that way for her, fast forward to now she ended up ending things with her boyfriend a couple months back and she told me her reason, but not until around the same time that everything was happening did she tell me it was mainly because of how she felt for me,  continuing with what happened, well being my bestfriend and just how best friends are, they tell each other everything and I told her about how I thought about her as being the one for me, and she said that when she closes her eyes and thinks of her perfect partner that she thinks of me as well. 

This is a big problem for me because I do really love my girlfriend, but when I look at my bestfriend well mentally I know she is the one but emotionally I’m not there, and when I look at my girlfriend, it’s the opposite, I don’t really know how to handle this situation and I feel terrible for keeping it from my girlfriend which makes me feel like I’m just digging a deeper hole to get out of in the end.

friend starts hating behind my back for no understandable reason, friend gets other friends to ignore me, huge confrontation, left with 0 friends left.

I've never had very much luck with friends. My faith in friendship was already at a mere 10% before all this.

I had become acquaintances with my partners friends in the past year just by proximity. (2 girls, 2 boys) I wouldn't talk to them outside of my partner inviting them out and over, and I only had one of the 4 on facebook. We are all in our 20's, working jobs. (this whole thing reminds me of high school drama)

So, January or February this year, one of the girls started saying that me and my partner were arguing, and that it was all a big mess etc. (We hadn't even had our first fight at the time) We didn't know about this until one of the guys was over and mentioned it when I left the room. (cue everything being behind my back)

So later my partner mentions to me that the friend thought we were seriously fighting, which was news to both of us and I felt pretty bad from hearing it. The friend told my partner how he knew that, and he said it was the one of the girls. (specifically)

The next day or so I mention how I hoped for an apology from her for spreading a false rumor to my partners' circle of friends. He later confronted the said girl and said this.

Cue the onslaught.

She went on about how she wasn't sorry for it, how she did nothing wrong and she just mentioned it to the guy because she was bored. I let that slide until she told my partner that she would ""not be begging for friendship with me."" 

All I wanted was a small feeling of 'sorry', not that our entire acquaintance depended on it. I was going to let it slide before it got worse.

My request for a small apology planted the seed of months of hatred from this girl. She would say all these things about me to the group behind my back. I only found out what was said from my partner.

Fast forward, a non-related friend (to this story) just sent out invites to his wedding. I got an invite because my partner will be best man, and due to number issues one of the four was not invited. This girl took it as me taking up their invite, and blamed me for the guy not being invited. I had no say in the invites or if I was even going to this wedding. (I just met the groom and bride recently) 

Now a bit later, the girl comes to hang out at our place. She walks in and I make small talk like how's it going, etc. She makes no eye contact, doesn't respond, and sits on the lounge. She ignored me the entire time she was there. I attempted to resolve the issue here but of course she would not respond.

As an extension to this, my partner and I drove two hours to go see the other three of the friends (not the girl). I didn't want to go in the first place, but I tagged along to be there for him. All three friends ignored me completely. After a few hours of trying I just gave up and went outside to hang out with the dogs.

This escalates to the 4 of them starting to ignore my partner. Calls, texts, all went unread for weeks. I tell him if they were his friends they would not ignore him.

So here I am thinking I am the problem, but what have I done to incite this reaction? I had not spoken to any of them since the start of this. (Besides my attempts to resolve) So surely it was the apology thing?

Wrong. Well, maybe. I'm not sure.

The girl messaged my partner today, inviting him out to go camping with the others. The last sentence of her message was ""But you can't bring your girlfriend"". My partner politely declined, and the girl unleashed more hell than Satan himself.

The girl went off questioning why his significant other was more important than his friends. Why they always put effort into the friendship and he never did. (remember they were ignoring him) And how he better not come crawling back to sook when ""his life turns to shit"". Dropping him completely. Waved goodbye in emoji. Not just her, but she was the spokesperson for all 4 of them.

So this set me over the edge. I was sitting on MONTHS of confusion and eventually dislike for this group and this whole situation. She just went ham on my partner and I felt like this was all my fault. So I message her. 4 or 5 big paragraphs. I keep it relatively professional, a few swear words here and there but I'm Australian so I can't help it. Basically just told her my side of the story, how I had no clue what I did to upset her so much. 

So she tells me she wants to set up a meeting, which I am like okay, I'm down to sort this out. Next thing she says, ""So I can show you that you are to blame, and if you say no then you are automatically guilty."" Guilty of what? Being confused? This was my first direct interaction with this chick for months.

She said I pushed away my partners friends because of this and that, but would then say I knew nothing of what was happening, that I wasn't involved, and that I should butt out. 

She told me to ""know my place"" and that since she was my partners ""BEST"" friend for 6 years, and I've been with him for less time, that I am just here as a courtesy and am irrelevant. I am not a 'party player' as she put it. She is saying this after ignoring him for months.

So, I am quite petty, but I am only petty when met with another petty. Here she is calling me irrelevant, a side thing, an idiot who knows nothing, someone who doesn't know their partner at all (she knows best!) She calls me controlling, and how I'm the second version of his stalker ex girlfriend. (that this girl had control over!) Tells me to know my place when it comes to my partner and her, that she is above me. I retaliate mentioning her girlfriend, how it would feel someone calling her girlfriend irrelevant and a side piece.

Here she starts threatening me. Saying that I'll regret saying that, and that she'll come over ours so I can say it to her face. I don't back down easily once started, so I said I would gladly say it to her face because of all she said previously. She's telling me I better take her seriously or else, I'll really regret it etc etc.

Even though this girl is basically a human truck, I have never been scared or threatened by her existence.

After her threats I blocked her. Her and the other girl start sending my guy tidbits of my conversation, of course in their favour and out of context. But my partner has a habit of not blocking anyone and letting people walk all over him. When this all first started, he tried getting me to apologize to her for wanting an apology. 

I am not sure what to do. He says he will call the girl soon to sort it out and said he 'won't go easy'. But I have no faith in this. Usually I am the one defending us. He hates confrontation so will avoid it by going silent. What should I do if he doesn't block her and she just shows up again in a few months? Or the worse outcome of her getting him on her side.
I have all this guilt now as if I am the reason he lost his friends. I really don't believe in friends because of all this, if you are bestfriends for 6 years how can you act this way. I am stunned.

This drama stemmed behind my back, but I was the key factor. I need to stop this happening, since it has started with my partners parents too. They never say anything to my face and think I am the devil. (I could write a whole other post about that)

I examined my actions in every single instance in both situations and while nobody is perfect I definitely did not warrant this kind of reaction. I'm really at a loss.  Would love an outsiders view.
How would I stop this in the future?

154,"A bunch of people I work with go out and hang out several times a week. I try to join their group because they are often in the same or similar schedule. When I ask them if I can join them, they say they'll let me know when they go out next. 4-5 people tell me they will invite me next time. I see their posts in social media and ask them why I wasn't invited and their reasonings are: it was a last minute decision, forgot and will tell me next time, thought I was busy, etc. They are all really friendly whenever we talk at work, but I'm sick of the bull shit. All the false hope associated actually making friends is hurting me tremendously. Do I tell them they are making me feel like shit? Is there a way to tell them that won't destroy our ability to work together?",04Jun2018,1
155,"So there is this girl that I've been thinking about a lot lately, but first, some context.

(Summer just started, so I'm referring to the next school year) I'm a Sophomore and she is a Junior. In fall I decided to join the academic team. She's always so kind, like smiling every time I face her direction. Anyway, this story really starts about a week and a half ago when she asked me to start a streak on Snapchat (I'm not really into that sort of thing, but whatever) because she said she really liked my personality. To be honest, this is the first time something like this has happened to me. So for the next part of the story, I should add that I had been developing an [Inferiority complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferiority_complex) over the years where I would take all insults as fact and all compliments as ""They're just doing that because they are socially/mentally obligated to say those"". I would also like to add that until this point, I identified as asexual(as in not feeling a romantic bond towards someone), and if your response is ""puberty happened"", My ""development"" had started a few years ago, so back to the story. Ever since she gave me her Snapchat, she was all I could think about. I sent Snapchats to her about 6 times until I showed her a video of a tour of my room, she responded with 'That's very nice"". Because of the Inferiority complex, this sent up so many red flags and made me depressed for the rest of the afternoon and the next day, she was literally the only thing I could think of. Then I got home to find out my dog of 4 years had died. Both these things made me depressed until about Wednesday. You see, our academic team got to go to nationals in Washington D.C., These are some more characters in the next part(Girl(her), Girl 1, Girl 2, Me, Guy 1, Guy 2, Guy 3). The First night, the girls invited Me, Guy 1, &amp; Guy 2 over to their room, we played Truth or Dare, but since nobody picked dare, it dissolved into what we called ""T(ruth) Time"". This is when we all started to talk about each other's feelings. Me and Guy 1 opened up about our respective experiences with depression, Guy 2 and Girl 2 talked about family members. I want to point out that while she was the main reason I came, I was also there for there for the others as well. One of the nights, while I was opening up, they all started complimenting me. This actually worked for the rest of the night until the next morning :(. Ever since we left DC, I have not been able to stop thinking about her, I was depressed the entire way home because of this. This is what brought me to this question. She recently had a peaceful breakup with Guy 3 (they're still friends) which means the next few weeks I have a chance to ask her out. Although, A few things concern me. One is that if she rejects me, our friendship would never be the same if it even still existent. We also have not only academic team next year, but also a class, but I don't exactly have the cards stacked in my favor. She is an upcoming Junior and my looks aren't as good as hers, but I do know that she likes my personality. Which brings me to my second choice, strengthening our friendship. Not only is this a way more doable thing, but it would probably last longer too! All I know is that I need more of this Kind, Sweet, Funny, Smart girl in my life. What should I do?",04Jun2018,2
156,"As a preface: These people are capable of kind acts, but they are few and far between. They are Middle Eastern, and very old fashioned, though not every middle\-easterner is. My sisters have little to no freedom and and are essentially prisoners in my eyes. There is little to no happiness from what I can see, and they appear to have been terribly raised, as they have serious personality/attitude problems. I'm not perfect either, I'm incredibly lazy, but I get stuff done when it needs to be.

* My father has never once been able or willing to take criticism. He is always right, has never made a mistake, and his policies/rules are absolute, unless he breaks one of his own rules, in which case they don't matter. He goes to work everyday \(big whoop\), and I can't say he doesn't provide for this family. He does however, beat the living crap out of my sisters, when he finds a spot on the floor or the dishes aren't cleaned. His parenting style is what I call ""bare minimum."" Examples: When I had trouble with tests, I asked to be called in sick \(I'm aware I was terrible for doing this\). After telling me how much of a failure I was, my father would call me in. Another one: I waited two months to get my permit. A year and a half to get my license after that, to which I had to retake my permit test. I waited even longer to get a car. My sisters just recently got their permits, in their junior and senior years.He barely ever lets my sisters out, holds it over them when he does, and takes their phones whenever he feels like. He has hated every single job choice I've ever made, even going as far as to forbid me from taking certain jobs. I never did get a job, because he never liked them. He's not very supportive, and he certainly is not socially aware in the slightest. He constantly tells me that my friends hate me and are just trying to take advantage of me.
* My grandmother is incredibly nosy. If you buy something, or go somewhere, or do anything that requires independent thought, she has to know about it. She wants to be involved with everything, and wants everything her way. She is incredibly easily offended. When she takes offense, the whole family knows. My sisters have a saying: If Dad is mad at you, it's probably because Grandma is mad at you. I forgot to mention that my father follows his parents religiously. He seems to be incapable of functioning independent of them. I've heard from other family members that she is incredibly two\-faced and complains about almost everything.
* My grandfather is not the worst person on this list. I actually favored him the most. I recently discovered many issues with him though. He does not care that my dad is an asshole, thinks that we are ungrateful, and used to always tell me that Burger King wouldn't even hire me. He is more of a passenger on this ride, but the fact that he has not said anything and does not intend to pisses me off.

Some other things that have happened to us: Our mother died December of last year. She was, in my eyes, the last good person in this family.  My sisters and I have never once been supported by our family. Everything we do that is even remotely not STEM is looked at as stupid or is ridiculed. I've never once felt loved by my father, always anxious around him or the next thing that would piss him off. He screams at my sisters and I for not doing anything with our lives, but then doesn't allow them to go out and doesn't allow me to get the jobs I'm looking for.  I'm 19, and I'm a guy. My first car is a 40,000$ BMW. It was not my first choice. I tried first to buy a 2007 dodge charger for 4g. I was looked at like an idiot. Next was a 2014\-2015 Q50 for 20\-30g. Again, looked at like an idiot, and no car was ever good enough for them to buy. Final decision was up to me, and I picked a car with the options I liked. I was basically coached into getting a very expensive car. I do not feel I deserve it. I am constantly reminded by my father that he bought me that car, and that I should be grateful. My father is incredibly lazy, and it seems that way even when he is at work. I've heard from employees that my father tries to befriend them, and often interrupts their jobs, which I think is very sad. To put that into context, he is the owner/manager of his business. He rarely spends time with us, and when he is home, often spends his days watching TV and then screaming at us for not doing anything all day, which is exactly what he has just done. What should I do? I am most likely moving out, but I want input from other people first.",04Jun2018,1
157,"Sorry in advance for what I feel like might be a long post. For a while now I have suspected that I have an actual mental disorder but have never been diagnosed. I go through phases of several days or weeks at a time where I feel ""normal""- I'm generally excited about life, confident in myself, and actively social. In these times I feel good about most if not all of my interactions, and can easily convince myself that the little things don't really matter and life is generally good. I exercise, care about my health and actively do things like yoga and art to keep my creativity active and stress levels in line. 

But I also constantly cycle through bouts of extreme negativity and low self esteem that also last longer than the good moods. I start to see myself ugly in the mirror, feel like I have no real friends or that they secretly think I'm annoying. I genuinely struggle in conversations, lose all motivation and get fleeting suicidal thoughts like I might as well just not exist. I get extremely easily irritated by simple shit- people being rude to me at my restaurant job (duh), loud volumes, too bright or too dim or too white of lighting in a place all stress me out on a level way beyond what they should, and sometimes to where I can't even articulate it and need to isolate myself until it passes. When it's like this I basically go through days at a time feeling like I'm on the verge of tears, totally useless, stupid and a failure despite any of my accomplishments/good traits that I try to remind myself of. 

Even though I know of healthy habits that help manage my well being and self esteem (exercise, taking care of myself, staying active and creative and social), I inevitably fall out of regularly doing them and end up back in this snake pit of self hatred.  

I can't keep living like this because just this weekend I had basically a nonstop tantrum/breakdown while my whole immediate family was in town to see me graduate. I was pretty wretched and I don't even know why. I just felt awful about myself and nothing felt right. I couldn't even fake being excited to graduate, even though I AM proud of myself, I'm constantly switching between excitement and dread for the future. 

I feel like my mom is ashamed and annoyed of my tempermental behavior. She tells me every time I express this to her that I need to be on medicine, but I live in a different state from my family and feel totally daunted by the process of finding a psychiatrist- one who will be good for me and easy to talk to, because I've been to ones I didn't feel comfortable with in the past and am scared of having to try multiple doctors because I don't have enough money to support myself doing all that and my mom already helps me with my rent. 

I can sense myself pushing friends/family/my boyfriend away when acting out of my negative emotions, but a lot of times I can't even pin down what those emotions are or where they're coming from. Sometimes I can talk myself down to rationality, but a lot of the time I just feel *really bad* and I don't know why but I can't see around it, and then I just feel like a fucking child who needs to be alone. 

TLDR I genuinely can't tell if I'm bipolar, chronically anxious, depressed or mildly autistic and I dont know where to start on improving my mental health because I'm daunted by the task of finding a proper psychiatrist",04Jun2018,1
158,"So, there's this girl I used to date, and I really liked her. We met in high school, and it was my senior year. Our relationship was great, and honestly, probably the best one I had ever been in. I, for once, wasn't too clingy and she didn't cause me a lot of drama or mentally hurt me like past relationships. However, our relationship ended sooner than I thought I would. Her cousin, who I used to be good friends with in my Sophomore year, told her family these rumors of how I was really a bad person, and how I cheated on people. On top of that, he even threatened to beat me up. We ended up breaking up around the end of the school year.

 For awhile, she wasn't really on my mind, and I had thought I had moved on. Everything was good, but recently I've been having dreams about her, and wherever I go, I think I see her, but she's not actually there, like my mind has to somehow remind me of her in some way. So I had asked a good friend of mine if she could see if we could talk or something \(I'm not allowed to talk to her, for obvious reasons\). And this month, I got a call from her, and she said that us ever happening again would be possible, and I agree with her, but I told her that I would wait. I honestly don't know if that was the best choice, but it's what I felt, and i still feel. I don't know what to do, I want to believe there's a chance or a slimmer of hope that I could be with her again. I want to try and prove that I'm not what I was made out be by her cousin. So here I am, waiting for a girl, hoping to jump these many obstacles. How do I fix this? Is there any chance I can be with her again? Or should I just try and move on again?",04Jun2018,1

161,"I bought the last one in 2012, but I want to buy a new one for when I start university next year. My current one is a bit on the slow side and not dependent enough for my studies, I fear. It works great, but sometimes it can take a while to start programs, and I’d hate to miss out on valuable time because my Mac is too slow. In math last year, I was literally always the last one to start up a program called GeoGebra, so I was always lagging behind. I had to watch and take notes with pen and paper instead of using the actual program.

Anyway, my fear is that the issues with the new keyboards are too severe. Has this been fixed, or will I still encounter some should I buy one this month \(I’m going away in early July and want to bring it with me\)?",04Jun2018,1
162,"I lost a friend a few months ago and now I want to reconnect, but I’m not sure how to or if I even should! 

I dated a boy for a year and a half, then we broke up. He had known that I went to college with a guy named Joe and that we had liked each other in college, but my ex (James) never knew him. We never dated and remained friends. When me and my ex broke up, I started texting Joe more often but we no longer had feelings for each other, we would just play games and talk nonsense. After two months, me and James got back together but he found out about me being in touch with Joe and lost his shit! 

James demanded that I erase Joe from my phone, social media, everything. So I did because I wanted the relationship to work. James ended up messaging joe on Facebook asking about the nature of our friendship and if we ever hooked up, or were planning to. He also told him to not get in touch with me “or else”. Joe wasn’t upset and let the whole situation blow over to avoid any more confrontations. I feel like James blew the whole thing up over nothing. 

I broke up with my ex shortly after this drama because he was becoming controlling and I was unhappy. It has been about 3 months since the incident and want to reach out to Joe because he had been a good friend to me. I’m not sure how though, I would feel weird just adding him on instagram without saying anything. I don’t have any feelings for him and we were never very close but I miss his friendship. I never even got to apologize to him for my ex dragging him into our relationship drama. My ex gave Joe the idea that I want a relationship with him so I don’t want him to think that’s the reason I’m reconnecting. Should I text him first? Most of our interaction was via text or Snapchat, so is it even worth trying to reconnect, or would it be an awkward mess? 

tl;dr - lost a friend because of a past relationship but now I don’t know how to reconnect ",04Jun2018,1

166,"I saw a post on Craigslist about a free dog. The dog in the picture looked... unwell, and the text accompanying it raised some red flags for me. I contacted the person to get some more information. He let me know that he got the dog, immediately bred her several times, and is now getting rid of her because he has the puppies and ""she pisses him off."" He was going to give her to the first person to come get her. When I said that I would take her, he told me to not be alarmed if she was really slow and limping, because he had recently kicked her a few times and she was recovering. She's only 1.5 years old.

My plan was for him to drop her off here \(I don't have a car\) and I would take care of her while finding an agency \(we have a lot of bully rescues around here\) to take care of her, paying her vet bills and just making sure she was alright. He never showed up, citing some weird reason, and then offered that I could pick her up at his house tomorrow.

I don't think that going there is safe but I'm so worried and concerned about this dog. If he's giving her away, I think there's only two types of people that would take in an unspayed, obviously abused dog: people who want to help it, and people who would just breed her or use her as a fighting dog \(unfortunately, we have a lot of those around here, too\). I have the numbers I'm supposed to call, and I can call the bully rescues in the morning, but I'm afraid that nobody's going to be able to act by tomorrow, and she might go from one terrible home to another.

168,"I have never ever posted to Reddit before asking for advice or help on anything, but to be honest I feel insecure asking people around me about this and I want to know what others have to say. 

Basically, ever since I was young, I have been very obsessed with getting work done, being organized, etc. I would get playfully teased very often that I was a ""nerd"" or ""workaholic"" because throughout highschool I would never procrastinate and get assignments/projects done pretty much the first day they were assigned because if I ever waited on them, it would make me extremely stressed out. In highschool, this didn't seem like much of a problem because the assignments weren't that challenging and were easy enough to complete in a day or two with no complications. 

I started college in Fall 2017, so my first year is almost up. I am feeling enormous amounts of stress. I am a Computer Science major, and coursework has been notably more difficult than in highschool (which is expected). I just feel so overwhelmed with all my school work and this quarter my professors have not been the greatest, resulting in me having to self teach myself a lot of concepts in order to complete difficult assignments. I often work for hours on end without eating (so I skip meals) and sometimes even hold in using the bathroom because I get so fixated on a certain problem or bug that I cannot leave it for a moment. I have a boyfriend, and he seems to support me as well as he can, but sometimes it's not enough. I don't blame him, but I can't help how my mind is wired. He suggests I take breaks, but breaks don't clam me down like they do for a normal person. I literally cannot stop thinking about a problem until it's solved. If I take a break, I end up getting more stressed. If I try to nap or sleep, I get nightmares about the problem I'm trying to solve. This all sounds so stupid... I don't want to sound stupid. I feel really misunderstood and I constantly feel like I need to justify how I'm thinking. I don't know if I have OCD? I don't want to jump to any conclusions. I'm asking for some advice on how to deal with this or maybe just hear about someone else who goes through this... I honestly just feel super alone sometimes because I get so worked up and others cannot relate to me. 

TLDR: I am a workaholic to the point where I cannot sleep or eat until I finish my work, it's obsessive and haunts me. I often feel lonely when I am stressed out because no one understands me. ",04Jun2018,2
170,"I have a female friend, she is my ex-girlfriend and I am very worried for her.  Part of the reasons I stopped a relationship with her is because she gets upset at just about anything (including the smallest things where she ends up in tears) to the point I had to stop and help her nearly every day, which ended up affecting my work negatively and also my study due to the amount of time I spent with her.
I loved her, and I still do and was so worried about her that I stayed friends with her trying to help where and when I could.  I still don't know if that was the right decision because I cannot seem to help her.  Every minor negative thing that I wouldn't usually expect  to affect the ""average person"", she bursts into tears over.
She also seems to think that I am going to leave her, and go out of her life and she has no basis for this.  If I am unable to talk on the phone or come and see her because, for instance, I might be with a client and at work, she seems to think that is reason enough that I don't want to see her again and her texts to me express that.  No matter how much I reassure her, or try to help nothing seems to work.

171,"Regardless of the long process that I know this would take, I'm curious if I should do it. I have two reasons:

1. It's hard to make a name for yourself if your name is so common. This is a very superficial reason though, so please refer to the much better number 2.

2. This was how my family originally spelled it. Back in the 30s, the two prominent Smyth brothers in my family split in a name-change decision, in which one brother changed his name to Smith and the other kept Smyth. I come from the Smith lot. 

I would never change my name solely for the first reason because that's obviously not sticking to your heritage, but at the same time, I'm not doing this in some sort of heroic way to get closer to my roots. It's more the case that I want a more unique name and it just so happens that my rightful last name was changed almost a century ago.",04Jun2018,3

174,"Ok so at my school I’m pretty decently socialized. I have a variety of friends who are into different things and have different personalities. A few of my friends in specific have really been getting on my nerves recently. It’s a group of three friends, let’s call them J, E and A. They all watch and like anime which I’m completely fine with. The issue is the way they go about liking it. Whenever they talk about it they act almost like they are superior to other fans of it. They constantly reference weebs and talk down about them. Even though they are mega fans of anime making fan art, buying body pillows and figures. They use a lot of ironic humor. Like J will constantly makes Nazi jokes to the point where even I don’t know if he’s being serious. They’re not even well crafted jokes. Just him saying shocking things and sometimes even getting into arguments with me over whether hitler was a bad person or not.  Out of the three of them J and E really struggle with serious conversations. I went to E asking for advice one day and he sat looking silently at me like he had no idea what to say. J gets upset but instead of expressing why he is upset or sad he starts making suicide jokes or referencing internet humor. He’s gotten better at this recently because I’ve expressed to him how frustrating and unhealthy it is. Awhile back I flipped out in the groupchat we were all in. It got to the point where E and J were making fun of me for asking them to be genuine with me. I’d ask them a serious question or express a personnel belief I held and they’d just respond with a dumb and non well crafted joke. I’m the only one out of us that really socializes outside of our friend group, the rest of them being very shy around other people. J has expressed being annoyed with me talking and sitting at other tables during lunch, making comments like “I’m glad your back to see your real friends “ or something like that. I openly call him a bitch whenever he makes comments like that. There was also a point where J was dating a transgender girl and the rest of our friends except me kept making fun of him over it. He seemed really insecure and upset by it but he never expressed himself to the others regarding his feelings. I was the one who pushed him to ask her out because I knew he liked her. And after they started going out J thanked me through text one day and then at school kept saying I had “peer pressured him into asking her out” which kinda bothered me. I expressed in our groupchat that the bullying of J really bothered me and I think it’s really shitty to put down a friend that way. A asked me if I was ok the next day but E never spoke to me about it or brought it up. Right after I went on a long rant he responds with a meme in the groupchat to which I didn’t respond. After a few days of not talking to E and not sitting with them I moved past it and started sitting with them again. Recently I feel like I’m gonna explode again because E keeps making comments in our groupchat acting like me having interests is funny. I just expressed that I was looking forward to E3 and Fallout 76 and now he just keeps randomly quoting me in the chat, making fun of me without directly insulting me. It’s weird as hell. Basically their comedy or quips don’t make any sense outside of us 4. They are making each other worse because they encourage this weird behavior. In the real world people share interest and opinions. It’s how you make conversation for Christ sake. I’m just really frustrated and don’t know how to move forward.

I just need advice on moving forward and communicating with these emotionally and socially immature people.",04Jun2018,1
175,"Hi all, 

First, I’d like to apologize in advanced because this is going to be quite the read, but I really do need some help! I’ve been fighting with this problem for a few years now… Just a brief bio about me, I’m an 18 year old guy in my junior year of college studying Mechanical Engineering. 

  I wanted to ask, what’s your advice on leaving my “friends?” I was raised as a Christian, so you know, every Sunday I would go to church. For literally my entire life, I’ve gone to the same church, with the same people, and thus the same friends. So you can imagine the type of connection I should \(key word\) have with the people around me. For some reason, I don’t have this connect with these people anymore. As a child, I would always hangout with them and play games and stuff, but now growing up they seem very distant. It’s not one, or two of them – it’s all of them. Around 10\-12 people to be specific. They always go to lunch together, movies, birthdays, etc. and NEVER invite me. Sometimes, I’ll literally be in front of them as they make plans, and they don’t even notice I’m there. For example, many times they would make plans in front of me on where to go and eat lunch. They would all talk with one another and organize who’s going to drive who, and who’s got to be back by 3:30, so on and so forth. Yet no one would ask about my ride. How I was going to make it, or when I had to be back.  

I’m not a shy person, so speaking for myself isn’t the issue. Whenever I would forcefully mention the casual “ what about me guys” type of question they all sorta pause and have that pity look…like “ Yeah, you can come I guess.” I thought it was very odd that I have such a high number of people who dislike me – so naturally I though I’m the reason.  Maybe I smell, or it’s my personality or whatever – but when I sit down and think hard about it, I legitimately can’t formulate a reason as to why these people would dislike me. I’m really smart, a pilot, kind, funny \( or at least I’m told\), and to be honest; just your average typical dude. I like video games, and Netflix and stuff. 

 What the real Enigma is, I haven’t done anything to these people for them to dislike me. I haven’t fought with them, shared rumors, or anything like that. As a matter of fact, I’m the complete opposite. I try to listen to them whenever something is on their mind, or offer my 2 cents on any problems they have, and especially invite them to places whenever I plan on doing something. I have all their numbers, and have all of them on several forms of social media. Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and hell, even Viber and Whatsapp! I’ve even asked them individually if the phone number I had saved was correct – of course it was.  I understand not everyone needs to like me, and I’m cool with that. But the issue is, they ARE friendly to me in person, but its more of a hi &amp; bye basis.

  I’m sick of opening Snapchat and seeing all of them have fun while I’m at home. Not going to lie, it really hurts. I grew up with these people since elementary and like a switch they’ve completely changed. Today was the last straw, I opened Snapchat and guess what! Another huge birthday party with everyone and their great grandmother! Its not like I’m friendless, I have friends but ever since we split in high school \(because each of us went to a different college\) I don’t see them anymore. However we do text from time to time. So I’m sort of a lone ranger at the moment. I have a very interesting life full of really fun events, for crying out loud I can fly planes and I've offered to take them flying! So its not like I’m a dull person to talk to or be around with. I... I just don’t know. Every time I think about cutting them off cold turkey, I have a part of me saying don’t and I’m not sure why. Please, I’m all ears to any advice you guys have! I’m tired of this continuous cycle of being around fake people.",04Jun2018,5
176,"Hello everyone,
I wanted to share something that happened yesterday and ask for your advice on it.  I’ve ordered some shoes on DHgate (kinda popular wholesale website) a month ago but never got the tracking number or any information about them, and when I would ask the seller why that was happening, he would ignore me. I thought that he might’ve wanted to scam me so I filed a dispute to get my money back. A few days later, while I was on my iPhone, I got a notification from Apple that someone tried to sign in to my Apple account (I use the same one for my Apple ID and DHgate) near Nanjing, Jiangsu. I thought nothing of it and I obviously declined it and proceeded to change my passcode and delete my credit card information from my Apple ID. Yesterday the seller finally responded (obviously annoyed) and said that he had shipped the item, provided me the link where I could track the shipment and said to close the dispute, which I did. But here is the sketchy part. When I tracked the shipment it said that the Collecting center has recieved an item (my shoes) from a customer (my seller) in Nanjing, Jiangsu. I was kinda shocked when I saw that the seller and the person who tried to hack me live in the same city, I don’t know if he had something to do with it or was it all just a coincidence?
Please tell me your opinion and what should I do regarding the safety of my Apple account. Thank you

177,"All of this is happening in a public discord channel for a niche hobby, for context. 


I've been friends with a group of ~15 people for two years now, and we've shared many great moments together. Though, while there are several individuals within that group who are overall difficult people, I'm a pretty amicable guy and we have no trouble with each other. Trouble comes when last year, a new guy (Bob) comes in. Whenever I come across Bob, he's a nice fellow, and we have easy conversation. However, Bob isn't as passive as me, and he frequently calls out those ""difficult people"". They start needling Bob, Bob starts needling them back-- and it becomes more than that: Bob begins to goad these people whenever he can find ""an in"". Whenever he's not around these difficult people gossip about him behind his back. 


What happened recently is that all this came to a head, and the admin of the server made a private channel, brought our group in, and asked for our thoughts on having him banned. Now, Bob is kind of an asshole. But the ""difficult people"" outright start telling lies, attempting to be the loudest voice in the room, claiming they'll leave the server permanently if Bob isn't banned, and everyone else is quickly influenced (e.g. ""I had no idea Bob had done that! We should've banned him months ago!""). Because I'm Bob's friend, I feel obligated to stand up for him. I say to everyone to look at the logs, to find proof for claims, but no one is doing so. It's like talking to brick walls. And now people are getting upset with me. And I'm getting mad back! Bob wasn't being an asshole in a vacuum. I'm upset that this group, who I had good opinions of, won't listen to reason or logic. I'm upset that when those ""difficult people"" start attacking me for 'defending' Bob (I'm just asking people to get evidence!) that others are telling me to stop stirring shit. I'm beginning to resent this entire group.

178,"Mentions of self harm and suicide below.


This time last year I split from my cheating fiancé, it was hard to decide to leave him because at the time I had no idea he was cheating but he had been ignoring me and we had been fighting for months. Due to breaking up with him I went into a depression for two weeks, while heavily suffering from anxiety I felt lost and alone, until one day he called me and told me he stopped loving me a long time ago. Fair. I thought to myself “Okay, that’s fine, I can’t go on living like this.” So I pulled myself together. 

I had lost many people while I was in a relationship with him, for someone who was cheating on me he sure loved to control me. So when I was single I reached out to my friends again, apologising and explaining the situation. I had fallen out with a girl I’ll call Stacey, before I started my relationship with my ex, for unknown reasons why we fell out. But while I was getting back into contact with friends I decided to reach out to Stacey too. 

Stacey had explained to me that she felt threatened by me and that all of the others would do as I say, she felt like she had no say in anything while she was in the friend group. I apologised to her, I never meant for her to feel that way and I asked others if they felt that way and they said no, they never have. But I still felt weary about it.

Stacey started coming over more often, I was glad to have her back in my life, it felt better now  too. We learned more about each other and i started to feel like I needed to protect her from all the bad things in the world. So I invited Stacey to live with me during the week and then at the weekends she would stay with her boyfriend. 

She didn’t get on with her divorced parents because of her tough upbringing, when she talked about her past I would cry and tell her that the future was going to be better and she had me and other friends and her boyfriend. I tried to help her in every way possible, she had no job and was taking money off the social welfare so if she ever needed money or petrol or food I would gladly give her anything she needed. 

Helping her was like helping me, I went on adventures and did things I’ve never done before, I had another companion by my side, it felt like we were a couple but I wasn’t attracted to her. ( She’s bisexual and I’m pansexual ). I remember she told me that her boyfriend told her that I was USING her. I asked how? And she said because she drove and I didn’t. But yet I gave her a home and anything she needed, I dropped the conversation though.

Stacey liked to harm herself and I never caught her doing it but many times she’s come to my house with cuts on her arms, I’d cry and tell her that there’s more to life than this. She was ‘diagnosed’ with bipolar. I put it like this because after everything I’m not sure I believe her but I believed her at the time.

I introduced her to more people and told her if she felt uncomfortable that she could tell me and she did, but she began to become more comfortable around my other friends and we started doing things together. One night I invited her to come to mine instead of going to a golf thing with her boyfriend’s family. She agreed to go because she didn’t like being around his family, that was of the Saturday night. During that Saturday I had been on a date and she had called me and texted me all day, I never saw this because I was with my date. When I left to go home I tried calling her and she wouldn’t answer.

I was so worried I almost called her parents but ended up calling one of her other friends, he never answered even though she was supposed to be with him. I texted her boyfriend ( who’s never liked me ) and asked him did he know where she was, he replied with ‘yeah she’s taking a nap beside me’ I thought this was strange and asked him did he know she was going to come over to mine that night and he said no that she never told him. I said okay as long as she’s safe that’s all that matters and left it at that.

Saturday night I had the girls over and we played singstar and got very drunk, it was a great night but I missed Stacey. The next morning I woke up quite late and checked my phone to see a message from one of Stacey’s friend telling me she tried to jump off a bridge last night. I called him straight away and asked him what was going on. He said that her and her boyfriend went out for a walk and she was near a bridge and tried to jump off it. This isn’t her ‘first’ attempt ( again, putting it like this because I’m not sure what to believe ) at this kind of thing. Apparently it was her fifth.

Now she had been talking about killing herself so much that it worried me, I even spoke to her mother and father about it and they seemed to care even though she had told me they didn’t. I spoke to her friends about it too and they were worried about her. So hanging up on her friend I tried calling Stacey. Bare in mind, I was balling my eyes out, my heart shattered when I heard all of this that my mother had to try calm me down. 

Stacey never answered her phone but instead texted me saying she couldn’t do it anymore and I told her yes you can! And that I loved her but she didn’t listen to me and ended up hanging up the phone. I texted her boyfriend asking what was going on and he basically told me that it was MY fault she was gonna kill herself. 

This hurt me more than finding out my fiancé had been cheating on me. I threw my phone away and cried myself silly until I got the energy to go to work that day. Her boyfriend explained to me that she felt overwhelmed by everyone wondering where she was all the time and she couldn’t take it anymore that it wasn’t only my fault, after blatantly saying it was my fault. I only wanted to know where she was because she was supposed to come over to my house, plus she had told me the week before that she thinks people should be paying close attention to her in case she’d do anything, ‘I’ve a car, I can drive wherever I want and no one would know.’ Was her words. 

Eventually we got into contact but I was still heartbroken, it killed me hearing that after all I did for her and because it was killing me I needed TIME to get past it. I needed to deal with it because the stress of it all made me physically ill. Stacey hated this and began to bitch about me to her friends, I know this because they sent me screenshots. 

She put up posts on Instagram tagging her ‘true’ best friends, and began posting mean tweets about me on twitter. I remember telling her friend after he showed me the screenshot of what she said that it was okay, she can say whatever she wants about me as long as she’s okay. I didn’t want to be the cause of her trying to kill herself again. So while I was trying to take care of my health and mental health she continued to do this. 

Eventually she deleted all the pictures of me on her Instagram page and deleted me off Facebook. At this time I began dating my boyfriend and let Stacey do her own thing. I kept checking up on her by asking her friends if she was ok and they began to never reply. 

Months later, as this all went down in November of last year she is still writing hateful tweets about me on twitter even calling out my family. I don’t want to reach out to her because i tried in January and she sounded petty and that she didn’t need me anymore, but I told her if she did that I was here for her. She told me she was getting help and that she had borderline personality disorder, which she sent me links to understand them. And that was all fine. 

Until she kept up the mean comments, and to this day she still is. I think she’s angry that I took care of myself instead of her at the time, So was I in the wrong or not? ",04Jun2018,0
179,"Now I know this problem I'm having may seem very small to some, and probably rightly so, but it has affected me a lot and I would really appreciate some kind words of support and advice on how to overcome this. 

I'm a 20 yo student living with my parents. Last month I broke my two front teeth when stupidly getting a piggy back from my friend on a night out. We both honestly didn't think we'd fall, but he tripped and we fell face flat on the asphalt. I got the teeth bonded but my mental state has never been the same since. 

I've always been a light hearted guy who gave everything a chance and was open to people and new relationships. But now that my teeth are broken I get constant anxiety and they're gonna chip off or break right in front of a new person, and that makes me avoid social interaction altogether. I just sit at home this past month, not exercising, not doing anything. My parents don't understand why I'm being like this, saying things like in our childhood we never whined or gave out about anything and just did what we had to do. But I fear that in this new vain world where first impressions matter so much that I just can't muster up the courage I used to have to continue living confidently as I did. This has affected even my attitude towards my friends, and I find it hard to string up sentences together because I'm more concerned about my teeth than what I'm actually saying. It's driving me insane. Because I used to be very confident, liked to tell jokes and in general brought joy to people. I have this fear of being judged by people, because I've always been told that I'm handsome and all, so people always notice me. I've started avoiding people because of this. And I don't understand how I can continue living like this, with the constant fear of my teeth breaking because they're not as strong as they were before. This constantly makes me think of the fall and I just relive that horrible day every since minute of my life....
All of these feelings are so new to me, that I can't bring myself together, I'm only 20 and honestly have never experienced anything like this before.  

Is there any way I can reprogram my brain to understand that this isn't the end of the world and that people won't judge me by my teeth, but I think they do, and I feel ashamed and embarrassed in front of my family and friends for being like this..",04Jun2018,1

184,"Hello all, a but lengthy but I would love some advice about this situation.


First things first, I do not live at said house but it's is my boyfriends and he manages it and lives there. He rents the 2 spare rooms, and basically I live there without actually living there. I do like to keep things separate because this is a newish relationship (9 months).


Too ate number two is moving otlut within the next two weeks and he was looking to fill in the room for the remainder of the month. And just recently roommate number one, who has a child, has brought In a distant friend (of mine) to babysit. I know of her through friends of friends. My boyfriend told her he would love to have her live with us over there. I agreed and I totally thought she would be a great canidate. Shes very helpful likes to run errands, cook clean the while nine yards. For those reasons my bf likes her company as well. Since she is always over babysitting we talk about everything and are really starting to get to know each other. I thought she was a rad chick! At times she can be a bit negative and start talking about other people's issues but I am one to quickly change the subject and never give in to the shit talking. It never really bothered me much until this weekend.

I have told her a few main issues and insecurities for the past 2 months of her being around. Very specific ones, ones that I have ONLY told her.
I was at a party minding my own business relaxing with my friends in the corner and out of nowhere this other chick, a go go dancer who is friends with the babysitter (future roommate) comes up and starts talking shit about my insecurities. I used to go go dance but my birth control has caused me to gain weight. Just recently the babysitter go go danced at EDC I was excited for her! And told her I plan on getting into shape again so I can join her and talked about my body issues ect. Any who I was so taken aback by the time I relaxed what was going on the go go dancer and the babysitter where busting up laughing and walking away.

I had another run in with the go go dancer that night, she came up to me telling me why my ex broke up with me (another subject I only told the babysitter) and was rubbing it in my face. I think the babysitter is telling her all my secrets and whispering in her ear that I don't like her (NOT TRUE)! Never had an issue... Don't even know the girl. My male friend had to get in between us and broke it up . Mind you this go go dancer hasn't spoken a word to me since me and me ex broke up a year ago. Never liked her but never NOT liked her. Never talked about her, or anything. Just another face in the crowd. Funny... Because the babysitter was talking shit about the go go dancer to my face just a month prior and I told her I don't want to get involved.

Its obvious what's going in here. 
My bf is out of town for another 6 days and the babysitter is posting looking for a bed and dressers and so excited to move in. 


My issue is that my bf likes to keep the peace... I told him exactly what happened... He said he would tell her to find another place and he will make sure she never babysit again. She is practically 86d from the house but I'm afraid I'm coming off too harshly for catching someone talking shit. Also afraid that my bf won't do exactly as he promised. If she has done this to me, won't she do it to him? 

I caught her red handed speaking things about me, and I'm afraid once I confront her she will deny it and make me look like an idiot to my bf. I know the truth, he wasn't there so he is kinda iffy. What should I do here guys? 
Please help!

190,"I've been feeling really anxious and worried these past few weeks because I currently have no college/uni applications that were accepted, and as such, I'm really worried that I can't pursue a future in something I'm passionate about.

I'm an 18M (turning 19 in August) living in France, so French users will know some of the terms I'm going to be using here. In February, our education system opened a thing where everyone can put forward their wishes for colleges, universities, etc they would like to go to next year. I'm really passionate about anything computer, coding and programming related, so I put down any and all wishes relating to such things in faculties that are closest to me.

However, about a week ago, our responses came back - and I wasn't accepted in a single one of the places I had signed up for.

This flat-out crushed me, because I was hoping so so much to be able to get out of the place I currently live in, have some more control over elements in my life, and moat importantly, be able to find a part-time job somewhere in a town I had planned on moving to.

I currently live out in the countryside with my parents. They are, well... I can't call them outright abusive or narcissistic, but they do deprive me of certain resources that are essential to me being able to move up in life. For example, we have no Internet, which, according to them, we 'don't need'. I find this excuse outright pathetic, since I'm pursuing a career in anything IT-related which I'll obviously need for. My older brother is also a music producer, and needs Internet to be able to stay in touch with his contacts, etc. This goes the same for our landline, which was my only method of contact with my then-girlfriend. We were both upset with what was happening, but we talked things through and ended our relationship on good terms. I was still angry that there wasn't anything I could have done to stop it. There have also been other...events that I do not wish to currently talk about here that has also added to the pile.

While I don't have a crushing urge to get out of where I'm currently living in ASAP, I still have come to the point where I decided I don't want to be living here anymore, since I'm not exactly doing anything with my life right now.
I have looked around for volunteer work and the like, but where I live, there isn't exactly anything. Hence my reason for wanting to move into town.

I'm going to be sitting my BAC (end of high school exams) in two weeks, and while I am dedicating my time to revising for it, I am still extremely fearful of failing it and shutting out any and all future hope of me bring able to move forward in life. I'm fearful of falling into depression or something, and then ending up flat out stuck with nowhere to go or escape to and rebuild from there.

192,"Hello Reddit, I hope you are having a good day. : )
Sorry if this is long. : p
I don't really know what to do, but I think my maths teacher is a pedophile. 
He really weird and creepy all the time; especially people like me who feel uncomfortable. I don't know how much longer I can take of going to school everyday in fear. 
He sometimes hands out chocolates or candy which is against our school rules. I never take any just in case. Everyone says that he's 'nice' for doing this, but I don't trust it.

He does this thing where whenever he talks to you, he puts his hands on your shoulders and gives a weird massge thing. And he only does it to people like me who are uncomfortable around him. I avoid asking questions and eye contact as much as possible. It's really creepy.

This is affecting my grades. Not trying to brag or show off or whatever, but I am one of those students who has never gotten below 80% in a maths test in my life. Maths has always been one of my strongest subjects and I really like it. But for this year, I've been getting around 60% (67% has been my highest). I am too scared to ask questions because I sent an email once and he said 'we'll go over it in class' and he kind of did, but then moved on. Ever since then, he's been more closer, I guess, and used it as an oppurtunity to talk to me more. He keeps going up to ask 'if you're doing alright' with a creepy touch each time. It makes me so uncomfortable. I had a panic attack because of him (I have anxiety and have dealt with it all my life, but now, I can control it pretty well. I haven't had one at school for 2 years), and it's one of the worst ones I've ever had. He talked to me in front of the whole class because we were playing some game and I kinda looked at the ground and rolled my eyes because I was annoyed and hoped nobody would see, but he says 'don't have that attitude' and then I just started freaking out and crying. He allowed me to go to the bathroom to 'have a moment', but for the rest of the lesson, I hid there and cried. 

He likes to yell at this group of students who do really well when they come late. Some people laugh, but I can't tell if he's joking and his voice is so loud, it makes my bones shake. I get scared every time and he just makes that anxiety in me spike up.

Most people in my class see him as 'nice', but those are the ones who he doesn't touch. The ones like me who aren't so confident are doing badly and I'm the only one from that group who is just passing (60% is pass). Everyone else he touches (that I know of), are getting below 50%. My class is doing the year ahead because we're a top class, so we're expected to get at least over 70%. I know these people need help like me and I can feel that they can do well in maths, but like me are scared and just count down to the end of the period. I feel we all have potential, but none of us are brave enough to speak out. This is terrifying to write. I'm scared I might drop a class, but I can't ask questions. Everyone else who isn't scared of him does, and he individually helps them. It would make sense to tell the whole class because so many people don't understand what's going on. He's a really bad teacher and he gets stuff wrong when he does explain in front of the whole class and I feel like it's not proper. 

And he's British so I find it hard to know what he's saying (not trying to be rude or anything : p). And I'm now kind of scared of British people. My parents noticed my grades were dropping so I got a tutor. My luck, she's British. She's nice, but I'm just somewhat terrified and I avoid those sessions as much as possible. 

I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I'm too scared to talk to my parents. It's making school a bad place overall and my anxiety is getting so much worse. : (

During the weekend she was quite dry when she was talking to me and she didn’t want to FaceTime, so I messaged her asking if she was still interested and she said she was to start with but she’s not feeling it anymore and it wasn’t my fault cause she said she’s not good with relationships and talking and stuff, I told her I understood and we agreed to remain friends and I’m stilling going to see her this week, but I have strong feelings for her and all I can keep thinking about is if I kiss her it would change things but I know it probably won’t.

198,"TLDR; Trying to find a direction at 25. To travel or just keep mindlessly working a dead end job? 

I'm 25. 4 years ago I dropped out of university with pretty good grades to travel the world, I managed to get to about 20 countries since then. I know it sounds expensive but I did it very... Very... cheaply because I didn't have a huge amount of money. 

Anyway I don't live in my parents basement, I rent a place, I have reliable transportation, and have no debt whatsoever. Financially I am independent and extremely competent with a modest savings for a person in my position. 

Right now I work seasonal jobs that don't really progress my life other than having exceptional networking possibilities and gaining (nothing to write home about) money to invest. I activity  manage my portfolio to make a little money. But I don't have enough to make large enough gains to live off of. Though I'm net positive over the years I've done it. I do this on the side and it's probably what I want to do for a living. I'm only saying that because I enjoy investing as every day is different and I could eventually make a lot of money. Or loose it all. Either way. I'm not sure if it's a actually what I want to do. 

Lately I'm getting wanderlust pretty badly since I haven't traveled for a while and I'm not really doing anything worth talking about. I'm bored after a couple years of this seasonal job, have made all the valuable connections I can, and now it feels like a dead end. I'm just doing it for money which, to me, isn't worth the wasted time since I know I could find something more meaningful.

Ultimately I'm a very ""shoot for the stars"" kind of person. I have been lucky to grow up in a great family where there is food on the table. I do know that I want to change the world and I also want to be super wealthy so I can do what I want when I want and give back to people around the world every chance I can. Especially my parents. They don't get to do anything for themselves. Ever. But I'm not sure what to do, or how I want to do to get there. I don't mind hard work but I just don't know what to do. 

So I'm thinking maybe it's time to go on an adventure and come back refreshed with ideas, meet some inspiring people, and have a beer on a beach somewhere far away with new friends. I might not have very much money when I get back but I guess the best place to start is from zero.

203,"Hey Reddit, 

I was recently dismissed from a prestigious university when I was about to be a senior (I'm 20). I was going to school to be in the medical field, but I hated it. I was mainly there because my parents wanted me there. My downfall started last spring after a serious breakup that sent me into a downward spiral and fail multiple classes that dropped my GPA by 0.8 (putting me around a 2.2). I tried to recover myself, but didn't do well enough by taking difficult classes that just slowly started to bring my GPA down the following semester. This most recent semester, I just lost all interest. While I did exceptionally well on the majority of my exams, not going to class and forgetting due dates on assignments hurt me. 

I cannot fully blame my academics for plummeting on my breakup last year (although it did influence me destroying my GPA). My interests and passions lie elsewhere -- I do photography in the music industry (festivals, individual concerts, working at a popular club, etc.), but it's inconsistent pay and probably something I won't want to be doing in another 20 years. Can you imagine me, 40 years old, still shooting a festival full of drugged up 20 year old's? I'd always be traveling. I wouldn't have that much time for a family. I have an interest in technology and knowledge with computers as well. I have an interview at Apple coming up, but who knows if that will actually work out. I currently work part time as a server at a family restaurant in my town and have been there for over 3 years, but again, I DEFINITELY don't want to do that forever.

I'm starting to worry about what will happen now. I feel like a failure. I feel ashamed for being kicked out. The university knows my mind and heart aren't fully into academics and they think it's best for me to take some time off. They said I can reapply after the 2018/2019 Fall/Spring semesters, but I feel that they tell this to everyone who gets dismissed. I highly doubt they'd accept me again, even if I wanted to go back. I feel like I've wasted so much money and time now. I've been thrown off the standard route to success and don't know if I can pave a different path while maintaining happiness. 

Where do I go from here? ",04Jun2018,1

207,"Hi all,

So, I fell in love over the weekend two weeks ago and now I just want to get over this person.

First, I know this might sound really stupid to a lot of people since I met this person online. 

Second, I never believed in a long\-distance relationship because I knew it wasn't for me even though it has worked out for many people. However, for the following person, it was different \- I am willing to risk and get out of my comfort zone. I was ready to give it a try.

Third, there are a lot of reasons why I want to get over her but the below are the priorities: 

1. I care about her future. 
2. She probably doesn't feel the same way.
3. It could be the age difference, it's only 5 years gap but maybe 5 years from now she might want something else.

So, a bit of background story, just so you all can have an insight of what happened and why I am being such a pathetic loser!

It started out as a small like \(let's call her Leoni\) but I suppressed my feeling because I was in a serious relationship at the time \- Leoni and I still maintain contact as friends. Months gone by, I ended the relationship because me and my ex both realised things weren't working out between us after almost 10 years of being together. We both wanted different things in life and agreed to remain as good friends.

I spoke to Leoni after she heard about the breakup and she was there to talk to me and everything felt better. Months after the breakup, I managed to get the courage to ask Leoni *""If we do meet up one day, would you go on a date with me?""* since we both live in the same continent, travelling is not a problem for me. Leoni replied with *""Yes.""* and that's when our conversation becomes more meaningful, we could have deep conversations.

There was a lot of flirting and teasing, trying to get to know each other better and then I initiate the first move by visiting Leoni and meet each other for the first time. Also because there was a huge event that we both wanted to see! Keep in mind, during this phase it was still a crush/like/friend period.

When I met Leoni, she took my breath away, I didn't know how to react so I was rather awkward. Fast forward to that weekend, the day was lovely, we held hands, we kissed under the fireworks at night and I was over the moon. We were both happy. I felt something different after we shared a kiss, a mixture of happiness and warm sensation inside my chest. I can't say the same for her but at that time **I knew I was in trouble**, I fell in love with her and it was the best damn feeling ever, way better than falling in love with my ex whom I had bought a place with and was going to propose to.

Unfortunately, things didn't turn out the way we both hoped it'd be or rather, I hope it'd be. The next day reality struck Leoni first because I am an idiot and was still over the moon. She explained why it wouldn't work between us, she also mentioned that she doesn't want me to spend a lot of money visiting her \- which I do not mind at all. It was a logical explanation and therefore, I accepted it. I agreed that her education and career are far more important and I would not want to engage in a relationship with her if it would distract her from what she wants to achieve. It hurt like hell at the time and it still is. I kept my sadness to myself and held it together until the day I leave. We exchanged our goodbyes and a casual hug, I got onto the airport bus and I just broke down and cry. I know it's ridiculous but I couldn't help myself.

I thought there was something wrong with me so I flirted with a random person at the airport and had a quickie just to prove to myself that nothing was wrong with me, it was a dumb thing to do. A week has passed since the parting between us, I've been having meaningless hook up to forget about her but it didn't work, all I could think about was her, even now as I am typing this, I am thinking about her. I feel empty with a broken heart and I can't shake this feeling. I feel absolutely crap and I don't know what to do.

This feels much, much worse than ending a near 10 years relationship with my ex. I just want to pick myself back up. My friend suggested that I should get a job in the same country as her and pursue the relationship but the idea seems creepy.

I don't know what to do, I feel so lost and regret I didn't try to make it work. ",04Jun2018,1

209,"Hiya. I go by a bunch of different names, but for the sake of anonymity, call me Luna.
Today, I’m gonna tell you a story regarding my former friends. Again, for the sake of anonymity, let’s call them a, b, c, and d. a and b are dating eachother. c is my ex. d used to be dating someone we’ll call e, but our group cut e off for similar reasons they’d later cut me off. 

a, c, and I met through a rp forum that b and d would later join, and a and I didn’t exactly get along, sometimes. we disagreed over things (minor stuff, like opinions on fictional characters, ships, etc.)
about 4 or so months after we met, c asked me out and i said yes, because i liked them. 
we started dating, and a while later a cut ties with me. We just didn’t work as people, I guess. But, by then I’d grown very attached to a, and I got angry when this happened. I called him things I immediately took back and B took screenshots of it and sent them to A. I spent an entire day writing an apology and had C send it to A. (I’m not sure she did, because the apology cited in the callout post A would later write isn’t the one I sent her to send to him.) 

The damage was done, though. c broke up with me, and they all cut me off. They wrote a callout post for me which was one third things I apologized for, one third things I didn’t realize I was doing, and one third things I didn’t do at all. C was mad at me because she thought I payed A more attention than I did them, and they all accused me of having a crush on A, despite me identifying as a lesbian (and being very open about such) and A being a man. I was lost, for a few days. One of my friends, however, comforted me. Let’s call her F.

For the final part of this story, I’ll have to tell you about F.
F and I were in a roleplaying forum together before ours disbanded and I joined A and C’s. A, B, C and D didn’t like F, because they’d gotten into drama about what I don’t remember that resulted in C having a breakdown (F apologized), and before this whole thing went down A threatened to cut me off and felt ‘betrayed’ because I’d been talking to her and tried to get them to be friends with eachother.

I’ve been looking back on all of this, and I just don’t think the relationship between me and a, b, c and d was a healthy one. I don’t think I’d call it ‘abuse’, but it’s not healthy, I don’t think. F and her friends agree with me, but I’m just not sure. Do you guys think I was being used, or was it just a monster of my own creation?

213,"So it is a very lengthy story but let me just cover all of the bases quickly. Around 8 months ago I met this guy who works beside me, and ended up giving him my phone number. I told him I wanted a relationship or nothing at all because I wanted it to be less likely that I would get used by another guy. SO he agrees and we start dating and we are very happy for 4-5 months. Now here comes a few bumps- he began to grow away from me, would ignore my calls, texts, snapchats, etc. Pretend like I wasn't there. Being ignored is my BIGGEST pet peeve so it would obviously set me off BIG TIME and I would flip out and we would fight. After maybe a solid month of just argument after argument and fight after fight, I'm super over it but he invites me to come over. I came over to his place and we were talking it out and it led to us about to have sex. However, his phone dinged and he thought it was SO important that he had to get up and answer it RIGHT THEN. When he unlocked his phone, I saw some naked bitch was his home screen (it was obviously taken on his phone). I rolled over, angry, trying to think about what I was going to say when BOOM, I see a bra strap hanging out of his bedside drawer. I went OFF. Screaming and I started bawling and I hit him because I have been cheated on before but this guy was actually the first person I have ever fallen in love with and it truly hurt. So I dumped his ass and left, he calls me and texts me for hours and I don't respond because I was so upset I was literally throwing up- I had relapsed into my eating disorder. Finally, I cave and we start talking again about two weeks later and everything is being healed and we are happy again. He wouldn't take me out anywhere and lied to me telling me that he didn't have certain social media (when he did). But I was in love so I didn't care about the little details. MONTHS go by and I am out of town on a 5 day trip with my school in Florida and he keeps texting me saying he misses me and to come home, blowing my line up. I wake up the next morning and we are at a park in Disney when I check my phone to see if he opened my snap and come to find that he had blocked me on snapchat and my phone number. I started bawling at the Happiest Place on Earth and didn't stop for a few hours like I was honestly so hurt. He unblocked my number at some point and was just like ""I wasn't ready for that"" even tho all together we had been together about 9 months- isn't that a little late to say for someone who WANTED the relationship? Anyways, I was sad and depressed again and trying to cope with it. We come back from Disney and on the 18 hour bus ride I get a call. She's like ""is this Ashley"" and i was like ""yeah who tf is this"" and she explained everything.
She was his girlfriend of three years who had just found out he was cheating on her. In total, he cheated on both of us with 12 different girls in the time that he had both of us with him. I was so livid angry but she was bawling and I felt so bad- neither of us was angry at the other, we both wanted to kill him and felt stupid for getting played SO hard.
We both cried it out on the phone and actually developed a really good friendship and got close. However, she decided to take him back after all of this mess and now he's growing distant from her again- a MAJOR warning sign for him, as we both know. She refuses to think anything of it and just thinks he's been going to bed earlier and picking up more shifts at work. I told her that he's been making every attempt to see me while I'm at work and parks his car right beside mine, and will clock out and run outside so he can see me leave or go in to start my 9 hour.

In the same time I realized, athough I have always been smart and a good student, that I am extremelybeing weak and lazy and it has has been a bumper for me my whole life. Now I am stressing wether I will lose my job as a legal adviser due to a stupid mistake I probably did due to being careless about a lawsuit I lead. Last autumn I got inspired by web developing decided to study for a career shift, but depression got me in a big hole currently. the stress over work and my mistake only made things worse - I am in a pool full of self pitty, self anger, desire to runaway and cry like a baby, hide like a coward, the latter fuels self anger again, etc.

A few years ago I was like ""come at me life"" and thought I was in charge of life never felt so weak, but now I am panicking that I will never make a career, beet my mental conditions, have a fruitful realtionship with a girl and make a family - suddenly I feel unprepared to become a full-grown adult, while the thought my family is getting older is panicking me even more. I feel like I aint got no time for anything, I am scared

One month now I dont sleep well and almost dont eat. Barely jog, drink a lot of beer. I will try to drink no more than two beers a night, just like I've always been. Before this I had a walking depression for two years and I am taking meds since the end of last summer. As I mentioned I find conformity only in beer. I wil try to force my power of will, but still, I need some happiness inthis life, right, where is it...

P.S. I had violent memories from my early childhood with my father beating up my family infront my very eyes, which probably made me an anxious soul, easily-scared, but I know this is no excuse for the bad decisions I have made so far, being weak, and lazy.",04Jun2018,1

I'm cutting out this girl who I used to be extremely close to - we used to travel a lot together and have known each other for roughly 7 years, throughout high school and university. She always had this competitive side to her and she was always in competition with me, and I didn't know why. I didn't even know I was sort of in this competition with her until I slowed down and analysed all the shit she said to me. She's always wanting to be closer to the mutual friends we have, she's always jealous of when I'm hanging out with other people one-on-one, she told me that ""i won in our circle of friends"" when i got offered this job opportunity, she tried to pit other friends against me. I was going through a really rough time and still am, and she was condescendingly telling out mutual friend that at least she isn't as lonely as I am because at least she has her dogs????  She's also incredibly ableist and it seems like whatever I do, she will put herself in her OWN competition with me and wants to outdo me in everything, esp. with friendships and trying to be other people's #1 best friend.

And it was for about 15% less. It’s a fair amount but not enough to significantly change things. 

I told them I wanted to discuss it with my family before accepting and I would give them an answer Monday. 

I told my girlfriend and she said, “do what you think is best.” If this was any of my previous girlfriends I would have seen it as a red flag, but she has always shared with me exactly what was one her mind. 

I accepted the job today, and told my girlfriend. Now she’s expressing her feelings about it, and they are not positive.

When it first happened we asked extended family for help. We were all going through rough patches and the rough patch has been extended due to an inevitable break down in our house A/C unit. We're barely getting by, but we can absolutely pay a family member back, collectively if we have to. 

This has been going on for years. I know they know about this and they blame us for not keeping up with the family anymore. Currently we have one extended family member asking for our help?! I'm not sure she thought that through. I'm not sure they think anything through, honestly. I'm hurt, I'm quite miserable, and I have no idea how to get out of it myself. I thought about moving out on my own to live with a roomie, but I feel like that's the equivolent of what my extended family is doing by not helping us out. If I took care of myself then maybe my family would eventually save enough to get things together? I don't want to abandon what's left of my family. 

This would all be fine, but we live in Texas. Technically it's not even summer yet and it's already unbearable. It affects my sleep and I'm already anemic, fatigue is the bestfriend I didn't want.

246,"First, I'll say that I suffer from bad social anxiety, depression, OCD, and tics.

So my friends are all planning on going to the beach today just after lunch and staying until around midnight. Weed and alcohol will be present. Sometimes when they are under the influence, they sort of hook up with each other which makes me extremely uncomfortable. Especially because I always feel someone will go with my crush. Like seeing someone hug her or stand close to her just kills me. I am also extremely paranoid of the police coming, even though parties like this happen almost every night at this beach and they do not seem to care much. All these feelings alone make me not want to go.

On the other hand, I get bad FOMO, I think as a result of the anxiety and OCD. Not going would kill me as well.

247,"Hey Reddit, I posted a while ago about my husband lying about liking porn. Y'all said to leave it alone but I ended up confronting him about it anyway and shit absolutely blew up..

To start with, he completely lied about it. He said he had it just to have it that he never looked at it and would only look at it if we got interrupted or if I were gone..ok.....so I let it go. For about a week anyway, and then I asked him why he was subscribed to so much if he never looked at it, and he said again just to have it that he never looked at it, and that he'd only just gotten it all within the month. 

I let it go again, until it got the better of me and I looked at his old Reddit account (a year old) and he had porn on it to, including saved videos and whatnot. So I confronted him about it and he said he didn't know why, and that he was just scared I would hate him over looking at it. Which is stupid because I've told him I don't care as long as we're open with each other! 

We spent that entire weekend fighting about it, and it turns out he's been watching porn and jacking off almost every day for over a year. Even though we have sex almost every day, and I try to make sure he's always satisfied. He's even turned me down to go jack off. He said I made him feel unwanted even though I've tried everything to make him want me again because he's been acting like he's only intimate with me because he has to be. He even watched porn to get turned on and then had sex with me, which is the only time in months he's initiated sex. He jacks off at work and then comes home and I have sex with him. He texts me while jacking off and never mentioned it, and he comes home and looks me in the eyes and lies to me. 

So I asked him about it one more time, and he said I told him no once or twice right after I had a d&amp;c after our first miscarriage before we got married and that's why he's been jacking off so much. Even though I always try to have sex with him. I've went out of my way to try and put him in the mood but he said I was never into it. That he jacked off to keep from getting sexually frustrated even though we NEVER go more than a day or two without sex and often go more than once a day. 

I got drunk and told him I would never talk to him about it again but it bothers me so bad, I don't know what to do. I feel like when he looks at me he pretends I'm someone else, and I always wonder when he's in the bathroom what he's doing now. When before I would have thought it was hot that he was helping himself it now makes me feel like I'm going to throw up and I can't breath when I think about it. He's at work right now and I can't help but wonder what he's doing and if he's going to look at porn all day and jack off. 

I don't know what to do, guys. I feel disgusting and like my whole marriage was a lie. What can I do to get over this? This has been going on since before we got married and I've been stupid enough to think everything was fine that he's just tired from work is why he never wants sex or why he doesn't spend time with me anymore. Help please?

Also, I've been running myself into the ground this past week, I've been having sex even when I didn't want to just so he would be satisfied, I've been initiating it two or three times a day to make him feel good because I'm scared if I don't he'll feel unwanted again and lie to me again. What can I do?

248,"I've never been here before but I need advice on some family problems. Some of this is very personal but I know you need the full story. Please don't judge me. 

I am an 18 year old female and about to graduate high school and go to college far away. My parents have always been very controlling and don't really believe in me. This largely stems from my mental health issues. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I have a history with self harm and attempted suicide a few times in middle school. However, I have been doing very well recently. I haven't self harmed since right before 9th grade with one exception in 10th grade. However, they still are afraid of something happening again, which is reasonable. But they take it to extremes. They view me as a porcelain doll that will break under the smallest amount of stress. They constantly try to control me in many ways. 

One way they've done this is not letting me take a full course load in 10th or 11th grade. I was already credit deficient due to auditing the last quarter of 9th grade to be treated for an eating disorder I'd had since 6th grade but was just diagnosed in 9th grade. Because of this, I had a lot to do senior year. I had to pass a full course load and take extra classes. This has been very stressful, especially as the end of the year approaches, and my parents have only made it work. They tried to micromanage me and we had fights, sometimes to screaming, almost every night. This made home a **VERY** stressful environment and I couldn't work well. 

The last fight happened at the same time as me having massive problems with a teacher bullying me and being overall awful. The morning after the fight, my school counselor, who I get along well with, started digging into me over going to the principal about an unethical request from her and another teacher, upsetting me even more. A bit later, the problem teacher went off on me and said, among other things, that she wouldn't interact with me anymore and that I'm a whiny brat. At this point, I couldn't take it anymore. I left school  to kill myself. After being unable to run into the busy intersection by my school, I went to a train station nearby. Again, I couldn't take the steps. My fiancé and future mother in law (FMIL) picked me up there. 

Since then, I've been staying with them so I'm in a less stressful environment and able to get the work done that I need to to graduate. The plan was to go back to my parents after I graduate. However, as my FMIL talked with my family, she realized what a terrible environment I was in. After talking with her husband, they offered to let me stay with them until it's time to leave for college. I'll admit, I was tempted. But I wasn't considering it. I don't want to give up on a relationship with my parents. But today they told my FMIL that they don't think I should make my own choices. They also told her I have Aspergers. I don't. I was tested for it in 10th grade but it was decided that I don't. Despite this, apparently it's contributed to how they treat me. 

It's now apparent to me that they don't see me as an adult or even my own person. They are so stuck on my past they refuse to see how I've grown and changed. They have no trust or faith in me whatsoever. To them, I'm just a helpless doll that has to be protected at all costs. I've been living like that for years and have always held out hope I could prove otherwise to them. I see now that any change in that view isn't coming anytime soon, if at all. I don't want to go back to living like that. I was miserable! With my fiancé and his family, I'm supported, trusted, safe, and I feel loved. I'm happy here. After I realized things won't change with my parents and exactly how bad things are, I'm strongly considering packing the rest of my things and taking my fiancé's family up on their uoffer to stay with them. 

However, this has some complications. I'm fairly dependent on them finically. I plan on getting a job over the summer but it won't cover everything. I don't have to pay for food or rent at my fiancé's but there's other expenses. With my medical problems, I have multiple medications and I need semi-regular appointments. I rely on them paying the copays for those. I'm also worried about the possibility of them dropping me from their insurance, which would screw me over majorly. I was also going to be getting a new phone soon since  mine is dying. They might not pay for that if I leave. They also might drop me from their plan. I'd have a long commute for work and can only reach my fiancé and his family by email when they're at home so I need a phone I can email from. 

I'd like some outside input so I'm here. Should I get out of a terrible situation where I can't be my own person, or go back my parents just because they're my parents and I need their finical support? Any input and advice would be great. Thank you. 

(Yes I'm 18 and engaged. No I'm not pregnant and I don't have a child. I am not looking for any advice or opinions on this. Any will be ignored and anyone telling me I need to call of the engagement will be blocked. If it gets bad enough I'll just delete this post which I don't want to do.

1. Looks. I honestly don't look that bad, but when I look at the mirror I can see all the imperfections, and I feel like I am so ugly, and I compare myself with people that I consider beautiful.
2. Self\-confidence really reduced. I don't see lot of good things in my life, in a week I have exams, really important ones. I try to focus on it, but I feel depressed, sad, broken. This thing happens sometimes, this feeling that I have, once a week. And it is enough to make me not wanna do anything for at least 1\-2 days.

My family lived in a duplex in Stockton, Califonia for 10 years, but then our landlord kicked us out with a 60 day warning due to them having to remodel the house after our neighbors called the home authorities on them.

To the point where the termite infestion got so bad she called the home authorities and they failed they house.) Now the 60 days are over and we have moved out and started paying for another lease. We put our old sofas, mattresses, and bagged up trash and put it in the front yard and garage. 

This morning I received a text from her that she wants us to move out the stuff on the front yard or we will be charged by city. She says that hiring someone will cost extra money so she would charge us for it because its and I quote ""too much money for me"".

When people refer to me as not him I actually feel so annoyed. I avoid socialising because anyone I meet would know that I wasn't Mike. I'm very happy and perfectly normal otherwise I have a lot of hobbies etc and even go to gigs on occasions. I message a friend who usually goes along with it (he refers to me as Mike etc )
All my social media accounts are all as Mike Dirnt. If people accuse them of being fan accounts I block them.    
When my parents ask questions about green day ie when are they next on tour etc I desperately try and change the subject and get annoyed (because it's when are 'THEY' on tour rather than when are 'YOU' on tour)   
I recently a posted a pic of myself on instagram wearing a vest and trilby. I know Deep down I look absolutely nothing like Mike but somehow I think people won't notice this because I AM Mike Dirnt so it won't even matter that I don't look like him if that makes sense.
Recently my dad made a joke that I wasn't a proper green day fan as I didn't know what number a song was on one of their CDS. I felt extremely embarrassed and annoyed and raced to play the song after saying ""I'm not a fan I'm Mike "" 
I felt seriously offended how can he not know who I really am. 
Mike Dirnt is 45. When people mention my real name and age I'm enraged. Not because I dislike being so young but because I'm not 45 as Mike Dirnt is.

This may be weird but I'm never letting go of Mike. Maybe in some way I really am him.
A few other points....
1.l when playing songs on the bass I insist on only playing Green Day songs. I don't think of as it as covering the songs because they My songs and therefore I'm only rehearsing.
2. I managed to rope in a friend to play a gig in school in about a month. (He'll be singing ) I convinced him that we don't need to rehearse at all (we've never played any of the songs together at all ) we are both fairly good at singing /playing bass so with practice we could do them but of course I am Mike Dirnt and therefore he's Billie Joe Armstrong so we're green day and have played these songs millions of times before and don't need to rehearse.
3. I spend a decent percentage of the day filling out paid online surveys  (I earn about 5c a day) it's to buy studs you see (ie metal studs to put on my vests you see .)
4. I didn't become Mike because I didn't like being my real self. I just found him to be such a hero that I turned into him.",04Jun2018,0

255,"So last year, I was out partying and got pretty drunk. Had a great time and it was an awesome night. I get home and get into bed straight away. I had some pictures up on Snapchat and someone messaged me saying they thought I was ""hot"" or whatever. I'm still pretty drunk at this stage so I engage in conversation with this person, who I believed to be a girl.  We start talking and almost immediately, ""she"" starts asking me to send nudes. Before I could say anything back, they send me a nude video. I was pretty horny and so I sent a video back of me jerking off... I asked them to send some pics but they said their camera was broken and me being drunk, I believed them, however I started to panic a little bit because I thought their behaviour was strange, so I blocked them.

So a few months go by and I completely forget about what happened, until I'm out with my friends and they start talking about some local guy that had a fake account and was cat-fishing people. They said the same username of the person that I sent a video to. My heart sank. I was terrified. It's been a few months since I found out who it was and every now and then I'll worry about what could happen.

My face wasn't in the video but I'm still worried about the person sending it around. What can I do to stop this pain?",04Jun2018,1
256,"I'm the average gamer nerd which can't really socialize a lot and I'm kind of the laughingstock of my class ever since I fall in the loser category. I have no self esteem and most times you can find me depressed when I'm alone, with no company in my gaming time. 

As a backstory, I was never alone up until now. I always had someone to play with me, someone to laugh with and all that. Even when my ex broke up with me some time ago. Everyone used to hang out with me from time to time, but lately, I've been getting the feeling they've been avoiding me. 

I feel like I'm too clingy, that I shouldn't worry about this and that I shouldn't really mind that no one is really hanging out with me, but I can't seem to find a way to deal with this. Do you guys have some hints on how to deal with this kind of stuff?

257,"I am the youngest of my father’s children.  The other kids are my half siblings.  He is leaving them his home.  Recently, he had me go to the bank to add my name to his checking account.  That money is to pay for his funeral and any outstanding bills after he dies.  This will be my responsibility and the left over money is for me.  Anyway,  the reason my father did this is because I am the only one that is self sufficient and does not ask him for money.   He trusts that I won’t touch the money.  My issue is this, the house is very old and needs a new sewer system etc.   I know my siblings are going to try to get me to use that money to fix up the house to sell.   Also, the heating etc.,because my brother lives there and my father pays his bills.  My father is old and does not want to revisit his will.    My siblings don’t know I have been put on his checking account.   Is that money safe since he did this while he is alive and it’s now in my name as well?

258,"I got my results of a career deciding exam today. I fell into depression (due to various reasons) midway during my preparation. With a month and a half left, I didn’t study. Just stopped completely. I was sleeping 18 hours a day, trying to sleep my time off. I felt suicidal and kinda hopeless. I would try to study but would forget what I read very soon. Had zero concentration and was unmotivated to do anything really. 
So, I knew I wouldn’t qualify this year and was planning on attempting it again next year (in 2019). 

Although I knew I would score low, the results hit me like a train. My mom told me I was a failure and I should stop trying. She said that I’ll fail again next year and that I wasted their money for tuition already. I told my dad my score and he hung up instantly. Said he didn’t want to talk to me.

I was crying the whole day and still am. Have a massive headache and haven’t left my my room since. Really sucks having everyone tell me I’m worthless and there’s no point in me trying again. I really want to pursue my dream of being a doctor. I don’t think I’ll be happy to settle in any other profession. I’m not a complete dumbass and studied well until I got depressed.

Usually, I see my therapist once a week. I tolerate my sociopath family for that week and the anxiety that builds up and I let it out  with him, then he gives me advice and I feel much better.

Now, this friend of mine has this girl that hes been dating that lives 8 hours away from us that he met on a boys trip to her home town in late 2017.

If I wasn’t already super intimidated by her before, she asked me to come see her band play a show the other night and now I’m just totally floored by her.

But I’m also significantly younger and she’s always busy at work, so I’m afraid of bothering her while she’s working because that’s really the only chance I get to talk to her during the day. I just really badly want to be better friends with her and don’t know how to go about it!

274,"Background information: So my junior year high school just ended, normally I would try to solve this internally rather than asking for advice, but I'm at the end of my wisdom. After talking to this girl pretty much all year, and finding that we had similar interests, and that she actually found me entertaining. I only decided that I liked her pretty much the last week of school. I tried to ask her out the last day, but lost my testicles and decided not to. So a day or two after school, I worked up the courage to ask her out to a Marvel Movie \(her favorite genre\) and to my surprise received a yes. We watched it yesterday, everything seemed to go great, I laughed, she laughed,  she appeared to be just as socially awkward as me. Everything appeared to be good, We were talking afterwards and having one of our normal conversations when I said ""I suppose this is the obligatory moment were I say: Wowee I enjoyed that, would you like do this again sometime?"" And her response was as previously stated ""Eeeeeeee"", I'm not good with people so rather that press her for an actual answer, we both joked about the following awkward silence, and like an idiot I went to talking about the movie, this went on until my ride picked me up. I'm not irritated or anything, I'm not entitled to a relationship, and I think complaining about the ""friendzone"" is pointless and annoying, but I'm at a loss here, I have difficulty reading people, and understanding hints, but I'm quite certain my invitation didn't imply an ""as friends"" date. I don't no why she would accept my first request, if she didn't have an inclination to go on more, and if it was a test date, I also don't know how I could of watched a movie wrong.

275,"Hello,

  So recently, I’ve noticed that I find myself getting annoyed with and judging people for many things that I do myself. I want to give a couple examples so that you guys can understand what I mean exactly. I work part-time at Chick-fil-A and I often judge people’s orders that I take because I think it’s gross that they eat like that and I assume that they also go to McDonald’s every day and eat like crap. Honestly I’m in really good shape but I too eat there once a week or so and I don’t always eat a healthy diet. I have an extremely hard time acknowledging the fact that I do this.

   Another time I was up in bed before my girlfriend so I got on my iPad and played a game until she woke up. The next morning I wake up to her on her phone texting and I get really annoyed and it bothered me in my head a lot about how she was sitting there on her phone and what she had to do that was so important. I ended up just annoying her a lot. This is an issue in many cases with her as I have a hard time realizing when I’m annoyed for no reason. There are many things that she can do that bother me for reasons that they shouldn’t actually.

What are some things that I can do to either stop getting annoyed or to at least work towards it? Because I’m having a hard time stopping myself even in the rare case that I do realize... it’s like I stop thinking rationally and I’m just fighting my natural feelings.

We recently got a puppy and have been working on potty training him, so we take him out to the designated grass area. Well last week, I noticed a strip of what looked like tar with peanuts with some kind of white substance powdered inside, some strange little seed things (kind of looked like bird seed), and huge glass shards stuck to it. This was in the grass right by where people let their dogs out. It was obviously deliberately placed there because the area for the dogs is very small. I talked to the couple that lives next door to us about it because they have a dog as well and they were very angry about it. The next day, the little strip was gone.

Embarrassing and awkward situation. Long story short, I was recently on an nine hour trip via train. During that time, I got a little frisky and decided to take some time in the bathroom to... well, you know. :\ 

Anyways, I work in an office. We're a pretty tech-oriented company, and I usually have my phone connected to the company WiFi. It's been about a week since my trip and I noticed today that I could no longer access WiFi on my phone - I got an error that said I had been blocked.

I only explanation I can think of is that I still had the porn open in a tab on my phone browser. I had just forgotten to close it, and I've been back in town for a few days - so I wonder if my phone had been trying to reload the porn every time I opened my browser.

In any case, I don't think they can connect the phone to me because I have a unique name for my phone vs. Blah's iPhone. 

I don't necessarily need to access WiFi on my phone, but at the same time I want to be mindful of how much data I'm using. To get my phone unblocked, I imagine I would have to speak with IT, and I don't know if that's a conversation I want to have. ",04Jun2018,1

283,"Im 18 this year and I’m halfway through my first semester in an information technology diploma. I feel like this is one of the worst choices ill ever make (enrolling into college without clearly knowing what i wanted to do) as I realised i wanted to do something more science related (loved the subjects in high school) such as engineering.

I’ve tried and tried to get myself to like the course I’m currently taking but it just doesn’t really appeal to me.
I also have thought about dropping out and pursuing another course as it would be worse to drop out in the later semester since tuition fees are so expensive and my parents are about to retire in a year or two. Well, money is still wasted by dropping out from the first semester too.. :/ I honestly feel extremely terrible to be wasting my parents hard earned money like this but also feel depressed on a course that I do not like. 

A little backstory on how i joined the course. It was the season where everyone starts college including my friends. So i guess I felt a little pressured to enrol in college too as my parents scolded me for not being able to decide on a course which leads me to choosing information technology. IT was always one of my choices though. It was always between IT and engineering but i felt discouraged at that time as people have told me how hard it would be in the latter. Which I regret on not taking on the challenge. I lose the motivation in my current course as one of the factors is that it was not what i expected. I had an emotional breakdown 2 weeks in my course and told myself that I’ll give it time and it’ll get better. But guess it didn’t..

That being said, what would be the best thing to do about this? So far I’ve thought of the following
-Continue in the course although ill still regret it deeply in the future..?
-Dropping out and joining another course?
-Dropping out and find a job for the time being to earn back some of the wasted tuition fees and think about what to do?

Sorry for the long post. Any comments would be appreciated and do let me know if theres somethings i should’ve stated but didn’t
Thanks!

I have anxiety through the roof and I am a complete social retard. I have friends (all female) but I don't see them very often anymore. I have a weight problem which bothers me a lot. I think I may be bipolar or borderline as well. My childhood sucked. 


My parents got divorced when I was five and I rarely saw my dad. My mom cheated on my dad with my step-dad who is an alcoholic and doesn't have a filter for his mouth and can be very cunning with shit he says and got pregnant. Something ended up happening and my step-dad went to jail and then prison for four years. After this happened my mom became the town slut (I'm not being sarcastic or kidding around) and drank a lot. 


We were pretty poor and I was reminded of that on a daily basis. Okay so yeah I had food to eat, clothes on my back, and a roof over my head which I should be grateful for. However, I guess I never felt loved or wanted. Honestly out of all my moms kids I felt like she cared about me the least. I always felt left out. I mean I remember once I asked if she and I could go to the store alone and the entire time she was like ""I miss my babies (my younger brother and sister). Why didn't you let me bring them along?"" This happened like 14 years ago and I still remember this. I felt like she didn't give a flying fuck about me at all. Hey mom thanks for not giving a fuck about me. 


I'm 23 now and I still feel unwanted and unloved by everyone. Seriously I have guys interested in me on pof but I just seem to get friendzoned or used when they see me in person. I just hate myself with a passion all the time. I'm always like ""why doesn't anyone want to be with me? Why am I not good enough? Why does everyone seem to hate me?""

I have relocated to a new city for school, I don't know many people here except for a friend and my boyfriend. I have to move out of my apartment and possibly in with my boyfriend. But the really stressful thing is money. I have been searching for a job and I get interviews, but I just can't seem to find something that sticks. I have a few upcoming interviews, but I am a generally shy person. I have a hard time coming across as outgoing and really social. Any tips? Any advice? I just hate sitting around and job searching all day. ",04Jun2018,1
289,"Hi there, looking for some advice/suggestions regarding my current birthday ""drama"".

So first of all, I don't hate birthdays. I just don't think it's super important to celebrate, since it's just like any other day for me. I also don't really enjoy when people make a big deal out of it and behave like it's the most special day of the year - makes me feel uncomfortable for the most part.

It has always been like this for me, even as a kid. I like parties, I like cakes, I like presents - but tbh I could do without as well. And if I'd be alone on my birthday and no one would give me a call, I'd be fine with it because I really don't mind. I'm not the kind of person that gets bad about these things.

For about two weeks now, friends and family have been asking when I'll be hosting the party, what they should get me etc. I'm turning 27 this year, so it's not even a special in any way. I also have a big exam in three weeks and still need to study and I'm not sure I'd be able to enjoy any celebration before that. I told everyone I won't be celebrating this week, but rather in a month maybe, though I also said I might just skip it this year, no big deal imho.

It isn't even the first time I'm doing this, so not sure what's wrong, but this year everyone is super disappointed or even mad at me for not celebrating (respectively postponing). My older brother is super pissed for whatever reason and refuses to talk to me about it. My mom is mad because she wants to come over just to hang out, but I don't even have time because I'll be studying all day and also will have to take an extra shift at work (which is fine with me). Some friends said they think I'm being extra and should just stop pretending being busy and other friends are either concerned that I'm depressed, while yet others think I just don't want to invite them to my secret bday party.

At this point, I'm just not sure what to do anymore. I explained to everyone in detail why it just isn't a good time this year, etc. but no one seems to care. I'm currently even considering ditching my weekend plans (flying to NYC to visit a good friend I haven't seen in two years) just to please the people around me.

I'm so confused. I really didn't expect this. Also, surprise parties are not a thing in my social circles. In fact, everyone is expecting me to host a party, either at home or at a nice place.

How would you guys deal with this? Any suggestions? Did you have similar situations? If so, how did you manage it and what were the reactions like?",04Jun2018,1
290,"So I have this job interview tomorrow for an associate at a makeup counter at the mall. My only other jobs I’ve ever had were working in a grocery store bakery for a few years about until 3 years ago which I kinda had help from someone I know to get this job (which I absolutely hated mainly because it was so boring because I never had enough or if at all any work to do during my shifts and was told half the time to just find something to do to make me look like I was working and not standing around) and then I figured what career I wanted to go to school for but I had to quit this job to go. I went to esthetician (skincare/waxing/facials etc.) school since the school was only full time and I couldn’t do both school and work. I graduated the school in ‘16 and didn’t get a job till this past November which was at a small spa doing facials, waxing and stuff. Then only about 4 months into it I got fired basically for no complete reason or explanation. 

Now I have another interview tomorrow and I’m so nervous not necessarily about the interview but because of how much I hated my grocery bakery job and I’d never have any work to do because the previous people already did all of it before my shift and it just made the shifts drag on and on and I can’t stand for the life of me being bored with nothing to do and you obviously can’t use your phones or anything to help time pass faster. That’s mainly the one reason why I’ve waited so long to even apply for a job after esthetician school. 

Any advice? I’m like so nervous about this!",04Jun2018,1
291,"I just moved into an apartment building located a half mile from the downtown area of my city. The area itself is nice in pockets and dangerous in pockets. I am in what is listed as one of the 10 most dangerous areas of the city. 

I'm looking for info on what might be the most common things to look out for, ways I might be putting myself at risk, and basic self defense. At this point I do not have the funds to live in a nicer place and just signed a year lease. 

I am not looking for advice on how to get out of this place, only how to stay safe while I am there. I am in a fourth level apartment in a pretty dilapidated building. I have a front entrance to the building from the main road and a gated parking lot and stairwell from the back.

This is an area where I won't be going outside alone at night or opening my door to strangers. My car is already bare to avoid being broken into and I move quickly from my car to my house and vice versa. There are some friendly and unfriendly people in the immediate area.

292,"I’m not sure if this is the right group to post this type of question🤷🏼‍♀️ I just feel like a 5 year old asking this question so I thought it would fit. I just moved into my house 2 months ago, and my house becomes almost infested by earwigs every night. It’s literally driving me insane. I’m 8 months pregnant and it literally makes me cry when I can’t even sit the hell down and relax because I see earwigs all over my living room. I will have a brand new baby here in a month and there’s ear wigs all over my house, even in my baby’s room. I know they aren’t dangerous but it’s still disgusting, and I also know that it’s just the beginning of summer so bugs start trying to escape the heat. But this is beyond anything I’ve dealt with before! It is my worst nightmare. It’s a horror movie. It begins, every single night around 10pm when the crawlers wake up, I start seeing a few random ones around the tops of walls, around the front and back door, or crawling on the ground. I start killing them and throwing them away. As the night goes on, there will be like 5-10 of them in an area near each other. I have no idea where the hell they come from, they just start appearing. I do notice them coming in through the cracks of my front and back doors though... apparently my doors don’t have a seal under it like newer houses. Anyways, as the night goes on, it gets to be too much of them to kill. I can’t even relax because I’m constantly running around killing bugs like a crazy chick. I feel like a huge waddling Ghostbuster running around with my bug sprayer and hose attachment spraying bugs. 

I’ve tried that bug spray that you can use indoor and outdoor, around the perimeter of house and door frames and such. In the 2 months, I’ve literally sprayed the entire outside of my house 3 times (even though it says it’s good for 12 months, and I’m not in a super rainy climate) They seem to like collecting on my porches so I have literally doused them like 4 times. I’ve also been spraying the inside of my house, more concentrated where the bugs are, like 3 times a WEEK. I know the stuff works somewhat because I start finding dead ones for a few days after. I’m getting worried about using it so much because I don’t want the fumes to affect me/baby and my animals. 

Possible solutions.. I plan on bug bombing entire house and underneath house when I finish unpacking all my boxes and organizing baby’s room (the bugs like to collect and hide under boxes and stuff) but doesn’t solve the problem of more and more coming in from outside?! Should I contact my landlord or would that be silly? He’s not the best, most proactive landlord anyways.... ",04Jun2018,1
293,"Hi everyone. This might be a complicated question, so I thought I'd split it into three different categories. The back story is that my boyfriend recently got a promotion at his work to move to the other side of the state we live in. We've been living together for 3 years and together for 5 years. We are both 24 years old. Here are the reasons I am unsure about relocating with him:

1) I have a good job where we currently live at a university. Although I don't want to be here forever, the city we are currently in has better job opportunities for me and the job market is more saturated. I could find a job where he is moving to, I'm sure, but it would be much more difficult to find something in my field. 

2) We have been in a rough patch for the past 6 months due to my concerns with his drinking habits. He drinks too much too often and I've brought it up with him multiple times. He agrees he has a problem and has gotten a bit better about it. He will hardly drink during the week anymore but on the weekends he'll end up getting so drunk that he passes out with lights on, leaves food out that he was in the middle of making, and leaves messes everywhere. I usually have to get up and bring him to bed from the couch.

3) I have recently been talking with an ex of mine - I know this isn't the most mature thing to do, trust me. Him and I dated about 4 years ago for quite a while and we had to break up due to location. He has always held a special place in my heart and with this rough patch going on, it's nice to be able to talk to him. Now I feel like I'm at a cross roads where I want to be with him but have to think about my future with the guy I'm currently with.

This is all so complicated and I don't know what to do. That's why I'm here asking for advice. Any advice you have would be appreciated and thank you for reading this. ",04Jun2018,1

295,I found that I have a lot of difficulty being confident in myself in making my own decisions in that I unconsciously look to check with someone else until I get the OK that my decision is sound and is adequate enough. I learned this was really a problem when one of my friends told me that I don't have to ask their permission to make decisions in a friendly way. Is there anything that would be helpful that would help address this and help build confidence in making my own decisions without double-checking with a peer?,04Jun2018,1
296,"I'm essentially just confused and feel pretty lost overall on how to continue after college. For reference, I graduated from a large university with a Bachelors of science in neuroscience with no intent of ever pursuing medical school and maybe pursuing a masters later in a different subject (possibly biomedical engineering or computer science). The possible masters decision came during my final year of school, where it would have made zero sense to switch degrees and spend 4 more years there so I just took the Bachelors for what it was, a certificate saying I completed a four-year degree with no hope of the actual content helping me very much (the fact that I at least have a Bachelors is not lost on me)

In my own mind, I have done a pretty piss poor job of setting myself up for the workforce in general over college, no academic research to speak of, no internships because I was mostly school oriented and my degree program didn't require one, I never attended any job fairs (I have no excuse for this, just poor decisions and laziness), and to top it off I was (formally at least) in zero clubs. I regret all of this but try not to dwell on it as that does nothing to help the situation I currently find myself in. I did, however, hold a job for 3 years throughout school that involved heavy customer service oriented talents and some light security. I became a supervisor at this job during my last year and have just left it to pursue.... something else.

The crux of my problem lies in that I want to try and get involved in the technology field, and maybe eventually work with A.I, but have zero skills in this area. I am slowing working towards learning about tech and finding free online help guides to direct my learning, currently I'm learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and have started learning basic in Python but am at a loss for what I can do with any of it since I'm so fresh and people want experienced workers. I still just feel overwhelmingly incompetent in everything.

I welcome any advice people can give me because I feel extremely lost and dejected at the moment. If this would be a better post somewhere else, please let me know that as well, I mostly lurk so am not up to snuff on these things.",04Jun2018,1

I get married on Friday to my lovely partner, we have been together for almost 9yrs, 2 children and very happy. The bit I’m not looking forward to is the wedding, is this normal does anyone else feel this way? It’s not that I don’t want to marry him, it’s that fact of being in front of people aka our families. Some members of the family are shall we say nightmares and to be honest nothing is good enough for them. I originally wanted to get married abroad and just be us but it was unfair to some family I do want to be there to be apart of it. It is going to be a simple wedding and just drinks and nibbles after, no speeches, no sit down meal, no free bar ( we are on a small budget). I’m not worried about what people think of it, it’s what people will say to me....and I know they will speak their minds to me, belittling me.

299,"So 2 weeks ago I was at a party enjoying myself. I was having a good time until someone came up to me and told me their friend wanted to fight me. I learnt after that the reason he wanted to fight was because I was being rude to him, however I have never spoke to him in my life. He was waiting for me outside of the party but I left at a good time so he didn’t see me. When he couldn’t find me, he took my friends phone and rang me, I didn’t answer. He hasn’t messaged me since, which implies he doesn’t really want to fight and it was just to get attention or whatever at the party. However I see him out with his friends sometimes when I’m also out. It puts me on edge and I get really paranoid. How can I avoid the fight? Does he still want to fight me? 
P.S.  I’m a pretty strong 14 year old male and he is 13. I will still defend myself if the fight does occur but I want to try and avoid it. ",04Jun2018,1

Well, come the end of the test, he starts to hassle me about the fact I was getting nervous during the question about drug sales. Now, I have never even come close to doing drugs let alone ever sold them. I stuck to my answers and told him I was telling the truth and he says I have a chance of not passing the polygraph if he sends the results off to pre-employment without that dispute resolved. It was left at that and I shook his hand and he told me I'd have the results in 5 business days.

302,"I work as an assistant in a special needs classroom. The teacher I work with is 26 and is heavily dependent on her mother for money, even though she makes a salary. She has asked me several times to borrow money as well as the other assistant in our classroom. 

The year is almost over and last Thursday, she left early for an appointment for her daughter. When she left, I used her computer to check my email. I noticed she had her Facebook logged in and open and there was an active chat box up. I admittedly snooped and opened the chat log. She was chatting with someone and asked for “hydros” and negotiating prices and times to meet. Basically, she left school to buy drugs. 

Now, she has already been fired for plenty of other reasons and she is actively looking for jobs in other districts. Again, we work with special needs children. I feel like it wouldn’t do much if I told my principal what I saw since she is already fired. What if I anonymously called the schools she has interviewed with and told them?

She takes care of the kids and the house, and he is gone all week for ""work."" When he comes home for the weekend, he's drunk. I went to pick him up Friday and he started drinking in my car. He constantly asks me to take him places because he lost his license due to drinking and driving. I don't mind taking him to do things he needs to do, but he'll ask to go to the store and tells me to stop at several places along the way. He gave me money for gas, which I desperately needed, but it doesn't nearly cover the amount I use taking him places and I barely have enough to get to work and back now. The last night he was here, he had vodka in coke and gave his and our toddler a drink. I told our daughter to stay away from it. He's crazy as fuck and I have no idea how he'll react if I say something to him because he's always drunk. I feel like if I don't learn how to put my foot down, he's going to get me into legal trouble, but I don't want to rock the boat. The last time I gave him a ride, he told me to pull into the driveway of an abandoned house. He got out and tried to kick the door down, but couldn't.

307,"So this will take a bit to explain

Im male 20, and I'm not gay, but i like to pleasure myself with gitly things, dildos being one of them, and just wearing lingerie in general.

I always did this stuff in secret, so as far as i know my parents might have a hint that i wear lingerie every now and then from seeing my mail orders and card activity from online purchases, but otherwise I've bought dildos with gift cards and cash.

So I'm finally home for the summer from college, and we packed my car to the brim with stuff, as well as a company car (my dad owns a dealership) which my dad's co-worker helped us bring everything home. So MY car, i stashed away the dildo underneath the tarp i use to cover my car, here's the problem;

So my dad's co-worker instead of taking my car directly home, (it was on a trailer, i did not drive it, i flew back home earlier to meet friends for a birthday) He took it to the dealership because it needed the AC fixed. He thought it was a good idea to unload the entire car, and pack it into the company car. So upon doing that, he took the tarp out, and what did he find; my 12 inch giant dildo just sitting back there...

So this hasn't been talked about by anyone, and he must have just thrown it away because when the company car got home, everything from my car was in it, except the dildo. I didn't think he'd take the tarp out because it wasn't anything that i initially packed for school like it's just from the car, but alas.

So idk what to do. Nobody has brought it up but I'm not sure if he's told my parents about it or anything? I guess I should just ignore it and move on?

I have severe depression and am struggling with alcoholism. No one knows because oddly enough I’m very sociable and charismatic when around people. It’s easy to play that part, to turn on a smile and pretend.

I do not have a close family. They’re the type that text on your birthday if they remember at all. I haven’t spoken to my parents and most of my siblings in years. The sister I still talk to is a narcissist so when we “talk” it’s literally me sitting there listening to her or me being ignored.

My closest friends moved away \(or I did\) and we no longer have the same relationships. Mostly because they have marriages, kids, or serious relationships now, and I’m still single. They already have a close partner in which to confide and filled in my role. I’m not jealous of or upset with them. It’s just life. It’s moved on without me.

I don’t have the same bond with the friends that are here. I can’t have deep conversations with them. I’ve tried to reach out and it’s been ignored. They mostly want brunches, and boardgame nights, and more smiling and pretending.

One of the decisions having the result that she could suffer less \(and her dying sooner\) by refusing antibiotics for her lungs. I hope that I did the right thing for her.

Everyone has the chance to process this but I am still stuck. I am the only one living in this country so I am the one who has to take take care of all the paperwork \(something that this country seems to suck at\). I feel drained, I don't know how to deal with all of this.

My boyfriend and I are starting to have problems too, or at least I am. We have a long distance relationship for 3 years now and I am missing the support that I need now.  I feel like I cannot talk to him and that even if I do that he simply doesn't understand. It happens quite often that if I search his support that I feel worse afterwards. I know that this makes him feel helpless too.

I also think that I am starting to fall for somebody else, but I am wondering if it is genuine or not. My boyfriend already knows about this and we are still searching for a solution. We spoke a few evenings ago about it too, but I think that our conversation made the situation worse for the two of us. I know that I am selfish but I opened up to him about how I feel on a daily basis \(after I asked him not to judge me, to which he answered that he would try\). His respons was that I seem to be more mentally unstable than he thought at first and he now  tries to 'figure out' my feelings. I feel like I cannot talk to him anymore.

I know that I should speak to a professional but I feel like I cannot open up about everything \(and I cannot pay the costs to cover everything\).  
Has someone any idea to help my clear my head?

321,"I honestly don't know if this is the correct place to post and if not I apologize. Back in February, I filed for my taxes. Unfortunately at the time I couldn't find my routing number for my bank account and opted for putting the money on a American Express Serve card that was supposed to be sent to my home. It is now June and I still have not received this card in the mail. I have called the number they provide to get a replacement card 4 different times. Each time I am assured that they are sending it and will arrive within 8-10 days. 

Its been months and I still have yet to receive anything. I've even tried to call the IRS to see if they could settle this, but the person I talked to was very rude and even hung up on me mid call. Thinking that there may have been something wrong with mail getting delivered to my home, I even had Amex ""send"" a replacement card to a different address, and even that was a hassle. Thanks to depression and anxiety of talking to people on the phone, I've put this one on the back burner for a while just because of how discouraged I felt from the hassle of dealing with them. They will barley talk to me because I don't have a card number to provide them because again, I was never sent one. I can check the account and see how much money is there but I cannot access anything until I activate the card, which again I do not have.

Does anyone have any advice on what I could do to receive my income tax? I'm afraid that if I call about getting another card that the same is going to happen.

I left a dime-sized hickey on his neck. if I had it myself I could cover it up, but since it’s summer and he has short hair, he’s kinda screwed. We both like neck kisses, but we’re adults and not trying to give each other hickeys. I definitely did not mean to do it, and I feel super bad. Neither of us wants to walk around with that. Luckily, he doesn’t work in an office so there’s no issues with work embarrassment. He does live at home, and his parents have already teased him about it. I literally don’t know how I can go back over to his house and show my face. He says he’s not mad and I’ve apologized profusely, but I think he must be at least a little annoyed. Do I just pretend like nothing happened with his family? How do I let this go and stop obsessing about what they think about me?

330,"Hi.
Im feeling pretty lost right now and would like some advice. And since this concerns the person I talk to about nearly everything, I can’t exactly go to her. For context, Im a 17y.o. Male and my friend is a 15y.o. Female. We’ll call her June.
My best friends Mother is a helicopter parent. Pretty extremely. There have been a lot of incidents where she was very overbearing. For example, one time a mutual friend, June, and I were at a get together after this years graduation ceremony. We went to walk our mutual friend home (2 blocks away). Without telling us, June’s mother had followed us there with her *headlights off*. This is one instance of many.
So, today, June is in drivers ed. We have plans to hang out tonight and like watch a movie and play board games. Her mom calls me and asks what the plan is, as June cant be on her phone during drivers ed. After explaining the timeframe and what we plan to do, June’s mom informs me that she had a rough day yesterday. I knew that, I was there. However, what she followed that up with is the information that June has been “crying every day”. I told her mother “I do not think that is something you should be telling me; it’s June’s personal business”. After that we said goodbyes and hung up.

So now Ive always know  that June is going through rough stuff. But I didnt know it was at this extent. And I was not supposed to know this. The knowledge was given to me without her consent (or mine for that matter). I dont know what to do.

I try my best to be a good friend to June. I stand up to her mom when I can (who weirdly appreciates when I do, as she is a therapist) and I try my best to do nice things and be a good person and be there for her when she needs to talk. But I never knew that her situation was this bad. She has made it clear in the past that she does not want me to worry about her (especially with a potential history of self-harm) but I cant help it.

332,"so, i don't enjoy hanging out with my friends anymore. it's just not very fun. i've only known them for like 5 months, but i don't have any other choices for friends outside of school. One of my friends is the only person i've ever met in my life that has the same interests humour wise (memes) and I used to really want to be her friend, but know i realise that it is so unsatisfying to talk to her. She's amazing, but I now find it so bland to talk about anything. I laugh at her jokes like a pig, but it is so non fun talking to her about anything else. She can be really immature, and so can I, but i feel like some of the things she does is kinda asshole-ish and really immature? Maybe i'm the asshole here, but all of my friends seem really,really,REALLY immature. I would love to talk about something new for once but to no avail, its always the same topics and i always say the same exact things. Romance is a huge thing to me and i am the kind of person that loves love songs and gets crushes, BUT: it gets very annoying constantly hearing people talking about it. I GET IT. Someone likes someone else. Its not my business! And holy shit, it's another story if you dare compliment someone else that isn't the same gender. All of my friends are always like oooooo you like him and oooh i bet you dream about him at night. They all barely like to talk about anything else with me and i don't know what to do. Should i just deal with it? Is it better to just be friends with them and carry on? Because the teachers will definitely make a HUGE deal out of it if i suddenly didn't want to be anyone's friend. I don't know how to make friends outside of school. I've never done so before. I felt the same in all my previous schools but it's definitely really distressing now because it's the start of a new school. I only had to deal with the other people for a year when i realise i don't like being their friends. Now, it's 4 whole years. I don't want to be lonely, i just don't like hanging out with my current friends. Advice?

Here is my second problem (i'm so glad reddit exists lol):

I've currently been able to finally break through a depressed mood that has lasted for about a few months. I felt really terrible, but 2 days ago, i told myself that i deserved love. Now, this was really hard. I've made myself keep a journal, no matter how my day has been, I have to compliment something about me for a month about my appearance. My journal is now my safe place, where i can talk about how much i desperately want love in my life. Not romantic love, like the love that old people have when they've been married for like 35 years. This is probably really cringe, but it helped me get out of only eating croissants, not leaving the house at all outside of school, barely talking and losing motivation. I drew a picture! I hadn't done that since April! I was very proud. But, now, doubts are coming back. I don't want to go back into that terrible place, and i've been convincing myself that i'm worthy of everything but it just feels like i'm asking for things that would never happen. I feel like i'm being narcissistic and i don't deserve it, and i know that the only way to stop getting into those moods is to finally convince myself that i've got a chance in my love life when i get older. It's not even a thing that i like anyone. I just imagine what my dream guy would be like, and then immediately imagine him with another girl or me being rejected by someone i would call my dream guy. I don't know why i care about love so much?! I just want a realistic answer to this question:
Is there a likely chance, that I, will marry someone that i love, and be able to work hard enough to maintain said relationship for as long as I can? I like the kind of guys that nobody else likes, for some odd reason. Guys that are the complete opposite of me i guess :/ Adviceee??

Back in primary school, my school counsellor told me that i had the body of a child and the mind of a stressed out 90 year old woman. I wonder if she's correct haha.

First off, she comes off as very sophisticated. Like she has all the best things in life. And with such a wealthy husband, she does.

Secondly, I found out that she actually did not hire a few people because of their sizes. Claiming that they’d be bumping into things or whatever because they were bigger and only wants slender woman to work there. 

Thirdly, I helped an associate figure out that our boss has been actually taking $150 out of her paycheck for no reason! I’m BAFFLED about this.

Basically, I'm a grade 12 student who is about to graduate from high school in Canada. My grades have never been terrible but not something to be proud of either. As I stated before, I live in Canada and I usually average 60% - 75%. As you can already tell, being a grade 12 student means that I will be going off to post secondary education next year and I have already applied to Universities and a single College. Now, by the time our mid-terms came out, I got accepted to the college that I applied to, but none of the universities. I originally wanted to go to College and finish that with a degree but my parents made it clear that they want me to go to a university even though I knew that I don't have University level marks. Now i'm here in a position where all the universities rejected me (There goes 400$ in application fees) and I'm most likely going to college now. That is if my parents can understand which I doubt they will. I came home from school today and my mother is pretty angry that I got rejected from the universities and every time I try to point out that I knew I wouldn't have received admission in the first place, I am being accused of blaming my parents for my crappy marks.

I'm a person who likes to move around a lot, see new things, talk to new people, and not sit at a desk for a majority of the day. I also value my health a lot. I don't know what kind of career offers less desk sitting with a good amount of socializing and travelling and offers an income which allows me to sustain affordable living and caretaking of both of my parents.

353,"So I got suspended from school on Friday for 5 days for selling drugs. This is my first time ever caught and I’ve never ever been in trouble. Today was my first day of my suspension and I’ve hated every second, I hated what I did and I want to die because of it (but I won’t). Just want to. I’m extremely remorseful and regretful and this was a huge mistake that won’t ever happen again. 
Anyways, I’ve been thinking of calling the school and asking if I can talk to one of the principals and show them how sorry I am and how I fucked up real badly. My grades are perfect and this is so out of character for me, school means so much to me and I love going. If I can show the principals how sorry I am do you think it would be effective? Even if they don’t lift my suspension, I just want to show responsibility and maturity in this situation. Neither of my parents know I want to do this. 
Please help me and give me your honest opinion.

So I sold my PS3 and saved up to build a gaming PC which I played games on but after turning 17 I started regretting each and every time I played cause I was addicted to Football games and I felt I was not really doing anything productive, watching other kids do well and some motivational videos I finally gave up on gaming and played almost once a month or not at all for 6 months in a row but recently I bought an Xbox One S cause I felt I was not enjoying life and even after giving up I was still not as productive as I should be so I made a decision to enjoy life as well as work cause I don't want to live a boring life.

359,"TLDR; I hired my friend to put in my tile for what seemed like a great price and he ended up not completing it, did a half\-assed job, and wants partial payment. Can I just not pay him?

I bought a house recently and I wanted to put tile in the living room because I didn't like the carpet. I initially asked my friend to see if they knew any tile guys because he did remodeling work with his dad/had his own company for about a year. He suggested I hire him instead and he would be able to get everything I wanted done in 2 days. He showed me some pictures of a tile job he did recently and it looked great so I decided to go with it. He also was going to only charge $500, $300 less than another quote I got. Day 1 he doesn't bring a sledgehammer to demo the tile and says he won't be able to do that part until the next day. That already delays half the process by 1 day. The next day, he ends up texting me stating that he's unable to finish the job, he lowballed himself on the price and will not be able to complete the job even if I pay him more. I go to the house to check on everything since I figured he left when he texted me. I arrive to the house about 2 hours after the text since I assumed he closed up \(he had the garage code to get in and out\). The garage door was left wide open with materials in the garage \(tile, mortar, etc\). The tile job was shit \- he didn't use spacers properly so most of the tile are not 1/16th and are more like a range between 1/16th and half a cm...\(wtf\), some tile was not level, the pieces that he did cut were not only extremely poorly fitted but they were also not even mortared to the ground. He didn't mention any of this to me in the texts. 

I ended up having to call another guy to come out and give me an estimate \- $1000 to complete the tile job. I decided not to make them pull up all the messed up tile as it would cost me even more labor and material. I'm thinking to just not pay him anything as clearly our friendship is no longer there \(or ever was for that matter\) and he did an absolutely horrifying job anyway...What do you guys suggest I do?",04Jun2018,1

365,"Apologies in advance for the lengthy post. So, my story is that social anxiety has completely fucked me. I am the worst loser on Earth. And I can't see a way out. 

I'm 27 and I've spent the entire decade making absolutely no new long-term friends. During my entire 20s, any social connections I made at all were influenced by alcohol.

You know what my Thai girlfriend said to me tonight in broken English? ""Why you not have many friend? I think you had many friend when you were young."" See, that's how desperate I am. Such poor social skills that I had to find a girlfriend from Thailand who can't even speak English well. But she's a girl who still knows how socially inept I am.

She's a great girl and everything but she speaks rudimentary English so our communication is always rather superficial. Beyond cooking, travelling, and watching films together, we don't share any interests. Most people like me who read books and pursue other intellectual interests tend to find partners of an equal intellect. I found a poor farmer girl from Thailand.

That's not even the worst of it though. The worst if it is how my 20s have been spent in a state of mostly pure isolation due to my lack of sociability and my anxiousness around others. I have two acquaintances, but they're not friends; all I do with either of them is drink. I could call on neither guy to help me during a crisis, such as now.

In college, I studied for four years and I can count the number of times I went out clubbing on two hands. I've fucked two girls in my entire pathetic life.

You know the things most people do during their 20s, like making tons of friends, going out clubbing all the time, having multiple sexual partners etc? I've done barely any of that. Yes, there were times when I was sociable, but most of my 20s have been spent alone due to my anxiety around people.

I worked in an office for a year in 2014: had to quit because of social anxiety. That brief foray into the workd of corporate finance represents my only actual adult experience of office work. I've since carved out a mediocre living as a freelance writer. I earn $20k per year and still live at home with my parents at 27. 

In college, I scored low on some modules because they had a presentation element, which I invariably skipped. I went to Australia on a working holiday visa in 2015 to change things, but I ended up returning home after 3 months because I was an utter outcast in the sociable backpacker environment.

The last three years, I've lived in Thailand 50 percent of the time with my girlfriend, who I met while on a solo southeast Asia trip in 2013. During all that traveling? I've made a sum total of zero new friends. Drank with randomers in bars sometimes, but mostly, that's near 18 months spent living in a foreign country making no friends at all.

You know how everyone who travels solo meets lots of people? I spend my time exploring cities alone, and cowering away from others in my hostel bed, afraid to interact.

I'd try to change things but I've already fucked up too bad. It is too late for me. All I feel is regret about my 20s and not spending it like everyone else.

Any of you who got this far, thank you very much for reading. If any of you have input or advice I'd appreciate it a lot.

**tl;dr** social failure in my 20s. Social anxiety has prevented me from feeling like I've achieved anything. Is there hope for me going forward? ",04Jun2018,2

368,"TL;DR, title. 
I’m almost 17 and my little sister is 14, and she makes my life a living hell. 

She constantly disrespects me and my stuff: I’m actively working on improving my self esteem and she knows that, but whenever I say something positive about myself, she’ll say the opposite. I had been attending college for the past year, but had to drop out and return to high school for mental health reasons. She constantly reminds me of this, too; if I say something about my own intelligence, she’ll remind me that I’m a dropout. She also takes my things without asking all the time, which I know is pretty common and not a huge deal, but she’ll change it, use it all up, or destroy it with no remorse. 
She also shows no gratitude for the things I do for her. I regularly drive her to practice, to her friend’s house, or other places, and buy her food when she wants it. She rarely if ever thanks me, and is rude constantly while I’m doing those things, like refusing to let me play my own music because she knows I hate hers (while insulting my own taste, calling it lame and stupid). She also insists on me doing these favors for her despite the financial strain it puts on me; I can barely afford gas, let alone extra food. 
Finally, she often physically hurts me too. Slapping me, punching me, and when I complain she laughs because “you’re so weak, I didn’t hit you hard at all!” She’s got 3 inches and about 75 pounds on me, so it’s not like I can fight back. 

She thinks she’s got mental issues, and I know she has a lot of difficulties in her friendly and romantic relationships which cause her a lot of stress. However, she’s starting therapy soon, and I don’t believe whatever problems she has justify the abuse I face. 

I’m completely at a loss as to what to do. I haven’t even included everything she does, but trust me, she makes me completely miserable. If anyone wants more details I’m glad to share. I’ve talked about this to my parents more times than I can count, and they always insist they’ll punish her, but nothing ever changes. She’s starting high school with me next year, and I’m dreading it; I don’t think I’ll be able to handle this much longer. What, if anything, can I do about this?",04Jun2018,1

371,"
My sister and I have butted heads for as long as I’ve remembered. She’s just turned 13 and has been giving me grief ever since. She’s started hurling some pretty nasty insults when we go at it, stuff that makes me wish I was 17 again since I wouldn’t be arrested for clonking her upside the head.

So we got into again today when her and her friend were playing Hide and Seek. My brother and I told them both not to play up where were at playing video games. She ignores us and unplugs the TV by mistake and we get annoyed with her. So I tell her friend where she’s at so they would go away and she got upset and comments on “That’s why you don’t have a gf.” And ergo Satan telling me to push her down the stairs.

Yeah I get it, probably wasn’t cool for me to do that, but that response was unwarranted. She got in trouble for something similar not too long ago and she didn’t take anything away from it. She just argued and argued until she agreed with mom just to be left alone.

And I know, she’s 13 and hormonal. Issue is she’s always acted this way. Mainly because mom let her get away with stuff that’d have me and my brother grounded for weeks. 

So what should I do? I tried talking to her about the gf comment and it had no effect. My original plan was to talk to her and if it happened again, I’d have no remorse going to mom about it. But I don’t think she would learn anything. She’s always the victim in her mind and I doubt spanking or grounding would do anything.

Or am I the asshole? Should I just get over it? I’ve tried, but I’m getting really tired of it. I’m personally afraid one of these days I’m gonna snap and slap her across the face. Luckily she doesn’t dare hit us, she understands that it would not end in her favor.

378,"I'm a 20 year old male. I decided that I'm going to try to get out of my comfort zone. I went out for a short walk around my neighborhood just now. I notice I have this intense fear of being watched or looked at. During my walk I had cars riding by. I hate when cars ride by me because I feel like the person driving or the people in the car are looking at me and judging me. I had to walk near an intersection to get back to my house. I don't like when cars are stopped at an intersection and I have to cross, because I feel like everyone in their vehicles are staring at me and judging me. Judging the way I walk. Them sensing or noticing that I'm nervous or uncomfortable, and judging me for it.

I also have a fear of catching my neighbors sitting on their porch. I didn't catch anyone sitting on their porch during my walk. However, I have these thoughts like ""What if I see my neighbors sitting on their porch? Should I say hello to them? Should I wave? What if they ignore me? What if I don't speak and they think I'm ignorant or rude? What if they think I'm weird?"" I don't like being observed by people. It makes me uncomfortable.

Whenever my father observes me doing something he always judges or makes fun of the way I walk. He tells me I walk very stiff. Because of that I'm self-conscious of the way I walk. I always feel like people are judging the way I walk. He gives me a hard time and gets angry with me for looking nervous or uncomfortable when we're out sometimes. This is why I always feel like people can sense that I'm nervous and are going to judge me negatively.

My father always tells me, ""You have to always watch your surroundings when you're out. You have to walk with your head up and your chest out. You have to man up and toughen up. You have to appear strong. You can't appear weak or scared, because people will try to harm you if you appear vulnerable."" This is why I'm always a little paranoid when I'm out of my house or being watched by people, because I don't want them to think I'm weak and I don't want them to treat me like I'm nothing because of it or try to harm me.

Sorry if this is all over the place, but all in all I hate being watched or observed by people. This stems from a lot of the things my father tells me.

Pretty much I only eat 1 meal a day, dinner, and since it's my only meal I make enough food to fill my plate and eat it over the course of several hours. I snack on fruits throughout the day too, but they just bump my metabolism up and make me hungrier for dinner.

So it's been up in the air if my company will send me on a work trip... for months. It's a huge investment on their part, but I expressed that I wanted to go, and they haven't told me yes or no.



A few weeks after I asked, my boss asked me if I had my passport and if the company needed to pay for it. I said no and a few weeks after I applied for it and let him know that it would be here in time. He said that it sounded good and he talked to our CEO and didn't get much feedback on a decision.


The trip is now next month, I have my passport but I haven't heard anything. I didn't want to keep bothering him about it because I know it's a non priority... but I really want him just to tell me that I'm not going instead of not saying anything about it. The other person they are sending is all set.


I know this may sound silly, but how do I ask him without seeming emotional about it? I'm trying to be better about being confrontational and stating my needs. While being professional. I am disappointed, but I want to hide it. But honestly I'm very sensitive about being ignored rather than being told news I may not want to hear.

389,"Technically, it's a summer internship.

It's a desk job and it's so fucking tedious. It's in the field that I'm interested in, but not the exact position I would ideally like. The only reason I took it is because it can offer me experience and because I really didn't have many other options available to me (I started applying for internships very late into the year). 

It only lasts until late August, but I'm less than a few weeks in, and I don't know how much more of it I can take. It's making me severely depressed - hell, the idea of even going into work tomorrow is making me tear up. ~~I've actually lost track of how many times I've cried about needing to go to work.~~ I want to try to power through it, but the thought of doing simple busy work for 8 hours a day for a few months is awful. Worse, I was referred to the job by someone at my school, so giving up two weeks into the temporary position would not only reflect poorly on me, but the school as well. Finally, I'm scared that if I leave now, the company might get angry and inform others companies who they have connections to not to hire me. 

I don't know if I should stick to it or quit. I feel lost. What should I do?",04Jun2018,1
390,"So I'm a male with 16 years of age and I've been awkward with my dad for a few years now. We barely talk we never have conversations about anything. I joke around with my mom and siblings but when it comes to my dad I stop.My mom once said that he's doing everything that has happened to him to me (Ex. I got a haircut that I wanted and he made me go back and cut it off). He tried to make me someone that I'm not and I think that he's not gonna try that again. My dad is always at work so when he's not around I'm my self but when he's around I'm another person I don't wanna leave my room and I don't wanna have no iteration with him because I feel that he's gonna complain about something.But when he's away I feel good I feel my self. I really wanna ask him a question but  When I ask my mom if I could go out or like do something and she says ask your dad. I never do and just stay home because I'm really uncomfortable with him.

391,"I'll start this off by saying I've always been a super extroverted and social person. Love spending hours on end with friends and family just hanging out, love going out and meeting new people, so on so forth- ever since I was young.

However, this being social also comes with its downsides- I get emotional a LOT and attached to people easily. I'm quick to hurt and not as strong as I'd like to be. Go through dating troubles? It's like the end of the world for me, and even a short lived experience takes me months and months on end to get over. It feels abnormal and not right. Reconnect with someone I used to know in college? I get so elated and happy, thinking ""oh, this could be the start of a new friendship, this'll be great..."" only to get disappointed in the end. Slighted and ignored by usually friendly coworker when asking for help? ""I can't believe this is happening to me. Why must everyone be so cruel. Why do bad things always happen to good people"".

Case in point, this forms many of my interactions besides for my childhood friends for the most part. If they go through things and need space, I understand and leave them be. Although, in trying to seek new friendships and make new relationships, especially being so far from home, I CAN'T help but depend on others for my happiness. I'm not sure if it's being extroverted or something else, I sure did get a lot of affection from my parents growing up and was raised well, but this is something I can't entirely let go of. It's like I need people around me and for things to go well to just BE happy, and I don't like how that makes me feel and sets my life.

Perhaps I'm too used to being disappointed by others. I don't want to go through life like this anymore. I want a change but don't know how to start. I've tried investing myself into different hobbies, but my mind always trails back to the wrong others have done me and how they've hurt me. I know that if I invest in a huge personal project or something, that might take my mind off all this, but what between work and social/familial obligations, it's really difficult to commit to something big like that. I'm at a loss and want some advice. Thank you in advance, Reddit.",04Jun2018,2
392,"So, I'm a thirty something female from England. I live with my parents, because they have health problems and I don't like the thought of them living alone. We are renting near a council estate because its cheap. I had a job as a marketing manager and I left because I wanted to write a book and I'm on this spiritual path and marketing silly products didn't make sense to me anymore. I don't ever want to go back to it. In fact, anything 9 to 5 makes me sick. These days I'm writing a lot, reading a lot and cooking a lot, as I'm trying to live healthy and get my family healthy. Anyway, my conundrum is that even though I have cheap rent, I am burning through my savings. I'm reluctant to get a job in marketing but I also have faith that something better will come along as I do believe in the power of the law of attraction. Actually, when I left my last job i kept seeing 1111 and have been ever since, it's getting quite freaky now because I'll look at my phone, the oven clock, my emails and it'll all be 1111, for those of you who don't know this, I looked it up and it's supposed to mean I'm on the right path. But, my family barely talk to me because I'm not working. My parents think I'm working from home. I just don't know whether to give up on my dream and also sell out and go back to my day job, or follow my intuition and continue as I am, at least until my savings allow me. I'm not spoilt and I work damn hard. I hardly watch TV or spend time doing nothing. I'm always growing, expanding my mind. My parents have always lived in shitty housing and I want to buy them a house too. I'm not sure which way to turn. My parents don't have any money which is why they live with me, technically. I pay for most things. What would you do? Suck it up and get a job, or try something different. I know I can work and write but I hate marketing and 9 to 5. I'm also not interested in money, I've learnt to be grateful this way but how do you look after loved ones and follow some moral/divine path you know you need in your own life?

394,"(I live in Australia) I bought a used car from a dealership, 2005 Mercedes kompressor.

It doesn't have a Statutory warranty as its over 10 years old but has also done less than 160kms.

I brought to the mechanic straight away (after purchasing) and they have found rust on the first speak plug and water in the first cylinder. This can cause major problems.

My mechanic advised me to take it back to the dealership and get I fixed. The dealership has advised me that since there's no statutory warranty it won't be repaired.

The form 5, doesn't list any defects. Do I have a case if I take this to VCAT?

Any other advice?

397,"I am a masters student in Canada working for a prof as an RA. I am contracted for 60 hours but I've worked 110 hours so far (I will probably go over 120 hours by the end of contract). I've been coming to the office every single Saturday and Sunday for the past month (because I am also working on my masters essay and freelance work) . My colleagues think that I am working too much and I know that the other RA don't work as much as I do. 

However, I'm still worried that I will sound whiny or incompetent if I tell my prof that I'm working too much. What is the best way to go about this? What should I say in person? Should I say anything on email so that it would be on record? Would it be okay to directly mention in an email that I've worked 50 extra hours? I don't know if this will help, but I have been keeping a pretty detailed timesheet of all the hours I've put in this time because I have had this problem with this professor in the past. 

Lastly, I think what could work against me is that I had told him initially that I would be able to finish the project in around 60 hours. However, I ended up going over my hours due to three factors: 1) I mis-estimated a bit and the work ended up taking about 80 hours (which I would have been okay with), 2) I had to switch softwares midway and spend extra time re-coding the work I had done into the new software, and 3)the prof also gave me some extra work to do.

400,"I’ve never been in a relationship. I dropped out of school at 16 to receive full-time therapy for my depression/anxiety (I did get my GED). I was so frustrated for years with my lack of a girlfriend. I matured and learned a lot about life and myself. In hindsight I understand no one wanted to be in relationship with someone who didn’t even like themselves. Let alone looking past my weight. 

I’m in a really good place now. I’m losing weight, working for the first time in my life, off most of my medications, and in general life a happy life with little anxiety/depression. Now I think I’m ready to put myself out there, I’m certainly lonely enough. I try (and pay for) Tinder, OkCupid, Bumble, and POF. But I am getting 0, and I mean 0 responses or even likes. 

What am I doing wrong?  I’m not opposed to approaching girls in person, but I don’t wanna bother someone in a relationship. Don’t even know where to start, as I never have tried. ",04Jun2018,1
401,"I recently went on a date with a coworker. I know it’s stupid to date coworkers, but I like them a lot and another coworker whom was convinced she felt the same way egged me on. So I did. I thought it went great- said we liked eachother, had some meaningful conversations, held hands for a while, as far as my first dates have gone it was great. That was a week ago, we’ve barely talked since. Tried to set up a 2nd date 3 times: was busy the first time, ignored me the second time, and after finally deciding to go out again today they cancelled on me. Said they had “made other plans”. 

I’m quickly losing patience with them, don’t want to date anyone that plays games or isn’t as interested in me as I am in then anyway. Have done both before and those types of relationships don’t end well. Question is, how do I handle things at work now? Unfortunately I’m KIND OF her boss, but I’m more of a supervisory manager then the actual boss. I’m done trying to date her, I’m not stupid, they obviously didn’t have as good a time as I did.

402,"So I'm in my early 30s and I'm pretty much the very picture of someone that has completely failed at life. I don't have a job. I live with my boyfriend and his parents. I'm deeply in debt. I don't really have any prospects. I'm a bit of a pariah, but I won't go into details as to why. Anyway, I really don't know how to get my life together. I have consistently failed at everything I've done. I've never been able to maintain a job or career. I've never been able to realize any goals for myself. I'm in a situation that I absolutely hate, but it feels insurmountable to get out of. 

I'm in therapy, but it doesn't really help. While it is nice to be able to talk to someone, I'm not getting any better. If anything, I'm getting worse. She is the only person I talk to about my problems in detail. I've been declared to be medically frail due to ""Disabling mental disorders."" According to clinical psychological evaluations, I have severe psychological issues. I've come close to being institutionalized several times, but escaped by the grace of having a very understanding therapist who also realizes that being put in something like that could set me off even worse.

So I can somewhat internalize that the issues I face aren't ones I created for myself, but to me it doesn't really matter. The outcome is the same, which is a shitty situation that I have to live with. I am completely eaten up by self-loathing, anxiety, fear, bitterness, and anger. I feel like I'm on the edge most of the time. I can function to a degree, but if something happens that sets me off, I really lose it fast and hard. I become really self-destructive and enraged. And that leads to me being very violent to myself and others. And the only way to avoid getting set off is isolating myself most of the time, which has its own set of problems due to all the brooding I do. 

I'm not without some good things. I have a really great relationship with my boyfriend whom I cherish beyond measure. I wouldn't be able to do it without him. He's a very moderating force on me.

\(I promise this won't be melodramatic, I'm looking for advice not a massage of sympathy\)

I'm in a new relationship, I have been for the past few months. At first it's easy to not be lethargic, the excitement of meeting a friend that you get to fuck is simply the best. BUT, as all things that go through time, my feelings have become more of a standard of living than some ecstasy joyride. I'm comfortable now. 

So I'm bummed again. Now I'm bummed that I'm bummed. I'm especially upset that this angel has to see me all droopy eyed and wearing sweatpants, like sure, you're alright with it and supportive. All those correct answers, good job you passed the test. I understand, but this wasn't what was advertised and we both know it. 

Writing it out it's becoming clear that the easy answer is to work on the baggage that's making me sad to begin with. Get a pulse in my passions again and all those self help book stuff. BUT, something's off. Is there any way to really tell this dude I'm not getting bored? That this shit was here before and I just got distracted for a while when we were blowing our bank accounts on each other and laughing a bunch.

My boyfriend and I work for the same large (400+ employees in our building alone) company. We're on different ""teams"" so we rarely see each other at work outside of company-wide meetings and going to lunch together 1x a week. 

Recently, my boyfriend has been given multiple warnings for his hygiene. The issue is, he doesn't have bad hygiene. We live together. He showers every evening before bed. He uses deodorant, he brushes his teeth, hell, *I* do his laundry, so I know he's wearing clean clothes.

Recently, one of my coworkers came to me, telling me she had heard some of his coworkers (the girl he shares an office with and her best friend) laughing about how close they were to getting him fired, and talking about how ""he deserves it"". About a month before the ""hygiene"" complaints started, he had called out his officemate's friend on the fact that she kept trying to sneak meat into their vegetarian coworker's food, and the friend was given a warning. Apparently this is the two of them trying to ""get him back"". 

My coworker and I went to HR about this - her because she'd actually heard it, and me to attest that he doesn't have hygiene issues. The HR rep told us that they have to ""take action"" on all complaints, even if they think they're groundless.

My BF has received his ""final warning"" about this last week. If they get another complaint they say they are going to fire him. He's been actively looking for a new job for a while, but so far hasn't found anything that pays close to what he's making now. 

Is there a way to deal with this in the short term?",04Jun2018,1
