0,Alright so the truth is that im gay young man and I have no friends and no boyfriend. I have been this way for about two years now. I have dating apps like tinder and Grindr and simply can’t find anyone i like that also likes me back. It feels impossible sometimes. I don’t know what else to do. Sometimes i just feel like maybe moving to another state like California and seeing if my life will change. Is this normal? ,14Jul2018,1
1,"Well, I interviewed in the final round with a fortune 40 earlier this week for a student position I've been pining for and had been told to expect to hear back towards the end of July. I felt alright after the interview but wasn't too giddy especially after hearing they were hiring 5 people out of the thousands that applied- I also wasn't able to meet in person since I'm working out of state for the summer and thought that the students who could go in person would have a better chance, so I just thought whatever happens, happens. Alright. I get an email from a recruiter earlier today. He says he has good news to share with me and that he is going to call me around 10 pm tonight? I was really confused about the last bit as I can't think of a reason for him to call within that particular time frame. I am trying to keep an open mind, but don't want to assume anything yet. What do you think he wants to talk about? I believe management should have wrapped up interviews today so I didn't think they'd be making decisions for another few weeks! ",14Jul2018,6

3,"So... I've kinda failed.  I had a plan with what to do, and back ups for if that ever failed, which didn't end up working. But anyways this is where I need help.

Well, I went to college, and long story short, the major i took (bio) had a lot i wasn't prepared for (animal/insect Bio). Combine that with a terrible chem teacher (seriously who goes from atomic structure to advanced thermodynamics in three weeks (which passes the drop date)) (also he legitimately mocked people who asked questions during lectures) and i lost my aid, which means I dropped out. Okay plan A down, lets go to plan B, Paramedics.  I worked as a volunteer EMT/Firefighter and really enjoyed it, so I thought this would be a great plan. I took online classes for the degree.  But, unfortunately, i failed. I would love to blame something at this point, but i just didn't pay enough attention, combine that with the loss of aid and college is no longer an option. So, final plan, plan C.  I wanted to become a professional firefighter.  I knew this was it, as I loved doing it.  I loved even waking up at 1 am to direct traffic in the snow for a fender bender.  Certainly I could do this.  But after waiting 3 years for the civil service exam to come out, working at learning all I could, i only got a 73...... that put me behind 1350 people, and that's if they even go that far.  I can't wait another 4-5 years for a maybe.  My fiancee would love me through anything, even being a low level employee forever. But it takes it's toll.  I don't know what to do,  I just can't stand myself right now.  I can't keep doing something I hate forever.  But everything I even liked seems to have been eliminated.  Does anyone have any advice for someone who is seemingly out of options.",14Jul2018,1
4,"My mother doesn't work, but is looking for a job, or so she says. She doesn't have much in her checking ( about 2k i think) and none at all in her savings. she doesn't have a retirment fund and will probably work until the day she dies. She had GAD which makes it hard for her to keep a job.

She will collect a little over a thousand a month in social security starting the end of Sep. We are moving into a new apt. in Aug and she wants me to pay her utilities and bills which will be about $200 per month. Also, my income is what is qualifying us for the apartment. 

She says its unfair for me to live in her house for free when i make more than her, essentially. she called me an anti- semetic slur (i think you know what it is), as I am part jewish from my father's side.... but continuing on. 

**tl;dr She also said I was greedy and selfish for not wanting to help out. She knows that I'd like to move out and be on my own, and she's fine with that. But I'm sure she'd still want some financial help. I'd like to move out in late Aug / sep, but I could always give her 2 months of the bill money in advance, to get some independence?

5,"My brother (18) was diagnosed with severe depression a few months ago. He's been seeing both a therapist and a psychiatrist since. To me he appears slightly better, but emotionless. When we're out in public with other people outside the family he acts like a normal friendly person, but alone he likes to shoplift, go outside and shoot animals with a bow and arrow, and spends a lot of time on [r/watchpeopledie](https://www.reddit.com/r/watchpeopledie).  So far I'm the only one he's told these things to, probably because he figures I won't give a crap.  Way before this he was the complete opposite; he was caring, passionate, charitable, and very religious.

7,"Hello Im 17 and I found alot of bed bugs in my room today. I know they are bed bugs do to the brownish clear color and the blackish red back they have. It scares me that I have them because I found alot of them that have already fed on me because some are getting pretty big with more red on their backs.

So after a short freak out I woke my mom up from bed (she works midnights) and showed her one. She didnt believe it then went back to sleep. So I took action. I grabbed my vacuum cleaner and tried to suck them up. It failed. They just didnt get sucked up. 

So I wake her up again to show her the bigger ones and tell her that they are bed bugs. Okay now she believes it but doesn't care. Goes back to her room to sleep because she said ""I dont know what to do."" I suggested throwing the mattress out but she got very upset for that idea before she left.

10,"7 months since I last spoke to her, 10 months since I last saw her, 13 months since I last held her hand or did any of that cliched bullshit. 

You know I never really believed that I would fall in love but I guess that's because I didn't know what love felt like? Maybe I'm not and was never in love? I remember the very 1st time I saw her, I feel that looking back at it that it was that quintessential love at first sight, as soon as I layed eyes on her and before she even opened her mouth her beauty really did captivate me. It wasn't just her looks that made me fall in love, it was her sarcastic jokes or her eye rolls; her way with words.

We spent endless nights until 1 or even 2 in the morning talking about everything and nothing; endless hours walking and talking to the point where time became a force lesser than us and I felt like we were the only people in the world. She told me one day that one of her friends told her that he loved a girl that she knew and she turned to me and said 'surely you can't fall in love so quickly, I mean at this age,' at the time I wasn't aware that I loved her and I so foolishly agreed.

And now she's gone as if she only existed for me but I didn't exist for her. I guess I partly blame myself for not telling her how I truly felt even though she could probably tell. I still kick myself up for it because what do you get out of not saying anything at all? Nothing. We haven't spoke for what has felt like my whole lifetime yet I can't help but feel that she disregarded the memories of us the minute she decided to leave me.

I still don't have closure, I want closure... why did you just leave me? what did I do wrong? I would give the world and more to even have her present in my life because she made everything better even though I didn't know it at the time

15,"Hi, I'm sorry if this is inappropriate to post here. I tried looking up lgbthelp and similar things, but the subreddits didn't seem to be very active.  I'm on my phone, so I'm sorry if the formatting is weird. 

I don't know if I need advice or guidance or if I just need to vent. I'm not a very good writer, so I apologize in advance if what I'm staying is hard to follow. 

I'm 26 and ""discovered"" (??) I was a lesbian around 14/15. I had a bit of trouble accepting it at first (went to catholic school, conservative parents, etc), but once I turned 19 I felt confident about it and came out. I never felt ashamed about it, just accepted it as who I am. 

I've been seeing a lot of things online lately that point to being gay as some sort of a reaction to trauma or similar mental issues and it's messing with my head. I've been watching videos about ""ex-gays"" who realized their gayness was from issues they had and never dealt with (lesbian because she was upset with her father abandoning the family, etc..). I was sexually abused from 14-17, am an alcoholic (currently in recovery), and I was raped by a man when I was 18. Now I'm starting to feel like something is wrong with me. Not morally wrong with me (I don't think being gay is a moral failure), but mentally wrong with me. Like somehow the trauma or whatever made me this way or I'm mentally deficient and that's what lead me to this. 

I'm just really confused and I feel like I'm having some sort of identity crisis. Has anyone else experienced this? I want to clarify that I don't think being gay or lesbian is wrong in any way and I don't believe that it's some sort of mental problem. I'm just confused about why I'm having these sort of thoughts when I've never really had a problem with who I am.

20,"My sister has been a liar her whole life. She would lie about everything. It was just a fault of hers my whole life, and I just dealt with it because it never effected me. 

Now her lies have gotten to the point of being illegal and it has effected me. She was arrested for multiple counts of fraud. I am in a high ranking law enforcement career, and although it doesn’t effect my position, it does tarnish my name. It has effected the views of other commanding officers at other jurisdictions. Nothing major, but enough for me to decide this is not someone I want in my family’s life.

My son is being baptized and the family is invited, just not my sisters family. My parents keep emailing me and calling me saying “people are going to ask why she isn’t there. Can’t she just come so people don’t ask what happened”

They are embarrassed about it, and they worry about their image. It is getting to the point that I cannot have a visit with my parents without them trying to guilt trip me. We do a yearly summer vacation, and when I cut her off I said that I just will not be going, and that I will be sure to visit everyone for dinner on a separate day so we can see each other. Instead they cancelled the yearly vacation “because of some people cannot get the time off work”. 

It’s like they are trying to hide the whole thing. They think I’m being unreasonable and I am doing this to be an ass and “drive her to suicide”

I don’t hate my sister, I just feel nothing for her anymore. I feel she is mentally ill and nobody will help her they will all just enable her.

6 years ago, my mom died from a drug overdose.
3 years ago, my dad died from a drug overdose.

I’ve been depressed. I hate admitting that but I cope it with gaming and sports, specifically NBA.
I don’t have any motivation at all to advance. I don’t want to kill myself or anything, it’s just that I have no goals. I wanted to make my mom or my grandma proud or something, and now I can’t. I’ve never been very spiritual.
I’m not close with the rest of my family, so impressing them doesn’t mean much to me.
I love my girlfriend to death and she is my support system, but I’m still having issues finding the motivation to do my college work.

I don’t even know if I want to focus on school, but I know I have to, especially with it being free for me.
It’s free because I’m adopted, by the way. 

I don’t know what to do, I can’t work less and I need the money to live, but I can’t focus on school while working so much.

24,"Sorry for the wall of text :(

Some back story:

About a year ago my mother suffered from a stroke. She spent a week in the hospital and afterwards she wasn't the same. She constantly yells at my grandparents (even though they're the ones who take care of her), she gets confused easily and when we correct her she gets upset, and honestly her condition is getting worse. Right now she's living with my grandparents and she's driving them crazy. 

Now (as in the last week or so) she was back in the hospital due to kidney issues and she's starting to take dialysis every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. It just seems like things are getting worse and worse.

My grandparent's aren't young. And they aren't in the best of health either. My grandfather lost both his legs due to diabetes so my grandmother is taking care of him (while she doesnt exactly have the best heath either.) as well as taking care of my mother. And my mom doesnt exactly make it easier for my grandmother. 

I'm just worried my grandparents are going to pass away and I'm going to be stuck taking care of my mom. I don't know if she's going to get better. I want her to, but I'm just not confident. If she was nicer  then sure I wouldn't mind, but I know she's going to make my life miserable. I just feel like there's this invisible timer counting down to the moment when my grandparents pass and this is thrust on me.

In all reality my uncle (her brother, who I will be moving in with soon) is the one who will be making the decisions but I know it's going to effect me as much as him. He doesn't want to take care of her either because he knows how mean and manipulative she can be. 

Sorry if all of this didn't make sense. I just don't know what to do and its causing me some serious anxiety.",14Jul2018,3
26,"He retells stories and repeats information all the time. I’ve kinda learned to live with it, but I can’t stand it when it comes to friends, family, and strangers. For examples, this week at dinner he tied up our waiter telling him about all of his past careers as well as what he eats for breakfast every day. The waiter was obviously not interested but he kindly engaged. 

My boyfriend never picks up on social cues. My belief is that this stems from his work life. He’s always been pretty successful so as the big boss guy I’m sure a lot of people felt obligated to listen intently and laugh at his jokes no matter what. He thinks I’m just being an asshole when I try to tell him later that he went overboard. He just gets defensive and criticizes my topics of conversation, saying he doesn’t really care to hear about what I bought while I was shopping or what I did when I was in high school etc. Fair enough but I didn’t waste someone else’s time with that.

27,"I’m not entirely sure how this happened. I swear they must have mixed up my resume with someone else or something.

Coming out of the Army. I’ve been applying for jobs but haven’t had a great amount of luck so far. I’ve got a wife in college and two kids to feed, so I was getting a little desperate. I wound up jumping on a certain big company’s careers page and basically applied for everything they had open in my area.

I didn’t find out until the actual phone interview that I was being considered as a fleet mechanic for their massive fleet of vehicles.

I wound up getting the job. Somehow. I almost told them I wasn’t sure I was qualified, but then they started talking about wages and.....it’s considerably better than anything else I’m up for. So i kept my mouth shut.

I posted about this situation already. My friend is dating this new girl who just got out of an 8 year relationship. 

Things seem to be progressing for him....but not her. Like he posts pictures of her and she likes them but if he posts something of him or his interests, she doesn’t like them and she doesn’t tag him in pictures she posts even if he’s the only other person with her. And she didn’t even post about he when they spent the fourth together, on a vacation.... 

Basically, I’m still worried that my friend is being used. And I know the posting and social media isn’t an indicator of love but she posts very often and they’re together a lot but doesn’t really tag him or write loving captions....

She’s so hot not gonna lie like she’s fucking fitttt (yeah I’m British, so 16 legal age lol) and she knows what she wants to do and she’s working towards that which is something considered mature at 16 round my area.

I’ve asked her to meet me again soon, cos I got her snapchat... the plan is to either go with my attraction towards her or call it quits in person and explain why I can’t.

it’s tricky for me deciding how to feel which is why I’m here.

30,"Since I was a kid my mother would always chastise me for being quiet or not smiling. To be fair, I've always been pretty introverted and shy and serious, probably genetically from my dad's entire family, so some of this was necessary. If I came down to breakfast one day without smiling or if I sounded exhausted/tired, she would always snap at me and ask me why I couldn't just make myself more cheerful. She still does that to this day. 

The thing is, I never really grew out of my sensitive skin. I remained a pushover throughout my life and always felt like I had to try extra hard to not be aloof and to get people to like me. And when people didn't like me, I was always upset and wondering what I could have done wrong to upset them, when really they don't owe me anything and I shouldn't rely on their opinion of me anyway. With my mother,  I would always wear the clothes she wanted me to wear or otherwise risk her calling me tasteless because I'm not as interested in fashion as she is and I don't like shopping. Luckily, she does have good taste, but I really abhor feeling like I need to read her mind about what she wants me to do. Every time I try to mention these things to her, she always takes my point to the extreme or completely invalidates my point because I'm getting too loud and too emotional. The funny thing is, she's the loudest and most fucking emotionally unstable person I know. Can dish it but really can't take it. She'll take credit for all the good things I've done, like being valedictorian of my high school, and none of the uglier sides of my behavior, like being a pushover.

I understand that on a logical level, I shouldn't feel the need to hide my real feelings, but it's so automatic for me now that I don't even know how I really feel about things. Also I end up projecting my self-criticism onto other people. Like, how rude, that friend from class is being sullen today, why can't she try to keep the harmony in the classroom and try not to bring down the mood? (Not that I would ever say or express my thoughts on that). I guess because my mom was my first role model and all, and because I really love her, I ended up thinking like her, because that was how I avoided conflict at home. And, of course, the whole experience has basically made me unable to communicate in a straightforward manner to people. I struggle telling people they did something wrong/are in my way and I end up just hating them quietly/passive aggressively because I think it's better than just saying it, even though I know it's not. 

tl,dr: how do I start to be more of my own person without ruining my relationship with my mother? Despite these points she is a loving mother and she grew up in a different environment than I did, so I try to respect where she's coming from, even though she can never do the same for me.

When I was little my dad used to take me out to explore abandoned places or the woods just for fun. Sometimes we would find really weird things and other times we would find nothing. Also keep this in mind, I loved hubba bubba bubble tape gum when I was like 4 this will be important to the story later I guess. So one day my dad and I were out exploring again and he brought his friend along too. We had been walking on a trail intended for jogs, walking their dog idk it was a walking trail in the woods on the side of a highway I think. Pretty sketch right? Anyways my dad, being the adventurous person he is, found a little trail that was off the side of one of the original trails. It was a small little trail I think it would be. Called a deer trail. Really muddy. But we started to walk down it. I remember a little ways down the trail my dad pointed out how weird the trees were. There was this once big tree that looked like it had been blown up. we continued down the trail just a little further and found a literal stunt plane that had crashed in the middle of the woods. It looked like it had been there maybe a month as wild life had started to grow around it. There was muddy skid marks on the side of the stunt plane and the wings were still intact. The plane was white with 2 red stripes down the side of the plane.  I was about 3 or 4 years old so I was short and couldn’t see inside the window where the pilot would have been. I’m was a weird kid then and I still am now that I asked my dad if I could look inside the pilots window to see if there was a dead guy inside. Normally my dad would want to explore it and see what’s inside but he immediately wanted to leave and the friend that was with us didn’t say much about it. I don’t remember him talking at all actually. We rushed quickly out of there that’s dropped my bubble tape on the ground and I remember my dad yelling at my not to pick it back up because it was “icky”. I’d say that happened around 2005. Now I’m 17 years old and any time I ask my dad about this memory he acts really weird and Denies that it ever happened. I told him to ask the friend we were with that day and he said he forgot to. My dad tried to get me to stop talking about it by taking me back to that very same woods a few years back. He took me down the walking trail but not the deer trail and he said we had been walking a long time but had not found anything so it didn’t exist but the plane was on a deer trail and my dad wouldn’t go down any and so we went home empty handed. I’ve done research on the plane and the area of the trail but have come up with nothing. I think the pilot may have died because I’ve never seen my dad so freaked out in his life from something like that plus if the pilot survived the window would have been off and somewhere else in the woods. The pilot would have ejected himself from the plane right? Or is that how jets work. Idk. But the walking trail in the woods was in blue springs Missouri I think. My dad has also tried to tell me it was a dream, that I’m thinking of the plane display at the kc zoo, etc. but I know it happened because my mom told me she remembers me and my dad coming home and telling her about it. If anyone could do some investigating or give me some thoughts and opinions that would be amazing. I’ve been looking for answers for so long and to finally have an explanation or at least an idea of what happened that would be awesome. Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this.

38,"I don't want to give too many details but I'll try to explain the situation. I was raped by a complete stranger in march, who then followed me to my building. At first he just started appearing at the store near me, trying to make smalltalk etc. But I kept running away so now when I've tried to leave the building I see him outside and I have to turn back and cancel my plans. Luckily I'm a student and I don't work, so I can just miss some lectures. Last month he got my phonenumber. I still don't know how, and I changed it. He found it again. Then he found my facebook account (might have been earlier, I don't really use fb). I deleted all of my social media accounts, and started ordering in groceries. But in two weeks I will have to leave my apartment again to study. The police are really doing their best and I'm thankful for them, but I don't know his name, he keeps using different fb accounts, different phone numbers and emails. So before they find him I'd like to stay hidden. I've been living in my current apartment for 5 years now and I love it so much, moving is my last option. Is there anything to do so he would just forget about me, like faking my death?",14Jul2018,0

41,"I’m not a big drinker, i started late unlike most of my friends. I do like to get a bit buzzed and i feel like i’m more confident at times. A night when you’re buzzed and just having a «feel good» evening is awesome. What isn’t awesome though, is when you drink too much and have blackouts. This rarely happens to me, but it has happened a few times and i loathe it every single time. The hangover, the bad conscience, all of it.

Problem is i can’t seem to figure out my true limit, and know how much i can take. I always make sure to eat plenty before going out. I don’t really feel like i drink much, but i guess i’m a lightweight. What’s confusing is that some of these times i’ve had a blackout i don’t really think i drank that much more than what i’ve done on other occasions when i’ve been buzzed. Around a month ago, i went to a friend to start drinking, and i began really late. Didn’t really rush the drinking, just drank rum and coke like i usually do, but at some point when taking a cab i got a blackout and only remember certain stuff. Ended up in a fight with a dude, which is something i would NEVER do sober. I’ve been like halfway scared about drinking since that.

I’m invited to a party tomorrow and i have decided to go. I wanted to ask some advice on what kind of routines you usually do when drinking, to avoid getting too drunk? What i usually do is start with a beer or two, then i switch to rum and coke, and stick with it through the night. I had a period for a long time, after i started drinking rum and coke, where i didn’t get wasted and didn’t get much of a hangover either. That’s what i mean about it being difficult to figure out. Why am i sometimes blacking out, but most times not, when i usually drink the same amount? Should i just stick to beer to avoid it? From experience i feel like beer is safer to avoid blackouts, but it usually gives me a headache. Thoughts/ advice?",14Jul2018,1

I talked to men much older than me on apps, online and ect i know it was wrong i just dont know what's wrong with me i never did anything with them irl but i think maybe it's because I just constantly hate on myself without realizing which causes to stoop so low when it comes to finding ""people"".

I leave my phone unlocked on one the apps i use on a conversation of me talking to a man while i was asleep my mom happens to see it read it and see photos so when i wake up she asks of im gay and i reply saying no and tell her im Bi then she tells me how she would support me no matter what but i ""can't be talking to people like this that's it's wrong, people can go to jail, and that i need to respect myself and be a kid not do whatever garbage ive been doing on my phone ""I start to cry because i know all of this is true and i felt so guilty and ashamed i wanted my mom to know about my sexuality eventually but i didnt want it to happen this way.

44,"Yesterday my girlfriend and I were enjoying a beach day at a state park on Lake Michigan.  While we were out in the water, some of our belongings were stolen from the beach.  It wasn't much in money value, but more inconvenient and upsetting, especially to my girlfriend who lost her favorite shoes and shorts, plus her phone and wallet with ID, credit cards, etc...  We didn't see who did it, but we had strong suspicion of a group up of 3 boys and 1 girl in the dunes behind us (this state park is huge, not many people, and a lot of woods/trails)  We ran back to the car to make sure it was still there and not broken into as well.  Once we were there, my girlfriend mention how that group was laughing at her aand waving right when she began running.  So I then went back to the beach (about a 10 minute run) to scope things out.  When this group saw me coming, the got up and ran into the woods.  They were high up on a dune, so I had no chance.  
Meanwhile back to our car, which we couldn't get into without our keys, my girlfriend borrowed someones phone and called the police.  A state trooper came, filed a report, and walked to the beach with me to see how things went down.  While I was with the trooper, a couple in the parking lot saw my girlfriend crying, so asked her what happened.  She told them, they said they were sorry to hear that, and went on their way.  When the officer and I got back in the parking lot, that couple came back to us and said they had seen a very fishy thing go down just on the other side of the lot.  They said they had seen a person very randomly, from the side of the road in the woods, pick up a girl.  They gave the trooper the plate numbers, and he said he would run them for us.  Later on we saw two flashlights in the woods, and as soon as we looked their way they took off.  So it seems pretty clear that one guy got to the car, and the others stayed in the woods so we didn't see them.  Then the driver picked up that girl, and the other two guys were still in the woods waiting for us to go.  We then went on to go home, bummed out about our loss, and drank a lot of wine.  We didn't lose much in terms of money, but my girlfriend was so, so upset and in tears for the whole night. Every time this even crosses my mind I get upset and want to do whatever I can.  Now all I really have is the fact that it was 3 guys and 1 girl, they stooped real low and ruined a good beach day, and the state trooper has their license plate number.  So does anybody have any advice on how to find these people? 
 
TL/DR,   The state police department has the license plate numbers of a person who's name I really, really want (because they had my girlfriend in tears for hours,)  and I'm wondering if anyone knows how I could get that?",14Jul2018,1

46,"OK Reddit, Never posted anything here before but i have a dilly of a pickle and i just cant decide what to do!

Bit of back story: So when i was in the death throws of university (shouldn't have gone but that's another story) i used to hang out in a bar as you do! This bar was frequented by some serious headcases....so i was chatting to this lad, lets call him A, anyway A is a regular in this bar, he has just got out of rehab (Alcoholism). Me and A get on well, we become firm friends.

A is getting his shit together, he goes to college, finishes college. He applies to the local redbrick (read: traditional) university, gets his degree. Through out this time me and A are hanging out, playing Xbox, going to bars (He doesn't drink, only soft drinks). So A goes off to do his Masters at another Uni, i go off to do other things....growing up as you do.

So i go through some stuff, got some great friends who have my back but move about a lot, sometimes near(ish) to A sometimes 5 or 6 hours drive away. A has started drinking again...son of a bitch! he gets bad.....e.g...wont walk from bed to toilet (3 meter trip) so he just uses empty bottles....wasnt fun to walk in on, but im getting ahead of myself!

So A starts posting some random stuff on FB....(wtf.jpg!) Me and another mutual friend organised a road trip, 6 hours drive. Get there and A is out of his skull. F that! Arrange to move him down to live with me and mutual friend whilst we sort out rehab. NHS is great and all but wait times are big. We all club together £10k put A in rehab....

6 months after A leaves rehab, i gave him a car, Mutual Friend lets him live with them. I have to move home (Mom was ill).

Turns out A has started sniffing aerosols! (I gave him a car....dick!) I take my car back, Mutual Friend says....2 choices...get commited or get out.

A calls long absent Dad (also an ex alcoholic), Dad takes him in...he moves. Me and Mutual friend are dubious but what can we do, A is a decade older than me and im a grown ass man, so he should know his way by now! Dad kicks him out (im shocked!....) He seems to be doing alright though, lets face it he managed to get his masters.

So over the last week he has been posting nonsense, well it might make sense if you have 4 liters of vodka in your system!

Here is my question...at what point do you give up on someone? I can afford....just, to put him back into rehab. but is it throwing good money after bad? I know people deserve a second chance, but a third or a fourth? (he has been in rehab 3 times so far) A will eventually kill himself through alcohol poisoning....His mom cant cope (the poor lady has had to deal with his alcoholism most of her life) and his dad is probably as much use as a chocolate teapot! Me and Mutual friend promised we wouldn't help him again, but a friend is a friend...im torn!...Answers on a post card....or in the comments :) whichever is easiest!

FYI im posting this at 3am my time so responses will be slow but i will try and reply :)

TL:DR Friend is an alcoholic, put him through rehab on my/friends dime after family had put him through twice, friend is clearly fallen off wagon again, i can just afford to put him into rehab for 4th time....at what point do you cut your losses?",14Jul2018,1

She’s someone from Instagram, she’s really pretty and she happens to be my age, as well as lives in my city. So we texted late last night, I ended up falling asleep texting her lol, we were really just shooting the shit. In my situations, staying up till 3AM generally means you’re interested in that person(I might be wrong). Anyway, this morning I asked her what her day was like, she told me she had a meeting early, and I told her I get out of work the same time she gets out of her meeting. She then asked if I wanted to meet up. I agreed. We met up in the city, got some halal food, and went to the park. I was instantly clicking with her and felt pretty normal around her, despite liking her a lot. We were together for a couple hours and she had to head out, but overall I had a good time.

She’s been depressed for longer than I’ve even known her, and I’ve stuck by her side through her bad days. It just hurts and makes me feel guilty to know that she’s on the other side of my phone feeling suicidal and all I can do is talk to her. I don’t really know any of her family either so it’s not like I can call one of them or something. Plus, she has a really rough relationship with her close family so it’s hard for her to go to them for help.

50,"hi!! this might be a little bit ranty and long because its something i just wanna let out to see how i could handle this

so im pretty young im in high school and so is my boyfriend -- we hooked up at a party a few months ago in april. he's the most straightforward and simple person ive met in a while but hes also hard to understand. what i mean by that is after hooking up we hung out a few times - no label at all - but it was rather unromantic to be frank: walking around doing nothing with some slightly forced conversation was our first official date. 

at the end of the school year we were pretty distant and i really didnt know what we were but we kept hooking up at parties and hanging out sometimes... but i never felt that emotional connection because all we talked about were superficial very concrete things. we got closer when summer started and got closer mentally: when we saw eachother we felt close and i felt his interest through his actions his body language etc but nothing was ever said out loud 

now hes left the country to go on vacation for two months and we aren't gonna see eachother for a while -- we were extremely close the last week before he left and we saw eachother every day so it was sweet and i didnt think i needed anything more from him.  but ever since he's been gone we've been texting but our relationship has been reduced to that type of superficial small talk type thing we dont talk about feelings or our issues or our lives or anything remotely important. we recently made it official and are dating but our relationship hasnt gotten to anything bigger in terms of emotions.

i have a lot of shit inside my head and i often have to vent -- im insecure and i get anxious and panicky about certain things and i heavily rely on my friends and close ones my age because i feel its easier to connect with them.. 

since we're so superficial in our relationship i dont feel like i can talk to him about that -- once he invalidated my insecurities which is something i struggle w a lot and he said he doubts i have those serious of issues -- granted we werent very close back then but i can barely say we are now... i stil feel judged and invalidated so i dont feel trusting enough to confide in him or to come to him when i need someone. he cant express his emotions: i said i miss you a couple times and he didnt answer until a few days ago. i need someone that can be there for me so i told him about it 

he said i should be able to speak to him, that he would help and listen and that he has emotions he just isnt used to telling people about them or sharing anything. i thought it got better and that we would talk about things and form that dimension of our relationship but the next day things reverted to basically the same as before. 

im struggling with my own feelings a lot lately so i need the support right now and i really dont know if i can get that with him. how should i handle it? when i am with him i feel the connection and im so happy and i dont need verbal validation of his feelings but when we're apart i cant read what hes feeling and he cant tell me so i dont know if im getting what i wanted from this relationship.

any advice? i dont know if i should stay with him and see it through or break up with him and find someone more capable?",14Jul2018,1

54,"I want to start this off by apologizing if this isn’t quite the right place to post this. If there is a better subreddit to post this, let me know.

I’m currently in the process of finalizing my financial aid and registering for classes so that I can finally return to school this coming semester. It’s something I’ve been waiting nearly two years to do and I’m looking forward to it. The only thing is, I’m having trouble finding information about the two different fields I’m considering that is anything beyond generalized information. 

I’ve narrowed my sights down to information technology and/or some form of engineering. I use to have healthcare in the mix, but after gaining first-hand experience in that field, I’ve discovered that it is a field that I do not enjoy being in and have no desire to pursue further. I’ve researched other fields including business, finance, and public service and, for the most part, have decided against them as well based upon my own personal preferences. 

It’s not incredibly urgent for me to have a specific program picked out at this point in time since there are some basic prerequisites for all programs that I need a semester to complete, but come next year, I will need to have a decision made and I want to make that decision as informed as I can.  Fortunately, I am going to an inexpensive state school and qualify for financial aid that will cover my tuition, books, and other supplies so that I do not have to take out loans. Understandably, I don’t want to waste time or that financial aid. 

So, my questions for each respective field are (in no particular order):
1. What level of education did you need to enter the field?
2. How easy/hard was it to get hired after you obtained your degree? Did you previously have an internship in your respective field that helped you to get hired?
3. Do you feel that the salary you are being paid is what you are worth or at least close to it? If you don’t mind me asking, what is that salary? Furthermore, is it an entry-level or experienced salary? Does it get the bills paid and leave you enough leftover that you could possibly save or invest?
4. Are you satisfied with your respective field? Was it worth it? 
5. Do you think there is a future in your field? Will your job still be needed 10-20+ years from now?

So, I welcome anyone in any form of engineering or information technology to respond and thank you for the time you spent reading this and replying. I don’t think anyone ever 100% enjoys their jobs/careers, but I’m sure having one that you don’t hate and pays you well sure makes working 40+ hours a week a little more bearable. I have considered trying to network a little to try to find someone through mutual relatives or friends in the fields I’m interested in and possibly see if I can spend some time with them and see their careers first-hand, but so far, no luck. 

Again, thank you!",14Jul2018,0
55,"LONG POST AHEAD

There are two different parts to this post but the title works for both. Part one is about a trip I went on and part two is about a girl I met on this trip. I know you are all probably tired of people talking about moving on from girls (I feel like it’s every other post on this sub) so feel free to skip it. Also I am on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues. 

Part one

I am about to be a sophomore in college. My freshman year went alright. I liked it but I felt like I could have done something more. Growing up I always heard that college is some of the best years of your life but I didn’t really feel that. Because of this I decided to sign up for a study abroad program this summer to try and feel excited. 

It worked. 

Too well. 

I signed up for a program in Paris. It was only a six week long program that started in the end of May and ran until a couple of weeks ago in the end of June. 

I am not exaggerating when I say that these were the best six weeks of my life. 

It was my first time out of the country (USA) and my first time really living in a big city. I loved the freedom I had, the things I was able to see and do, and just in general the entire experience. 

But now that I am back home I have almost fell into a sort of depression. I can’t find that much enjoyment in things that I do because nothing can live up to the amount of fun that I had overseas. 

I need your advice on how I can learn to move on from this trip and start to enjoy things at home more while still having the good memories I had abroad. 

Now on to part two, the girl. 

There were about 40 people in the program, with the majority coming from one of two schools. For anonymity I won’t say the schools but I will say one of them is in Michigan and the other is in Texas. Naturally, the people from each school tended to hang out with each other, so there were kind of two separate groups. The Michigan group and the Texas group. I, from Michigan, tried to hang with the people from my school, the Michigan school, but for some reason I didn’t really mesh with them very well so I started to gravitate towards the Texas group. Most of the people in this group were really cool and I liked hanging out with them, plus there was one girl in this group who I just fell in love with at first sight. 

After hanging with this group for a while, I started to get to know this girl pretty well. And she finds out from one of my other friends in the group that I like her. I was a little nervous when I realized that she found out but it turned out ok because she then told me that she liked me too. However this is where the good luck ends. I knew right then that there were two major problems. 

1. She has a boyfriend 
2. She lives in Texas and I live in Michigan

So while it was fun in Paris with her we are now living literally a thousand miles away from each other and she is back with her boyfriend. We still text quite a bit but I can tell that the distance is really taking its toll. I’m thinking of just not talking to her anymore because the more I do the more I miss her and I start to feel really depressed.

I can’t stop thinking about her. I need your help. Should I just move on? Should I keep talking to her?

Thank you everyone in advance for your help on both parts.

56,"Hi. On my phone so sorry for formatting or whatever. 

I'm a man in my early 30's, and I have been in a LOT of accidents in my life. I'm talking 13 total bones broken. Yes, 13. Arms, legs, hand/fingers, collerbone, etc. I'm not fucking kidding, and other than broken bones I have been in many incidents including multiple second degree burns, and more bruises and cuts than I can goddamn count. The point is, I'm an accident prone ass person, and, needless to say, I have just a teensy bit of trauma. So now, everywhere I go, I sort of feel like something bad's gonna happen, and sometimes physically cringe thinking about the horrible things that can happen anywhere. I've been to a couple therapists, but they're pretty expensive and they didn't help that much, so I stopped. Anyway, my question is; how do I stop myself imagining the horrible accidents I could potentially get into?

58,"For all my teachers/students/educators...

I just finished a research course, taught by the director of the program. Participation is part of the class and there is a rubric for it. Here's a link of the rubric: https://file.io/IL250F

I thought I was doing fine, since I counted that I was late once (about 5 minutes late), always participated each class, I would do all of my assignments and would read the needed reading before class, and I got hit with a 79/100 for participation/assignment section.


A couple of my classmates who were also ropped off their grades went to see her and she was nasty to them as well, and told them that she is the director so she can do what she wants and she doesn't have to show them the breakdown of their grades. And then she continued to call security and kick them out of her office.

Now what really sent me over the edge, is one of my friends and classmate, received a 95 while she was gone a whole week (for vacation) and participated once. And I have a few friends who received 95-100 and were late and missed class and participated the same amount or even less that I did.

The director is known to pick and choose favorites and she is known to not like certain people, she has a problem with my cohort for some reason... so what do I do in this case? I really don't want to escalate this before I get my grade for my paper, because of she is... and she will give me a bad grade on purpose. I have spoke to several of my previous professor, and they told me I should wait until I get my final grade and make an appeal to the dean and then escalate to Academic Affairs. How do I swing the whole 'well many of my classmates got this and xyz...'- unsure how to pose the formal letter I have to write.. Would this be valid information to present in my letter?

Thank you in advance! Looking for all the recommendations you guys have!

TLDR; I received a grade I didn't deserve and need to appeal it by obnoxious professor who has some hidden agenda towards me.",14Jul2018,1
60,This is a long post but my girlfriend of just 3 months who I am trying to help anyway I can just made it out of her abusive Father's household and lives with her mom this move her dad pulled crushed her and knowing she has anxiety and depression I'm not sure what to do I love her to death and want to try and do something in this situation. How her dad managed to pull this off was by keeping her phone and using it to go onto her personal Gmail then he changed her password to her Ticketmaster just before she could stop it and I haven't seen her so crushed this being her first concert and seeing Panic at the Disco with her favorite singer Brenden Urie hoping he would meet him got all ready and now her dad did this. I don't want to see her hurt herself so I need any kind of advice or helping making sure that she is happy or even advice on how to get her tickets or honestly for her I would hope to unrealisticly talk to Panic but any advice now will help right now.,14Jul2018,1
61,"I have been single for over a year. And when I mean single, I mean I haven’t been on a date or kissed anyone. I am 19 and F, but began college and living alone at 15 so I am not young minded. My school is dominated by women, due to being in science/math/Physics my classes are 99% women with the occasional guy. I am so lonely for affection of just talking and building a bond, sex, etc. I don’t have a need for a label of a “boyfriend” but I need that intimacy. 

My friends realize how single I am and tried to put me up to a one night stand on tinder tonight and I couldn’t go through with it. I can’t have sex with someone I don’t trust, and it usually takes more than 24 hours to trust someone and sometimes you never will. Also, I am worried about the dangers (killed, robbed, drugged, stds) Also, artificial meetings sometime take the fun out of dating to me. 

I have been on tinder for a year but nothing comes of it. I rarely get to the point of talking to a guy where he asks me to meet up.. and when they do I get the definite vibe of it’s only for sex.. and I don’t go. 
I’ve tried different apps with the same results. 

What should I do? ",14Jul2018,0
62,"Sigh.

I'm dating this guy who I grew up with, and ever since we've met we've been best friends. We've spent the past eight years talking online or being together virtually 24/7 and I love him to death.

We're dating now and have been for a year.

In high school (years before we started dating) he came out as trans and started using female pronouns and female name online. This bothered me a lot because I had a crush on him and didn't want him to change (also I'm straight). A little after he did that he told me he was in love with me and wanted to date. I told him no and told him it was because of the trans thing.

Fast forward a few years and he ends up developing a chronic disease and loses a fuck ton of weight. (he used to be very overweight, and is now skinny). A few months after that we were talking and he told me he didn't feel like he was trans anymore, and he explains that it was because he was uncomfortable being fat and felt ugly (also he is very into transformation porn and he said that was a cause as well).

I was very suspicious that he was telling me this so he could date me, as I had just became single, and he knew that was something preventing it from happening, but I went along with it anyways.

We started dating and moved in together, I love him, but there are things that bother me still. He told all his online friends to refer to him as male and use his original name when we started dating (a year ago). His friends were all super confused because they were crazy supportive and the change was sudden for them.

The things that bother me are as follows:

He identified as a girl for years and had people calling him as such for that long and was perfectly ok with it. I don't know anyone who would be ok with that for that long without feeling it was true for them.

His fetish. I've never seen him uh ""enjoy himself"" as much as when I've indulged him in the past. (Calling him a girl name etc). It doesn't even seem like only sexual gratification either...

He wouldn't cut his hair since I've met him and I only just convinced him to do it. He used to tell me he would cry when his mother would take him to get a haircut.

I've read some of his old confersations with his friends (yeah I know snooping is bad, sue me) and he had in depth ""...as a trans girl"" political discussions....a lot.

I have asked him about this as we are very close and direct, and he staunchly denies that he is or wants to be trans. Basically, I'm scared he's lying to me to keep me around and I don't blame him because I know I wouldn't want to be with him if he confirmed it. I don't want to end up married with kids and he has it all bottled up and comes out then, I feel that would ruin my life.

I do care about him deeply but the suspicion eats away at me.

Ugh.

I would love to hear from anyone who changed their mind about gender identity or someone you know who did the same. ",14Jul2018,0

65,"Hi all,

I'm  so frustrated and exhausted from worrying about this. I work in the freelance industry (TV production). I love my job. Its unstable and sometimes I go a few weeks without working, and sometimes I get a longer term thing to cover me for months. It's always really fun, and I'm really good at what I do. I have a degree in filmmaking and have been responsibly moving up in the field. I will not get the offer of employer provided health insurance because it just doesn't exist in this field. I'm turning 26 in a few months and I feel defeated. 

Looking at Obamacare prices - I'm not seeing a plan that I can afford. I live in New York City. It's expensive to live here, and the added price of $300-500/ month plus a deductible of $3-10k is killing me. My parents literally suggested leaving my field. I'm debating leaving the country. I don't want to leave my field and I don't want to leave the country, but both those options give me an out to this huge problem. I might be able to afford the costs, but there's a chance that I won't be able to, and it will definitely affect my quality of life. I currently make around $50k/ year which is manageable for this city. Its comfortable for me in my crappy apartment shared with many roommates. Its not a lot, but its definitely more than some, and it's more than I've made previous years. I'm proud of where I am and I'm on track with my career.

I make too much money for medicaid, and depending  on how much I work this year, I think I might make too much for government help. I also can't forgo healthcare. People keep telling me to just ""stay healthy""... but I'm not. I have an autoimmune disease. And knowing that every time I see my rheumatologist I'll have to pay a large amount until I hit a high deductible is nauseating. Then it's not just $500/month. It's  that cost plus $10k for every year. And it will go up every year after that! Literally everyone I know that is 26-30 and doesn't have employer benefits either don't have insurance or have a catastrophic plan. That won't work for me and I don't know what to do. I think this is more rant then anything else, but if anyone has ideas I'm all ears.",14Jul2018,0
66,"I’ve been struggling lately. It’s awful. 

Recently my girlfriend revealed that she had been with a co-worker (company of 300) that works with us about two years ago. (One year before we met.) I didn’t understand why him or why she committed that act. She didn’t go into details about it but acted weird. She said there was no precursor to sex. She went to his house to hang-out strictly as a friend with others present and she said “it just happened” and she didn’t know that was going to happen. She said they didn’t talk ever again after that day. I was upset and kind of confused. She was reluctant to talk about it or go into it. 

A few weeks ago, it came up again and she clarified what she meant by “it just happened.” He sexually assaulted her and forced her to have sex with him, completely ignoring her choice. He didn’t care what she wanted. I broke down immediately and started crying. I’ve witnessed my mother being sexually assaulted before as a child. It shattered my world. I experienced so many different emotions. Anger. Confusion. Sadness. Regret. I was disgusted with myself because I made slighted comments about her hooking up with said person but it wasn’t anything like that. It was quite the opposite. 

She doesn’t want to file a report. We are in the Navy. So it makes things difficult. There is a culture of victim blaming and doubt. She doesn’t want to be seen in that light or go through the process. She wishes it to just go away and act as if it didn’t happen. Only 3 people know. Her. Him. Me. She just wants to let it go. It’s her way of coping. 

I don’t feel the same way. I want to take action. I feel helpless and I’m at a fork in the road. I’m tired of this happening to the women I love in my life. I see this person everyday at work and if I could cause him harm, I would. I’ve considered it. I want him gone. It eats me alive to see him walking around freely. He could be doing these things to other women. I’ve heard of similar sketchy situations involving him. 

I know this isn’t about me but this situation resonates inside my heart. I cry from time to time about it. 

What do I do?",14Jul2018,0
67,"My partner tried to leave me last night. He came over and out of the blue said he couldn’t do this anymore. Previously he’d been saying he loved me and gave no indication anything was wrong, other than saying he’d been struggling worse than he ever has before.

I fought him to stay, saying if he still felt this way in a week we can rediscuss but right now I didn’t feel he was in the headspace to be making big decisions. He said he was just too overwhelmed to be in a relationship right now.

I believe he wasn’t thinking straight, he told me he just couldn’t feel anything and was overwhelmed and anxious and his headspace was telling him to just cut everything and everyone off. A lot of what he said wasn’t making sense, in that he’d said the last few days had been worse, yet the last few days were when he was on a holiday without me so in my mind I didn’t make sense that leaving me would solve those problems if when he was without me, he got worse.

I told him that he had made a commitment and that meant not making impulsive decisions but thinking things through and that relationships are your biggest asset when you’re depressed. He said he’d been thinking about it for a while, yet only thought of acting on it since the night before. He didn’t tell me at all though what was going on inside his head.

I believed at the time that I made the right decision in persuading him to stay but I’m doubting whether it was just my selfishness and my wants rather than for the best. He told me after that he never wanted to break up with me and he knew I’d convince him to stay and said I love you throughout the whole conversation, but I don’t know what’s actually going on inside his head.

I genuinely don’t know where I stand now but I feel awful and guilty for arguing with him to stay when he said he didn’t want to, I don’t know if it was for the greater good and it’s what he really wanted or if he was honest when he said he wanted out.

He has tried to break up with me before, when we were first together, while he was in a bad headspace, which I talked him out of. And he has told me since then he was so happy he stayed and that I make everything better and make him happy and he feels more for me than he thought he could feel.

I don’t know how to feel I don’t know where to go from here. I’m contacting a psychologist for him and just want to be here to support him but I’m scared being with him isn’t what he wants. Yet from my experiences, when people are depressed and impulsively push others away, then realise all there problems haven’t disappeared, they regret it so much. I don’t know what to do or where to go from here :(

She's a friend from school, and while I wanted to make plans with her after classes ended in April, she was busy at the time so I gave her some space. I haven't heard from her since, and want to try and get in touch again (we sat together during class, and would study for exams together). Would the following text be a good way to reach out?


""Hey, [her name]! Haven’t talked to you in a while, how’s your summer been?""


I was originally going to write ""haven't heard from you in a while"" but that seems passive aggressive.


Also, on a semi-related note, I've noticed that none of my friends ever reach out to me. As in, I am always the one to start texting them (various things, like asking to hang out, or picking up conversations we had earlier that day/week) and if I stop initiating then I'll never get a response back. It's gotten to the point where I literally don't talk to anyone but family. Do people just expect others to text them, or am I not doing something to make them want to text me?

73,"I am someone who will be starting their sophomore year in September.  For the first part of my freshman year however I did not do my work and goofed off the entire time. A month or two into the second semester of my freshman year I had a sort of ""awakening moment"", where I finally decided that I was going to give it my all to make a better career for myself. I raised my grades and started to prepare for tests I might take, scholarships, community services and looking into colleges I may wish to go to. However I have noticed that many of the scholarships my current school of choice( USC) offers are very competitive scholarships and because of my bad semester in freshman year I may not qualify for them.

Here are my grades and classes: 

8th Grade Year Semester 1

Algebra 1: A-

Spanish 1: B+

8th Grade Year Semester

Algebra 1: B

Spanish 1: B

8th Grade Year Semester 3

Spanish 2 : B-

Geom Honors : B-

Physical Education: A

Biology : A-

Human Geog AP: A-  
 

My high school follows a standard GPA system out of 4, A=4, B=3, C= 2, D= 1, F=0. AP/Honors/IB classes are all weighted and add 0.2 to my final GPA total. Courses such as Cross-Country and Physical Education are not calculated into the GPA sent to colleges. I wasn't able to raise my second semester Freshman year grades to all As due to the fact that I only started trying in the middle of second semester, I am pretty confident of having high grades and good classes throughout the rest of high school. I seek advice on how I may be able to raise my GPA for 9th grade semester 1. I did not get high school credit for Semester 1 Biology but took a summer school credit recovery course for it. I live in California, and wish to go to University of Southern California . I also hope to qualify for academic scholarships and hopefully the national merit scholarship. Here is some more info on my PSAT and AP testing this year and also my sophomore year first semester classes.

Sophomore Year Classes:

Eng 2 Honors

Spanish 3 

Algebra 2 Honors

Cross-Country Running Club ( Junior Varsity)

Chemistry Honors

AP European History

AP Art History

PSAT 8-9 Results:

Total Score: 1180( 96th Percentile)

Math Score: 610( 97th Percentile)

NSMQT scores:

Reading: 27

Writing: 30

Math: 31.5

AP Human Geography Exam Results: 5 (extremely well qualified)

So yea just looking for some general advice on how I might be able to raise the grades for my first semester of ninth grade year. How I may qualify for scholarships such as Presidential or Trustee. I will be trying harder in Sophomore, Junior and Senior Years, to raise my GPA and get good SAT/ACT scores, but I want to know if I can get rid of this dark spot on my high school career.

74," Hi all!  A little background about my situation; I graduated high school a semester early and then went to my local community college the following semester. I had a great mindset going in, signed up for 3 classes (Chemistry, Online History, and Introduction to Library and Research). In the middle of the semester I dropped my Research class, because well, it was just stupid and unnecessary. Chemistry had always been my weakness, never understood it no matter how hard I really tried. Nonetheless, I was still determined to receive at least a B in the class. Everything went well at first, until I started getting behind. Long story short, I fell so behind I couldn’t really make it up and made the decision to skip the final as I knew I was going to fail anyways and had a C in the class already. I ended up failing the class altogether, as well as my history class. Now this wouldn’t be as bad if I wasn’t receiving full financial aid to attend this community college. I spoke with an advisor who basically told me I was screwed, and my problem was that I had no idea what I was doing post college and therefore didn’t have any goals and wasn’t motivated. I’m now contemplating if I even want to return to college this upcoming semester, and would rather just work full-time at my current job. Is it beneficial to take a gap year, and am I even eligible to now that I’ve completely fucked up my entire financial aid situation? Should I even return if I have no career plans post college? I just feel lost and unmotivated.

TL;DR: Failed my first semester in college, unsure of if I want to return at all. No direction in my life career wise and am starting to believe educational institutions are bogus and a scam.",14Jul2018,2

My whole life it has been just totally broken, my parents were constantly fighting and there was so much mental abuse, then they split up.

Nothing I want or want to do, or even what I do ever goes correctly. Any time I make plans, they just get totally annihilated by other events that I had no knowledge of in the first place. Why do I have to be the one to go through with this, I don’t like being called selfish or ignorant, because it doesn’t help me realize anything. Not only does my life never work, but my body is somehow going to shit as well. I have scoliosis which causes me to be in so much pain sometimes.

76,"I have a depressed friend, and lately he started acting differently from how he behaves and talks with me. I wasn’t sure if I should have left him alone or get him to open up to me— as in to help. So I asked another friend for advice. I followed the advice, asking if he wanted to talk, offered a listening ear. Depressed friend didn’t refuse but told me that he was tired and to leave him be for awhile. He didn’t want to talk to anyone at all. I said ok, take your time. Later on, I stupidly left another single message about how I hope that no one stole or broke his heart. I didn’t think he would get back to me. But he replied. He seemed pissed. Cussing at me. Saying, how can someone steal/break their heart when they can’t even leave their goddamned bed? That he can’t eat, sleep, or talk or be a decent person at the moment. They wanted me to leave him be before he hurt someone’s feelings. But it was too late, I got hurt. I had never seen that side of him before. I apologized but he hasn’t got back to me. I feel horrible about it all, I don't want to lose him. 

I know it’s the depression talking, it’s what he is mad about—not me(I hope), but I feel at fault. I feel I didn’t even say anything that horrible to illicit such a response. It’s only been a few days but I feel like I messed up our relationship. It doesn’t help that I have feelings for this person either. I can’t believe I’ve been crying over it. I feel overly sensitive. But it just hurts to see him act so deceptively okay, polite and nice to others. 

The problem is: I keep thinking over it.  The only way it stops is when I’m sleeping but even then my dreams will haunt me with my depressed friend. I wake up at 1 or 3 am and can’t go back to sleep because I'm constantly thinking about it. I feel I can’t escape.

I hate it, I want it out my mind. I feel like I’m crazy, it‘s such a small thing to obsess over. 

TLDR; My depressed friend snaps back at me after I leave a message expressing my hope, they wanted to be left alone and stopped talking to me. I can’t stop thinking over it. It hurt. I want the thoughts to stop. 

Is there anything anyone can recommend I do to stop thinking about it?

77,"I'm talking to a girl right now, we've been talking for about 7-8 months. We've gotten to know each other really well and through all that time we've been through many ups and downs. There's just one problem. I thought that I fell for this girl pretty hard when we first started talking...she definitely fell for me. She made that clear and through all these months she's proved how much she means it when she says ""I love you"". I tell her the same and, while I'm not lying, I *do* love this girl but, I don't have very strong feelings for her. Or at least, they faded *incredibly* quickly. As we still talk to this day, we're basically considered dating (it's never been official between us though).
I care a lot about this girl and don't want to lose her; she has taught me so much and helped me in so many situations in my life and basically killed all of my insecurities. She's my hakuna matata. The only problem is... I don't have feelings for her in ""that way"". She comes at me telling me she wants to be with me forever (yes, she says those words, and has multiple times). And while, not wanting to make it awkward and to make her happy, I'd tell her the same thing. It's easy to when you're in the mood. But then afterward, when I'm alone and we aren't talking on the phone or anything, I truthfully say to myself: ""what the fuck did I just get myself into"". Don't get me wrong, this girl is beautiful and I'm pretty sure she means well. But she's not perfect and her flaws are enough for me to not be in love with her. Like, she has some serious turn-offs in my book and the good doesn't make up for them, especially when she continues to do things that downright piss me off even after apologizing.

I just don't know what to do. I've dug the relationship/""I love you"" hole so deep with this girl, there is no escape. I can't just tell her ""I don't feel anything with you anymore"". Not after the meaningful things we've said to each other. But at the same time I don't want to lose her.

No, I don't know why I dug the hole this deep. I guess I didn't know what I was getting myself into. Please help me, ask questions if I wasn't clear enough about her personality if that matters. This girl scares me if I'm going to be real. Like a lot.",14Jul2018,2
78,"Before I start this post, I want you all to know a couple things that relate to the story.

First, I love music. From country to heavy metal to hip hop, I've always been one that spreads their playlist evenly across all genres. Second, I'm 17 years old. Lastly, I've just moved back to my home state after living in another state away from my friends and sibling for a couple years.

So, a few short stories to explain my problem in detail:

- One story being that I was in my car with my sister and she handed me the aux cord. I played a song I really enjoyed, and when she didn't react, I changed the song until it seemed like she sort of liked it. 

- Another time is with my best friend. We always used to go travel places, so we always listened to music on the way there and back. I now notice that the same thing occurred. When he didn't react, I changed it.

- This last time was the time I noticed it. My brother, 25, loves metal (as do I, but I'm more interested in rap). We start talking about it and I wanted to play a rap song and he was fully against it. He expressed a disinterest in it for personal reasons, but I became fairly upset being that it's a peak genre for me. I know I had no room to be upset over his musical taste, but I was. In my mind, I was just trying to expand his rap horizon and show him that good rap exists, but I know he was very uncomfortable and didn't want to. Now, I still haven't apologized and don't know the best way

That being said, the issue boils down to me wanting a positive reaction. If a reaction isn't warranted or it seems like they don't like it, it feels like it becomes personal to me. It's a terrible issue, and I'm not sure why I do it, which is why I've turned to this subreddit for help.

My questions being:

1. Why do I take it personally, and what can I do to change that?

2. How can I help prevent myself from taking it personally?

3. What should I do with the situation involving my brother?

4. Is this part of a bigger issue?

Met a guy at a fast food joint. We talked a bit, asks for my number. I was interested, so I gave it to him. 

First night talking, I mention that I work out with my mom in the evenings. He suddenly asks to join us, and I agree to meet him. Next day, he texts around 4 asking if we’re still working out. I said yes, but then he asks me to pick him up. I got uncomfortable with that, but I tell him we’re not going until the evening. Doesn’t give a response for 3 hours. 

I tell my dad, dad’s uncomfortable about it. Told my mom, mom wants to pick him up. My mom’s been wanting me to find someone, even tried getting random guys’ numbers, and she probably thinks this is a good opportunity for me. And since she would be in the car with me, I asked where he lived. No response. It was getting late, so we left. As I’m parking 10 minutes later, he suddenly texts he’s taking his dad somewhere. I said it’s fine, I go to work out, but I’m annoyed that he waited until the last minute to say something. That’s a huge trigger for me. 

We continue to text, but he takes hours before responding. I’ve done the same, but not at first, and not for that long; I am quick to respond, but because he’s done it continuously, I assume it’s not a huge problem if I do it, too. I could say that he’s busy, but we text around midnight to 3ish and I don’t think he works around those times. 

Conversations don’t feel natural to me anymore, too. At one point, he says I’m cute and wants to get to know me better, so I suggested we ask each other some questions. I was hoping that a more natural conversation was sparked, something to help keep interest in him, but it didn’t go very far. By the time he responds, I’ve already lost interest. Think I may have gone to bed, too. 

Attempts at meeting up haven’t gone well----one time, he asked me to meet him in his neighborhood. I was NOT comfortable with that. I barely knew the guy, but I wasn’t opposed to meeting him. We tried planning for that, but nothing happened. Honestly, I think both of us weren’t interested. 

Wasn’t until recently that I see him again, accidentally. I was working out, noticed a guy come in to wipe the machines. When I was done, I went upstairs for my mom. Noticed the same guy again but was too tired to think about it. Wasn’t until he came up to me that I realized it was the guy I was texting. Said I looked familiar but wasn’t sure. He apparently volunteers there. I think it’s when I couldn’t recognize him that I knew there wasn’t much left between us. We tried chatting, me asking a question or two, him asking what I was doing, but it was awkward and nothing productive. My mom rounds the corner, I point her out, and then he waves at her, saying “hi, mom!” She’s friendly with him, but he was being, I don’t know, overly enthusiastic? I guess because it’s my mom. 

Since seeing him, he’s texted ‘wyd’ and I have yet to respond. At this point, I just lost interest. Should I just text him that this isn't really working out, or would it be better to just let it fade? If we’re talking more and I was no longer interested, I wouldn't have too much problem telling him this, but we are pretty infrequent.",14Jul2018,1

86,"My friend is in desperate need of help and I’m so lost on what I need to do to help her get to college. Before I get started sorry for bad grammar in advance. I’ll try my best to answer your comments.

My friend has had a rough family upbringing and half way into her senior year of high school her father wasn’t taking necessary care of her and she moved into an aunts apartment. This apartment mind you is in a different county as the school she should be attending. Her father was the only one who could have signed her into a closer school, yet no one ever got in touch with him to do so. So then she was stuck with track season starting and this plays a huge role into her college choice. She has excellent grades and does great in track so the university she plans on attending is nearly entirely paying for her way there and this is coming from out of our home state. So, even with her aunt not putting forth effort besides letting my friend sleep at the apartment; I had to take her back and forth from school everyday from another county away for the next six months. This isn’t a big deal anymore, because thankfully God was on our side and I was able to get her to graduation this past June. Now, I don’t have much money and her cousin in California offered to fly my friend out to help get her started again and keep her there until it’s time for her to go to college. My friends cousin ends up kicking her out where she has now been staying at some friends home secretly. I’ve sent some money already to help, but I’m not stable enough to help her like she needs. We are approximately one month away from the start of her school year and she needs to get there. I’ve been able to do all I could while she lived back here with me. 

Reddit, I need you to come through for me and my close friend. I need to ask you guys a couple of questions that may help.

1.) So my friends father AND mother have been paying child support for her for awhile and we are wondering where the money is going. She’s just turned 18 and to me it would make logical sense if the authorities or someone could then transfer that money rightfully to her when she’s got no financial support.  I know it may vary by state with that being said, her father lives in North Carolina were I am. How can we get this money going to her without knowing who’s receiving the current child support?

2.) If any of you know anywhere else I could post to get some help for her, please let me know. Whether it’s another subreddit or some advice from someone you know I’d really appreciate it.

Side note: We haven’t gotten the authorities involved in the past due to them possibly making her family dynamic even worse. She would’ve been taken away to a foster home and that was even further away from the school she needed to get to. She’s in California, trying to get by and I can’t let her down.

I’ve also tried getting in contact with the school just less than an hour ago, maybe something soon.

89,"The neighborhood kids were my best friends. We used to play from dusk to dawn. We would battle our lightsabers, walk along the neighborhood trail, have lunch at each other’s houses, play in holes, have lemonade stands, and play air soft till the neighborhood light came on signifying curfew. There were 7 of us. Two were older and eventually moved, leaving 5 of us. Then a year passed and the 2 siblings eventually moved, leaving 3 of us. Eventually the last two moved and I was the last one remaining.

Now, I look around and see a new generation of kids playing on the streets, riding their bikes, having carefree lives, and curiously approaching me with questions. I love it, but it also makes me realize how much older I’m getting and how I long to reconnect with my childhood best friends (or at least see where life has taken them). The only problem is, I only remember their first names!!!

I’m still connected slightly to the last two, but they don’t remember either, my parents don’t remember, and we’ve asked the new homeowners of the house that they lived it, and they haven’t been able to find the paperwork. I don’t even know where they moved too.

91,"a serious questions for y'all who are experienced with life....So my life has just started....around 20 years old. I am a very cynical person and dont appreciate life very much and have been indifferent about life. half of the time I just kinda hope I wasn't born and now since I am an only child. cant really just leave behind things. recently I graduated and am looking for a job, however due to language barriers I cannot find a job as easy as others. Or maybe I am just bad with interviews and people. I have been told I am extremely mean and fucked up and nobody wants to be around me which is true true true. However I do need to find a job which means I need to pass interviews. However i am not an imposer....if I support trump I support trump. if I think the people who got stuck in thai cave shouldn't be called heroes cuz they shouldn't have got in there the first place then I ma say it. It is hard for me to pretend or be poli correct. Anyways i think because of what I knew about others....the veteran who forced me to do things we agreed on not to do...other people who forced themselves on me, or when I discovered other's secrets I just dont trust anyone. I never thought it was a problem and ppbly will stay this way.

Had an interview where the employer straight up told me they didnt want me and I also straight up said well i like other conversation also your honesty. 

Wondering if anyone can offer some tips on how I can become nicer so I get a job. 

also I think certain times I get extremely angry from 1-100 real fast even at myself. like I get dizzy once in a while and everytime i just intentionally bash myself or get mad hoping one of the veins would pop.

93,"Alright so a neighbor anonymously complained that my family has been attracting cats that pee or mark on their car tires because we leave out food all of the time by our front door. This is entirely my fault, and I was very apologetic and I've put the food away now. 

So some pretty hefty background, I live in a townhouse with my family. I've always loved cats and I have been feeding this lovely black cat for 2 years since I was 17 and even asked my parents if she can sleep in the  home until she passed away. She was unusually sweet and seemed to know how to lay in my lap when I sit down on the concrete so I suspected she belonged to someone before. 

After she passed, another cat stopped by. This gray cat isn't as friendly as my first because he always runs away when I come near but walks to the food when I'm farther away or go back into my home. He doesn't hiss and has a very calm demeanor, but I give him space and he just likes to chill on my doormat and seems to always be waiting for me though. I was always worried about him because one day he came by with this huge chunk of fur off of his back like something scraped it off of him. I just kept giving him food and kept watching him and it healed eventually and I was glad it didn't cause an infection. 


It's the summer now and the heat is up to 90-105, and I decidedly to leave out a bowl of water. The next day my dad got an email from the HOA that someone wants the food stopped and that the cats in the neighborhood are destructive and I had no clue that this was happening. My dad was sad too, but we had no choice. 

So it's been 3 heat days and the little guy is still waiting and looks a lot skinnier.

I understand that I shouldn't be doing this and I only want to feed him and not other critters like the more viscous cats or possums so I let him to the garage and fed him inside there. I've done it when no one was looking, but one day my mom caught me and was really, really pissed. She told me that it was probably ""this neighbor""-  and this neighbor is always nosy and likes to bust people's asses and yelled at me that the stray can find food somewhere else so we can't risk my dumbself doing this. While she was yelling at me the gray cat was sitting on our doormat waiting for me and I had to walk away because my mom was watching me.

So understandably my family would get fined if we leave out food, but technically I'm not leaving it out the whole day or night for other animals to get to it. Would I still get us in trouble? I was really sad and kept thinking of ways to avoid it- leave food in the backyard, give it food just real quick, or abandon it all together. My dad also wants to leave a little food in the backyard but my mom is just angry at the idea.

Things escalate quickly and when she finally removes her underwear, I'm hit with a strong pungent smell. This should've been the first red flag. I ignore it and after a few seconds of sex, she breaks down crying. She says she had a traumatic flashbacks of rapes and then includes her abusive parents. I try to calm her down and cheer her up which ends up working but now she suddenly acts differently. She begins kissing me and caressing me etc. in a way you would do in a serious relationship. She goes on to say things like ""you'd make a perfect boyfriend"" and ""you're now my one and only cuddle buddy. no one else can have you"" on top of repeating how thankful she is for cheering her up. I'm completely turned off at this point and realize the mistake I made for letting my other head do the thinking. I pretend to be tired and sleep until she has to leave.

I watch anime too, but lately makes me sad as I don't talk to a lot of people anymore unless I drive 3hours to visit friends that moved, they come visit, or there's surf.

It feels like we're not even in a relationship, when we go weeks without seeing each other and barely talk at all. That just makes me so sad. I could be overemotional. And listen - I've told him a few times before that I want to talk more, but admittedly I sugarcoat it every time. However, I did specifically say once ""I need to talk to you more.""

On Monday, we talked on the phone. I was upset because I thought we'd be able to hang out and then it got canceled. I was trying not to cry(because I cry too easily) and he asked if I was okay.

Today while he was getting ready to leave for a flight he mentioned causaly how i could just do this myself, which is true but i always thought we where close and maybe he would be intrested in seeing what he would be paying for.

My friend passed away at 25 because of reasons that are sill not completely clear about ten months ago. My girlfriend and I were very close to him and have kept in close contact with his parents through this time of mourning, they are family to us. The problem they are having is that he had a MacBook Pro and a surface pro that he had most of his art and photography on but due to privacy policies cannot get access to. They have gone through every means of communication with Apple and Microsoft that they can, provided death certificates and jumped through every hoop imaginable but have had no luck with how to gain access to his devices and Apple and Microsoft have said they can’t do anything about it unless they have the passwords to get into the computers. Has anyone dealt with this issue or know anyone who has? They don’t want to invade his privacy but they want to be able to access his art and despite court orders and death certificates are being denied.

115,"Recently, I’ve started regaining interest for a YouTube channel. I have had a lot of experience editing and animating as well. 

It all started when I was in 4th grade. I had a burst of creative knowledge, and was set out to show my talents to the world. I found a website called, “YouTube,” in 2012.  I was around maybe 9 or 10 years old at that time. This was also the time when my dad secretly let me on the computer (my mom didn’t let me without supervising) when my mom wasn’t home.

I downloaded several editing apps (free of course) and got started. I learned the basic functions such as cropping, trimming, time duration, split, copy, paste, green screen, applying shadows/borders, text, overlays, filters, and the list can go on and on. Ever since, I have been obsessed with people knowing who I am and what I have to offer. 

I would animate characters on online games, especially one called, “Fantage.” Rip tho, because they recently shut down.

My channel started growing and I almost got to 100 subs. Unfortunately, middle school came and I was burdened by sudden responsibilities and... puberty. So I quit and lost all motivation.

For some reason, I never gave up when it came to editing. Watermark problem? I would try to find a way to solve that. Copyrighted music? That too. Even if there were endless problems, I would still keep going. And even if I never posted the videos, I would just do it for fun. Research for fun. And this continued 6 years later (with breaks in-between lol my lazy self), till now.

And now, I have the same strength as I once did 6 years ago (not to mention 6 years of experience. wink). I want to start a brand new channel, featuring me. I want to do all sorts of things, random videos, challenges, vlogs, and etc with my friends or by myself. 

I’ve always dreamt of people knowing me. It’s not because of fame, but it’s simple just because I’m an average person like any other person. I want to be a role model for the younger generation. I want to be a voice for the ones that are too unwilling to speak up. I want to be a figure in people’s lives where they can watch me and have their moods lifted up after a really bad/long day.

I sound super dramatic, but at the same time, I doubt myself. What if I’m not pretty enough to show up on camera? What if all I get are hate comments? What if nobody likes my content at all? What if everybody thinks I’m stupid for being on YouTube? What if my classmates watch me and make fun of me behind my back? Would anyone support me in taking my time and effort and dedication into this? Would people just tease me and tell me to just focus on school because what I’m doing is, “useless?”

I wasnt sure if i wanted to sell it, but one night when i was bored i figured id give it a shot and i posted it, its case, 4 packs of film, and a BUNCH of other accessories i have for it for a ridiculous price thinking ""if someone wants it for this much, they can have it"" I posted it around 3 days ago and so far have gotten about 7 likes on the post.

the only offer came from a girl who said she'd pay no more than 85 for just the camera, no flim (but there's already a pack loaded in, once its loaded it cant be removed)

Considering i paid 80 for the camera, should i just take her deal? i wasnt sure i wanted to sell the camera, still am not. I had hoped someone would maybe pay like 150 for all the stuff, and i could use that to get a different camera that costs that much. should i just wait it out and not jump on the first offer?

The reason i wanted to sell the camera btw was because the pictures it was taking turned out crappy 70&amp;#37; of the time, and when its almost a dollar a photo, that gets old fast. could be my fault idk, but the cheaper model my sister has takes better photos so im kinda thinking screw this camera, but i also feel attatched to it for some reason and wonder if im just doing it wrong.

127," I'm 28 F, divorced with no kids and run a consulting business online and live in Southern California

My Mom (58)  died of breast cancer in June, before that she was in charge of my grandmother's (89) care.

The original plan with my family was that if my mother passes, grandmother goes back to China (My grandmother came to the USA 18 years ago to help raise me because my single Mom had to work)

I had lots of issues with my Mom who decided to send me back to China because my father never chipped in financially and she did send me back to China for 5 years, and continuously in arguments talks about how worthless I am and how I should be back in China etc, needless to say our relationship was strained. 

However my mother did take care of my grandmother when gma suffered through depression and dementia and while I was helping a little bit, eventually I left due to continuous fights because my mother and grandmother lived together, my mother owns the house so of course her roof her rules. 

My grandmother just went back to China to live with her husband (who she had issues with before) and her son is super busy and daughter in law is busy as well and now she will live on top of a 4 story building with difficulty going down, and I feel enormous guilt and shame for not fighting more to keep my grandmother in the USA. 

I feel like a failure of a granddaughter, someone who she gave up a lot of her life to raise but when she needed help I was not able to do so. 

My grandmother is not able to walk far, she does need help cooking and wears a diaper. 

I felt like I was fighting my mom so much I forgot to really think about what I could and could not do, I just took it for granted she would just go back to China while I was busy going through my Mom's stuff, and taking care of house stuff. 

I asked my grandmother what she will most miss in the USA and she said ""your mother"", which I completely understand but just feels like I am now the person leaving her behind. 

I had initially said that if she is willing to go to a nursing home near me I can keep her with me closer and visit, but she disagreed and culturally it is very different, or go back to China. 

I feel sad that my business is not as successful as I want it to be and I feel like a terrible person for not being able to take care of the one person who did help me for almost all of my life. I have been crying so much these days much more than when my Mom passed. 

Should I be finding ways to bring my grandmother back and rent out a new place and getting caregivers in the USA? ",14Jul2018,1

131,"I don't really know how to get out what I'm trying to say but I'll try my best with the words and what not. It's not anything *too* serious nevertheless, it's causing me a lot of conflicting emotions and is stressing me out A LOT. You might think that it's stupid what I'm even asking what I'm asking when we get there. But first, let me get started with a bit of background information.



I've been playing games online with this group of people I've known for a little over a year. Our group started out fairly big, which I liked. It meant that there was always someone on you knew you could play with. Over time, our group got smaller and there were a staple few that stuck around that played almost daily.  At first I didn't really mind playing with everyone and I got along fine but I don't know, these last few months I've realised I sort of dislike these people.



I feel bad because I know people are complex and everyone deals with their own shit but every single one of them has a toxic outlook on life and it's wearing me down anymore. Here lately, I just dread getting a party invite or a message from any of them. I feel like I grew out of them maybe and I feel selfish for that. Or maybe I'm just now realising how spiteful and hateful they all are. The only things any of us have in common really are the games. I've been appearing offline a lot recently and this bothers them. I just want to play games and relax when I get home.



They tell me about EXTREMELY personal things that I don't really want to know about nor ever asked about. I just feel obligated to talk and play with them. They talk about meeting up in real life and I don't want any of that. I never wanted to become IRL friends with these people. I wanted somebody to play games with and just games.



Now I feel trapped and I'm not quite sure if I did it to myself. I've been so inconsistent lately that I feel like they think I'm a shitty person and I never intended that. I don't want them to hate me and I don't want to hurt any of their feelings. I feel like somehow I signed up for more than I asked without realizing. It's just games but I feel like I'm suffocating. I just want to fade out of the picture. I think It's because I've know them for so long that I feel this deeply towards the entire situation even though the setting of it is kind of inane.



I wanted to ask, have any of you ever had this happen with a group of friends you've had? How did you handle it? Am I a bad person? Am I worrying too much? I've thought about changing my gamertag and blocking all of them but I'm not entirely sure if that's the right way to go about this. Should I just stay offline and ignore them all? Is that childish? I've also thought about just making another account and gamesharing with that. I'm too scared to directly tell them how I feel. I mean, I'm pretty much telling them I don't like them if I do that and I don't want them to feel like it's all them when it's mainly me. I just feel too different and it's hard for me to be around so much negativity all of the time. They all just talk *at* me and not *to* me. I don't feel like I'm getting back what I give them. Like, I'm not appreciated. And I have this thing where I feel like I shouldn't get back what I put in. You know, that word ""insecure."" Yeah that. I think what I'm looking for is advice on what I should do and if my feelings are justified.



That may be a lot to unload and tell more about me than I'd like but it's how I've been feeling lately. I get stressed out easily and overthink a lot.  I'm especially bad at socializing. I've been working on it and have made strides in getting better. I never want to alienate anybody because I know how that feels. I just don't know how to remove myself from this group of people.



Recently I've been playing with randoms without using my headset and I like it so much. I don't want to talk to anybody. I just want to play games. I think I got in over my head with people. I can only take so much before I'm emotionally overdrawn.",14Jul2018,1

134,"3 months back everything was fine I guess. Pretty typical. I would go to my classes and during lunch and sit with my friend group. We would all chat and laugh and everything was fun and games. We call each other best friends and so on. We had sleepovers sometimes, etc. I thought of them as my friends until...

I got sick. I got really sick to the point where I wasn’t enrolled in school anymore because my health was at risk. They supported me for the first 2 weeks but slowly started texting me less and less. I wasn’t allowed visitors or to go out and I suppose it’s partly my fault but they still could’ve texted or called me. 

I thought this was just because they were busy with school and exams were coming up, but as the weeks progressed towards exams, I would only have a simple “hey” or “how are you doing” maybe once a week. 

School ends and summer begins. Still absolutely no conversations. It’s been a month since exams and I’ve only received one message of “yo hru.” - to which I replied and it turned into a super dry conversation.

I don’t mean to sound selfish or anything but I feel as though they don’t care about what I’m actively going through. If I was really their friend, they’d at least message me once a day, wouldn’t they?? Just to check in? I understand I can engage the conversation to but what’s the point if it’s going to be dry. I didn’t do anything either to get on their bad side.

Mike was kind of just there, it was a “oh look we’re at the same party” kind of thing “hi and bye” I noticed Jill before at a few parties and they started dating for a very short while — I never really held a convo with him for more than 10 min

They broke up and Mike got into a very serious relationship shortly after with a new girl — I went through a rough break up as well around the same time

Me and Jill met through mutual friends and she started texting me, we hung out, had a short fling — it didn’t last, I was too upset deep down for her demands of an actual relationship as I couldn’t take her as serious as my last gf. 

Mike and I started ending up at the same gym at the same time and the conversations got longer. We started asking if one another is going to the gym, meeting up there doing the same routine. We even went to my brother’s  (knows my bro because my bro is a dj, which is how me and Mike met 6 years back) birthday party together (so we don’t look like losers walking in alone lol)

 So it is a new friendship, and I would have his back in a fight, but it isn’t a bff kinda thing.. 

anyway, jill texts me, we go out, have a blast and we make out, and i’m willing to give it a chance but still want nothing serious out of it.

She’s also made me feel like she’s into me as well. She like touches me and kinda acts flirty sometimes which is weird cause she has a boyfriend. I’m probably not going to act on it or say anything I’d rather just leave things how they are.  But I mean if something happens it happens I guess I’d just like to hear strangers opinions and stuff.

153,"This has been bugging me for about a year now and I felt this is the place it should go. I’ve had a guy best friend for 5 years now. Everyone always tells us we’re like the same person and we always agreed because we have a lot in common and act similarly. Recently though, about last year, he made some new friends that weren’t from our crowd. They’re heavy alcohol and drug users, shrooms, lsd, xanax etc. He hangs out with them all of the time, and less with me. He’s addicted aswell, and doesn’t want to admit he has a problem. He has skipped plans with me a few times so he could get high with them and post it on social media. I know that makes him sound like a jerk but I swear he isn’t. He’s the sweetest guy you could ever know. Well, he was. Genuine, honest, generous, not a mean bone in his body. It’s so hard to make a friend like that. But these friends of his, they changed him. They’re terrible, they don’t care about his wellbeing. They just see him as another person that’s fun to get high with. But he doesn’t see that. He thinks they’re true friends. Most of my friends smoke weed so when I try to complain about him doing drugs they don’t see an issue with it. I’ve tried talking to him about this and how he will ruin his life if he doesn’t stop and he just raised his voice at me. I tried talking about it with him again after that incident a month or so later and he promised he would stop but he lied. I’m not trying to be controlling and I’m aware it’s his life, his body etc. But I love and care about him so much. It breaks my heart seeing how much he’s changed. He’s not the same person I became best friends with. I don’t want him to end up on the streets one day begging for spare money just for some drugs or alcohol, or even worse, overdosing. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve done all I could to try and convince him to stop. But I can’t just stop caring. I know it sounds so stupid but I seriously cry whenever I think about him doing drugs, or seeing videos of it on social media. One of my friends suggested I threaten to stop being his friend if he doesn’t stop but in all honesty I feel like at this point he’d choose the drugs over me. Cutting him off is not an option for me. He’s too valuable. I just want to help him but I don’t know how anymore. Do any of you have advice?

155,"Hello Reddit! So, I'm looking for a little bit of career advice tonight, not really someone to pave the way but just to show me a path I perhaps haven't thought about. Here's the deal. 

I currently work at a steady job that pays about 11/hr (and goes up a little more than that the longer I'm there) the job is  full time guaranteed with some benefits such as medical/vacation/etc. So this comes out to about 330ish a month. It's a call center type place but no customer service, sales, or technical support. It's honestly pretty cool but not something I want to do for the rest of my life. 

I have been considering a trade school of some sorts simply to start making a little more/perhaps do something a little more interesting. My city is big on medical but I'm not sure if medical is the right path for me.  HVAC tech sounded like maybe something but that's just after a moment of looking. Otherwise, I'm just not sure. I honestly don't really know what to get into. I enjoy working with computers, writing/reading type things, etc. I'm not really the greatest at complicated math things but could probably relearn some simple stuff. 

I guess I'm looking for something to get into that will earn some money but also might open the door to further study if I ever chose that path. If I'm being honest being a lawyer or some type of law career sounded like a cool thing, but I don't want to jump into something like that without any kind of net. 

If I fall (at least as far as finance goes) I fall on my own. I don't have any kind of support net as far as money goes. I have about 700ish in the bank and that's going to drain with some charity I'm doing, a mini trip, and just general life stuff. I also want to get my own place as soon as possible.  I have about a 900 loan debt and less than 100 on a single credit card. My credit score was about 7 ish last time I checked. Any ideas/advice as far as what I should look into or avoid? ",14Jul2018,1

Everyone I know is concerned for her. She reaches out for help and then gets mad when no one can fulfill her needs. She is so desperate for attention and approval that shes literally depressed from it. It’s fucking annoying now. Best of all she made a follow up post a screenshot of Instagram notifying she was reported with the caption demanding who reported her. Whoops.
I’m done with her. But I’m wondering how stuff with those captions are allowed in instagrams guidelines, I must be crazy if suicidal captions like that are completely fine. It’s not a plan or anything, but it’s completely disturbing to her followers because everyone is getting concerned for her.

160,"I take responsibility for the dumb charges I got myself into recently, which would be two felonies. I shouldn't have court for at least a few months from now, at LEAST. 

But when I do, I'll have to do some time, followed by felony probation for a while which I believe restricts your travel abilities. So what I am debating is this...

My girlfriend just got to belgium yesterday to spend some time there before tomorrowland starts. She will be there for 2 more months after the festival ends. I have the funds to buy a plane ticket from my state to Belgium, and back to my state in time for any various upcoming appointments. In the past I've never been able to hold onto money and actually spend it on something worth while, so this being the first time that things are actually changing for the better, I am still burdened with consequences by some actions I made.

I'm so worried about all that I'll be required to do after court and such, especially the jail time. It would make my entire year, maybe even decade lol, if I got to do something I've always wanted to such as travel abroad before all these consequences start... and especially be able to share that experience with someone I care about. 

My employer isn't an issue. And no other real required things I need to do before the time I would want to be back in the U.S.

161,"Hi, I hope atleast some of you could read this post becuase it might be a bit long but here I go...

I don’t know what I feel about my parents/family. I don’t know whether my mind is just messed up or not. 

Around 2009, I got a disease called Narcolepsy. It basically makes me sleep during the day and makes my muscles weak when I experience certain emotions, mostly excitement or similar. When I got diagnosed, my life got a little restricted and harder. I couldn’t enjoy taking bus with my friends, I had to take retalin which had this weird side effect of making me depressed for a little period. Later on, we found out I had a food intolerance and I couldn’t eat sugar or gluten. This meant I couldn’t enjoy cake with my friends or anything delicious. My head fell on the laptop while playing Mincraft so my dad didn’t allow me to play games which flashed, because he thought that it triggered my cataplexy (but that wasn’t the case). I get that this was important, but it was later when disagreements/conflicts came between me and my dad. What messes up my mind now isn’t this alone

My dad had other rules which were not necessarily bad. Other kids probably had such rules to. These are rules like it’s a school day and therefore you cannot play video games ( or go to the cinema etc. apparently) I think these rules were important for some time because I needed to do homework, but later I didn’t feel like I needed it, atleast for the cinema part. One day, my friends had plans to go to the cinema, and I asked my dad if I could to. I said I didn’t have any homework to do, but he says no. FYI, we had some disagreements and conflicts before this and I disagreed with my dad many times. I just found my dad’s logic or arguments bad. Why can’t I go the cinema? I don’t have homework. «Because it’s a school day». My mind goes «what does this even mean?», «how is this an arguement?». If I don’t have homework or anything to do, why can’t I go to the cinema? I need a reasonable arguement. 

Eventualy we began shouting at each other and maybe a little violence. Then, it calms down a bit and family goes to sleep except me. I’m sad. In my mind, I keep thinking about how my life has barley been any good because of all these restrictions. I repeat these thoughts many times. I’m in the varanda and crying. I want to be left alone so I make sure no one comes in. My dad comes and stands in front of the varanda door. He tells me I need to sleep. Why the f*** do you care? Am I disturbing you? Let me finish crying in peace. He then days he will call the police. I’m thinking why? What’s the problem here? What’s the police gonna do? Can’t I just finish crying in peace?

What happened that day I still remember cause I can’t believe or understand why he would call the police, what did I do wrong?

The next memorable conflict was more violeng. I don’t remember how it started, but we began hitting, but mostly pushing each other. I then wanted to stop, but it continued. We were in the bathroom and he did something that eventually made me bleed in my mouth. I think he brushed my teeth for me, while I refused, but ai have no idea how it got to that point. I just remember the violence and that I was willing to stop

After many disagreement and some conflicts, the anger and thinking builds up. Although we had fewer conflicts and disagreements ended peacefully, it’s only because I didn’t bother. It just damages menand not him. Not so long ago, we had a rough discussion. I have never shout  so much before. This is what I mean with the anger building up. My dad didn’t allow me be outside after 10 o’clock (pm). Previuosly, we had discussed but just disgreed on this topic. I’m 16 btw, and he doesn’t think this is normal. He just brings up arguements like it’s night, everyone is sleeping. This is just untrue. Many of my friends are literally out at this time. But I didn’t shout becuase of that. I became pissed of saying that he doesn’t to anything good and just keeps making boundaries and restrictions in my life. He thinks what he has done is right and has no consequences.

I could have written more, but it would have been to much for a post. What should I do? Am I thinking wrong?

162,"So I should preface this by stating that my sister and her boyfriend have had a troubled relationship for awhile now (they’ve been dating for 3 years). There’s been cheating on both sides and there’s been some major fights, but they‘ve both said they still love each other and want to stick it out. They’re both just very immature people, though, so I’ve never had much faith in them sticking together.
This week, however, my sister is in Las Vegas partying with a bunch of her female friends. I’ve hung out with her boyfriend a couple times before, as we both like playing video games and watching Marvel movies (both of which my sister doesn’t like) so I figured it’d be the same. I’d never let anything happen between us, and I don’t even feel romantically or sexually attracted to him. But then later (5 am) he FaceTimed me super drunk and confessed he has major feelings for me. I told him I’m not attracted to him and apologized because life sucks, you know, tried to placate him and everything. He was respectful about it and acknowledged that it was wrong (this is compounded by the fact that I’m 18 and he’s like 27 😐 my sister is 23), and I respect his honesty but now I feel like I should tell my sister because I would hate for someone to keep something like this a secret from me. He begged me not to tell her because they’re going through a major rough patch (and I wouldn’t tell her until she’s back from her vacation anyway because I don’t want to ruin her week). I told him I had to decide and couldn’t promise anything.  I feel like he’s probably just latched onto me because he’s feeling emotionally vulnerable because their relationship has been so sour lately, so I feel like if I don’t mention it and they see a counselor (as I’ve suggested) it might blow over. Plus I don’t want to create a situation and make my sister miserable. But I’m also a very honest person, and I don’t know - I personally would rather be informed than ignorantly happy, and I don’t see how a relationship like this is sustainable (though I do think my sister has shared a good portion of the blame throughout the years). 
Do I tell her what happened? Or do I just wait and see how it plays out (I won’t be hanging out with him anymore)? ",14Jul2018,1

I was so upset but kept plodding along, I saw the recruits taken on and 9/10 were the same gender / ethnicity as me. 

I got an email the other day saying ‘we are recruiting again later in the year but because you passed all stages we only expect you to turn up for the one test and then interview’ but my friend currently in the job says they’re really looking to get women in the job this time.

166,"(I promise I'm not trying to be edgy or a troll, I really need help with this and hope to lead a better life) 

I've been this way for a long while, and it's so draining. My friends describe me as paranoid because of things like avoiding crowds and not being too close to people because they have AIDS and will poke me with a used needle, or ""conspiracy theories"" like chemtrails and issues regarding the Clinton Foundation. 

I don't share that information to hurt them, I want them to be safe and know what's happening around them, and they call me paranoid and treat me like I'm brain damaged, I see solid proof of myself being wrong but it's so hard to fight the constant thoughts of ""you can't trust this, this is made to fool you into thinking youre wrong"" ""they're hiding something"" ""they're going to get you""

What tipped it for me was during the Parkland shooting, I didn't go to school for weeks in fear of another shooting. I got in trouble, but I felt more sorry for them. My friends and some family go to the same school, people with their own families and friends go, but they don't believe it will happen, and they discredit me. I confronted my friend (we'll call them C) C, asking her to not go to school, I told all of my family, even staff. C asked me ""what is wrong with you?""

I hung up the phone and cried, I knew that they could die soon, and they didn't believe it. 

Obviously and thankfully it didn't happen, the school year ends, people go about their summers, and I haven't left my family's apartment. 

I'm split between paranoid and knowing I need help.

-when selling the houses I was always an after-thought, sleeping on the floor alone in an unfurnished house, had to live with my cousins and moved in with people from the hospital because I felt like a burden
-Treats everyone around him as lesser
-my brother and I had a long day and decided to sleep early, well your drunk husband decided we were having a barbecue and woke us up and forced us to watch him eat, what a night that was!
-Called my brother WHILE HE WAS AT REHAB FOR ALCOHOLISM whilst extremely drunk
-wore that dumb fucking Albert Winestein shirt the day my brother got back from rehab
-numerous occasions while drunk abused the two most important girls in the world
-uses his physical stature to intimidate you and my sister
-multiple drunk driving incidents
-makes me afraid to leave the house at night because I'm scared I'll come home to another story about what he has done 
-You work 40 hour weeks to support the family and his alcohol addiction, when you come home you have to cook dinner and look after him. All this time focused on him and you never have time for us

-he cant even apologize for ANY of the items on this list

I’m currently on 0 hours and work 2 days a week if I’m lucky, but on average I get about £50 a week since I usually work one day (not been very busy lately in our restaurant.)

I understand that I have to pay for my own phone, which is completely reasonable as well as my own clothes, contacts and other personal products- but I think the rent and food part is just a little much? I mean, I’m still a kid! I’m still in school full time and have my own rats that I have to care for (I buy weekly fresh food for them, monthly medicines and new toys every now and then.)

A week ago I had to get my toenail removed after my younger brother accidentally tripped me over and my toenail ripped in half, the surgery to get it removed cost me £125+ had to get bandages, antiseptics and all that jazz, which my parents refused to help me pay for so I had to take it out of my savings account I have set up for my rats if anything was to happen to them.

177,"My friend is in a bit of a financial struggle. She currently works for herself doing uber and deliveries when she has time. She has depressive episodes so I get that but there are times where she not even trying she's just being lazy. 

The most recent problem is she hadn't been making her car payments and now owes a couple thousand dollars or her car would be repossessed. She borrowed 1.5k from another friend and $600 from her mother so she had 2 weeks to make another $600. I don't drive uber so I don't really know how much you can make but if you really work at it I know you could make $600 in a week not to mention 2. Her problem is that if there's a party or something fun she will go regardless of her financial state. Now her payment is due so she's borrowed $100 from me because she hasn't gotten her ass in gear and she got the rent from the people living at her place early to pay for it. 

I'm just annoyed that I I've paid her to help her keep her car. I help her out because she's a friend and I love her but then I hear that she's bought weed and is doing her food deliveries while high. Um what? Excuse me? You get the money for your car situation sorted out FIRST! You don't just go and blow a bunch of money on drugs. 

I do understand that people with addictions will do this and there's no talking to her about it but it's grating on my nerves. Now that I have helped her out a few times (I honestly think this is the absolute last time) it's hard to come up with reasons why I can't help her. She's living beyond her means buying tickets to concerts when she's not paying off her car 🤦🏻‍♀️. 

I'll be happy when she gets her 9-5 that she is starting soon and hopefully pays me back so I'm less on edge about the whole thing. Unfortunately it's call centre and she angers easily so I really don't think she will be there long.  

I guess what I am asking is what should I do? A part of me wants to just wait and see if she pays me back before cutting off that friendship. Part of me wants to just stop lending her money 🤦🏻‍♀️ I'm too nice I get taken advantage of.

178,"For the past couple months now, I've been finding it almost impossible to relax. I feel like I haven't deserved it, and that my life is just coasting by.  I'm a University student and I'm currently on summer break and haven't been able to go back to my old summer job because I'm focusing on work experience, personal projects for my CV, and spending time with my friends that I haven't seen all year. 

When I have a day of where I can just spend time to play a video game or watch movies or something, I just can't do it. I stress myself out feeling like I have better things to do, and just occupy myself with other meaningless tasks that I tell myself are productive (tidying, showering or eating when I already have done those tasks/they don't need to be done.) Then before I know it and the day is over and not only have I not achieved anything, I'm still incredibly stressed out because I haven't relaxed with anything. This makes me feel like everything is just flying by me.

On top of this, I can't shake the feeling that all of my friends are aware of this and are looking down on me (Even though I know they all love and care about me.) I can't help but feeling like they are talking about how I'm just wasting my life. Most of my friends are doing much more academic courses (I'm doing an arts degree lol) and are going to be much more employable than I am.

What confuses me the most is that on paper, everything is going really well in my life. I've got a brilliant, supportive girlfriend, great friends, I'm taking important steps to find a career, I'm at the most psychically fit I've ever been, I've got a healthy diet - I just don't get it. There's no obvious cause in my life for things being wrong.

What's wrong with me? Do I have some kind of condition?",14Jul2018,3

180,"Recently I had an argument with my mom since she always forbids me to hang out late with my friends. Sometimes she doesn't allow me to sleep over at my friend's house and lot more. It's not that she entirely prohibits me from hanging out but I do hate it that she always have something to say whenever I ask permission from her. 

Another thing is that I once mentioned it to her that it's my dream to get a tattoo someday and she's really against it. She even told my father about it which resulted into a bigger issue since both of them are really close minded.

I'm almost 21 and already working but I still feel like she treats me as if I'm still I'm a high school student! I love my parents but I feel like they can't handle my personality. I think I'm a free spirit and would love to venture onto different things but it really frustrates me that my parents seem not to support me on a lot of things. It makes me feel like I'm locked up.

181,"Hi there. I’m looking for unbiased outside point of view on this situation because I cant seem to convince this person or get them to see how fucked it is.

I want to know from both males and females, especially those in relationships, what they think of this and what he said to me, his girlfriend of 3 years. [https://imgur.com/a/8DhwU3A](https://imgur.com/a/8DhwU3A)

To be fair, here’s a rundown of the entire situation:
He suddenly got really sick. Could be mono or strep, they don’t know yet. He also just found out his mom got diabetes. I’ve been pretty supportive and caring since he’s gotten sick. Yesterday specifically he found out his mom had diabetes and was worried about his &amp; his families health. I wasnt being that sympathetic yesterday, but I didnt think I was being rude either. I told him that him and his family needs to change their eating habits for their health, and said that the meal we had at his neighbor’s was mostly red meat and mayo and his mom loved that, and that maybe thats why she got diabetes (did not mean it like that but can see how it comes across over text). I later on apologized for it when he called me out on it, and explained to him that I also felt like shit and I was doing stuff and he skipped past how I felt and thats why I hadnt been as sympathetic as I couldve been. I also explained that I said it out of concern &amp; care not insult, and that that’s what a doctor would say, many times. He sent me these texts even AFTER I apologized.

Thanks. If you guys want to see any follow up screenshots of our conversation (warning: its atrocious), lmk and I’ll make an update post. Please try to be unbiased and let me know what you think about what he said.

He has also raped one of the girls around his age and has tried to do the same with multiple others. All the women and some of the men have complained to the other community members and nothing has happened and it constantly continues. I know on one stand that he ""does not know what he is doing"" which is what most people say but at the same time he is beating up and raping people.........with all this information as well as proof through texts messages he has sent to a lot of people confirming what he is doing nothing is being done.

We just kinda decided to stop hanging with the 3rd guy because he's becoming someone we don't like. This means I now have the opportunity to hang out more 1 on 1, just the 2 of us. But whenever I suggest stuff, she seems kind of interested but only really as like a friend? I don't know if it's just because we're just texting and not talking in person but that's just the vibe I get.

She used to act so much more like she was into me or something, but at the time she had just gotten a boyfriend so I made the choice not to respond to these moves and just essentially act like I didn't notice. I don't even know if any of it was real. Like maybe she was just kidding about all of it, as friends could do right?

Obviously the only solution here is it ask her out or at least confess how I feel. 6 months ago I'd probably do that no problem, except she'd be in a relationship so I wouldn't. But now, she just doesn't seem as interested. It's mildly tearing me apart lol

Do I just say screw it and ask her out like right now, or should I try to hint at her that I like her? How do I hint that I like her without being obvious enough that she'll think I'm being weird or something in the case she doesn't like me?",14Jul2018,6
186,"We had never seen her that drunk before, we didn’t know she had been mixing her medications every single day and drinking at the same time either. Her boyfriend (a raging alcoholic) dropped her to my Mothers house around 11pm last night, completely sober, sobbing to me about how he can’t cope with her anymore. He had found her laying in their lane, half naked, covered in scratches and cuts from drunkenly rolling around with her dog in broad daylight. He brought her to bed and hid all of the drink in their house and proceeded to go out to work. When he returned she had left the house again, presumably to go to the pub or to find more drink, and then she started to roar and scream at him. As per usual, she then became our problem. I approached her quietly and calmly, asked if she’d been drinking and if she’d taken her medication today, and within seconds she went from 0-100. She roared and screamed at me, she got into my face, and eventually battered me until I gave up fighting back and protecting my face. I spent a lot of time on the ground being smacked, punched and I think kicked because today my ribs are sore, my forearms feel bruised and I have a concussion for sure. My Mother tried to defend me during her fit of rage and ended up being whacked herself. My sister stumbled and stomped out of the house down to my step-sisters house to cause even more havoc. From there she proceeded to claim I had battered her, and told the entire family that was the case, but they knew better as she was drunk texting and calling everybody within minutes of eachother.

Around 1am, she texts my Mother saying I’m sorry and I regret hitting you. My Mother didn’t respond too kindly and made it clear she was not welcome until she sorted herself out entirely. I received no apology, no text message or call, and came out of it with bruises and a concussion. This sibling constantly engages in shitty behaviour and expects us to fix it for her, while ignoring any advice given to her, and I am sick of it. How she spoke to me was one thing, but becoming physically violent was another. I have no intention of interacting with her again and I want to ensure she will never have the opportunity to make contact, but I’m afraid this will cause disrupt within the family circle.

191,"I have talked to many girls and have felt like I was in love all until this one person comes along. It all started during the process of graduating with all the normal routines like sending out cards, and going to parties. As it came time to start winding down the school year and getting closer to graduation of course all of our parents want to post everything under the sun on Facebook. In this case I am happy that one mother did just so. My own mother was tagged in a post by one of her friends, who I later realized was one of her bridesmaids at my mothers wedding obviously meaning they had been close, but the post went on to show a picture of my mom and her friend with two babies. Those two babies were me and this girl. Later on my mom explained who they were, where they're from, and so on and so forth and I understood not thinking of it again. It wasn't until we started to receive grad cards that I figured out who this person was. At first I didn't know who the picture of the person was, but yet again my mother explained how she was the other baby in that first picture and that is when I fell in love. Like I said before I have felt liked I have loved another person and have had crushes on another person, but this one particular girl has me speechless. I know there are much prettier girls out there, yet I have this feeling I have never had before and this is the first time I have felt like I could kind of explain it. Is this love at first sight? Is this the person I need to spend the rest of my life with? Am I even more lonely than what I think?

Although I knew this and respected it, to me it was always  difficult to stay friends with someone I really liked when they are dating ( maybe I'm being a dick but I would really love some advice on how to deal with that) and although I still texted her a lot, I didn't really hang out with her outside of school and after we graduated, I saw her even less (especially since she moved in with him). Eventually I did hang out with her and her bf and he was a pretty cool guy but something between us had changed. Maybe I was oblivious to it before but she became extremely judgmental of a lot of things about me. Fast forward a few months later, she needed a place to stay and she lived at my place for a while. Unfortunately, she continued to judge and berate me during this time as well. Eventually she moved out to go to univeraity.  I still considered her a close friend of not my best friend and would text her constantly, but one day she got angry at me and stopped talking to me completely. Two months past without a peeps from her and I'm cruahed that someone I'm so close to would shut me out and I text her where ahe eventually responds and we start talking again but something had changed. She was even more verbally abusive and she would constantly berate and belittle me when we played games over a group chat. Now, I can stand trash talking considering I do it to my friends as well but she only belittled me, she had only insulted and attacked me and she made it extremely personal. It got so bad that I believe I actually became afraid of her. I was afraid of having to hear someone I cared about continue to harass and insult me. Last year near December, I told her I was busy reading and relaxing since it was my final for my college course and ahe stopped talking to me again. I had a lot of time to think and I've come to realize how abusive and toxic she was and yet, I was highly attracted to her looks and personality and find this problematic. I don't understand how when I look think about my preferences in woman, I still think about her. It disturbs me that I don't despise her for how horrible she treated me. I'm exhausted from my friendship with her and although I want to make new friends or someday put myself out there but I'm afraid I might find someone like her again.

Professor DEFG, who is a mentor of this project, and I were actually talking about having this project as an individual project before these 3 came into the project. First, when I heard about these 3, I thought they will be much more knowledgable about what we are doing, and as highly excited and motivated as me. Thats why I told Prof DEFG that I can work with them. I was so wrong. 

Fast forward to the end of the project. I did 95% of the project. There were times where my father and mother would come to the lab and help me because I was working all by myself and had many troubles. These girls would not help me; they would even slow down the project and make me do things twice. If I tell them to do something for me, they would not do it unless I get involved... I swear if someone asked a single things about the project, they would not know shit. 

HERE IS MY I AM MAD: Although Prof. DEFG knows that I did the most work, he still kinda likes these 3 girls and talk to me like shit. Few times, he even said ""We can turn this into their Senior Project."" ARE YOU SERIOUS??? I spent so much of my own time on this project, thinking day and night and he is going to say that like I did 5% of the work? Then, I just did their ""SENIOR PROJECT"" for them for free. I have been busting my ass for 10 month now every day and Prof. DEFG is going to give me only this much credit? Here I am in a situation where either I just want to quit since it will not benefit me OR finish this project be the main guy and have these 3 girls under my control and I decide how much credit they get(it will be a hard conversation to have).

My boyfriend works from home but that doesn't mean he should be a child care service. He does it because his own parents and brother passed away and he feels guilt over it. His nephews are great, don't get me wrong. Nobody would have a problem with this if it weren't like every other day.

I pooped the question last week, and my fiancee asked if my parents would be there, she knows they can be racist, although they don’t express it unless they’re behind the scenes. I told her they weren’t going to be at the wedding. 

To make matters worse, they tend to be alcoholics for things like weddings, and my wedding isn’t going to have an open bar at all, I don’t want to be slapped with a bill for all the beers people buy. 

My younger sister is friendly with the fact that we’re getting married, and she enjoys my future wife’s company, and after I popped the question, I called her right away before making it public. The other family seemed to not care, there were a few that had that tone on the phone like “you really fucked up”. There were a few close cousins of mine who were also ecstatic at the fact that I’m going to get married. 

I’m in a bit of a quagmire with some in the family upset with who I’ve dated, and eventually married, so I would like it if they didn’t show up to the wedding. For those who supported me, they can go, but I need to find a way to extend an invite without others knowing. The main debacle will be with my sister, who still lives with my parents, and likely will next year when the wedding will be. 

I don’t want to send a formal wedding invite because I’m worried my parents will catch wind and show up at the wedding. Although hopefully they get turned away by the fact that the bar isn’t going to be an open bar, if they catch wind.

Yesterday I came down with the stomach flu and had texted my boss that I needed yesterday and possibly today off. He wanted a doctors note, so I gave him the doctor on call note that I used to speak with over the phone (to save on copays. It’s legit). 

He didn’t say much after that and then this morning I texted him asking if he wanted me to come in today, and he said: 

“No, I will let you know when to come back. I am making some needed changes at work and will call or text when I need you. Thanks”

I live in a state where employers can fire anyone for any reason, but I’m confused as to why he would say this. Is he firing me? I did send a legit doctors note, although it was very generic. I’m not lying about having the stomach flu, and it gets me down for a few days because I rarely get it. 

Any advice?

211,"[24 F]. I am having a few problems with my Dad, though I am pretty sure he is unaware of it he is constantly giving me unsolicited advice on how to act around my Mother. For the record they are divorced. One of my favorites is: “not to get in her way.” I am a psychological trauma survivor who has PTSD, even arguably complex, so this doesn’t make things any easier for me. 

On numerous occasions I have asked him to stop nicely, and that I don’t need it but it keeps being carried on which again, not good for my psyche. I have talked about this with my therapist who is a bit convinced he isn’t going to change — typically the “change” lasts a few months but it ends up going back to square one. 

When I am around him I constantly am worried about what he is going to say next, and his mental health. As ashamed as I am to say this, on an emotional standpoint it can feel like I am in a relationship with him sometimes. 

So my question is, what do I do?

Please keep in mind that I *really* do not want to kick him out of my life.

212,"I was in an abusive relationship with a classmate for 14 months. This past week, she asked if I was busy. Of course I answered no because I don't want to see her just so she can remind me of all the emotional, mental, and sexual abuse she put me through. So then she goes and starts to talk to my sisters, who are 14 and 12. She's 18 years old. I don't have a problem with her snapchatting them or talking to them, it's just with asking to come over is where I draw the line. There is no reason she should be asking to come hang out with them so she can come try to make me feel guilty for breaking up with her. I've also previously expressed I don't want to even see a picture of her. I want no association with her at all.

213,"I'm sitting on my couch crying.
Here's the story:

My family is a quiet cool one, you can drink with them and have a great time with them, so they are more like friends than family to me. 
I have 5 siblings too, but I don't have a good connection to them. 
My friends are nice, but very superficial and they can't hold any secret. 

So here is the problem: I don't have anyone to talk. When I come home I surely talk about my day and other stuff, but I don't have anyone to talk about my feelings, my inner needs... my dreams... 

I seem happy to everyone around me, rather too happy I'd say, but on the inside the urge to have a friend, a close friend makes me really sad. 
Recently I started separating from my friends, I still did go out with them, but my priority was always my mobile, because I didn't want to have conversations with those superficial bastards. 

Beside one friend. One girl I had no one. We both spent a lot of time together, whether after school or now while our summer job. I just felt good beside her, it was great to talk to her and I started to have a crush on her.
Once the rumors have started to go their rounds there was no way back. 
One day, a week ago she asked me if I'd love her. Completely nervous I answered ""no"" and she replied with ""you know, this with us wouldn't work anyway"". 
This little sentence was like a punch in my stomach. I was close to crying the whole day and I could hardly concentrate on my job. 
Out of my deperateness I decided to cut all contact with my friends and... Her... 
I don't know if it was the right decision, deleting all my apps my friends could communicate with me without saying anything, but they hurt me... Maybe they didn't know. Their insults, their fucking attitude I just don't want to have to deal with them anymore... 

 I just wanted once a friend who I can talk to when I have something on my mind. These little things are devouring my soul, everything I have....

So please, what should I do... Get back to them and act like nothing has happened... Get her to love me... should I get a new circle of friends, which I most certainly won't find...

After we left each other last week, we were absolutely heartbroken. I live with an abusive parent and while I was with my bf, everything was okay. I felt safe. This is something I never felt before.

He suggested I come to live with him until he finishes his degree and then we could come back to the states after he graduates and he'll get a working visa, or possibly a green card from marrying me. 

But, how would I even be able to live in England for about 15 months? My bf said I could get a working visa, but I don't have a degree. The only job I'd really be eligible for is those that don't require a college/uni degree. Would they even offer a working visa?

This is just a consideration. I am even wondering if this is feasible. I really want to just finish my degree back home but my family life is absolute hell and I just want to escape it and be with the one I love.

Our neighbors argue A LOT but last night they where a lot louder and it sounded violent with her screaming to him to call the police etc. Because I was worried for both of their safety as it sound so bad I called 999 for a domestic disturbance saying they usually argue but this sounds worse than normal. The police showed up after they had calmed down so I stepped out and said like they have quietened down and the police said that they had heard screaming as they had shown up so they and was not getting any response from knocking and because they kept hearing more screaming and loud arguing they gave it 5 more minutes and then kicked in the door. One of them was arrested and taken away,

My wife and I have been talking about moving to a new state for a while, possibly 2-3 years now. Recently, it's become more serious because the job market here in the South kinda stinks. I'm a systems administrator/tech support for an automotive part manufacturer and she's an RN. The biggest concern of mine has been raising my daughter and possibly a second child if it comes along in a place with a better education than what I had (Decatur, Alabama stunk). So with her being raised mostly up in Wisconsin, and Wisconsin being pretty damn good in education, it makes for a great compromise. The problem is breaking it to my family (her family is already up there). 

My parents have always been overprotective and kinda like helicopter parents. They're both in their mid 60s. They don't come up and visit but once every two to three months (which means they're not a great presence in my daughter's life) and my sister... well she hasn't been up here since we got married so she's not really a factor here. The problem with them coming up and seeing her more often comes along with an excuse...""We don't want to invite ourselves, we want you to invite us,"". 

Put simply, I'm trying to find a way to break it to them that we're moving 10h away.

The reason I don't just lay it all out on the table with them has been because I've been concerned about their well-being, but now it's more of a concern that my wife and I go for better paying jobs and set up our kid(s) with a better education.

He would go between my house his aunts house and I now learned his mistress too. I didn’t break up with him or threaten to kick him out when I found out he had an affair my entire pregnancy. I simply “brushed it under the rug”. 

Fast forward to now (4 months later)
He is still extremely verbally abusive and sometimes physically. He threw out my entire closet and shoes into our living room and told me I had to go. This entire apartment is furnished with my furniture including my mattress and sheets blankets he is sleeping comfortable with. I slept on the floor in my daughters room because I’m truly afraid of this person. I didn’t want things to get ugly so I let him do this to me.
I’m unsure if it’s even legal. Can he legally throw me out if I am on the lease and all of my belongings are in here?
I know I don’t plan to stay and live here but I also don’t think I should be the one to be “thrown out”. He pays a majority of the rent as of 6 months but before that everything was split right down the middle. Since he got a promotion and making more money he told me he would be ok playing a little more (after all he did live rent free with me for a year while cheating) he’s a real winner!
Any advice on what I can do is greatly extremely appreciated since I had a 3 year old daughter with him and he is using her as some leverage.

They treat me like dirt, my siblings. And I always, always forgive it. And force myself to forget. But lately I can't forget anymore. And I recently found some old journals and I realize I've documented many times they've hurt me. Reading these words reminds me that they have consistently done this to me.

But all families have dysfunctions. When is it unforgivable? I mean, it's never been anything huge, but it adds up. For example, they paid for my parents to go to the super bowl. Did not tell my husband and I and we were not asked to contribute to it. We only found out because they didn't tell my parents that detail, so my dad sent a thank you text. We don't have much money, but they should have told us regardless.

So obviously, that was February. And it's happened again recently. I'm so sick of it, but I have a great relationship with my parents, and if I cut out my siblings, I hurt my relationship with my neices and nephews, who I love.

I guess, I'm just wondering, is this typical? Something that I should just continue to get over? For the record, I do confront them. They say I twist words or misunderstand. But after all these years, I'd have to be pretty damn stupid to confuse these incidents for something they're not.

A few weeks after I graduated, however, I discovered that I could pursue a master's in Library Science, which is something I've always loved, but didn't think was an option. I applied to both programs and was accepted to both. Now it's time to choose, should I be a guidance counselor or a librarian? Both have pros and cons for my specific life situations.

Guidance counselor
Pros:
-My original plan
-Summers/weekends/holidays off
-Easy to find a job where I live
Cons:
-Not passionate about it
-No real opportunities for advancement/higher pay

Librarian
Pros:
-A job I would love
-Opportunities for promotions
Cons:
-Likely chance there won't be any jobs near me, forcing me to move
-Works summers, weekends, some holidays.

I know for most people moving wouldn't be a problem, but I have a very large, close-knit family that I wouldn't want to live too far from. There are libraries near me, but no guarantee there would be an opening after I graduated.

247,"So, my dad's been going out with his girlfriend for around 12 years and up until this point her daughter has always referred to them as ""my mum and (dad's name)"" and vice versa in my case. I go onto social media and she's put a post up of ""mum and dad"". It's made me pretty emotional but now I feel guilty for feeling down. I'm trying to see it from his point of view, I imagine if someone saw me as a parental figure i would be flattered but I also can't help but be petty and think he's my dad not hers. She's not had a good relationship with her own dad for years and they haven't spoken in over a decade whereas I am still in contact with my own mum so would never think of calling her mum my mum.

Basically do I have a right to be upset or am I being selfish and need to get over it? I don't feel comfortable approaching her about it and I feel childish speaking to my dad that I'm upset if he's happy about it. It's been over a decade, so why now? ",14Jul2018,2
248,"We’ve been dating for 2 years, he’s about 3 years older and we seriously plan to marry and have a family one day, I am one year away from completing my bachelors degree and currently intend to get a masters and a PhD. He previously had completed ~ 4 semesters at the same university I study at, but he took a break to work full-time at a university associated job. This job allows him to take 1 class per semester for free, which he has been doing but he is still so far from any degree. My masters will require us to move away, effectively stopping his education. And I mentioned to him that I didn’t really want to be the sole earner in the relationship but he didn’t seem hopeful about going back to school, does anyone have any advice for a situation like this? I love him, but sometimes I wish he had a little more drive when it comes to the future.

249,"I've made some bad decisions lately. 

I decided to take a summer class. My family is putting pressure on me to go into the healthcare field (dental hygiene or x-ray tech) but I have no real passion for either of those. But I do want to be responsible and get a real job, so going back to school seemed like the right choice. So I'm taking anatomy this summer for eight weeks. Then my friend invited me on vacation for a week, and I couldn't say no. Obviously, now I am behind in my course and I can't catch up. But traveling with her made me realize how unhappy I am being in school. I want to withdrawl from my class, but my dad paid for it and I know its going to be a huge fight with my family. Even if I pay him back. I only have $900 dollars to my name, and class was $600. I might want to go back in the fall, but I just feel like I am flaking in life super hard. I also have an interview for an internship the day I'm supposed to take my mid term, and I am more interested in the internship because it is in a field I like.

252,"I’m in New York for the weekend and I just sat down with two old friends (Phil and Lil) last night after not seeing one of them for about 3 years. Lil must have had a bad day or something because from the moment we met up she started ranting about income inequality and how sick it is and how Phil paying $2100 for an apartment in Chelsea is part of the problem. Then she moved on to talk about how this other girl we know sucks because she “pretends to know New York” (??) I was really astonished at how ignorant and unaware she was being. She also kept talking about how she has to get over this resentment she has towards people who have a lot of money. Mind you, none of us grew up impoverished so I’m not sure where this is coming from. Maybe she’s over romanticizing her NY hustle lifestyle and thinks hating people with money is part of the role. Anyway, I basically responded by attempting to show her gently how insanely ignorant and mean she was being and to a point it was working. We eventually moved to a different subject but Phil was having none of it and was fuming. He hadn’t said anything for about 30 min and when Lil went to the bathroom he exploded. He got red in the face and looked at me and said “This is ridiculous. My time is worth more than this. I don’t have to listen to this ignorant shit. Gemologyst, you’re worth my time. You’re renting my time.” He said it a little differently than that but essentially reduced our decade-long friendship to a cost analysis that can be written off in terms of time=money. I get what he was a but holy shit dude what has New York done to my friends?


I feel like I’m taking it personally. I was really excited to see them and they kind of ruined it. They went outside to hash out their problems and left me sitting alone at the bar so I just left. 

Is it worth me telling them I’m upset or should I keep it to myself and get over my internalization of this problem? I feel like maybe I’m being selfish by thinking about their argument in terms of how it effected me instead of seeing it as just bad timing. I tried to ignore it and hoped the conversation would move past it because I wanted to enjoy their company but Phil could not let it go. They both live here in NY so maybe they didn’t consider the occasion as precious as I did. 

I guess I just don’t know what to do from here. I’m considering ",14Jul2018,1
253,"Talking to my mom is very tiring. I don't want to say she's stupid, but when I talk to her I feel like talking to a retarded child - she has trouble understanding me in general, notices even less social cues than I do (which is fascinating), has no opinion of her own. I am gay and the only reason I won't come out is that the process of explaining to her what it means and that no, I won't get a girlfriend and no, I won't get a girlfriend and also no, I won't get a girlfriend will be horrible. Often behaves like a child, for example doesn't respect my privacy until I literally scream at her which I feel terribly bad for.

We talk regularly about non-personal stuff mostly. What are some subtle ways to find out if she and her boyfriend are still together?",14Jul2018,1
257,"There is a lot of history here. Basically, I worked with this girl (we will call her Julie) at a restaurant for about a year and a half. During that time I realized she was dating one of my friends and we would hangout sometimes. Julie and I were on good terms and decent friends. We hung out outside of work just us maybe twice, we got along, but I wouldn’t say we were “best friends” or anything, mostly just coworkers who got along. 

Eventually I quit and I didn’t hear from Julie for quite a while but I still hung out with that group a lot, I just didn’t see her very often. I’ve been friends with that group since I was about 13 years old, so I knew them way before I knew her. Eventually Julie and my now current boyfriend “Sam” broke up. I maintained a friendship with Sam throughout the years and while me and Julie were on speaking terms, we had lost touch nearly a year or two before the breakup. 

Eventually me and “Sam” started dating and we’ve been going strong (just moved in together about a month ago!) but Julie has been quite bitter about it. Even though she started dating someone new shortly after the breakup with Sam. She ended up deleting me and unfollowing me on everything because it was hard to see me with him. I let her have her space but was bothered because Julie and Sam have remained friends and it felt like Julie wanted Sam in her life but wanted to ignore the fact that I am a big part of Sams life now too. 

Essentially, I ended up inviting Julie over to my New Years party because she doesn’t have a lot of friends and she wanted to hangout with people she knew. So she was texting Sam about it and I said he could invite her over, cause like I said, Julie and I used to enjoy each other’s company! She came and it was a good time. 

Essentially, Sam ended up getting Julie a job at his workplace. I was a little uncomfortable with it because of some things Julie has said in the past but since we had a good history I tried texting her about it to relieve some anxiety. I was really nice about it but just came to her with some concerns hoping she would be able to help bring me at ease. Well she was a total bitch to put it lightly. 

And since then she has texted Sam in the middle of the night multiple times! He texted her back and said that it’s inappropriate of her and she can’t be texting him in the middle of the night to ask for rides or talk about her feelings and she texted back saying she’s sorry and she overstepped. Only to say disrespectful things about me to Sam when they were working. So she only gave a polite text back because she knew I’d probably end up reading it but when it was just her and Sam she felt it was appropriate to complain about me to him. 

Sam isn’t very happy with her working there, he was trying to be nice and help her out but he doesn’t like that it’s caused problems with our relationship and the fact that Julie seems to either be denser than a brick or is purposely trying to do things to piss me off. But it’s not like he can fire her or anything. So how do I deal with this? 

A part of me wants to text her and tell her to screw off but I don’t want to make it awkward for my boyfriend since he does work with her. But I feel incredibly disrespected and unhappy with her. She treats us like we are on borrowed time and like we aren’t serious when we’ve been dating for quite some time now and we LIVE TOGETHER! If she’s trying to get him back it’s not happening. 


TL;DR - My boyfriend got us ex “Julie” a job at his workplace to help her out. Julie and I used to work together as well and we were friends. Since Julie has gotten the job she has been really disrespectful to me sending me mean messages, texting my boyfriend in the middle of the night, and complaining about me to my boyfriend. I’m not sure what her angle is since she’s dating someone else but it feels like she’s trying to sabotage us or just make me angry. I don’t know how to deal with it. ",14Jul2018,1

Currently I don't work - not a choice, I don't see this changing any time soon.  


I'm 35, female, and Autistic - I'm very much 'passing' but I've no idea how to make connections with people, no one seems interested in getting to know me (told I'm intimidating, also I feel as if I'm boring AF) and I'm not sure I know how to approach others. I feel a lot better in myself when spending time with others, but I struggle to find ways to be social.  


Gym - you go and work out, not really an opportunity to make friends and doubt I'd gel with muscle-men.  


Volunteering - I've had a few voluntary jobs lately, but not much opportunity to make friends as you're there to work.  
Meetup - I can't go often due to finances, but found one meetup (there are only 2-3 locally) that was perfect for me in terms of interests and age-range, but the core members are all good fiends and I've struggled to connect with them at all. I dated one member, it was great as we spent all our time together, but he turned out to be  bit of a narcissist and cut me out of his life when I called-out his abusive behavior, this makes going to meetups really awkward now (even if he's not there: as he's friends with the others while I'm not, and as it's possible he's lied about me to some members).   


I try not to sit in the house doing nothing, I hate that, but options seem so limited...walking to the store, walking around the same local parks on my own, going for coffee on my own, I'll maybe try to find activities to do but there's not much locally and I don't have much cash...also, at the end of the day, not much fun doing anything on your own.

263,"SO this is a follow up to a post I made later last year, and it’s going to be a long one. I’ll break things down through how they progressed over the last year, and then do a tl;dr because I don’t know what to do.

May of 2017:

My best friend of 10 years asks me to be his best man while we were driving to the gym one day. I nearly cried I was so happy, and obviously said yes. I didn’t have the greatest income, had a car problem come up that cost me $2600. After this he told me it was going to be a destination wedding (which in my naivety I expected everything to be heavily discounted because so many people would be going, I honest to god was thinking to when I went to Cuba and it was 600 bucks, so I thought it would be around that price per person, boy was I wrong) and I said okay cool. I then learned how expensive they came to be, and one of the other groomsmen told me it was going to be around $1700 per person. For me who now had $300 in my bank account, and my student girlfriend to go (who I wouldn’t feel fair asking her to pay her own way to my friends wedding)  it would’ve costed over $3000, pre-tax, pre-suit, pre-gift and pre-bachelor party. I started freaking out, knowing I did not have this money. I decided to sit down with him and ask about the cost, he said the $1700 was around what it would cost, and I broke down explaining to him that I couldn’t afford the trip. He told me financing it was an option, to which I told him I’m sorry but I’m not paying interest to come to your wedding which I can’t afford to go to.

November/December 2017: So since May and our big talk, best friend is obviously disappointed, but tells me he understands that I can’t afford the trip. Between then and November, I also get a job that starts paying a decent bit more money. Also during this time, my best friend getting married has slowed down talking to me significantly. Where pre-May we used to work out once or twice a week, and texting and talking all the time, we now maybe workout together once every 2-3 weeks and that’s it. I get an invite from My cousin’s best man to come to his bachelor party in Vegas. Total cost all in splitting the grooms part is $1000. It was very reasonable, I had never been to Vegas, and I actually ended up coming back making the equivalent of what the trip cost me from gambling, so it didn’t really cost me anything to go. I was pretty nervous about going because I knew my bestfriend would potentially be upset, but he had already kinda distanced himself from me at this point, so I went. When I got back, I asked him to go to the gym. We went, but I could tell he was very distant. When we finished, I asked him if everything was alright, he said yeah all is good, so I asked to take him out for breakfast the next day. We went, I pressed him on the issue because he had been distant, was giving me a look like he was upset with me, But he wouldn’t tell me whatever was bothering him.

March 2018: We have pretty much stopped talking at this point. We didn’t go to the gym together at all, but would text every once in a while, but that was it. So at this point I’ve made a bit of money, and my girlfriend tells me she is flying to England to visit her sister, and asks if I would like to go. We take a look at what it would cost, and realize we can go to England, fly to Italy (I’m Italian) and take trains to all the major cities, which would all together cost around $12-1500 each. I was extremely hesitant and at first said no because I felt bad about not attending my friends wedding, but in talking with my girlfriend realized he hadn’t talked to me in weeks anyways, and figured what the hell. I’ve never been to Europe, and other than vegas hadn’t gone on a trip since I went to Cuba with my family when I was 13. So we go. Upon returning, I get a message from him the day after arriving. First asking how the trip was, and then immediately asking me how I could not tell him about the trip and stab him in the back in spending this money when I couldn’t spend money on his wedding. I’m not gonna lie I completely understand him being upset, but I broke everything down to him (the above timeline), and tried to not place blame on him stopping talking to me. I said I understood why he got distant, but when I told him I couldn’t afford it I legitimately could not afford it, and ever since he had pretty much stopped talking to me, found a new best man (which you would completely expect, I’m not upset), and it would be weird if after all that I just surprised everyone and was like hey sure I’ll come. After me explaining all this, he asked me to not come to the bachelor party (to which I pretty much fully planned for the best man, only slightly salty), and didn’t answer when I asked him if he was just talking about the bachelor party or if this was his way of ending our friendship.

Last few days: ex-best friend had gotten married a few weeks ago, so I wanted to give him some time but I sent him a message last week. I told him the wedding looked beautiful, I’m beyond happy for him, and that I was hoping we could get together. I was hoping for the chance to explain things in a bit more detail and that maybe we could look towards finding a way to mend some sort of a friendship out of this. I haven’t gotten a response, and I’m just looking for some advice because I’m at a complete loss. We were best friends for over 10 years. We worked several jobs together, have gone to the gym hundreds of times together and I want to find a way to mend this somehow, but I feel like I’ve done all I can. 

Can someone please help me with where to go from here?

TL;DR: best friend decided to have a destination wedding that would’ve easily cost me $4000 to go to, I had $300 in my account and could not afford to go. Friendship slowed down, I got a new job and started making decent money. Went to vegas for my cousins bachelor party, went to vegas when my best friend had pretty much stopped talking to me. When I got home he pretty much told me to fuck off, now I want to fix this friendship, don’t know how.",14Jul2018,1
265,"I feel really stupid for asking this but anyway...
(sorry for the long post) 

I've been with my boyfriend for over two years now. This year, we've been going through a rough patch. We broke up for several weeks and then he got back in touch, after we’d both been on dates with other people. I never questioned our relationship before but after seeing how other partners treat me I'm starting to think our relationship isn't healthy. Anyway, now whenever we have a minor argument, he really kicks off.  He says it’s over and he gives me the silent treatment for a week or so. He makes me feel stupid for then trying to contact him.

We don’t live together, so communication is more difficult especially as he won't pick up the phone when I call him. He constantly tells me I’m a toxic person and makes me feel like I’m the one who is the problem in our relationship. But he is never willing to resolve things - he just carries on the argument. 

He is quite controlling about my use of social media and gets angry when I follow people, for example. He is always blocking me and unblocking me when we have these phases of him ignoring me. He makes me feel like I'm always in the wrong - I’m not allowed to be upset with him, but he's allowed to be upset with me. 

He can get very defensive too. He says that I never take his side on things and that I should talk to him in private about issues instead of saying out loud at the time as it doesn't look good to be disagreeing with him — it shows that I am not showing respect.

He got into a bad mood when I told him I was going away for a weekend to see my cousin. He said that I should have either taken him with me so it was a weekend together or I could have spent the money more wisely. i.e. stay at home with him.

Is this abusive behavior? Whenever I’ve called him out on it, he just laughs at me and tells me I’m being ridiculous.

266,"**TL;DR: Can't stop hating myself, what can I do?**

I am about turn 22 and it will be a decade of self hatred. Which has included so many burnt bridges and ruined relationships, drinking, loneliness, job loss, self harm, suicide attempts and more. Things are better now than they used to be and I have an awesome job and love life. But still so much of my life is negatively affected by my self perception. Job, friends, romance, and more.

Basically I believe I am a bad person/selfish/uncaring and bad in every other way like ugly, stupid etc. There is no point even discussing these beliefs because I already know that sometimes it is contradictory and doesn't make sense but it doesn't matter because I will still believe it as it is almost a kind of defense mechanism where no one can hurt me more than I already hurt myself.

I have tried several therapists and they have been great but I never get anywhere because I believe deep down I don't actually want to improve. I just want to keep torturing myself. I know myself well enough and have strategies to get through my bad days and will always get by but fuck, the years keep going by and I still don't know what its like to have friends/romance or trust/openness with others.

I really feel so hopeless and have no clue how to improve. An understanding that I am complete evil shit inside is an idea that is ingrained into me and everything I do. My body language, my beliefs, hobbies everything. It's like this idea that I am not even human and that I am evil scum is so stuck deep down I have no idea how to shake it.

268,"Hey guys, bear with me, this is gonna be a lot, maybe some rambling, but I need help...

 I have been stuck in finding a job for about 5 months. I am 18, graduated highschool early in January. No plans nor parental funding to go to college. I like to travel, and currently I am in Thailand to be with my girlfriend. I've spent about half of all of the money I own, most on travelling, some on a Thai language school I will be attending in August.

 I have a decent amount of social anxiety so it is difficult for me to do something in person/in front of many people like teach English or meet with certain people. I'm an INFJ. I hate being in the spotlight. 

Aside from that,  I have skills and knowledge in: HTML, A little Python code language, native English speaker, I can do decent photography, Adobe Lightroom, beginner-intermediate knowledge in Adobe Photoshop (editing photos), piecing together desktop computers, I can Write essays/papers well, Religion, Esports, counseling/helping people with problems, typing 70+ wpm...

I have many passions and things I want to try and get good at, but am too afraid to try some things due to the lack of productivity, and income, and how difficult these could be. They include: Music, specifically low-fi/piano (lofi probably wouldn't make money because too unpopular, also don't know how to make it in a saturated market), appreciation of art, Photography, Travel, travel cinematography, app design, graphic design, cooking, Fight against human trafficking, coffee and coffee art, cameras, video games, entomology to an extent, religious studies, investing to an extent, Computers to an extent, exploring/discovering, astronomy, language learning and culture, social media, martial arts, helping others, and of course, getting money...

The list could probably go on, but those are the important-semi important ones I could think of. 

Anyways, any tips you guys could give me, any websites you could direct me to, jobs, etc. I am feeling so down and overwhelmed with finding a job that will make at least $15(could probably go as low as $10, but depends?) per day. If i need to do further studying and further my learning, please give me some insight on what I should be learning and how.

I have tried click bank, with no success so far but still learning, shutterstock, pond5, clashot, eyem, foap, etc. for my photos to get sold. Instagram with 1000 followers, for my photos with links to my photos on market. tried transcription but failed with many different sites. I haven't found much/been accepted on editorial jobs, like proofreading and grammar correction, which I could do.

269,"I’m a college freshman intern at a somewhat large corporate company and I just had my first major conflict with my boss last night. I’m a lab intern.

Let me just get a quick rundown of what I’m expected to do. I’m expected to run programs on a computer and watch it do scans for whatever we are testing. Usually these scans take anywhere from 20-30 mins so during our downtime we are free and allowed to browse the internet and encouraged to read a book.

Now, here’s the conflict. 

I’m finished with my section of work for the day and before I can move on to more work I have to have a senior intern overlook something on my computer. It was a particularly busy night as we were a bit understaffed in seniors and had a deadline due that night. Anyway, I was told to just wait until a senior could help me out. In the meantime, I go and browse the internet because I have already asked everyone if there was anything productive I could do as an intern and I was told to wait. 

Now my boss comes in and sees me browsing the internet and flips his shit because he assumes I’m doing jack shit and just wasting time browsing the internet. So I then calmly explain to him the situation and he gets even more upset and starts to point out stuff to disprove my reasoning to sit and wait even though I was told multiple times by other seniors to wait until I was able to be helped. He pointed out stuff like cleaning the desk, cleaning the floors, opening certain files to ensure I would be ready to go when I got my computer checked. In my head, this was just stuff unrelated to my work that I felt that he was using to put me down for having the audacity to say that “I have nothing to do right now other than to wait for help.” 

I soon start to get emotionally frustrated because after asking the senior interns if there was anything for me to, I started to feel like my boss was just out to get me. Multiple times he came in while I was browsing the internet on my downtime saying “Do you wanna go home? Huh? Is that what you want?” Making me feel threatened. 

In an emotional tone, I then to proceed say that I’m doing all I can and there isn’t much I can do until I get help and he just gets mad saying I should know what I’m doing when in reality, I’m just an intern who was taught specific tasks and processes and wasn’t taught specifically what he was asking for.

My neck muscles are extremely tight. It’s like a crick in my neck that never goes away. It’s driving me CRAZY. I take about 3 advils a day, it’s getting ridiculous. I don’t know what to do. The only thing that helped was getting a massage about 2 weeks ago, the pain went away for about 2 days and it was GREAT! But after 2 days the pain came rushing back and it’s just as bad as before. I can’t get a massage every week or I would go broke. I’ve tried fixing my posture, and doing stretches, but I feel like I’m just making it worse every time I stretch my neck. Should I go to the doctor? I’m afraid that they won’t be able to do anything to help me besides pain medication and I definitely don’t want to take opioids. Anyone have advice?",14Jul2018,1

I get nervous when I have to interact with strangers, being out in public, etc. I've always been really shy. I prefer to spend my time alone in the house. I don't go outside much. I've been doing this my whole life. My father hates it!

He's always given me a hard time for not going outside. My whole life and even to this day he tells me, ""Why don't you ever go outside? Go outside and play with the kids in the neighborhood. (He used to say this when I was little) You can't hide from the world. You never go outside, what's wrong with you?!?! Go out and get some fresh air. Go out and get some sun. If you don't start going outside, I'm going to start forcing you.""

Now I had a job before I got pregnant and continued working the first 3 months of my pregnancy. I didn't make much as I only had a part time job working at a retail store. I only worked maybe 15 hours a week or less. My boyfriend didn't make me pay anything like rent or bills, my money mostly went towards groceries and just extra stuff like if we wanted to go out somewhere or he needed some gas money. Me and him obviously started discussing what we wanted to do about childcare and if I should stop working at some point in my pregnancy, ect. My boyfriend is the one who told me to quit my job, he said, and I quote ""you don't pay for shit anyways so there's no point in you even working."" I was sort of hurt by that comment but I did as he told me and just quit my job. We ended up getting food stamps anyways to pay for the groceries that I had used my money for previously. We talked about me being a stay at home mom, I badly wanted to do that so I could be there for my son 24/7 and he agreed. He said I could stay home and care for our son, he told me to just relax the rest of my pregnancy and stay home and take care of our house and two dogs and then our son when he's born. I was more than happy to do this. But now he's been complaining that all I do is sit on my ass all day apparently and he told me he wanted me to go find a job and that he now wants me to work after our son is born Instead of being with him. He said I can work in the morning and he'll take care of the baby while I'm working then will switch places. Am I wrong to be upset about his sudden change in plans?

A little bit of background about me . I just turned 20 and I’ve never really cared about my looks/ health. I think part of it was being trapped in a very toxic family and possibly being depressed ? I never cared about myself and I honestly never imagined living this long. 
Recently I made the huge decision to stop talking to my dad and his side of the family. Growing up he use to tell me to kill myself, that no one cared about me &amp; basically crushed my self esteem. He helped me pay for some schooling even though I was working, because all of my paycheck was spent on visiting home ( 5 hours away) when something bad would happen and my sisters would call me crying. This easily costed $200 a week for months ( taking a train). My sisters are staying with my mom so I no longer feel the need to visit home to fix things, I know they are now relatively safe. 

I’m still away at school ( summer classes) and I’m looking for off campus housing. I have a job and I’m working 30 hrs a week and saving up money. I never buy myself new clothes, the last time I bought myself something was probably 3 years ago ? I haven’t had a haircut in years ( I know this seems weird , but like I said I didn’t care about looks , it was hard enough to make myself get out of bed). I haven’t had an eye appointment in years ( I wear contacts). I need to eat better and lose weight( currently trying &amp; walking a lot).And I haven’t been to the dentist since I was 10 ? I’ve never been in a relationship or anything either. I feel very childish. 
My point is that I feel closed up/ stunted like I haven’t made any effort for positive growth. I’m nervous to make changes, but I know that I need to start now. I know this is my fault, but I feel like a lot of my time was spent on survival and this is the first time I’ve had the opportunity to do something for myself and take care of me.

To make a VERY intricate story short, I desperately want a nose job and my mom will absolutely not allow it. She won't stand me confiding in her about my insecurity either. I'm on track to save up the money before I turn 18, but I'm two and a half years away from that date where I have full control. I'm terribly insecure, and all I can do is wait it out at this point and bottle it up. I've been doing this since I was 12, but my nose has gotten a lot worse since then.

I'm a fucking shithead, I honestly don't deserve anything I have. The issue is that, I've been having major problems paying my rent recently. I've been taking care of my sick aunt who then ended up passing away in April. So, today my landlord caught up to me. I was planning to just pay when I get more money in my new job soon,  but she demanded it right away because otherwise she wouldn't want to continue my tenancy for the next year. She demanded proof of payments, like the bank receipt or something. I had basically missed four months out of the last year, and I paid two of those this morning.  I gave her all the proofs from the ones that I had paid including the two new ones. But I simply have less than 5 pounds on my account right now, and I couldn't afford the two remaining. So I made a pretty convincing looking fake receipt of payment, and stated that I am able to pay the remaining one on Monday. If I get caught, I'm fucking over. I want to die.

It kept me locked in my house for years. Through medication, exposure therapy, and sheer willpower i've recovered quite a bit. I worked for 2 years and saved up 10k so i could go to college full time. I live in an apartment with my fiance who is also in college doing her masters degree. I still have panic attacks but not very often and i know what triggers them.

Anyhow, here I am, just started a degree in Information Technology with a concentration on cybersecurity and my main hobby is contemplating what i should do with the free time that i have after studying, exercising, practicing programming, and meditating. The main problem is that i overthink everything. I worry far too much about what other people think of me, to the point where most of my decisions are based of of what others think. Right now all i do is play a game of league of legends here or there, FTL, or sometimes shovel knight. 

I simply cant decide due to my overthinking. These are my options, of which i'd like to pick two.

1. Drawing- I can draw at a moderate level, but if i practiced i could really improve my skills which might even help me with my career. I do enjoy it however.
2. Reading- I enjoy reading. Fiction, Non-Fiction, Articles, etc. but I get the ""grass is always greener"" thoughts going on where i order if i should be drawing or something else.
3. Movies/TV: I enjoy watching tv and movies but in all honesty i feel like its a cop out of a real hobby. Its about the same if not worse than video games.

286,"Last night I was trying to sleep and at about 5am or so, my roommate comes home from a late night out. While he's getting some things done and preparing for the night, I simply say to him ""Let's have a talk in the morning about this whole 4-5am thing."" This morning I woke up to a text of him defending his actions mentioning we did agree on him being out until before 6am and I did have right to chain the door if I woke up at any point (which I did). He berates me for speaking to him like a parent when I'm not. Though I had no intention of having such a tone or to be a parent toward him when I mentioned that when should talk about the late night outing. I couldn't even get in why I wanted to discuss the time and him heading out or returning so late. He just made and off hand comment of ""we already talked about it"" (referring to the agreement).

I am aware that we agreed to things as roommates, but things change with time, and I simply approached him to talk about it to make a new agreement, but he's so defensive that it's difficult to communicate with him. This is just one example of how he is defensive. He's apparently aware of tones and intent of others when they speak to him, though after 8 months, I'm not so sure if it's reading people or him being a dick. I could go on and on with the kind of person he is based on how he talks back to me, and others.

The lease is coming up in a month, so I'm on that fence. As despite the defensive personality and being inconsiderate, he does help. But I'm trying to see if I should just look at the bigger picture and just not have him as a roommate any longer.

289,"Basically I was best friends for years with a person, L, who completely turned on me after I moved. We used to be so close and I would have died for L. I sacrificed so much for them in the friendship and cared for them like family. We laughed, cried, learned together. I thought we were platonic soulmates. But then L snapped when I couldn’t meet up after the move, began spreading bad rumours about me, blocked me, making themselves to be the victim, turning other people against me, sent me very cruel, harassing messages about how I’m toxic, manipulative and fake. Throughout our friendship, there were red flags which I ignored solely because of how much I genuinely loved L. For months I was heartbroken and grieving but now I’m returning to that school for the prom. How should I act around L?

The thing is, L never had many friends, only around two or three others, and those they did have, L didn’t like. And not many people liked L and L even admitted that because of their old behaviour. In all honesty, L isn’t very intelligent and lacks the “bigger picture” mindset. I don’t mean to sound condescending but L was never an intellect. In truth, if life was the competition L had tried to make it by spreading rumours and such, I would have won purely because I wasn’t mean, I didn’t target anyone, I’ve had a lot more trustworthy and long lasting friendships and was generally a more likeable person.

Even with that, I’m not sure how to behave around them. I want to have that icy, indifferent and smirking exterior. The “I’m having more fun than you” and not making eye contact, pretty much pretending L is an insect but I need advice.

How should I act? Has this happened to anyone?",14Jul2018,2
291,"Just a heads up- my formatting sucks, I do apologize. Also, I'm not very good with some terminology when it comes to discussing cancer, so for that I apologize too.


My boyfriends father is a man in his seventies whose been battling cancer in various forms for many years now. Most recently he has been battling lung cancer that resurfaced from several years ago, when they treated it into remission. My boyfriend was told back in May that it was getting bad again, his mom called after not speaking to him for 7+ months saying that he was practically on his death bed, that he needed help with 80% of daily activities, that he slept with a cath on and was on oxygen.

My boyfriend and I scrambled to get money to either fly or drive up there. This was around a time when he and I had a scheduled work vacation, so work wasn't stopping us from going. I asked my brother for funds and he was able to spare $800 at the time, and we dropped all of our plans and decided we would go see his family. Then, the night before we were supposed to leave, his mom calls. She tells him that his dad is fine, they're completely okay, and we don't need to come. We returned the money to my brother the next day, since I never would have asked for it otherwise.

I wish we had gone now. It was extremely hard for my boyfriend to hear that he shouldn't come, as we really didn't have the means to drop everything and have never asked to borrow money from anyone, so we went through a lot to be able to go. My boyfriend was hurt and decided we would go in the late summer, during my birthday week, when we had another work vacation scheduled. That way we could save and not have to borrow money, and if his dad was doing fine then it won't be so bad to wait. 

Then the other day he gets the call. First he's told they suspect his dad now has bone cancer. Yesterday he's told that he has fluid building in the lungs, and he was talking about being drafted for the war and how he's excited to come back home to see his mom. 

Today they've told him that he's not responsive. His eyes are glazed over and he's just fighting to breathe on a ventilator. 

I don't know what to do. I want him to be able to go up there. To see his father and be with his mom and sister.

His mom and sister are telling him that he's never been there for his dad when he's fallen ill. I know that's not true though.

He was living in England several years ago, about to become a legal citizen the first time. He dropped everything then and came. Stayed there for months. Lost the chance at becoming a legal citizen. 

Second time he was living in Quebec. Again, dropped everything and stayed there for a few weeks.

This time they told him his dad was ""fine"" and not to rush up here because there will be time, until he got this news a couple days ago.

I don't know what I can do... I see how deeply hurt he his, I know that if it was financially possible he'd have already bought tickets to go. I just want to be able to be there for him, and help him how I can. I don't have any money to get him up there, and he doesn't either, even if we pool everything we have. His family doesn't have anything either, but they expect him to be there in his father's last days. I can't ask my family for money, my brother only had it before because he had been saving.

I worry that he's going to pretend everything is okay because he can't go, and I don't want him to hold onto that burden. All I can offer is emotional support, but I feel like it's not enough.

What else can I do?

299,"Im 33. Growing up I always felt kind of like an outcast in some respects. When I look back I think it developed at around age 25.

From the ages of about 21 to 24, there were formidable years where one's inner self growth is supposed to come at a current stage. I feel like strong relationships were supposed to be formed at that age for me.

I was sort of an addict of sorts, and I never had a steady job nor could I follow through with anything.  I was addicted to something and it kept me from growing all these years. It would be nice at this age, to have a house, perhaps a good relationship with a good woman, a handful of friends, and some accomplishments under my belt too. But I spent my twenties at Meandering through life taking on small stints and different jobs and hobbies and never following through with anything.

So it's been pretty difficult, on top of struggling with low self-esteem. My past seems to keep bringing itself up to my face. All of the emotions and things I went through in my past are constantly reminding me of who I once was. I was just certain type of person. I recall in my early twenties going through so many phases. Trying to be different things.




It is taken me about 10 years to get my life together. Or at least learn to stick with things because I was struggling with lots of issues in my twenties.

My spirit has this inner yearning now that I'm age 33 and it's like I have to restart life. I have to go through things that I should have been going through 10 years ago.

When I look at people my age I see people that are married have a home and kids. I make a few dollars above minimum wage and I rent a room. I have this inner yearning to be accepted by people ages 18-25 and I'm not quite sure why. I think it has something to do with feeling like an outcast in these years.

These years were tremulous for me, but I also had good times and fun memories with friends of that age. I'm not sure if I established the close relationships I was trying to make at that age, as a lot of them were based on hanging out, getting drunk, being debaucherous. They weren't wholesome study relationships and friendships that have stayed throughout the years as they have all withered away.

So in some sense it's like I'm trying to heal my past by wanting to reconnect with people of that age and to present myself in a new light towards them, perhaps help people out and be a sort of mentor of people that age. I don't know if this is normal or not. Sometimes I hang out with my younger brother who was about 23, but it's hard to because of the immaturity.

Anywho I'm not sure if I'm making sense any feedback is appreciated.",14Jul2018,1

So it started when Friend B was talking to Friend A about how upset he was that Friend C was doing cocaine and how he was going down a path he couldn't follow. He got so mad and punched a wall and stuff

So Friend A Told me because we are super close and I felt digusted and concenred, I don't want Friend C going down a dark path and hurting himself, in in the process hurting Ex and friend B.

Since Friend C, didn't listen to Friend B, I decided to try and talk to my Ex, since Ex hates hard drugs with a passion, I thought she deserved to know, and that she could maybe talk t oFriend C to get him off this dark path.

I told EX and she thanked me for letting her know and talked to him.

But then Friend C told Friend B, who got mad at Friend A, whos mad at me, they're saying I overstepped my boundaires and ended up hurtign people in an attempt to help people. 

i'm really hurt by all this, I did what I thought was right because I didn't want them to get hurt, but it seems I hurt them even more in the progress.

301,"So last night I threw a small party for my best friend’s 20th birthday. We invited a few people over, all close friends that we’ve known for a few years. We were drinking, and everyone other than me was smoking. This girl, (let’s call her Abbey) was also there. She’s been a close friend for about 2 years and she and her boyfriend just broke up. Anyways, we’re all sitting around and talking and laughing, and Abbey goes into the kitchen. I followed her, only to find her looking really sad in the kitchen, presumably about her ex. I ask her if she’d like to walk with me outside to greet my other friend who was just about to arrive. As we walk outside, I take her hand. We’re talking back and forth, and I ask her numerous times if she’s okay (in regards to her recent break up). She replies yes, and cuddles me closer, so I put my arm around her. After greeting my friend and walking back into the house, I stop with her for a second and lean in for a kiss. She leans away and steps back. I make a remark along the lines of “yikes that’s a kick to the ego” in an attempt to lighten up the mood of having just tried to make a move on a close friend. She looks at me, as if she’s about to cry. I ask her if everything’s okay and she replies “yes” and we go inside. 30 minutes later, she’s slumped on the couch black out drunk, telling everyone I “tried to rape her.” Her best friend asks for my side of the story, and as soon as I tell her, she believes me. However Abbey was visibly shaken up, and even called her ex boyfriend to pick her up. Her friend told me not to worry, as she said Abbey was just “very very crossfaded.” And to text her the next day. Even still, I couldn’t help but feel guilty and like a monster. Today I texted Abbey, asking her if we could talk and she simply replied “no.” I then sent her a lengthy apology for making things awkward and uncomfortable, but I made clear that I was not trying to pressure her and I would never want to put her in danger.

311,"I’ve been sitting in my car in a parking lot for two hours. A girl I was seeing just broke up with me. I’m only a high schooler and have only had two things that could be called relationships before, but this hit me really hard because I thought this would be the one. This girl was my best friend and was responsible for what were two or three of the months I’ve had this year (and school year) that I’ve been actually happy. She said she still wanted to be friends and it was very amicable, but she also said she wanted space until the beginning of the school year.  

Right now, I just feel fucking directionless and worthless. I don’t feel hopeless, but I’m just not looking forward to the next school year as I have in past summers. Had this been my first time feeling like this, I would obviously not be depressed. But this year, I really haven’t been happy and have felt hopeless many times. All of this comes in spite of this year being my best one by far by all objective measures (most friends, best social standing, best performance in school). Previously, I was decidedly one of the unpopular kids and had few friends, but despite that I was relatively happy. Now, while I’m not a popular kid I think I’m respected by most people and I’ve made several friends who seem to enjoy my presence. In spite of this, my overall happiness has been much lower than previous years. 

I was happy for a brief period of time because I got to know the girl who just broke up with me. I felt warm, happy, and alive with her even when we were just friends. When I asked her out and she said yes, I thought my life would finally be what I had wanted it to be after 3 years of failure. Of course, that did not work out. Now, I just feel like shit. I don’t want to go home and have to hide this from my parents again. I don’t want to talk about what happened to any of my close friends. But most of all, I don’t want to go sleep like this. I don’t want to wake up like this. I want to finally be happy with my life, proud of myself, satisfied, and in love with life. But I am none of those things.

Anyway, am I depressed or just sad? I feel depressed, but I also feel like I’m not because I’m certain I would be perfectly happy if I found a girl who just reciprocated my feelings and gave me intimacy. Sorry for the essay!

Tl;dr am sad

313,"Hi.

Long story short, I came here to study and scout out the situation (if its good for relocating to with my family) 2 years ago, hit the block of not being able to find a job, now I am stuck here with no apparent way of leaving the country while still having a way to come back and finish my next year courses. I am a 24 year old man, ~10 months of work experience in IT as a sysadmin. The town I have relocated to is a small town in Russia. I was supposed to leave the country as planned around 2 weeks ago but money got tight and I was not able to buy a ticket. Heck, I wasnt able to pay rent for 3 months and had to ask the landlord to put it off for a period. Didnt buy the ticket earlier because there were uncertanties about when the courses end this year. Now I am stuck without a ticket and most likely will have to vacate the room in two or three days that I've rented for past 2 years (excluding past summer because I left back to my home country) since I've overstayed the agreed period for a week and the landlord doesnt want to deal with my problems, which I understand.

316,"My fiancé has 2 sons (7 and 5 years old), and their dad is a despicable human being. When they were together, he was physically, emotionally, verbally, and sexually abusive towards her. It has caused her some pretty serious trauma that has taken her years to try to move past. We’ve been together for about a year and a half, and he and I have never gotten along. I do my best to be civil, and even extend olive branches to him in an effort to make our lives easier. He’s not interested in being civil whatsoever. 

He doesn’t have a driver’s license because he has 4 DUIs, so the only time he can see his kids is when she brings them to him. She wants to afford her boys the opportunity to have a relationship with their dad, because even though he’s a terrible person and terrible partner, he’s generally always treated his kids pretty well (even if he’s practically been a ghost for a decent portion of their lives). Plus, if she were to keep the kids from their dad, it would do nothing but affect their opinion of her in the long run because they would just blame her for it. He’s a manipulative guy and would absolutely spin the fact that he’s not seeing his kids on her. 

Where my main problem lies is that any time that she takes the kids to see him, he touches her in subtly inappropriate ways. Nothing blatantly sexual, but things like putting his hand on her leg, kissing her neck when he hugs her, or trying to hold her hand. I already had a conversation with him about it roughly 7-8 months ago, but she told me last night that it’s still happening. And unfortunately because of the control he used to have over her, she still struggles to stand up to him about it and make it stop. She freezes up. She’s also afraid to start a fight in front of the kids or out in public (because she’s smart enough to only bring the kids to him and be there when it’s in a public setting). But on top of the fact that it’s inappropriate, she’s also concerned about what kind of message it could be sending to her kids if they were to notice things like that. 

So my question is: what do I do here? I can’t bring any kind of threat or violence against him because they have a court order in place and he would absolutely use that against her. Plus I’m in the background investigation portion for a career in law enforcement and can’t risk ruining it because of him. And, quite frankly, I’m not a violent person to begin with. She’s suggested having a chaperone with her (like a friend, her sister, or her mom) anytime she brings her kids to see him because she said he won’t do that if someone else she knows is there, but that won’t always be a realistic option. How do I put a stop to this so that she doesn’t have to put up with this anymore?",14Jul2018,1

320,"You're not wrong, you're definitely reading another typical ""in love with best friend"" post, but I genuinely don't know what I want to do or what I should do.

At my previous job, we hired this woman who very quickly became a good friend of mine. She was very quiet and shy, but we hit it off almost immediately and she opened up to me, let me see the true side of her. I've grown up with the same group of 7 or 8 guys that I consider my brothers, but this girl easily is my best friend. She knows stuff about me that my buddies don't, and vice versa. She doesn't have very many friends here to begin with, she had just moved here when she got the job, and it's been two and a half years since that point and aside from myself, she's only got a handful of other friends. She tells me everything, and I mean everything, about her day, her life, what's going on in her head, her hopes, her dreams, her fears, etc. She talks to me about her anxiety problems, which is easy for me because I have anxiety and depression issues as well. In fact, she came into my life when I was in a very dark place in my life, so she's been nothing but helpful in that regard. She even talks to me about her relationship issues because she has no one else to do that with. She has recently gotten out of a toxic relationship with a guy she was warned about from many people. I had my doubts about him as well, but I never said anything because when I say everyone was against it, I mean everyone in her life, from her hometown to the few friends and siblings she has here, was against it. I wanted her to have some form of support, it wasn't fair for her to not have that. 

Problem is, you guessed it, I have feelings for her. Throughout these past few years, I didn't think it was love, more so I assumed it was just a crush, since I have only really dated a few women. But I quickly realized that it's way more than anything I ever felt with my past relationships. So I have spent the past few months since her breakup supporting her in every which way I can, so she can move on from this asshole, and hopefully find happiness without him.

During her relationship with him, she pushed everyone away, including me. It was only ever about him. Now that he's gone, she's reaching out for help, and I've been there every second of every day. We've been inseparable since then, talking all day, every day, and spending whatever free time we can hanging out with each other. She went to visit family down south a while back, and during that trip, I debated whether or not I should open up.

My dumbass decided it was the best time to do so. When she got back, we hung out. Watched netflix, made some food, watched vine compilations, etc. At the very end of the night right before I left, I told her. I told her everything about what I have been feeling, since before she started dating the other guy, all the way up to now. She's the kind of person, like myself, who likes to interject often to clarify stuff, so I asked her to remain silent so that I could get all of it out, and if she had anything to say afterwards, she was more than welcome. She did exactly that.

I should've seen it in her eyes, but I kept going. I could tell what she was thinking, but I just wouldn't shut up. I said that all I really wanted was just a chance. A chance to show her what she means to me. At the very end of my proclamation, I decided to end it on a lighter note, one where she could at least say bye to me that night with a smile on her face. So, i did something really dopey and ""cute"" by recreating her favorite vine, and gave her some pinecones on a stick, saying ""I care about you. Here, some pinecones on a stick. They're lovely.""



As you can imagine, I wouldn't be here if it turned out the way I had hoped it would. About 3 weeks later she gave me an answer. She said stuff like

""You're my rock, my one constant in this life

I love you in more ways than I can ever express to you

You're my friend, my best friend"" 



And then she ended it with, ""But that's all I can ever let you be. I'm sorry.""




It was awkward for a day or two, but I got over it, because she needed someone again. That asshole of an ex came back into her life for a split second, igniting whatever embers of hope she had left, and then snuffed them out within an hour of being back. She needed someone. She needed me. And since then, I haven't left her side. We talk every day, even about how she feels about....him. She's said on many occasions, ""it's selfish of me to talk to you about this stuff, knowing how you feel about me. I'm so...so sorry."" But I don't care. I don't want her upset. I don't like knowing she cries herself to sleep some nights. I don't like knowing she resents herself for something that wasn't her fault. I hate him for what he has done to her. I will always be here for her no matter what it does to me. 

I'm still in love with her. I don't know if I'll get over it, idk how...idk if I want to. Should I hope for a change, eventually? Should I get over it and move on? Should I even still be around her?",14Jul2018,1
321,"I’m so overwhelmed and exhausted mentally, physically and psychologically. My husband of five years has asked for a divorce. I didn’t see it coming, at all.

322,"I apologize if this is not the right sub and for the wall of text.

First, a bit of background, some events have been dismissed or forgotten. About 4-5 years ago my parents decided to have a divorce which was not met with overwhelming friction. Both my brother and I were not shook by this and continued our daily lives, at this time my brother was an extremely emphatic character with immature humor (something we share). A few months later I was on my way to university in another country thus relatively free from the any prevailing issues. 

As time went by my father eventually wanted some time with my brother which I fully understand. However, his method of communication was rather aggressive and did not leave much room for a mutual understanding. As my mother did not want to resolve to legal measures she agreed to letting the brother stay with the father for as long as my brother wanted. You may say this was the wrong decision, but keep in mind that my mother has been under a lot of stress with her unstable work environment. After a few months she eventually wanted some form of a mutual agreement and rightfully requested one, only to be met with a passive dismissal. Suddenly I was informed that either my mother or father (both blame each-other) wanted to go to parental court to enforce a regular or permanent (scary) custody. Give their stubbornness I was sure this would get ugly and wanted to avoid this at all costs. I proceeded to call both of them to get their own version of the story and eventually (somewhat aggressively) fostered an agreement that seemed to please them both, keep in mind that I was still in another country. The agreement was that my brother was to go back to my mother in one week and remain for at least one week followed by a serious (and respectful) discussion to determine a proper custody schedule. While the peace did seem to last for two weeks my brother proceeded to immediately go back to my father and no discussion seemed to have taken place. At least the parental court was not in play anymore... 

My father is a loving man, but not without issues, he sometimes displays weird and perhaps narcissistic traits but perhaps not intentionally. My mother is too a loving mother that supports both my brother and I unconditionally (emotionally and financially), however, she has had issues managing stress levels throughout her life which leads to other issues (such as miscommunication). 

This is where things take a turn for the weirder. At this point in time my brother seems to gradually become less emphatic and more self-centered in his demands (custody and whatnot). Every query by my mother is seen as an annoyance and passive aggressively dismissed. A loose custody schedule is enforced at this time which does mean my mother gets a bit of time with him. However, my brother seems completely disinterested in connecting with her (she is a very emotional person) and almost manipulative in how he communicates with her. She often calls me to (rightfully) vent her frustrations with me, I should add these venting sessions have been a common occurrence throughout my life and that I do not mind them. 

Some months of this pass and I come back from my university (newly graduated I might add 🙂). My brother now seems completely disinterested in visiting my mother which has left her very lonely. With my return my brother wanted to be with me, so I chose to initially visit my mother for a couple of weeks. I immediately noticed that he refused to partake in any chores (despite my mother attempting to enforce it) and used a much harsher language, one that I was surprised with. As I was trying to relax I did not intervene (perhaps that was wrong) at the time. A few weeks later we journeyed to my graduation without major issue, surprisingly my parents were faring well together, and swiftly returned. However, despite the agreed schedule my brother now wanted to spend an indefinite amount of time at my father without any real notice, this left my mother in a visibly sad state. My mother at this time regularly tried to, initially enforce, determine a new schedule that would account for his needs (and hers too) but was met with aggressive (not passive) dismissal. After countless tried to connect with my brother she had reached her limit and was visibly distressed. It was at this time she said something along the lines of (not a quote) ""If he does not wish to spend time with me, why should I try"", this was a massive red flag for me. A day later my father surprisingly invited us to dinner at a local restaurant which lifted my mother's spirits (time to connect with her son). After the dinner my father suggested that my brother should return to her in a weeks' time which was wonderful, this is exactly what she needed. And then after returning home after an hour's drive (with me) she received a call from my brother that he was not interested in returning, apparently, he hung up on her and refused to discuss further. And then the shit storm fell (sorry), my mother came to me in extreme emotional distress and couldn't contain her frustrations any longer. She then began crying not knowing what to do and passively blaming herself, which it is clearly not in my opinion. I have never seen her like this before, and it scares me.

So, here I am, not know what to do. Maybe I'm biased here since I did miss 3 years of character development but my brother seems completely uninterested in my mother's state and void of any empathy. My mother has (temporarily) given up on essentially maintaining a relationship with my brother, which has left me very worried. I don't know how to proceed, should I call my father and vent my frustration? Should I damage my relationship with my brother and tell him off, am I selfish for not doing this? I'm blank.

However, my boss invited me to go to Six Flags with her and my other two coworkers (her husband and daughter).

329,Some background. I had a crush on my friend for awhile now. I never told her this because to put it bluntly I was a loser. Overweight. No job. Still lived with Dad. And some other issues. She has some social anxiety so it wasn't uncommon for her to not talk to anyone in our friend group for a while. But she would always text me a few times here and there during these periods(usually just a week or so). We had the most weird/ funny conversations and I would never not be smiling when taking  to her. Well 2 years ago I decide to try to better myself so I could get the confidence to tell her. I got a job and was during great at it. Started apartment hunting and found one. I asked her if she would help me move since I helped her move when she went away for college. She said yes. Moving day comes around d and she backs out cause it was the middle of july and really fucking hot. I understood. That was the last time she has spoken to me or anyone in our friend group.one friend took it really hard cause this was the second person to do that to her but I think she has recovered from it.

My room is only accessible up some stairs through the back of this house where it's completely dark. When I go out my door, it's mostly just tall grass to my right and I have to go left to reach the main house and small outdoor hallway to the front of the houses. 

My room's glass door faces the pool and the creepy shed where the forest line is. Even during the daytime the forest entrance is pitch black. And there's no lock on my fully glass door. There's a key and keyhole but if you open the door and look, the key doesn't even do anything.  All I have is a nice curtain and a door handle to block any intruders.

Oh, and there's a door in my room that leads to an unfinished 4th room but it's closed off by an actual door. In the washing machine room, there are actual stairs leading up to the 4th room but the ceiling just cuts it off. And 4 is an unlucky number in certain Asian cultures, blegh. I'm sleeping with the lights on and keeping something I can fight with close by. 

The good thing is, despite being in the valley/rural area, my phone signal is amazing and even though I can't reach the wifi signal my phone gives me all the internet I need. And that I have my own toilet/shower without having to go outside. ",14Jul2018,1
331,I'm 24 and still live with my parents ( I did live on my own for 4 years in college). They have a million dollar house that's over 7000 square feet. I'm at the point where I want to move out however I feel if i move it has to be somewhere far away from them (far away as in 1 hour +). I don't see the point in spending 1000+ for an apartment down the street when this big house is available to me. Seems like it would be a waste of money. I have enough money saved up to go to just about any city for a year and I'm confident of getting a job wherever I go. I just need advice on my living situation. I enjoy being around my parents but I'd like to get my own place but it just doesn't seem financially smart to move down the street.,14Jul2018,1
332,So this is gonna be a long self indulgent post lol sorry. I’m 17 just had the first year of sixth form and now have 2 months with no school. I don’t have a huge group of mates just a couple close ones and I’ve never been in a relationship. Usually over summer I get quite low from like boredom and overthinking (I’ve got ocd) or feeling like I’m missing out. I live in the middle in the middle of nowhere and it’s hard to get into town. I just want to know how I can get the most out of this summer while not falling into this negative headspace I always get into. Lol I know this doesn’t make much sense but any insight would be cool. Thanks for reading. ,14Jul2018,1
333,"I found a seasonal student job in a local small privately owned grocery shop to earn some spending money. 

Even though learning new stuff for work made me somewhat anxious, I think my boss is making my anxiety much worse. She is always there behind my back, she gives me contradicting rules all the time (Not to put certain cigarettes through the register, then often tells me to put them through, not to panic and hurry too much when there are more people, yet she takes over even though I had everything under control, to stack bottles when there isn't enough, but often tells me not to), she smokes all the time near the register, and always wants to chat and gossip.

Now to the insulting part: When we talked, I mentioned I liked baking. She REALLY wanted me to make Sacher cake for her. She basically forced it on me with her excitement, talking about how she would love to have some, not to worry about how it will turn out.

I made the cake for her, and once she tried it, she blew up about it being a terrible cake. ""You made a mistake for sure. Did you even put all the ingredients I gave you? You skimped on them for sure! It is totally dry, we hated it. You have yet to learn to bake actually, you made it this once and now you won't make it again. You will know once you get older that it is a terrible cake, it's so small, but it's no problem and don't get mad""

Needless to say, I was mad as hell. I immediately asked for a piece and it was soft, tasty and just like a Sacher should be (I made it countless times for many family events, and had some from the original cake shop in Vienna, so I know it was good). She kept saying I can't take criticism, and that she expected a much better bigger cake.

Anyway, I feel really bad about it. I feel disappointed in myself for being forced into making it, and I came to really dislike the woman. I feel like she shat all over my self esteem, and I dread going to work again.

Am I being a wimp? Should I just deal with it? I know I can find another seasonal job easily, but I feel like I may be overreacting.

336,"A little backstory : I'm 19 years old, I've had awful teeth since I was about 12 or 13 years old and I've been waiting about 6 years to get them fixed(I've been to many dentists, either the work was too expensive or bad shit just kept happening). A few months ago, I finally got accepted for medicaid(NJ FamilyCare). I picked Horizon as my HMO and got my referrals for the 7 root canals that I needed. 

My Endodonist's office sent in my 7 root canals for approval from the insurance company. Yesterday, in the mail I received 7 separate letters - all of them stating that my treatment requests have been denied. The letters weren't from my HMO(Horizon), they were from ""Scion Dental""(apparently they provide the insurance for Horizon). The reason stated was that ""The requested treatments might not last very long"". As you can tell, I was pissed off, that's an awful reason to deny someone medical attention. I couldn't call them because it was already too late and they don't have office hours on weekends, so I'll have to call on Monday. My other dentist submitted two crowns for approval, which were accepted(I'm wondering if my Endodontist did something wrong?)

What should I do? This dental work HAS to happen. I have pain in my teeth every day, and many of my teeth are going to have to be pulled if they don't get dental treatment. Someone please help?",14Jul2018,0
337,"I am was divorced from a 9 year marriage in Sep. of last year due to infidelity. It was unexpected and very traumatic for me to go through. I was able to go live with my younger sister and her husband and my nephew. Unfortunately they lived in a different state so I had to apply for a new job. The market was not as good as I hoped it would be and it was going on three months.. My sister then found out she was pregnant and that's when the trouble began with her. Her and her husband were fighting a lot, I was drinking and going out a lot (trying to numb my pain), and then one day I heard my sis and her hubby in a big fight. Initially I thought my sister was screaming for me to open the door and when I rushed to open her bedroom door she screamed for me to ""get the fuck back in ur room"". I was extremely emotional because my nephew was in the room with her and I could hear him crying. Turns out she was yelling at her hubby and wanting him to open the bathroom door. I called my mom upset (now regretting this) and my mom called and freaked out on my sister. My sister told me I had one month to get a job and get out and had accused me of sleeping with her husband. I was devastated. I had been going to therapy and constantly applying to jobs, and I didn't want to leave, but I knew it was only a matter of time before my sis got upset again and kicked me out completely. So I moved in with my mom in another different state! Me and my mom haven't ever gotten along so this was a challenge! My aunt had to end up letting me stay with her for two weeks because me and my mom had such a hard time getting along. Lots of ups and downs later I finally get my own apt and job (so thankful)! During this entire time I have been building a good relationship with my mom, but I also want to be close to my other family here (my aunt uncle and 5 cousins).  It just seems like they are extremely clicky.. I go to holiday events and they are all very stand offish and keep their click together, while excluding me and my mom. Today we went to a funeral with them and they were acting very strange. I literally just followed my cousin around and sat by him even though he hardly acknowledged me. I tried to make small talk but he didn't seem comfortable, like usual. My ex husband was very controlling and so I don't have very many long term friends, but I have made some new friends and I seem to get along with them okay... I have two long term friends. 

Am I doing something wrong???? Why does none of my family welcome me in? My sister still wont talk to me or let me talk to my nephew. I don't even know my new nieces name and this is devastating to me. I have apologized to her multiple times with no luck. I told my cousin I feel excluded and he hasn't responded.

340,"So I’m 19, living in my friends house. Had to get away from my home because my stepdad is a creep, in january he sent me these texts saying he thinks I’m beautiful and he’s so glad we have a friendship, he said that if he ever flirted he was sorry but he just had a habit of flirting with beautiful women. Just a lot of weird stuff like that. So I told my mom and she flipped and he moved to his moms house for a week (which is right next door to us) and we stayed in his home. My mom has 5 kids to take care of, so this was really hard on her. He ended up quitting his job and hasn’t worked since. we talked it over and chalked it up to his bipolar disorder because people w bipolar disorder tend to like just say weird stuff impulsively. He moved back in. I felt weird for months afterwards  anytime I was home. Mom didn’t want ANYONE to know, not even my older sister (who was at college at the time) so I was alone with it for a while. Eventually I told her I didn’t feel comfortable anymore and we should find a new place to go or make him move out. She wouldn’t make him leave. I told her I was leaving if she didn’t kick him out and so I left. I was getting a job I could have helped out and my sister would be coming home for the summer so she could watch the kids n all that. First I was gonna stay with my dad then I got a job here (my friend lives like 5 mins away from my mom) so I stayed here and my friends fam didn’t mind at all. Haven’t made me pay rent or anything. So I fell into a pretty deep depression and stopped showing up to work, started taking xans and drinking more, i always smoked weed like everyday because it helped the depression and anxiety I already had. I cut myself now. (I started when I was in middle school and pretty much stopped for three years with a couple relapses inbetween) but i got a new job I have orientation in a few days. The cutting helps when I get really suicidal, it’s enough relief to tide me over a few days. So yeah I’m living with my friend, her uncle owns the house. Her mom does a harder drug but I’ve been exposed to drugs my whole life so it doesn’t bother me that much. Her uncle is like late 40 something I think (just guessing based on the way he looks) he has this like infatuation with me. He would always make comments about how I looked or what a nice view I was etc. I pretty much just avoid him when I can. Well me and my friend both got jobs at this same place coming up, but for a while we both were broke didn’t have money to eat sometimes. So her uncle asked like how much money I would let him play w my boobs for. I was like nope I don’t want him to touch me so then he asked about pictures. I don’t even hate the idea of sending pics for money like fuck it I gotta eat ya know. So I’ve sold pics to him twice, made 80$. He said if he made me uncomfortable I could tell him n everything but like I’m already uncomfortable that I have to live here. I regret doing it but I did what I had to so we could eat. I’ll be starting this job sometime soon so I can save for a car and get the hell out of here. I guess I could have stayed with my dad but my stepmom treated me like shit for years and my dad is a (sort of) recovering alcoholic, he was supposed to die last year and somehow lived this long. He was never a great dad to me so I pretty much want to stay away from him. I’m just scared for the future. Where will i go, how will i survive on my own, will i kill myself before I even get the chance to try. Am I a shitty person for everything that’s happened?? Should I just kill myself before life can get any worse or weirder, because I can’t handle much more. I feel like I’m living in the twilight zone. I also am pretty sure i have borderline or some mood disorder, just an assload of mental health issues. Watched my mom get beat as I grew up by my two brothers real father who was also an alcoholic and on drugs which probably is the exact reason of why I’m mentally ill. Idk just have a lot of issues and needed to rant because I am so alone in this. ",14Jul2018,0
342,"I'm not an especially social person anymore, but I'd like to be as confident and as talkative as I used to be, However, over the last few years I've really struggled to join and stay part of a conversation. I think this is due to a few issues with speech I have that appear to be worsening, but I'm not quite sure how to change that.  


As it is, I have a fairly quiet and high pitched speaking voice. I work away (in Construction) so I'm often in loud environments like factories and bars, and I'm currently having to repeat approximately 90&amp;#37; of the sentences that I say. This often leaves me feeling embarrassed and I've started just dismissing it and saying 'It doesn't matter' when asked to repeat myself. I try to raise my voice, but it's apparent that I'm shouting and it usually causes my voice to break. And I STILL don't get heard.  


I also have a tendency to speak too quickly (I'm told). I don't notice this personally, but I've been told multiple times to slow down by friends and family, and every interview I've ever attended I've been told to relax and speak slower. I try to restrain myself, but this only lasts as long as I'm focusing on my speech. Plus, I tend to speak TOO slowly and sound drunk or dazed which people have also picked up on.  


Plus, I've developed a bit of a stutter. Most people say they actually don't notice this, but I'm incredibly aware of every time I do it and it makes me a little self conscious. It's usually fairly minor (M-m-m-minor), but sometimes I'm physically unable to finish the word. The last time this happened, it was about 30 seconds of me trying to say a word, before giving up and saying that it doesn't matter. The person I was speaking to just sort of laughed and I laughed it off too, but it was on my mind for a while after that.  


I think it's because of these reasons that I've started avoiding social situations. I used to attend jam sessions, go out regularly with friends and have a pretty healthy social life. Now I spend all week at the edge of a conversation being asked if I'm okay every 20 minutes, followed by a weekend I'd rather spend alone to avoid any more embarrassment.  


I was told that avoiding these situations is the worst thing to do, so I keep going out when invited and keep trying to join in. But every time I try, I fail to make a good impression and spend the entire time wishing I'd stayed at home. Is this something that a therapist might be able to help with? Or could it be considered 'serious' enough to require a specialized speech therapist? Anyone have any tips that I could try in the meantime?  


Thanks!",14Jul2018,1
343,"Hello, I have a (now ex) friend that is currently in a custody battle over his young daughter with an ex-girlfriend. My friend is extremely emotionally unstable, having frequent outbursts of extreme emotion in which he lashes out at his friends, cuts off all contact with others, and begins a barrage of personal attacks at the people he is upset with. In my view, this is a sign of extreme emotional immaturity, and is perhaps dangerous (as these attacks have recently escalated to threats of violence). He has even now begun talking about suicide, in the context of desiring for myself and others to kill ourselves (which I think may be a projection of his own desires). These are extremely alarming, and may be symptomatic of deep mental instability and problems associated with that. I have done my best to treat these attacks without returning in kind, but I find myself extremely concerned for his daughter. There is no evidence that this behavior has extended itself to his daughter, but the messages that he has sent are incredibly damning, and I find myself unable to figure out what the best course of option would be to take here. On the one hand, this behavior being brought to light in his custody battle would likely be incredibly decisive against him, but on the other hand I feel as though extending this personal conflict to such a degree would be too much.

348,"[Long post incoming, sorry] 

I'm 24 years old and started college in 2012. I started as a music ed major at one school and realized I didn't want to do it, so I transferred to a community college branch of the local university and started studying education. I then realized I wanted to be a librarian after working at the school's library, so I switched my major to English Lit (you have to get a Master's to be a librarian so I figured I'd not deal with trying to do everything for the education program if I just needed the piece of paper for undergrad). I had to go to the main campus after that and did not do well- on top of that, it was far more expensive and I couldn't afford it. I had taken a few online classes and liked them, so I transferred to a school where I could get my BA in library science online and afford it. I like my core classes all right, but I'm having to re-take gen ed classes that didn't transfer, which are becoming my downfall. The professors WAY overwork everyone (I'm talking reading 4 books in a week for one class and having to write a paper on each of them, 10 assignments a week for another, and it goes on). 

My biggest issue is my health- physical and mental. I've been dealing with an absolute breakdown for about the past year and a half, almost being hospitalized for my mental health at one point. I can barely get out of bed most days, executive dysfunction controls my life, and I panic constantly. 

I've taken semesters off in the past, but I feel like I could benefit from taking off for a longer period of time. Every time I take off a semester, I have this renewed sense of faith in myself when I go back, but I end up performing worse and worse every semester. I had to drop a class/lab combo and I'm failing another class- I will pass just one. I'm just burnt out. I'm going to be on financial aid suspension (which I can appeal, have before and it went fine), which makes things even more stressful.

I’ve know this person for about a year and her family situation is a bit complicated. She studies abroad so she isn’t always around her mum who’s divorced but her brother lives at home. 

This is what I know about her mum, she had a boyfriend for a while after the divorce who she went on a couple of trips around the with. The guy seemed super nice but apparently she just shat on him whenever he wasn’t around but then got annoyed when her children complained about him. (Kinda odd) .  

Then the guy broke up with her and was super sad and a bit depressed. She went off to the Middle East on a soul searching vacation in the mountains and seemed a little different when she came back. When she returned she started buying books about speaking to the dead and something about kundalini. 

This is where there is a gap of about 6 months as the girl was studying abroad. When the girl returned she (the mom) had about 15 books, was regularly attending Kundalini yoga, goes to a spiritual person who she is very secretive about .

Finally the family which has always been very financially secure is having financial problems (not large problems) since she started this strange behaviour. And she is only able to talk about this wild spiritual stuff to the point where she has lost all of her other interests and hobbies and is constantly calling her children burdens.

356,"**Warning - Long Post**

*So a sort of preface to this post: I am a student at a nearby college, commuting from my family's home, doing a degree I am not too happy about, nor going to a school I enjoy, but I don't feel like I have many options.*



So what has me stressed recently is that, I want to be able to make a good amount of money for financial security, without having to rely on a crappy college education being forced down my throat as the key.

I am not taking any classes this summer, and I am not sure if I will take classes in the Fall, but my mom (who is the closest person to me) constantly pushes me to as she thinks it is the best option since I am unsure of what I want in life, even though I dislike what I am already going for. It's a lose-lose situation with her because if I continue going, it kills me on the inside because it feels like my potential is wasted there, but if I don't go, my mother gets selfishly upset, and also whenever I try to refuse to go over something such as scheduling for the next semester. We aren't exceedingly wealthy, and I know we have many kinds of payments that chew up our family's income because we can't buy things straight up sometimes. I played Violin all throughout Middle School and High School in the Orchestra/Symphony, so when my mom bought me my own violin that I hesitantly picked out, I immediately felt massive buyers remorse and couldn't even stand to look at the instrument that would slowly accrue payments and take money from other things we could use it for, but I did not buy it, and my mother would keep it even when I voiced how unsure I was about getting the instrument.

I have tried to learn and get more skilled in various things to be able to make money on my own without relying on a business or company to be an employee of. 

* I bought a [digital] drawing tablet and downloaded Krita (free art software) to practice and try to eventually be skilled enough to make commissions. (Before this I was already decent at traditional art)
* If it weren't for the states near me having a 21 or older gambling law, I would bring what savings I have to a casino and play blackjack and possibly move on to poker if things went well (because I am good at the blackjack and play safe with a level head, so that is why I considered this option for when I turn 21 next year)
* I spent hours teaching myself about stock trading, and opened an account, but with the little money I have, I have not earned much through my stocks, so this route isn't worth it unless I took a loan for $25,000 and started day-trading
* Currently I have spent the most amount of excessive time trying to learn to make an indie game all on my own, which entails programming, creating sounds/music, modeling 3D objects (and/or 2D sprites), drawn art, and more.
* I once advertised my skill at photoeditting on fiverr but such a thing was overwhelmed by pre-existing popular users who offered similar things and buried my own listing.
* I bought a high-quality webcam for streaming/recording to maybe make game related videos, but I did not continue this shortly after I started for certain (trivial) reasons :[

Everything feels like its on an uncertain and terrible deadline, including the limited time until summer ends and fall classes begins. When I try to learn and make these things happen (such as the game development), the work put into it is tiresome and not feeling like progress is made while time slips by; it feels like motivation being crushed like a hammer to a vase. My desktop is in a room in our house right next to another computer, and the presence of another person alone adds a layer of stress because of the distraction.

With the stress of time feeling so limited, it goes hand in hand with my dislike/fear of aging. One of the things I considered before graduating out of High School was becoming something like a Genetic Engineer to help solve aging so I can save my myself, my immediate family, and my parents family from continuing to whither and eventually passing away, even though this kind of job isn't something I wouldn't personally enjoy as a career choice, but if it payed off it would mean everything, but if it didn't, it would be a wasted life. Last year I even considered the idea of either joining the military because it felt like it would remove many of the factors that contribute to my stress. Many thing do not feel very enjoyable anymore, and trying to do some of the hobbies I use to have for a long time feel like I am wasting my time from my tasks. There is no problem about keeping up with a social life because I practically don't have one outside of college with one college friend. From what I sort of found, I think I have an inability to make a bond with other people (stemming from childhood events), so I am not sure if that is a major factor in having friends (and/or never having felt like dating), but I think that is another issue nonetheless.

Sorry if this long post just seams thrown together. I reread it a couple times, but regardless of the format, I just wanna know what you have to say about any/all of this. (If anything I made was unclear or confusing, I'd gladly elaborate and expand on it)",14Jul2018,0
357,"As the title explains, my parents no longer invite me to anything, and I’m 19. 

So I just want to make it clear that my parents shouldn’t be seen negatively with what I’m about to say, and more of this reflects on me.

So my parents used to invite me along to a lot of things, such as the lake, baseball games, NFL games, going out to dinner as a family. I’d go to some of the things they invited me along too, but my acceptance rate is probably 20% if that, lol. 

My parents are season ticket holders for the Denver Broncos, and I like watching them, but it’s more fun seeing the game from the comfort of the living room. Moreover, my senior year in HS, me and some friends would watch the games together, and eat chips and dip. 

Just recently, as in after graduation (yes, I’m old for my class), I was offered to go on a fishing trip with the family, and I said “nah, that’s okay”, and the family left without me. After that, it’s been exactly 0 times I’ve been offered to go along with the family for their outings. 

I have proof this is occurring because my little sister (16) told me what all I’ve missed out, but wanted to wait to say something to confirm it wasn’t an isolated incident. She’s asked why I didn’t want to go, and the parents would just say “oh, he didn’t want to...” 

I’m happy my sister said something to me, but I’m disappointed that I’m being skipped over for these things. I recently found out that I’m missing out on a lot of Rockies baseball games, and lake time, and yes there’s been plenty of times where I wanted to go, but I wasn’t offered. 

My heart has that sinking feeling like I’m not wanted as a result of them no longer inviting me to stuff. I get that I don’t accept the invites much, but it’s the thought that they kept me in mind that really meant something to me. 

My parents right now, are at the lake, and so is the entire family, sisters included- even my cousins. It just so happens that I want to go to the lake now too. 

I’ve been brainstorming what I should do, should I crash their vacation? Should I try and call my mom or dad to see if they’ll be truthful? What should I do if they lie to me? For the record, my older and younger sister texted me asking why I “decided to skip”. ",14Jul2018,1

359,"In a previous post, you guys helped me find pig's blood. Thanks for that. Now that I've got it, it's not as thick and paint-like as I would like. It's runny and the surface I'm trying to paint on is not very absorbent. I tried adding cornstarch and it didn't do much of anything except lighten the color. Also tried heating it with a bit of salt added, as though I was going to make blood curds (ew), and it thickened just a bit. 

I will end up needing quite a bit of it, so heating/salting gallons of the stuff is not ideal. The smell is not great and logistically it's a nightmare. Any suggestions as to what I could add to it at room temp to thicken it up so that it's not so runny and watery?",14Jul2018,0

The insurance companies decided that it was 100&amp;#37; my fault but i almost feel like imposter syndrome? Im blaming myself even though the evidence and the damage and the police report and the insurance companies say otherwise. I feel very guilty that his job might be in danger because of this, since he does drive for a living. He hit my car but its nnot like he tried to hurt me and I dont want his livelihood endangered but there is nothing I can do, since he reported it to the insurance companies and I wasnt going to.

365,"Recently I’ve come to the realization that I’m a complete piece of shit. You guys know when we were in school &amp; young and someone would ask: describe yourself in 5 words... ?

Well, if I were to be 100% honest with myself, and whoever is reading this post, these would be my 5 words to describe myself, if I were asked today:

1. Selfish
2. Stubborn
3. Lazy
4. Ungrateful
5. Ignorant

Not saying these are the only words that describe me fully, but these are definitely the most prominent words &amp; prevalent “words” in association to my personality and my life. 

So, how do I build up a different list of words for myself?? Because although everyday I think about how this list of words defines me, everyday I continue to act according to these words again and again. I can’t escape it. Even if I wake up claiming “okay today I’m going to try to avoid being lazy, not be selfish, be less stubborn, be more appreciative of the blessings in my life, increase my awareness and alertness in regards to my surroundings”.... I make the same mistakes over and over and over again, I make myself the center and treat everyone else like shit.

Please help me escape this horrible downwards spiral. I’ve become the person I hate most in this world and at this stage I really just want to be happy with &amp; proud of who I am. 

Thanks in advance.",14Jul2018,1

-I grew up as an only child

-I have symptoms of adhd

-I may also have social anxiety

-I have trouble communicating through words

-I communicate perfectly fine with my mom but not with strangers

-I’m a loner at school 

-I know I need practice but I’m a slow learner. My mom has mention I need to get out of my comfort zone, which is true, but I think I will need something more.

-I looked at this [website](https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/treatments-approaches/treatment-options/treatment-options-for-social-skills-issues)and help includes cognitive behavioral therapy and speech therapy. Which do you guys think would benefit me?

368,"Okay so, after getting out of my last relationship I decided to try online dating instead. Basically, there was a girl I had met that I was interested in, and explicitly told her so, only to lose interest after I got to know her properly. I never really made this clear however.

Jump to now, several months later, and I'm in a relationship with someone else. I've maintained regular contact with the first girl, though she isn't aware of my relationship.
It occurred to me that I may be leading her on. She is seemingly still interested, and presumably believes I am too.

Am I doing something bad here by not telling her I lost interest?
Do I need to explicitly say as such?",14Jul2018,4
369,"It's really stupid.I told this girl we used to best friends ,that I am obsessed with leonardo dicaprio and I really couldn't care less about him.Since then she texts me about him sometimes and now wants me to hang  out with her and watch a movie of his.I really don't wanna hang out because of that but also because It's really awkward especially after lying about this because last time I was talking about how I've watched a lot of his movies and I was just agreeing with everything.Way too awkward for me.I've told her that I'm busy and I'll text her when I find time but she justs keeps texting...I don't wanna seem rude.Is there a polite way to distance myself?Because there's no way I could tell her that I said it to have something in common and I don't care about him.The situation is weird as you can tell.Any advice?Please don't judge I know I AM DUMB LOL",14Jul2018,2
370,"Hello. First time redditor here. Long post coming hehe sorry. I'm posting because I have some self esteem issues that I don't really know how to overcome. You see, in high school I used to be the ''weird, lonely, nerdy girl''. I was very timid and I really cared about what others thought about me -I still kinda care-. I grew up watching different programs with the popular, beautiful girl, that ended being up prom queen. My person, being very vain, had always cared about that social status. Yet, back then, I didn't even manage to have a decent appearance, i.e: Bad teeth, glasses, etc. I know that our outside shouldn't define how we feel about ourselves, but in my case I couldn't really help it. To make it worse, I made some mistakes, such as dropping my grades, becoming a rebel and getting myself a bitch reputation.  Even after that,  I feel that I kept being weird. I went from weird to weird bitch; with bad grades and reputation. Long story short, I've grown up in age, I've taken more care of myself. I've managed to be more confident and sometimes, even a leader. I've managed to achieve this, partly, because ever since I entered college, I saw that as an opportunity to start from zero. To be myself, to be even quirky and not even care about what others thought of me. Yet, I feel that I still have confidence issues. You see, I live in a very small town, in which EVERYONE knows each other, and that single thought makes me feel like such a failure because I still feel that my past defines me. Better said, I still feel that others opinion DEFINE me. I'm a little bit terrified of my college peers hearing my name from my old peers, or persons I've known since little, because to me, in their heads, i'm a loser, and that thought makes me pity myself..  I even think that I feel like such a leader at college because I started being myself, and everyone elses approval gave me reassurance. I mean, if it were true confidence, if my college mates didn't really like me, I'd wouldn't feel affected, and I don't feel that would be the case, so that makes me think that I haven't reached a healthy self-love. My god, I didn't even used to be just weird at high school, I was also at church and everywhere else. How can I leave my past behind  me? Especially when I feel that I haven't really accomplished anything at my twenties. Other thing, I don't even have social media such as Instagram, so, being in a small town in which everyone keeps in touch via Instagram (Fb has grown old) I feel kind of like a ghost. Like I don't exist and I kind of just vanished from earth. I don't know if being more active socially via social media will make me more vain or more confident. Part of myself wants to put herself out there, to stop being a ghost. btw: sorry if I don't express myself clearly, english is not my first language haha. ",14Jul2018,1
371,"First a bit of background. This ex is my first love, we have known each other since high school. We were in quite a serious relationship for a number of years, then for various reasons (including cheating on his part) we ended up being on/off for a few more years. 

Eventually I removed myself from it completely which lasted around 3 years, no contact at all, then one day out the blue he sent me a message. That was around 2-3 years ago? 

It all started off very innocent and mature as we were both in better places and forgave each other for past mistakes. He’d been in a relationship for a while, I was single (still am). We were both happy for each other and where we’d ended up. 

He signed up to the armed forces and left to be stationed in another country. Got engaged late last year. We’ve kept in touch and met occasionally for dinner/coffee when he’s been home. 

Things started getting less innocent and on a couple of occasions things (read sex) happened. I called time on it when he got engaged and nothing happened for almost a year. Then yesterday he comes home and comes to see me before going elsewhere. We end up in bed together, he stays with me for a few hours after. Then today his fiancé is choosing her wedding dress. 

I feel so guilty, rightly so, as I know how devastated I was when he cheated on me and how poorly my mental health became as a result. I don’t want to do that to someone else.

I know I have to call time on it. But I don’t want to end it on a bad note as I do care for him and want him to be happy. But we can’t be just “friends” it always leads elsewhere, albeit slowly. He’s didn’t have a great start in life and I genuinely want him to marry this girl and enjoy what he’s got. Although due to other factors I don’t know if he’s capable of that, but would like to see him try. 

He’s come so far but somehow we always end up back together. I don’t think he’s ever been in a relationship where he hasn’t come back to me. It’s unfair on everyone, especially his fiancé. 

I suppose I’m just looking for a bit of reassurance that I’m doing the right thing and how to go about it? I know I’m in the wrong but want to make it right without ripping people apart. ",14Jul2018,0

373,"We rent my boyfriend’s childhood home from his parents, which means we kinda have to give up a lot of rights most renters have. They come over whenever they want and basically just complain at what we’re doing wrong.

I’m trying to not be ungrateful. But they’re absolutely obsessed with the wood floors and say I have to sweep them every day (two story house, all wood). I have a full time job plus small business, so little free time. Not to mention their expectations are totally sexist, they don’t demand boyfriend sweep daily.

So I’m wondering if this is a normal mindset and everyone sweeps their whole house daily? I mean it’s a FLOOR, it gets walked on. Why would you want a house you have to tiptoe around? Obv I want things kept clean too but this seems over the top.",14Jul2018,0
