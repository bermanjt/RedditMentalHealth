Male, 26, USA

I have a decent job, especially to work for a nonprofit. I write, edit, and implement all the email fundraising for the organization as well as maintain and curate all the website content. About a year and a half ago, they added on social media strategy and reporting (thankfully someone else does the actual posting) and supervising the customer service team. At the time, customer service was a new department, and I was tasked with improving the team essentially from scratch. Additionally, they placed me on the department's leadership team. My commitments doubled at least.

On three separate occasions, I have formally expressed concern about my workload. Each time, I was encouraged to keep trying because they believed I could manage. Ultimately, I began making small mistakes, many of which were fixable and no harm was done. Still, I felt bad and again suggested that I wasn't able to fully devote my time to one job. 

Instead of being helped, I have now been written up twice (the next time will result in termination). The first time, I was written up for what amounted to a file of every mistake I had made in that job for the past two years--even ones that had been resolved or were not entirely my fault. 

Today, I was written up because my employee claimed I never showed her how to work her voicemail inbox and told her it wasn't important--claims that I insisted to my manager were untrue. 

My manager also does not fully understand what I do or how to do it, so she makes assumptions on what is my fault and what isn't and relies on other coworkers to tell her when I have made a mistake. 

I have already decided to find another job, and I've applied to several places, but the job market is slim in my area, and the turnaround time is slow. 

With the knowledge that this is a very ""Reader's Digest"" version of the story, and an outsider can't grasp all the nuances, I have a few questions:

1) Am I crazy, or do these seem like unreasonably stressful working conditions?

2) Is there something I can do to make my job bearable until I find something else?

3) Do I quit and get out before I get fired, or do I wait for them to fire me to draw unemployment? (I have never been fired. I don't know how that looks to future employers, nor do I know how unemployment works.)

Thanks for any help you can provide. (PS: I'm still a reddit newbie, so if I've made any mistakes, please kindly let me know. Thank you!)

TLDR: Job sucks an unreasonable amount, and my manager is writing me up inappropriately. What do I do?",22Mar2018,2
1,"So let me give you some background.

I'm a (24/f) graphic designer and I love with my mom and my grandmother(65). Me and my mom stay in the apartment upstairs while my grandmother stays in the apartment below us and we as a whole family own the building we're staying in. 

So up until about 10months ago or so we were a one household family. My grandmother bought herself a new car so me and my mom could basically share her old one. Because my mom works odd hours she mostly has the car . 

Idk if it's because I still live at home but for the most part I'm still treated as a child. Whenever I go out it's a struggle mostly to go through my grandmother . And it's mainly bc she worries so much to the point where it stresses everyone else out. She waits until I go home to finally go to sleep and sometimes that's not until 4-5am. And it's even worse whenever I ask for the car.. if I ask to go somewhere with it she has a fit. The only place she's comfortable with me going to is work or school. If I tell her I'm going there it's no problem.

Well currently I'm on a gap year and I'm working for a financial agency making flyers and whatnot for them. Like I said my mom has weird hours so my grandmother has been taking me to and fro . I make sure to thank her and let her know how appreciative I am of her doing this ALL the time. 

Now let me note she hates driving around when it's not really for her purposes like she hates going. To more than one place. She tries to get everything she can at one store. Cool not a problem with me most days bc I hardly need to buy stuff anyways.

So earlier today we're at our super market and my grandmother is getting dinner. She has just picked me up and while she was waiting for her number to be called I asked if she could take me to subway (bc I hadn't eaten all day and dinner was gonna take a while) literally on our way home and she wouldn't technically be going out of her way. So she huffs and puffs like she has a attitude and says yeah I lll take you . That's when I said to myself I shouldn't have asked. So I said I'll go look around the store for something here. I didn't want anything in the store. So I join her in line and now I'm a bit upset because I HATE feeling like burden. And she says you mad ? And I say nah I just wish I had my own car so I can go where I want when I want so I don't have to ask other people for help or be burden on people. And I feel like that already now. So we pay and get in the car she ends up driving to subway but I don't get out I've lost my appetite for it and I just honestly want to go home. 

So then she burst out and goes on about how she's tired and she tries so fucking hard and all this stuff and I'm just like yup tell me how you really feel about me. And she calls me unappreciative and all this other shit. I JUST DONT WANT TO BE BURDEN ON HER. (My grandmother has a gambling problem) so the other day she wanted to go to the casino but couldn't because she had to take me to work. Ive stayed home because she wanted to go to the fucking casino . I brought that up and she says I just want one day. Let me tell you guys all fucking last week she went to the casino and asked me for 40$ . Anyways she keeps going on and on and I'm trying not to get too upset because I don't want to be disrespectful so I try getting out so I can walk home but she stops me. We finally get home I bring her groceries in and don't say a word to her and go upstairs.

I just don't know what to say to her  . And maybe I shouldn't have said that because she said it hurt her feelings but it sucks I can't do what I want / go where I want / run errands when I need to . I stay in the house all the time mostly bc I don't like asking my friends for rides bc their busy with their own shit but I hate having to go through bullshit when I wanna go out.she texts me constantly when I'm out if I'm ok and while it's cool she's just checking in I'm also not fucking 16, my mom doesn't check up on me as much as she does I'm just tired of it. The simple solution would yes to be to save up money for a car but I'm also trying to pay off a bit of my tuition while I'm not in school.   

Idk sorry it's so long guys. can anyone give me any advice ?",22Mar2018,2

4,"Hey everyone!

Straight to the point: for college, I have two (?) viable options.


1) Stay where I am and attend college 30 minutes to an hour away from my family. 


2) Move back home, take a gap year while living there so I can get in-state tuition. About 1200 miles from where I live right now.


I moved away from my home of 5 years about 9 months ago. I hate it here, I feel unwelcome and the people here make sure it stays that way. However, tuition prices here are pretty low, and if I were to attend college locally while working the same hours I already do, I should have minimal to no debt. But then again, my mental health has suffered drastically here and I'm not sure what the future holds. :( 


My other option is a bit harder, but I feel I would be happier overall. I feel welcome where I used to live, and a lot of people I love still live there. It is more expensive, and I'm sure that, by taking a year to become a state resident eligible for in-state prices, I would sacrifice some of my scholarship opportunities. (There's no way I could just take the out of state prices, I've run like three simulations and was in major debt in all of them).


Thanks in advance for any advice! One year to get my shit together and counting down.

10,"So junior year has been an absolute accident for me-- I got into my first real relationship and got out of it two months later, causing the biggest breakdown of my life, I lost my best friends, and my grades are in a shape that won't put me in college. I've been thinking through my options, but wanted to know more about my options. If I go overseas to an international school (in Korea) will I be able to redo 11th grade? I've had friends who have moved from Korea to the US and they told me that an entire grade was left off of their transcript. If I drop out of school right now and apply to another school next year for 11th grade, will this year's transcript still be shown to colleges? Any help is appreciated thank you ^^",22Mar2018,2
11,"I feel empty every single day. Every day I am inside, I am doing nothing with my life, the skills I am learning are pointless and theres no real end goal to them other than to pass the time. I game for around 4-5 hours a day, just to pass the time. If I am not gaming, I am reading, or eating, or sleeping. I might spend about an hour a day jerking off or something as well. Over all, my days are empty and depressing and I am not happy with it. I am 19 and still live with my parents, they wants me to go to college or to start a business. But I don't want to go to college and get debt and get locked down with a job. 

What I really want to do is explore the world. But everyone around me says the world is extremely dangerous and that I should stay were I am and get a career. I barely have any friends at all, literally talk to two people max after I graduated high school. I think about suicide every single day because every time I think of a plan or something I want to do it gets ripped apart making me think there's no hope at all for me living a life better than this one. I actually bought a rope to hang myself last week but instead took four shots of whiskey and passed out on my couch. My depression completely comes from my extreme dissatisfaction with life and loneliness. I do not need to get a therapist unless a therapist can somehow make me feel happy about wasting literally the best years of my life in doors scared of the outside world with no friends and no social life and no hobbies or goals or likeable jobs or life experiences. Just studying and gaming and porn and thats it. This isn't living. 

Anyone have any advice for what I should do? What I should work towards? ",22Mar2018,2

13,"So there’s this kid in my grade named Chris who is the most cocky person I have ever met. He’s extremely annoying and nearly everyone at our school who knows him, hates him. 

One day during a pep rally, Chris decided to throw one of those paper ninja starts at me for whatever reason (I’m assuming it’s because he heard from someone else that I said he was annoying) and it hits me in the face. I yelled at him from the top of the bleachers that I was going to “beat the ever loving shit out of you.” Before I just didn’t like him because he was a dickhead but now I absolutely despise him. Chris will talk shit about me and will say he would fight me and kick the shit out of me, but what I don’t understand is that he is super skinny, while I am on the schools rowing team, so I’m like visibly bigger than him. 

It’s not too hard to tell I would kick the shit out of him in a fight because on top of me being purely larger than him, I did 9 years of Brazilian Ju Jitsu. I don’t tell anyone that, which gives me benefit of the doubt in most cases. He always says he wants to fight me but I kinda stay away from him when I see him in the halls because I know anything he says is gonna get me wound up and want to beat the shit out of him right there, and I can’t do that. I keep telling him to fuck off when he wants to fight me because I am almost certain that I can and will accidentally kill him. I know how to break any limb in someone’s body with my bare hands and I’m afraid I’ll like snap his neck or something. I’ve never gotten in a real fight so far but I have a game plan if I do, which is take them down and get on top and start pounding away, and if that doesn’t work go for an arm bar or other arm breaking move. I am also afraid that if I slammed him into the ground he would hit his back so hard on the ground that it’ll like break his spine or something and he’d be paralyzed. Believe me, I’m totally fine paralyzing this dumb twig but I am positive I would like to to jail or worse. 

What do I do and how do I get him to fuck off and stop talking shit and all that good stuff, without killing him? ",22Mar2018,2

15,"So I am two months into an assistant manager position for a leasing company and I genuinely enjoy my position and office. However in those two months I have haven’t had a manager or a maintenance supervisor or leasing agents. It’s pretty much been me and my regional manager which has recently become both stressful and difficult. I have been wearing all those hats for the past month and last week I finally had a mental breakdown. I’ve been working six days a week and failing miserably at completing a task in any of those given positions. We have had people come stand in at the property from other properties. So I have had five different managers... meaning, I had five different people telling me why I should do it their way and all their ways were different. I was only trained to do what is expected of me for my position and everything else I taught myself. There is a lot that I don’t know that I don’t know on top of having five people constantly correcting me. The agents that stood in vary in skill and time with the company but none above a year. 

That was the context but now is the situation. 

Our corporate office sent two women from another region to get us up to speed and help out. The moment they came in they said we’re changing everything. In less than a day they realized how drastically different our property was from their property and they looked shell shocked from the work load. However they have been flinging criticisms at everyone including our regional. They also did that in front of us.. her staff which was so unprofessional and discouraging.

After that my brain went from we can fix this to fuck this I’m burnt out.

I don’t want to see our property fail. I have dedicated two months , six days a week, and without proper training, to be the best possible middle manager I could be but I can tell I’m being singled out. We’re under a microscope and no one can perform that way. It seems that the ladies from corporate believe that I and my regional are the problem when we are the only reason our property hasn’t failed. We’re still leasing and meeting area expectations but as a flagship property, we’re underperforming. My new leasing agent staff and my maintenance staff were told I’m not their boss by these women and it completely undermined my ability to manage them. I cannot gain that respect back from them because I lack the experience with the company.

I don’t know what to do. I can’t enter that building again, put on a fake smile, or give a shit about its success now that I and my regional are being scrutinized when we never had a staff to begin with... We still don’t. 

This was an opportunity for me to show my skills with stress management and managing people and I failed. My last company I turned around our staff and customer service within a year. I have allowed there lack of full time staff or proper standard operating procedures and policies to turn me into a ball of stress. I went from being the “professional fake happy” to barely being able to hide my contempt. 

I feel like I’m very close to being fired and I’m very stressed out about it. I truly like the profession and felt so blessed to be given the opportunity with this company. I struggled finding a job having moved for my SO.

I don’t know what do to. I spoke to my regional but she is not providing a perspective or advice as to how to be better. She’s in the same boat and her authority has been undermined as well. 

I spoke with my SO and he said he’s not sure what I should do. It’s stressing him out because he’s worried I’ll be unemployed again. 

I need advice before I get myself fired for not be happy at work about how shitty it is there.

Someone help! Please! I want to succeed and see the office flourish.

TL;DR: for various reasons I think I’m on the verge of being fired. Partly because I’m failing at dealing with stress while still being a positive influence in my office and partly because my company has set me up for failure. What should I do to fix it?",22Mar2018,3
16,"Okay, so I'm kind of embarrassed about this but I can explain. I have a credit score of 589. I had some medical bills from 2015 that were so severely mishandled by my insurance company that they ended up in collections until just recently, when I was finally able to have all but one of them (whose balance is less than $1,000) removed from my credit report. I've been incredibly lucky to be employed with a company where I'm actually doing legitimately reputable work for nearly a year now, and I want to start trying to rebuild my credit.

27,"More details: He is a famous photographer with several published books, social media followers in the millions, and has worked for several large media outlets. He is in his late 50s, married, with children. 

I know for a fact that he pressures young and naive models into sex by offering them career advancement, guaranteed publication of their photos, free vacations, and pay through fake job positions as his ""assistant"". 


I know for certain he has done this with multiple girls, one when she was 18, and another in her 20s. I can also prove this through documentation (texts/emails). I believe he has done this with many more girls, but I only have verbal testimony for that. I am also worried because he frequently works with models aged 13-17, in a similar capacity to the girls he has carried on a sexual relationship with (publishes their photo in his books). 

As far as his wife and family are concerned, I only bring it up because he uses them to paint a portrait of himself as a ""family man"". Both his website and books go on at length about how important his wife is to him, and to his career. 

I have considered speaking to a reporter, but I know that this will destroy his family life and possibly his career. I also think he is doing what Harvey Weinstein and so many others have done to take advantage of young women, and deserves to have those things happen to him. 

Basically, I want to know how I should handle this, and what media outlet might be best to contact with my information?

EDIT: I should also say, this might destroy my personal relationship with one of the girls he has done this to. Despite hating him, and knowing that what he is doing is wrong, she has urged me not to speak about this. I briefly considered contacting his wife, and she told me never to do that. It might also hurt her career moving forward if her name were to come out somehow. The messages I have are between him and her, and I don't know if a reporter will hold back her name or not.

42,"So I've been trying to move from Florida to Boston for about a year. I'm an engineer and don't want to leave before having another job lined up. My gf went ahead and moved up there for school so we've been making the long distance thing work. 

A few weeks ago i get a call about a job. I fly up, interview, it goes ok. They request a second interview. That's where the past week starts. 

The morning of the second interview (Friday)  i learn of a friends death. I suck it up, go to the interview it goes well.

 After the interview i learn another friend was rushed to the hospital. He has a liver disease and it was failing. Over the weekend he got a transplant and so far is doing ok. 

Monday i get a call, they want to offer the position. They low balled the salary, and could tell i noticed. (It was 25k lower than the posting) i expected it to be lower than the posting but not that extreme. 

Today i get a call that they are recanting the offer. They never sent any paperwork, but i told friends i got the job. 

My boss knew i had the interview, and is expecting me to leave. I work for a small company so i can tell he isn't giving me assignments because he thinks I'm gone. Honestly the position is killing me and i want to move. But now I have no job. My boss is ready to get rid of me. And i have no good direction to move in.

45,"I'm a high school senior girl and I am very excited to graduate high school. My last two years of high school have not been very great. Recently, I have stopped talking or reduced contact with several of my closest ""friends"" because they kind of bullied me and mistreated me or were just toxic. I still have other friends, just ones that I'm not as close with. 
 
I'm just not in the mood for prom. Going to school each day makes me so anxious because I have to see my old ""friends"", I just don't really want to see them outside of school. In addition, one of my friends is dating my ex whom I still have feelings for; I REALLY don't want to see that either (it's just really tough for me). It's also pretty expensive. I've been to homecoming and sadie's before and honestly it was just okay. I also don't really have a close group of friends to go with.

On the other hand, I really enjoy dressing up and I want to buy a pretty prom dress and wear it. My friend who attended prom last year said she loved the experience and encourages me to go. I'm sure some of my other friends would be kind enough to let me join their group. My parents want me to go to prom; that being said they are very strict and would probably be very strict about which people they would allow me to go to prom with.

Recently, I have been learning gesture drawing along with deep learning of anatomy and it’s almost like I’m starting over again. I’m now unable to keep up with proportions like I used too, and the gesture drawings were alright early on, but after learning a little anatomy I can barely do them.

48,"Hi, I'm new to reddit and made this throw away to get some outside advice on my situation. I'm sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place. (Repost because it got locked on ""needadvice"" for unknown reasons)

So here's the background to better understand my situation. I'm a 21M in college. I have a full time office job that pays pennies($10/hr) and I live with my single mother and my younger sister. My family is low income and quite dysfunctional. There isn't intense abuse or anything like that. We just don't love each other(Save for my younger sister, bless her naive heart). Everyone in my family is just distant(I do have a father and an older sister who do not live with us.)

For the most part, the dysfunction found in my family all stems from my mother. Short and simple, she's stubborn, reckless, mean, and very prideful. She's been like this for however old she is and at this point I feel like there really isn't any helping her change. Truthfully i think the issue comes from her never truly wanting to be a mother; though she's never said anything like that.

The situation. My mother, in a fit of her typical recklessness has decided to move out. This idea started initially with news that the company she works for is expanding in another state and was opening higher positions. The rest isn't too complicated. She called me and my two sisters to meet together in the living room, and proclaimed. ""I am not renewing the lease on this apt, as I'm going to move to(other state). (to my younger sister)-You'll be coming with me, unless we can figure out a way you can stay and finish your high school."" (To my older sister)-If you can help in anyway, thanks. (To me)-Lease is up in june, figure it out.

and no i am not some bum/terrible son for her to do this, or speak to me this way. That's just how she is. In her words actually, I'm the pride of the family.

This was a few weeks ago. the situation now is

As I kinda expected(I've dealt with her spontaneous idea before), the job expansion thing didn't work out for my mother. Company is taking forever, position is different blah blah blah. But she still is too stubborn to keep the apt. rn she's thinking of a way to send my lil sis off with my big sis, while she is essentially homless doing idk what and Idrc tbh. I just know she's headed to a place I don't want to be.

This was my move- I applied and am applying for a bunch of higher paying jobs(entry level $14/hr stuff cause I'm not qualified for much else) in the next town over.Why? cause I currently live in the city which is WAAAYYY too expensive and alot of my friends are in the next town(It's also much much much cheaper to live there). My plan is to get the job, live on the couch at my friend's place for about a month(they offered and are great people), get an apartment in the area, and try to pull myself together.

More details that are kinda important- I don't want to quit school at any point. I'm about to finish my associates though that won't do much for me in terms of getting a better job.

I'm attending a community college so I don't have major related internships/experience/job opportunities.

I have 3yrs of experience of just call center/office crap which is why I can't climb to any real higher pay. (I started working full time while in highschool)

I have a (kinda nice)car I still owe payments on(under my name).important cause I don't think i can move into a bad hood driving a car like that. Also it's modified, so selling it is out the window.

I have a cat of 1yr I absolutely will not abandon.

My credit is recently established and pretty much trash.

I would like to save my little sister from this situation though I understand I might have to leave her behind for a bit.

Roomates are unlikely cause all my friends are happy,well off people who have no reason to move in with me. Though they think it would be fun.

-ADVICE- So that's where I'm at. And I'm curious if any of you kind souls could give me some advice on whether or not I'm making the right move? Maybe you see or understanding something I don't that could help my situation? I'm scared of becoming homeless or something. I could probably get my father to co-sign an apt. but that's about it. I'm pretty sure I'd be living paycheck to paycheck.

Sorry if this is scattered and has bad spelling ect. I'm at work and rushing through this.

-every since i was very young, like second or third grade, maybe even younger, ive had involuntary thoughts. I know theyre normal, but like sexual ones, even in second grade. Like my brain would think about climbing onto a middle-aged man who was in the same room as me and start making out with him. things like that. It is very embarrassing to admit, but ive had thoughts like that since 8 or 9 and even younger. eventually it was not only sexual, but violent. Like my brain would force a thought of me being raped. or me stabbing someone, or stomping on a childs head, or putting my head under the wheel of a car and having it be crushed, etc.(although i was in fifth grade when i first started saying how i didnt want to live anymore, i dont think i was fully aware of the idea of suicide then. but now i am suicidal and have struggled with self harm, etc.)
-i always feel like someone can see me through the other side of my mirror. like i know its delusional, but im sort of aware its not true? but i feel it every time im in a mirror.

50," I'm not sure it's a pyramid scheme, but definitely too good to be true, so probably some type of scam. I ran into a guy today who was super friendly and tried to recruit me for a job. I went to the office and everyone was creepy friendly. It was essentially a sales pitch. I guess they're some kind of financial planning company. They were keen to establish that im unemployed. I felt like I was being targeted. 

They talked about how I could help people save money and invest the savings into a particular mutual fund. They also talked about the benefits of recruiting others. There's a seminar type thing tomorrow and I'm going. I have no intention of getting swindled. 

I'm sure it's a scam. I'm not knowledgeable enough to demonstrate this, but I want to expose it in a way they can't effectively refute.

Right now, I feel defeated and isolated.. I genuinely thought I studied and prepared well for this midterm as I did the homework problems repeatedly (though never perfect) alone, before asking my professor for questions or looking at the solutions manual. Though I have to admit, there were many concepts from the test that I skimmed over thinking it wouldn't be on the midterm. I did well on most of my accounting courses except this one, which I'm retaking for the second time. There's the pressure of passing or else there are terrible consequences such as probation or graduating a year behind.

I work two part time jobs (about 25-30) but because of this I have to quit one of them, taking 4 courses, as well as two leadership roles for two separate school clubs (about 20-30 hours per week).

* 46% - 35% midterm
* N/A - 15% case study

3. Her parents are divorced at the age at which it started 9, which is how it escaped the mother's attention as it occurred when she was visiting him.

From what I understand, and what little she remembers or is willing or able to share it began with sleeping in bed together, then moved to fondling in her sleep. I am not sure how far it escalated and I don't want to press her for more information as up until now this was a repressed memory and she is very understandably fragile.

She never told anyone as her father would pick up knives and blades and threaten to kill her if she told anyone.

Here is where I need help. I am not equipped to deal with something like this. I am in no way shirking my duties to my woman, but I am aware when I am in over my head. My initial and lasting emotion is anger to the one man she should have been able to trust. My plan of action doesn't get past me driving to his house with some vigilante type justice in mind.

Her mother doesn't know
Her brother doesn't know 

No one knows but me. 

How do I help?
Do I tell her mother? (They have a good relationship and I have one with her mother as well)
It has been more than a decade since it began, but less than a decade since it ended. Should I tell her to go after him in a legal manner?

Feeling a little lost, and don't know where to turn as I can very well just go to friends and family with this.

Any and all help appreciated.

83,"As a (young) person, money is always a problem. I'm currently a design student and I need to take classes over the summer, but I also need a job. I'd probably be stuck with minimum wage anywhere willing to hire me with such little experience, alternatively I can sell art.

Is this a marketable skill?  I've sold pieces to people in the past, but I don't know how to market myself enough to profit. I'm prepared to do the work, but I'm also afraid this is a bad idea and that I'd be better off working a normal minimum wage job.

85,"Where to start really, brief run down... 

So recently found out my girlfriend had been cheating on me... Fine the relationship ended done and dusted haven't spoken to her since.

 1 month and 3 weeks later...

But today I received an inbox from an infuriated male, insisting that I don't contact her anymore, what left me slightly confused as I hadnt even considered even talking to her I wanted nothing to do with her, I resolved the situation with him and told him all the shit she had done to me and what abuse to expect when being with her , here's a few examples  mental abuse, she used to hit me, call me every name under the sun and tell me I am shit boyfriend (there's more but don't want to get into it), even though she was talking to loads of boys and even posted nudes online... I know classy (no you cant have the link) but the male told me everything she had said about me and alot of false accusations where made against me and he said that he had to kick her out the car because she was acting weird...

So he told me what she had said about me and pretty much switched roles and claimed that I did everything to her that she did to me...

Now I really don't like her and I would rather not have any contact with her, I should also mention our relationship was 3 years long, but when I first got with her she didn't seem that mentally well but she seemed to come around, but after our break up things with her sound really low and she really isn't mentally well in the slightest so she's using other men as a rebound what I really couldn't care less about,  I just think she needs some professional help.

Mental illness does run in her family, some members of her family committed suicide and I wouldn't want her to follow the same path.

So the question is people should I give one of her family members a message and at least let someone know that she's in a rough patch, I don't want to be with her I just want to know she's okay and isn't causing herself or anyone else pain.

Thank you for taking the time to read this the ones who do much love and respect.

86,"There’s this one girl from my drama class last year who I really had eyes for. We’d flirt a lot and we’d hang out a ton during that time and it was pretty awesome. Since I’ve graduated I haven’t really seen her, until last week when I went to my bros play. When I saw her afterwards she was acting like she did last year, maybe even better. She was hugging me and laying on me, basically just touched me a ton, and when I was about to leave she gave me a super long hug and a few compliments that would make Thor Blush 😉 and when I got home she texted me a Snapchat asking for my number. I gave it to her and haven’t heard for her in 5 days though.  I honestly have great game but it’s hard for me to like you that way if ya know what I mean, so From anyone’s experience is it worth having hopes? ",22Mar2018,1
87,"""Just ignore him"" is really easy to say but it's not easy ignoring someone you constantly have to work and communicate with.

We'll call him Dave. When I (26/F) first met Dave (29/M), he seemed like a very quiet and sweet guy. Everyone loves him and he's just known for being a genuinely good guy.

My older coworker Carla (56/F) and I have noticed that he has grown extremely arrogant in the past year and it's starting to really bother us.

Some things that Dave has done/still does that gets on my nerves:

* One time we were discussing the very first crew who worked at the shop we currently work in. Apparently it was a bad crew except for a small few and he word for word says ""Yeah, things didn't get good around here until I started working."" He wasn't joking. That bothered me a little bit because there are two other people that worked here before him who do just as much as a fine job as him, and it almost felt like he was discrediting them.
* Dave and I both sing in a choir outside of work. We have a regular customer that went to one of our concerts and decided to come in one day while we were working and gave us each $25 and said we sung beautifully. (We had a small duet). When we were alone I commented on how unordinary and generous that was and he goes ""Welcome to coffee"". For some reason he thought this gesture was a tip for his customer service.. (Dave runs the coffee side). It made me laugh a little because she never orders coffee.
* I don't know if Dave realizes it, but if you're having a discussion with him and you state an opinion or make a comment, he'll pretty much invalidate it with ""It's not so much that, as it is [....]""
* When you explain something to him, inform him of something, it's always ""Oh, I figured.""
* The biggest, and most inappropriate thing that pissed me off was a comment he made at our holiday work party. Two years ago at a separate holiday party I got super drunk and gave Dave a pep talk about how he's such an awesome guy and that he deserves a good girl. I mistakenly in my drunk stupor told him ""Oh I would totally give you a chance if I were single!"" even though it isn't true. I actually had a crush on his brother when I first began working. Later that night when we left the holiday party we were walking to our cars. It was my boyfriend, our coworker Melanie, Dave, and I. I was extremely drunk and ran into a pole and drifted off with Dave for one second because I thought he was my boyfriend. I don't know if he got a false sense of confidence for the pep talk, but *three* times he has made a comment about how I drifted off with him and how I was ""trying to follow him to his car"". At the latest holiday party it was the third time bringing it up, and right in front of my boyfriend, he words it ""You were trying to follow me to my car, not your boyfriend"". My stomach dropped and Carla (57/F) and I just looked at eachother like WTF?? Later that night my boyfriend commented on how weird that was. I said ""Trust me, I know. This is the third time he's said that and it's really inappropriate"". My best friend thinks I should have called him out right then and been like ""Trust me Dave, I was nooot trying to go home with you"", (Dave isn't the most attractive guy) but I'm not confrontational like that.

Those are the main things I can think of right now, but there have been other instances where he has made small jabs like that. He started dating a girl in the summer time and I'm happy for him, but Carla and I have noticed that his ego has exploded. I don't know if it's from finally getting laid or if he's just growing more confident, but it's getting really annoying. I'm quiet and awkward around him now because I genuinely don't really like being around him anymore.

He's the opener and I have to work with him almost every single day. I feel like I'm going to explode on him one day. How do you deal with someone this arrogant and cocky?",22Mar2018,2

My grades are half assed at best, I barely complete projects on time, and I’m woefully irresponsible. The pressure I receive sends me into a recessive fit of depression where I repress my guilt by staying up all night playing video games. I’m unproductive the next day and set myself up for failure, but it’s so hard to stop myself.

My girlfriend enables this behavior sometimes and while she tries to help me out of these holes I sink into, sometimes she helps me dig myself deeper. I don’t know how to help myself anymore, and I feel like I’m going to fail as a student and disappoint everyone.

So I'm a freshman in college and have been struggling to make connections and friends. 

I have a core group of 3-4 friends I see regularly (hometown), but my college experience has been so lackluster.

All the kids I went to high school with look like they're always at enormous parties every damn night, and have met so many new people. I haven't been to a single party or gathering.

My core group only hangs to smoke and barely hit me up these days...

I have pretty much no real friends on campus and I want this to change. I never put in the effort but it feels so foreign and hard to me.

I'm not shy I just don't usually talk to random people out of nowhere.

99,"^^^that should say “year and a half” 

(Throwaway account) I apologize for any typos - advice request is at the bottom 

So, this is a story about me, my SO, my SO’s ex, and my SO’s exes friend. We are in high school on the west coast. 

It all began with music, and what basically happened was I won award at a music festival our HS was participating at. At the time, my SO’s exes friend, who we’ll call Richard for the time being - was evidently not happy that I won the award. He is a year older than me, and auditions were coming up soon, so he didn’t want to be bested by someone younger. So on the bus ride home, he starts being really condescending about auditions, saying that I should switch instruments because I have no chance getting the spot we were both gunning for. Along with this, he said stuff like “Don’t ever try, you don’t have a chance.” At the time, I didn’t know why he was being like this, and it genuinely made me sad to be talked down to so severely. This occurred for the whole bus ride, and time passed on. 

Now a few months or so have passed, and auditions have rolled around. To cut to the chase, I beat him for the spot in the concert band that we both wanted. He actually was asked to switch instruments because of his low score on his audition. Upon hearing this, I was happy, because my hard work and practice had paid off. But things with Richard got worse. He started talking sh*t about me behind my back, to basically everyone. I didn’t antagonize him at all, not beforehand, and not then. This also made me genuinely sad because he was just acting like a jerk to me because I beat him in auditions. (He is someone with a very big ego) 

Fast forward several months - it’s a new school year, and everyone is a grade higher, etc. I start talking to this girl and we become close, but she is already dating someone, for almost two years. But this relationship, according to her, was getting stale and it was losing its romance. (Both her and her ex are a year older than me.) eventually, she breaks up with him to date me, because she revealed feelings for me while she was still dating him. This was wrong on her part, but she can be impatient sometimes, but it still isn’t fair to the ex. We’ll call the ex Mark. So mark eventually finds out and basically ignores both me and her, while talking sh*t behind our backs. 

But the worst part is, Mark and Richard are best friends, and they have been, for a while.

So now Mark and Richard are having loads of fun being tools by trying to find any chance to be a jerk to either me or my SO.  Later on, I’m in class with richard’s SO, and we’re talking. The conversation starts entering the region of sex, and I recall a time where Richard said he had done stuff with the SO. The SO freaks out, Texas him, and apparently the relationship was on the verge of being no more. So this obviously makes Richard super angry , at me. While I do admit that I was in the wrong for telling personal info, Richard did say this in front of multiple people. 

So This has been going on for a while now, Mark and Richard are jerks and Mark basically ignores the last relationship with my SO, which made my SO sad. So she contacts him through text, and tries to make peace out of all the sh*t talking. (This whole time, me and SO have truly been the bigger people, whether it be ignoring their insults or just not doing anything back). He responds by basically cussing her out, and claiming it was her fault for the relationship becoming stale. But my SO has revealed that he would often make her cry with just his words, and that we was only really nice to her, and jerk to everyone else. She admits that she didn’t want to believe that someone she thought was sweet and nice could be so mean and horrible. 

So my question for advice is, how do I make peace again? And am I the one in the wrong? 

PS - auditions for the next year came up - and I bested Richard again.

104,"Back in 2010, I met a girl at a summer camp program for exceptionally nerdy high school students, and we quickly became friends.  We became more than friends, but then her parents stepped in and made her cut me out of her life.  She talked with me in secret but they found out about that too, and then she moved to another state to go to our nation's best public school.  I got in trouble for writing a book for her and her mom threatened police action.  This was about 7-8 years ago.

In these past 7-8 years, I feel so empty having had this really strong friendship/relationship be taken away from me.  I've tried every few months for all these years to search her name and even paid for public records searches.  It just gives me vague information that I already knew from our relationship.  

I really miss her, but I can't get any closure not even knowing what happened.  I think she changed her name.  It's a very unhealthy cycle for me to go into another relationship and then abandon it thinking that this person was my soulmate.

What should I do? Private investigator?

What bullshit then after i found that out my exs dad got arrested and now the police came to my house for some reason and my mother took her in from the cops NOW SHE IS LIVING AT MY HOUSE

anyways she is a complete bitch to me and she thinks its funny she can get away with this and she even told me and it makes my blood boil she even owes me 200 dollars complete utter bullshit i talked to my mom and she said she does not care about my opinion she has no where else to go ( after what she did to me you'd think my mother would be upset over what she did to her son but i guess not)

Anyways 5 months since shes lived her and im done ive tried 3 separate times to get her out my mom just doesn't care so today i took things into my own hands and called her out and everyone started hating her for it and she has no friends anymore because of what i said because everyone agrees she a terrible person but now i still cant get her out

My First Idea
This is the part where i need help i need her out this shit is making me so mad to a point im about ready to pay a girl off to beat the shit out of her (personally think thats a bad idea) but anyways every month she has this social worker come to our house and my mom and her talk to worker about living situations and stuff but what i was thinking is a tell this social worker all the things she has done how she makes my home unsafe il make up some bullshit that is the one option i was thinking of.


My Second Idea
Her dad is out of jail now and i was going to try and contact him saying something like ""your daughter is making my home living hell how can we work together"" (hes trying to get her custody back anyways my mom has custody now or is trying to keep it that way) but ask him what can i do to help you win this case

113,"This will sound cocky but I've never really struggled with a class before. Basically for all four years of university I have coasted along, procrastinating, doing things at the last minute and still doing well (3.4 GPA, not amazing, but pretty good for the effort I've put in). As a result I have some terrible work ethic.


On top of this crap work ethic, I've struggled with addiction issues, mental health issues. relationship issues, being booted out of my home...But at the same time I know that these aren't excuses for my lazy behaviour and I know that I'm still very privileged in other ways (like being able to go to university) so I don't really feel like I can blame my failure on entirely on personal hardship - and of course others have suffered way more than I have.


All this is to say that I have really fucked on up on this one CS course. As in my average right now is probably teetering somewhere around 30. For assignment 1 I got 37.5 per cent where the class average was 84 per cent. For assignment 2 I got 16 per cent (!!!) where the class average was 61 per cent. Now the thing is, the weighting of these assignments is actually pretty light meaning I would just have to get a 60 per cent in every thing else to pass with a 51. This seemed doable but after taking to a friend in CS, he explained that the latest assignment is much harder than the other ones I bombed and that the fourth assignment will be even harder than that. Further, he emphasized that since the midterm was easy (haven't received marks yet, but basically everyone was leaving early) and the class average on assignment 1 was so high that the exam would likely be very hard to drag down the average. He also politely told me that I was probably screwed for assignment 3 based on my past performance and understanding of the course concepts. And pass or fail, this course will almost definitely be a GPA hit, which could matter if I ever decide I want to go to Grad school. 



This has all made me think that I should drop the damn course. But I can't help but feel like a failure if I do so. I'll be wasting more of my parent's money next year to take another course to fill in the missing credit and more importantly it's my own damn fault for letting this situation get to this point. I can just imagine the disappointment in my dad's eyes when he sees that I've failed him again and our relationship hasn't exactly been stable since my transition. I can literally hear his voice in my head yelling at me and telling me that I'm a failure, lazy, always wasting time with video games and my friends. And truthfully I agree. He struggled for so long to move to this country and create a future for me and I've just fucking wasted it like a brat at every opportunity. I want to push through and struggle because I hate feeling like this disappointment of a child but I don't know if I can handle the course and my friends are telling me to drop it.

I am worried that following through with this could lose the one friend I have going to my college. I value and don't want to lose a friendship like this that I have been wanting for years, but I also want to quench my loneliness and social anxiety by stopping to live in the 'what if'.  What do I do? I am so torn. I have never really talked to my friends about stuff like this and I don't necessarily let them into my life and open up very often due to my fear of intimacy. Sadly I feel like the only person I could talk to this about is the person I want to ask. Help. Please.",22Mar2018,3
118,"I recently made a joke to my sister, where I pointed to a bottle of extra virgin oil, and I claimed that was me. Though she shook her head, and said she was more a virgin than me; saying that I wasn’t because of something that went down with an ex of mine a year or so ago. Long story short, I was forced to do something I didn’t want to, by apparently giving mixed signals. In fact, it turned me away from men entirely. I never thought of it this way, and it’s been bothering me ever since she said it. 

I feel like a bit of me was stripped away that day now, that I’m no longer in that state of innocence. That somehow I’m less pure because of this, and I’m disgusted with myself. 

Am I really soiled because of something I didn’t want to do, but did anyway? ",22Mar2018,2
119,"My crush on this girl started in the latter part of my senior year in high school. She attends college in New York, while I attend school in Buffalo. Throughout my first semester in college, I went through a pretty turbulent time in adjusting being so far from home. I found a lot of comfort in talking to her throughout the semester. Nothing serious to be honest, we only chatted through messenger and all of the conversations we had were very friendly. I'm afraid that she completely sees me as a friend. Tomorrow I am having dinner with her, under the pretence of catching up. I have been contemplating for days whether or not to confess my feelings to her. The only thing that is holding me back is the fact that she might be taken completely aback by my confession of my feelings for her. There are also a lot of things that I'm worried about too. What if I am nothing but just a friend to her? What if she says it won't work out because we are too far apart? All of these questions have just been spinning around my head for so long, and I am really conflicted. Some insight from someone else perspective would be greatly appreciated!",22Mar2018,2
120,"I have been texting / FaceTiming this guy for about a month. We are on the same career path so we have worked with some of the same people, which is how it all began. I guess I can’t officially say I like him since we haven’t met or hung out in person, but I have no doubt that I would really start to like him if we spent time together. We have the same exact sense of humor and he is a very kind person. He treats me with a lot of respect, something that guys in my past haven’t done. I’m also really attracted to him as well. 

The catch is, we live states away from each other. By coincidence, I’m going to be in the city where he lives next week. I’m not going to make my trip all about him, but we are planning on hanging out. I never really thought about the distance thing because I stay pretty busy with work, so distance wouldn’t bother me in a relationship. However, he brought it up the other day. He basically asked me where I wanted this to go and told me that he really likes talking to me and he knows he will catch feelings once we spend time together, but he wouldn’t be able to do long distance because he did it before and it didn’t work. He then said regardless of that he still wants to take me out, but he wants me to know it probably won’t lead to much because of the distance. 

I obviously want to see him and spend some time together, but I’m wondering if I’ll be putting myself through unnecessary hurt by doing it. I don’t want to be rude and not see him, but I feel like I should put myself first. As you can see, I’m kinda going back and forth with this. My thoughts are all over the place. I just want to hear someone else’s perspective and get some advice. Thank you!",22Mar2018,2

130,"Short backstory here. Half-assed my way through school (only showed up enough to be considered a student so I could play sports, planned on going pro in rugby until I fucked up my knee too bad in my senior year). Went to graduation not knowing if I had graduated (I did, barely). Was unemployed for a year after high school, got my first job, got fired in under 3 months. Got my second job, got laid off after 6 months. Was unemployed for another year and a half. Got my third job where I've been working for 7 months now, first time I've finished my probation.

Now, I am just getting over the depression I've had since I was a kid, still dealing with anxiety but I've learned how to work through them. I am determined to get my life on track, but I don't have anyone I can ask how to do some things that I should probably already know.

1. I am 22 now, just barely graduated high school 4 years ago (due to lack of giving a fuck, I didn't find it hard at all). Now I've realized I want to go back to school and become a therapist, but I have no idea where to start when it comes to going back to school. Should I just start applying to schools? Do some program to get my shit grades up?

2. I was told when I was 16 that I needed glasses. Never got them. Realizing now that I definitely should have them. I haven't been back to the optometrist since my 16th birthday, so I have no idea what to do. Do I just call and say I need an appointment to get my eyes checked? (If it matters, I'm Canadian and don't have insurance)

3. Tying into that last thing, I am on antidepressants, I need glasses, I need dental work... I don't have any kind of insurance (I don't get it through work). How do I go about getting that?

4. How do I even begin to start thinking about moving out of my parents house? Getting a car? Getting a credit card? I've had a car since I turned 16, but it is in my parents name so I haven't dealt with that directly. I have always made all of the payments for it (I am really good with money, I just payed for a 9 day long vacation to California after being unemployed for a year and a half and then working at a minimum wage job for 7 months), but I just give the money to my parents and they actually pay it",22Mar2018,2
131,"Backstory.

Male, early twenties in college. Its been a frightening past few years. I've had history with anxiety, panic attacks and stomach issues. Those are real. I've gotten tests done on stomach and high stomach acid content is diagnosis. its affect has made me nauseous. They prescribe me Omeprazole 40mg and I'm no longer nauseous. It goes deeper but that's not what I'm here for. 

I have history with psychedelic drugs. Mushrooms, DMT, 25i, etc. Acid is the big one for me. If you know acid, you know that it's hallucinating with thoughts. You'll think things that you've never thought.  The mental affects don't go away like with other drugs. You can't unthink thoughts. I stopped psychedelics several years ago. Long lasting effect of acid about every week for several years is magnified thoughts. One little thing out of place, and reality gets ripped apart at the seems... 

During a bad trip once, a wise friend mentioned that the cold temperature is a sobering thought. That no matter how fucked up a person is, we can always recognize cold. This has become my safety blanket. I take a shower if I ever freak out. Showers are my favorite place to be. Thermodynamics makes up a majority of our environment in my opinion. You can literally control the environment with a hot/cold knob. I freak out, I take cold shower and meditate. I just sit there and collect myself. The result however makes me love the cold unnaturally, but hey, the shower works I guess.




Main story.

Family (mainly father) has family history with heart problems. I fear I'll have a heart attack every day. I'm afraid to eat fatty foods even though I eat very shitty. Red meat and beef make me feel like the grease will trigger a heart attack. One little discomfort and I'm done with. It's a little warm out, and I'll get spacey. Ill feel like I'm about to pass out. I jump in the shower and sit there... 

The line is getting blurry. More little things like my side hurts a little and I'm thinking something is up with kidney. It's hard to tell what's really there and what's not. 

So I looked up hypochondria. It matches me pretty close too.. an average hypo will stress over everything, do tons of research, etc, but I try to do the opposite. I try to distract myself. Like I said, the acid, it magnifies everything. I stopped weed recently too. I'm stopping alcohol as well.. drugs exacerbate it. I took this past 8 months off, hard  reset my body so I can enjoy weed and alcohol at the very least again. It worked for awhile, but falling back to old fears  so stopping all substances completely. 

I need to work out. I have no time though... Like I said, I'm in college. But who am I kidding?. I blow off my work and watch reruns of Archer and American Dad every day. I have time to work out. I need to remember.. If I get healthier, I feel like the hypo will maybe go away? 

Unlike the typical hypo, I feel like a logical one. Most of them seem to deny any lab tests, doctor suggestions, etc. I can draw a reasonable line as to what's real and what's not. But not knowing the true severity makes me scared. I never know if something is bad or just in my head bad. 

I try to distract myself from bad thoughts. Distraction is key. Doing research on health problems triggers this more. I know that... Most hypos don't seem to get that. Its bad though... 

I'm afraid of existence. I'm afraid of being too conscious for my own good. Like a war vet that's seen too much. Overexposed to reality, and you'll become afraid of existing in our world. Again, I try to brush off these thoughts and ignore.. but it's hard. Telling yourself not to think of something?.. that's like telling a child to ignore a room made of candy. But it's what must be done.. 


Anyone else here deal with hypochondria? I'd love to hear your story and coping mechanisms. It

Edit: just to clarify, I haven't taken psychedelics in over 3 years, I stopped smoking weed a couple weeks ago and it's been a few days since I've had alcohol. I plan to continue this. 

TL;DR:
I've taken a lot of psychedelics in the past. The effects still linger though. They magnify every little thought. For example if I get a little warm, i get really spacey and I'll feel like I'm about to pass out. 
Any little thing gets focused on x1000. I freak out over little things that I can't tell if they're real or not (physiologically speaking). I'm afraid of everything and everyday I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack and die. Anyone else out there with hypochondria or have any coping mechanisms?",22Mar2018,4
132,"TLDR: title. No context told me to shut up while casually venting about work.

I was complaining about a co-worker online in a public status (nothing heavy) about how they never make changes I suggest. It was a humorous and light hearted post and none of my co-workers would see it.

When he said ""you have two options. Tell her or stfu.""

To which I explained I had but she doesn't take criticism well and it would be pointless to try and argue with her again.

And he replied ""so I guess it's stfu?""

Now I see this guy on a semi-regular basis (hasn't been rude to me before but standoffish) but I thought it was pretty damn rude for him to tell me to shut up when I was clearly venting about work in a light way. 

What would you guys do? Because it was so strange I can't tell if he's baiting me or just being argumentative for no reason. Or perhaps he just doesn't like when people complain and has no sympathy? There's definitely some strange level of a lack of respect.

Another one is an Oakley sunglass I bought as a gift. I know my brother loves glasses ever since, so I knew he will really love it. However, when our uncle saw him wearing it, he borrowed and never return the glasses. Actually, he did returned a different one. The most identical Oakley he can buy in the street. My brother just have no power over him.  They saw him couple days ago on a birthday party wearing the glasses. His wife was so mad telling me what happened. 

With regards to his shoes, he was only able to get it back when I travelled back home (I live in Australia and my brother is in the Philippines) because my brother needs to make me happy to see him wearing it. 

His wife told me about the shoe, and he’s only ever worn it that day and yet it looked really really worn out. 

This happens again and again, clothes etc. He would also borrow his money Ive sent them, promising he will return it right away. My brother just don’t know how to say ‘no’. 

There’s also another case, a different person, who would ask him to do thing and promises to pay him money. After the work is done, this person will bully him telling him how badly he’s done and will not pay him. This person do this again and again.

144,"Hey! I'm currently in my junior year in college in India. The title pretty much sums up my situation. I'll try to give a brief summary of my situation in the next couple of paragraphs.

I feel like a different person compared to around 5-6 years ago. I used to be extremely smart and extremely fun. Right now I'm just a shell of my former self. I'm still smart enough and fun enough that I can make friends, but I feel like no one likes me. I made a post a month or so ago with some extra details and someone basically said I had a typical case of depression. I might be, but right now I just use it as an excuse for everything. I never actually want to do anything during the day. I have this routine I follow everyday to keep my mind away from suicidal thoughts, but I never go to sleep feeling close to even neutral about how my day was spent.

I've tried forcing myself to change things, but if I don't see immediate results (which of course has not happened so far), I just become worse mentally. Anytime I am alone and left to my own thoughts I become extremely sad. Fortunately this barely happens because I have a roommate and we have a ton of friends who always hang out in our room. At some point during this year(2018) I decided that something should change, and have kind of accepted that I am not emotionally sound. And this has sort of started this downward spiral for me. I have no self confidence. I second guess every action of mine and am always scared of what other people think of me. To make matters worse I got this huge crush on this really popular and good looking girl, and I feel this has further ruined me mentally because whenever she doesn't give me a ""sign"" I get really sad. I've become utterly insecure and I don't really have a reason to live at all anymore.

I have wanted to change my life 3-4 times in the past couple of months, but everytime I do something I have this overwhelming feeling of depression which just engulfs any hope I have at all. I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I really don't even know what I expect from writing this post. People usually give me advice and I am not able to commit to it anyways. At this point, it is just a formality to write a post every week or so just so I can feel that I am putting some effort into improving. I really don't try to improve myself ever. ",22Mar2018,3

157,"So my sister (let’s go with Mary) and my friend (Jane) absolutely hate each other

Now Mary hates Jane because Jen and I used to date, the relationship was very rocky and we both ended the relationship hurt

My sister saw her brother in pain and hated the woman who caused that. I get that but honestly this was all years ago

Jane and I have both moved on. We’ve set each other up on dates and honestly she has become one of my closest friends. I care for her the same way I do for family.

Jane basically hates Mary coz Mary hates her and I’ve told Mary all that shit was in the past countless times

Now here’s the kicker. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem, even though they live near each other they rarely see each other so I’ve made the situation work (Had a few fights with my sister because she scoffs every time I mention Janes name). This all changed tonight because they were both invited to the same wedding by a friend of theirs.

I’m babysitting Mary’s kids

Mary’s has a week to prepare in which I’ve told her many times “janes there be nice”, “Jane saved my life so the least you could do is be nice” (which is true, was literally about to kill myself a month ago and Jane talked me down, I owe a lot to that woman)

So she was prepared. Though the surprise was they were sitting at the same table

I thought “great they can finally fucking talk out their differences in a nice and civil way”

Nope. Apparently my sister is bruised and ambulance are checking her for broken bones (she may need to go to hospital) and Janes on her way to hospital for stitches. My sister glasses her

Both are swearing the other started it. I dunno who to believe. Knowing them I reckon Mary started with some harsh words, Jane snapped and threw the first hit and shit escalated from there (I’m not sure but knowing them as well as I do that’s my best guess)

I honestly dunno what to do

On the one hand my sisters blood yet I know she can be bitchy at times. Meanwhile janes one of the closest people in the world to me and I genuinely do love her as though she was family (neither of us are interested in a romantic relationship but we have spoken about it and we both care about each other)

They’ll both be expecting me to side with them and I don’t wanna get in the middle of this but I don’t see any way out 

Update: 

Well fuck

Just spoke to them both. They both have very believable stories and both stories are VERY different from each other. Right now they’re both at different hospitals. Wtf do I do....",22Mar2018,2

161,"OK, so I work in a job I despise, its a 45 minute bus ride form home, its dead end (nowhere to progress to) its run badly and I seriously hate it.
on the plus side its good pay and the money will likely go up in April too.

I have been job hunting for about a year and had very little to no success.

although I had an interview last week.

I was offered the job but declined it because they wanted me to work one in three weekends (I have my daughter at weekends, so not wanting to give my weekends up) 
It seems really dull and boring, its a contact centre with a  script and theres heavy targets. and its less money, equating to roughly £50 a month.

on the plus side, five minute walk from home,
Reach the targets and you get commission (according them this averages about £400 a month, not sure I believe that figure)
and the number one plus is its not where I am.

They have been in touch again and advised that they want to put with the IT guy aswell and have me as part call centre operative and IT support to break up the monotony.
they have also said to call and discuss with them about the weekends as I may not have to work them.

 I know what your thinking, whats the issue, im just not sure if I believe them about the offer to make special allowances for me, and I have never worked to those kind of tight targets for commission, plus less money.


I really don't know what to do.

163,"Hey everyone. 
So I have been dating a girl for a year now. I am 18 and she will be too in a few months. I have known her for a very long time (5 years) and we have a lot of history since then. However, I have always had this fad that alcohol and drugs are simply not needed in one's life and I dislike it (mostly because I have lost many close people in my life to it). As usual, after turning 16, all of my friends get into drinking and think it is ""cool"" and have gotten addicted. Similarly, even my girlfriend wanted to do the same but I just explained her one thing that just because 95% of the people in the world are into this, it does not mean that you need to get into it too. Try being different. She never really had a reason for drinking and wanted to do it just because everyone else does it which is why I explained it to her. I have tried telling this to people who aren't into the drinking business because it is really not worth it. But the real problem is where every time she kept going to a club she kept asking if she could drink. I never stopped her, but I just said ""I had told you something remember? My job is over there, the rest is your decision"". This happened twice and I did not feel good It hurt me that she is not understanding what I am trying to tell her. The third time she asked me. I pretended to be okay with it and told her to go ahead (even though I had told her before that it is her choice). She got really drunk and started calling me. And that really messed my mind up because I had a very important task to complete the next day and I had to be focussed but because of her drinking and calling me continuously, I lost everything. I could not work, I could think, I did not know what to feel because it was hurting me also and making me angry. I spoke about this with my neighbour who is an avid drinker and he told me it's okay socially drink and there is no harm but you must do everything within limits. I did not want to again explain it to her that why alcohol isn't good for you so I drank a little with her and even though it hurt a lot from inside I managed to survive. Fun fact: I feel like that only when she drinks. It doesn't affect me one bit if someone else smokes or drinks. We took a break recently because of both our workloads and I got to know that she DESPERATELY wants to do weed. This was where I lost my shit completely. I couldn't tell her anything because I wasn't supposed to know. And that is the story of my life. I don't want to lose her to this. I do not know why I feel like this if it is right if it is wrong. It is just very difficult for me to accept this because it goes against my values too. I am really confused please help me. I can't get done with any work properly because of this.",22Mar2018,2
165,"I'm not going go into too much detail about it, just the important stuff, but the past 3 years of my life have been hell. 

Before all that I was already struggling with severe depression and angst, thanks to a corrupted system and incompetence at my high school I had to rewrite a subject the year after I graduated, just so I can study the degree I wanted. 

I already had no friends and then I literally didn't even have familiar faces anymore because I got there a year late. Thanks to this, along with a genetic syndrome I have - Ehlers-Danlos syndrome - and all the mental issues, I couldn't function anymore. I'd stay up for 3 days so I can get to class because if I fell asleep it was for 14 hours or more. I eventually ended up crashing anyway.

This lead to me being booked into a mental hospital which (imo) just made me more fragile to ""real life"" 

Anyway so I've been dealing with that, I started studying through a long distance learning college so I'm not alone all the time and to help take care of my mom (she had cancer) and the house. My mom and I had a strained relationship because of my sister (for some reason she resents me so she always got me in trouble and even got the rest of my siblings to all tell me they wished I was dead, so that's fun). 

I've had some fucked up issues the past 3 years with my relationship as my SO's family are deranged and his mom tried to get rid of me, even though we'd been engaged for 4 years already at that time (she wanted to do this so she can get more money out of him, I obviously tried to get him to take care of himself first as he'd often end up struggling and borrowing money just to get through the month)

In January of this year, my mom died. Though we had a strained relationship, because I was taking care of her, she started realizing what had happened and we were starting to get along. I almost got my mom back. I don't know how to deal with it and I'm still struggling with everything else as well. But also obviously still trying to finish my degree. 

All I want to do is hide away from the world and ending up doing that just makes me more anxious and more depressed because I'm basically useless if I have to do something for myself. 

I can't afford counselling and my medical aid leaves me with R2000 for the entire year (about $170) and along with my EDS, in the past 6 months I've also been diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and cervical cancer (caught it early enough and had it removed at least) so the crappy medical aid doesn't really do much for me in terms of security for the year.

If anyone has any advice for how I can just get to do my fucking school work I'd appreciate it. 
I'm not expecting anyone to fix my life, I just don't want to be a disappointment to my mom or my dad. I'm tired of feeling like a failure. 

Tl;Dr
My life hasn't been super easy, as of late with the passing of my mom I can't function anymore (again)

Just looking for some advice on how I can try and do my school work to finish my studies.

166,"EDIT: It warms my heart that random people would spend time out of their day to give me well-thought-out advice, thank you, everybody, it means more than you know.

My girlfriend is 17 and I am 16, I know that this post may not be taken seriously by some people because of my age but I am really stuck on what to do, and the directions for helping and hopefully preventing these ongoing situations.

Her step-dad will decide to grope her and grab her breasts and genital area for up to around 60 seconds. It happens every couple weeks (from what my girlfriend has told me) and started since she turned 10 or 11. He usually does it by going in for a hug and things like that, and she tells him to stop and hits him but he doesn't.

She finds it so hard to talk about and I am the only other person who knows and we are going to try and speak to her mum about it today.

It honestly breaks me down and makes me feel physically sick to the point where I have migraines, I feel like crying because she is so upset and feels so ashamed that she is physically unable to get her words out. She will say things like ""I'm trying to talk but no words will come out"" and begins to stutter and cry. It sometimes takes days for her to come out on a singular occasion where this has happened, but I don't pressure her into telling me because I want her to feel that telling me is a safe and comfortable option.

Please. I have no idea what to do in terms of, the course of action, how I should comfort her or her mum, what I should say or do to help, and things I shouldn't do or say that can make things worse.

I'm sorry that this post is not up to par with other posts in this subreddit, but I just don't have enough time and feel that my mind is too scattered to form a formal post with good English.

I also don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this to, I'm new to Reddit and if it's not, then please just point me in the right direction.

173,"I’m 31 and grew up abused by my parents. Earliest memory, I was 4/5 and my dad beat my mom with a shoe. They fought a lot, divorced when I was 5/6. But they still interacted and fought after that. When I was 9/10, he came over, ended up in a fight where he was choking her. She begged me to call 911 and he spent a night in jail. 

My dad also beat me. First time I remember is him yelling at me, when I was around 5/6 visiting him. He pulled me up by around my waist and shook me because I was homesick for my mom  and crying. I hid under the sink. My mom used to curse me out and call me names, fight me starting when I was 7/8. Tried to burn me with a curling iron. When I got older I tried to fight back, so she pulled me through the living room by my hair and had me arrested. I was 13. My dad took me in. I preferred his sporadic beating to my mom daily verbal abuse/fist fights/threats of juvie. My dad randomly lost his temper, grabbed me, picked me up, threw me around. But that only happened every now and then. I left for college, and stopped talking to my dad this year as a 30-31 year old woman. 


I stopped physically being around my dad when I was 25/26, stopped going back home because I was scared of him and the memories there hurt too badly. He never stopped yelling at me. My mom I stopped seeing at 27/28, because she never stopped being nasty to me. But we talk on the phone every week.

I went to therapy for a year around 27/28, and he told me my parents will never have a healthy relationship with me so I need to give up.

So I did. But I have no family ties. I stopped talking to everyone except one aunt. I am afraid of anything related to ‘home.’ And I sometimes want to go back, but all I can think of is getting dragged by my hair or thrown around.

And that night I dreamed I went home and someone assaulted me. These dreams make me relive past abuse and I want to understand why this is happening to me and what  I can do about it?",22Mar2018,2
174,"This is sort of long but please bare with me. 

Okay, so I’ve been married for two years. My husband and I started having problems a little bit before he left overseas. Once he left, the real problems started. Half the problems were my fault and the other half were his. So I’m definitely taking some responsibility for why our relationship was kind of shitty. See, this is the first time we started living together. So anyway, we started having problems and the word divorce was thrown around a few times but we never went through with it because we knew that was stupid. But I guess because we threw that word around so nonchalantly, it became almost plausible. So after a big fight, he suggested a divorce and being unable to really do much else, I complied. He was quite adamant about getting divorced, too. He would call me to check up on whether I’ve been going to all my divorce related appointments, he would request all the documentation and would sign all of them digitally, so basically the impression I got was that he definitely wanted to get divorced and was trying everything possible to make sure that everything would go quickly and smoothly.

Well, once I went to court and paid for the divorce to get it officially started, I decided to start the process of moving on (He was still not back from overseas at this point). I concentrated hard on school, was trying to find a job (we had an agreement that while he was gone, I’d go to school full time instead of working so I could get ahead on my degree). 

Then one day, by pure chance, I met someone wonderful. We instantly clicked and have been inseparable since. I explained that I’m in the middle of a divorce and that it’ll be a few months before it’s finalized. He didn’t mind. He accepted all of me; something I felt was lacking in my marriage. So I thought, “well, this is a bit soon to be jumping into a relationship, but it’s almost guaranteed I’ll never find someone like this again, so I’ll take this opportunity”. And so it was. 

However, my soon-to-be-ex-husband, came back from overseas. He came to our house to pick up his stuff, as he was going to live elsewhere, and he took himself off the lease by paying it off out of pocket. I thought that was that, our divorce was due in a few days and I’d finally be able to breathe. 

Here’s where things get complicated. A few days ago, he calls me to request a talk. I agreed to meet up for a few minutes so he could tell me whatever it was he wanted to tell me. When we meet, he proceeds to pour his heart out, telling me that the divorce was really a bluff and that by saying he wanted a divorce, he was hoping I’d fight him on it, but he wasn’t expecting me to call his bluff by complying. He admitted that his pride clouded his judgement, and that he was incredibly sorry and that he would do anything to have me back. The thing is, this guy isn’t an asshole. He’s one of the most honest, genuine people I’ve ever known, so I know he wasn’t lying. He meant every word of that apology and he was genuinely distressed for having messed up our relationship and he was willing to change and improve to make this work. Hearing all of this coupled with his sincerity, opened up the floodgates of emotions that I had worked hard on keeping out. 

Here’s the thing though: I am genuinely in love with my new boyfriend. Turns out we were more compatible than I had originally thought and over the course of a few months, we fell into a steady rhythm of love and understanding. My real concern lies in our financial situation. I have a job but it’s not great. He has a job but it’s not great. Neither of us have a car. We both talked about it and agreed that if we stayed together, we would have to go through a lot of hardships in order to progress. 

Well now my husband, who is well off, starts casting doubts in my mind by telling me that if I choose him over my boyfriend, he would make sure that I would want for nothing, and that he would take care of me (which is true because that’s how it was before he went overseas), but it doesn’t make it easier to hear, especially because I’m in love with someone else. So I talk to my boyfriend about it, and he says that I should probably choose my husband, that way I can avoid a lot of stress and hardships. That was very painful to hear because I wasn’t expecting him to agree. But then he tells me that that’s not what he wants, he just wants me to be stress free in the future.

So that’s my dilemma. One the one hand, my husband (who I am not divorced from, yet) wants to get back together and genuinely wants to make a change so that our marriage will work, and on the other hand, I’m in love with someone but being with that someone certainly spells out financial trouble (which equals stress and that could put a serious strain on our relationship and we both acknowledge this). 

My head and my heart are conflicted and with no close friends or family, I’m really at a loss as to what to do. One option is familiar and comfortable and could work, and the other is uncertain and scary but could definitely be worth it. I never expected to fall in love with someone, especially not whilst not even being divorced yet. What do I do? What’s the right decision? I’ve had to up the dosage on my anxiety meds and start on anti depressants since then because this is seriously fucking with my head. Any advice would help.

178,"This morning I was talking to my dad about my car on the phone. Out of nowhere, he flips out on me asking why I don't live at home with them and work there. For some background, my parents aren't doing well financially and they're paying for my apartment. I've been searching for a job since January and I have been taking care of my medical bills from an unforeseen sickness that came up that month. I set up a gofundme for the bills and then I was able to get a one-time babysitting gig that earned $150 dollars. My dad doesn't seem to understand that despite all of the advertising I've done, no one has contacted me to sublease. This is a small college town out in the country, so there isn't much job opportunity (it seems). I've applied to countless positions through Snagajob, indeed, and I've called and sent in a resume and cover letter to positions. I've had my resume critiqued here on r/resume and I've fixed it up quite a bit. I also applied to temp agencies and no luck when I call them asking about positions. So my dad ignorantly states that this town I'm living in ""is full of country white people. They'll never give you an opportunity because they'll only hire other white people."" I quickly pointed out to him that when our hometown was just starting out -- It just had a Walmart and that was it -- he was such a good salesman that he had his name up on the billboard in town. How can he tell me that enough hard work and dedication can't get somewhere? He was persistent with this notion that I couldn't get anywhere and I eventually ended up crying. This is the last thing I wanted to hear while trying to find a job for so long. He wanted to know why I liked it here so much when there's ""nothing"" to do. I explained that I really like having my own place and I enjoy the nature here. I don't care for all the stores and restaurants in my hometown. I like my school's campus and botanic garden. I like the trail here and being able to go where I want to. If I move back to my parent's house, I wouldn't be allowed to go anywhere. I'm 20, you guys. I'm from a Caribbean household, so there are no slamming doors, leaving the house without telling them where you're going, or having a disrespectful tone. They instill fear into you at a young age. My parent's house is so depressing. No one does anything and they're all glued to their devices. My dad doesn't even like staying there. He goes ubering for fun right after he comes home for dinner. Going back there would be awful for my mental health. It always is, which is why I don't visit anymore.  
Right now I just feel low and discouraged. My dad really messed me up with all the talk about never obtaining a job in this town because of my race. I don't believe in it. I used to have that mindset, but I honestly think this victim mentality won't get me anywhere either. That mindset is just depressing, to be honest.

185,"I was in a weird ambiguous, on-and-off relationship with someone for about a year. He was the classic bad boy, involved in a lot of sketchy business and definitely a player. But he also had a lot of mental health issues. During the year I knew him, he attempted suicide, and I also had to talk him out of it on another occasion. He was also diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. He never really committed to me (he slept with a lot of other girls), and in hindsight only seemed to keep me around because I had a very cute, wholesome and innocent demeanor. Even though I was being used, I didn't leave this relationship because there was something so enticing about him. He was probably the most interesting person I've met, due to his experiences and his complex, messed up psychology. When I was with him, I was always learning something interesting, or on an adventure. In a way, it was like I was addicted to him, because when we were together, I felt amazing, but the moment he left, I felt like shit. I started to cut myself off from my other friends because they wouldn't stop criticizing him (even though they were totally right to do so). Because of my isolation, I slowly developed depression, which made me even more dependent on him. 

A year ago, he completely cut contact with me for, which now I realize was probably the best thing I could have asked for. I've come to realize how toxic our relationship was, recovered from my depression, and have developed a very supportive group of friends and a healthy social network. However, there is still part of me that still can't get over this person. Even though I definitely don't want to get back together with him I still have dreams about it in my sleep, and when I've dated other guys, I just feel like there's something missing. There's no intensity, and they seem bland and uninteresting, even though they really aren't, they're just guys who are mentally stable. It's like I want to find another tortured soul to be with because of the drama and the intense feelings.

Basically this all started when i was very young, i got bullied, didn’t have any friends at all. So i took to cartoons, and i saw the characters there as my friends, took them with me as imaginary friends. 
So i had been growing up with the idea that they were my only real friends, and i you know, found comfort in that. 
I eventually got the idea into my head that they would eventually take me to their beautiful world where i would be happy each day, i would go on grand adventures, meet incredible creatures, and just have an amazing time there.
My emotional state was really dim in those days, i felt very depressed and alone. So, yeah i guess it made sense that i believed all that.

Eventually i grew up, and of course i started to realize that these fantasies would never come into being. That was a really big dissapointment for me, i felt absolutely destroyed. Like they all went to the beautiful place they promised me and left me here to rot and had just excited me with the idea of coming with them to mess with my head.

I have since grown up far more, and i am in a way better emotional state, i’d say i’m really getting out of the long depression i have been in. I am an art student currently, i had followed 2 years and i succeeded in those. But the third year requires an entire year of doing an internship at an animation company. Well i tried to do that, but after the first 2 months i was just constantly getting panic attack after panic attack and feeling more and more trapped inside a schedule and inside a world.
I had to eventually quit my internship because it made me straight up suicidal. So i can’t say i didn’t try. I have been recovering from all that emotional turmoil for 7 months now.
I am a lot better now, i don’t get any panic anymore troughout the day. Only when i try to get myself into a schedule of a job.
Then my entire mind just messes me up.

I really want to just do something i enjoy and live from it. But i think what i really want, is to still be able to go and live inside those worlds i had always longed for. Eventhough i know that will never be possible. I don’t see how i can happily live this life if i have to force myself into a system that makes me so so depressed and cold.
I am willing to work, but, i dont see how.
I just want to run trough fields of green, and have amazing friends all around me, have the ability to go on adventures whenever with friends, just all kinda like the show Adventure Time i suppose.

So i think my core issue is:

I have absolutely no clue how to survive and deal with the mundanity of life compared to my wants and goals.

When i try to deal with life i just get so depressed and i feel like i could break out into tears because of how trapped i feel.

And i feel selfish as hell for even complaining, i live in an amazing place, i should not even be complaining. But hey if i am selfish because of who i am, so be it. This is my issue and i have to deal with it. 

I’d rather just get in a van with some people and just journey away into the world and just explore without a care in the world. (Well of course caring for food hygiene and the sort)

So does anyone here have any advice for me? I will appreciate any advice!",22Mar2018,2

193,"I'm a 20 year old male who has been a victim of emotional/psychological abuse since the Great Recession when I was about 11 years old. The abuse primarily came from my dad, but I feel a deep sense of betrayal towards my mom because she knew what was going on the whole time and didn't do anything about it. All she has ever done is make excuses for dad, justify how I was treated, or minimize how badly I was treated by calling me ""too sensitive,"" or saying that this whole thing is nothing more than a ""disagreement"" between me and dad.

I've concluded that I desperately need therapy, and thankfully my parents have agreed to it (dad intends to have a therapist tell me how messed up and evil I am). 

That aside, I genuinely believe that my mother is very slowly waking up to reality, and I want to fix my relationship with her. My plan is to find individual therapy for adults who suffered child abuse, as well as family therapy for me and my mom, who has said she will listen to what the therapist says. 

There's just one big worry with my plan.
I'm afraid that, when I go tell the therapist I'm an adult victim/survivor of child abuse, still living with my parents and still being emotionally abused by dad with mom seeing nothing wrong, the therapist will call the police and have my 13 year old sister taken to a foster home. 
I don't want to break up the family, I just want dad out of the picture. When he's not around, mom tends to be much more loving and caring and I believe would make a good parent with dad not around, and I also believe a therapist would be able to talk sense into her. She seems to genuinely deep down regret what I've gone through. 

Also I should mention that the abuse in this household is primarily between me and dad. He doesn't bother my sister too much at all, though I have to admit, I don't honestly know if how he treats her is abuse, because I don't know what a normal family looks like.

Also I have an anxious attachment style, which seems to mean that the psychological damage done to me shouldn't be too extensive (as opposed to avoidant style). Also it means mom was at least somewhat responsive to my needs growing up, and wasn't too horribly insensitive. She does often side with me when dad isn't around. 

My mom is becoming more distant though. She feels my claim that this is child abuse is me making a mountain out of a molehill, and I think she feels betrayed that I threatened legal action if they wouldn't take me to therapy.

So my question is, is there anyway that I can get therapy for myself for healing, and therapy with my mom to help her understand and bring us back together, without my sister being torn from the family legally because there is abuse in the household? Again I just want dad removed. Him being gone solves 90% of the problem. My sister being removed from everyone creates more problems than it solves, and mom will never forgive me.",22Mar2018,1
194,"Hello! I just started a new job at a university that pays 43k a year. This is the most money I have ever made, and I was really excited to have a regular 9-5 job in my field, as I previously had a lot of late nights and intense student interactions.

Cut to a month into my job, and I am essentially a receptionist in an office that has almost no foot traffic. I have a few tasks I have been assigned, but they take up maybe an hour of my day each day, if I'm lucky.

I said to my supervisor in the first few weeks of my position that I wasn't sure how I was going to fill my time, and he insisted that things would pick up once I got acclimated with the position. They have not, and I cannot forsee that they will.

I have a master's degree, and am qualified to do a lot more. I am an excellent worker and have passion projects that I think could benefit our office, which I would be happy to flesh out and implement. I proposed these to my supervisor, and he said I should focus on my stated job duties, essentially discouraging me from creating any new initiatives.

At this point, I am feeling defeated and a little cheated, as I accepted a job thinking I would be able to use my skills and my degree and feel somewhat fulfilled. Instead, I am literally surfing the internet for 7 hours a day and occasionally greeting someone as they come in.

What can I do?? Any advice?",22Mar2018,1
196,"My brother has always been extremely careless with his things, and I would say that he is quite spoiled. He never gets into trouble for breaking things, including mine. Just recently, he broke my phone (I'm typing this on my phone right now, but it's barely functioning and a portion of the screen won't work) after running around with it, my laptop for school (I had to leave the country for a week and entrusted it with him, and he broke it while I was gone) and my mother's phone, which she seems to have no problem with. I'm always told that it isn't his fault and that I shouldn't be angry because he's younger (9 yrs old), but I think he's old enough to understand that these things are expensive and shouldn't be played with so carelessly.

I recently decided on buying a new laptop, which is quite expensive, and cost me all of my savings. I'm expected to share it with him because it's ""ours"" despite it being my money paying for it, but I'm pretty scared that he might damage or even break it, being the way he is. I've tried talking to him and setting up ground rules which he refuses to abide by, even telling me that he would purposely damage it if there were to have rules. I'm ok with him using it under my supervision, but he still objects to this and I highly doubt my parents would side with me. As a last resort, I do have some dirt on him and can blackmail him into behaving himself, but I think that would be pretty low of me and I don't want to have to do it.

197,"OKAY. SO. A friend of mine (M) told me that a friend of hit (D) who I saw in a musical they were in together, was asking about me a lot. M told me that he thought D was probably into me, considering the amount of attention. Having seen D and liking what I saw I was like ""Sure tell him to hit me up or something. Introduce me whatever."" The usual Tsundere thing. Nothing happens for a week or so, then I text M like ""Hey I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable"" But a lot longer. M replies like ""nah it's cool I don't care."" He then proceeds to tell me that he will give D my details. the Next day we're talking and the topic of D comes up. M doesn't say anything about giving him my details so he just tells me his facebook name and stuff so I send a friend request. Maybe this was my first mistake? After that I sleep and you know. SKIP TO TODAY (the next day.) He hasn't accepted my friend request yet. I talked to M about it. M was like ""Oof bad sign. D is on social media a lot."" I wasn't TOO panicked about it before. BUT NOW I AM. Did I freak him out? Did M possibly say something? I know I'm overthinking and a good part of my mind is going ""I mean..I don't really care. It's not like I know the guy.""

My cousins are somehow a bit poor, their father has a low salary job but they still manage to buy expensive T.Vs and videogames etc. So today my cousin who is 22 years old came to our home to borrow my motorbike as usual. He doesn't fill the gas that he uses. I have to refill the tank everyday. Today when he came I saw him wearing my t-shirt that was in my wardrobe yesterday. I asked my mom if she gave him, she yes. I asked why didn't you ask me? She just got angry on me. Let me tell you about my cousin first, he is 22 years old, he left school at 8th grade, he does not do anything whole day and does not even have a job. He once stole my mobile too but I forgot about that. My mom sometimes gives my stuff to him without asking him. This makes me sick and makes me want to leave this house.

I honestly didn't care at the time because I wanted to help, and my current budget has already absorbed the financial loss so I don't really ""need"" it any more. 

Today I got an SMS saying she transferred it to me using one of those money transfer services (like Venmo or ApplePay Cash, but something else).  I tried to enroll with the service she picked, but after entering my credit card info it says my card is not eligible. I don't have any other credit cards. 

So my question is, what should I do? 

Should I contact her and tell her so that we can figure something else out? 

Should I let the 14 day waiting period expire so that the funds are sent back to her? (she's a single mother, and frankly could use it more than I could... if that matters for decision-making.)

209,"Apologies in advance, this is a bit of a long post. For reference, I am about 7 months in to this job.

I am a marketing professional. I moved from a gateway market into a much smaller one for a job that had a lot of promise. In short, the pay was quite good and the actual opportunity was an appropriate step up in responsibility. I got my own office, a team, and was promised direct access to leadership in order to get the marketing on track.

That being said I have some concerns about company culture:

1. Despite being a very small company, the reporting structure is way more complex than it was explained to me at hiring. My boss said I would report to him only, but I am being asked to run all materials by 5 principals, 1 vice president, 2 directors (technically my peers), and occasionally 1 associate (literally). 

2. Bottlenecks in management mean getting projects done take forever. Sometimes weeks just to get a single draft together. Despite this, comments have been made about how long it takes for me to complete projects.

3. Leadership resists seeing unfinished drafts for input. If I am at a crossroads that needs review, they get upset about the unfinished nature of the draft. This is despite placeholders or labels that say ""unfinished"" or any other disclaimers I gives. This includes saying ""i really need input on _______ only at this time""

4. When we discuss deadline dates, I frequently give aggressive scheduling estimates because I'm a pretty hard worker. My bosses frequently undercut these schedules, demanding even shorter turnaround to the point where it is actually impossible. When I give conservative estimates, they get visibly upset and still set impossible deadlines. In fact, when I push back at all they get upset. When I miss deadlines I point out I didn't choose the original dates, they get upset and tell me I really need to push harder on realistic deadlines then (ie, it's still my fault)

5. Half the company doesn't even use our branding standards. Executives in other departments frequently use in-house members to do very crude marketing work. When I ask to review marketing materials created by their team members, they delay until it's the last minute and send it to me when I have no time to realistically improve their work.

6. Other employees at my level often resist providing materials or information to me. I send frequent e-mail reminders, etc. The result is usually they avoid me in the halls, not step up and be responsive or provide any feedback (""sorry busy week"" etc). I've tried backing off requests and just focusing on building relationships with those people before making requests but with some people they are so hostile that I don't think that's possible.

7. Recently I'm being asked to give up my private office for a ""shared workspace"" with my employee. The boss seems to think it would be ""cool"" to create a ""bullpen"" atmosphere for my team. He is giving my office to a new employee. I might note that younger employees who are technically below me have offices and are not being asked to switch things up.

8. The aforementioned new employee is Director of Customer Relations. She is supposed to managing conferences and a sort of sales role. This was originally something I was supposed to do but since my team cannot fly solo, I do not have time for it. When I suggested hiring someone underneath me, I was told instead they were going to hire ""parallel"" to me. She has no marketing experience, and her main gigs have been managing small time musicians for tours, and fundraising for a private school. I have been asked to ""run all communications and materials by her"" - effectively creating an ad-hoc boss above me.

9. Most recently I simply asked my boss to clarify the reporting structure and said I have concerns about the new role's responsibilities overlapping mine in many ways. His response was ""people who are successful at our company learn how to collaborate"" 

In general, I have no idea what to do. Many of the biggest concerns seem like unchangeable company culture stuff that are directly the opposite of how things were sold to me. The minor concerns seem almost petty if taken alone, but in the larger picture they are upsetting. I literally moved across the country for this job so I can't just quit on a dime. Finding a new job will probably take a little while and to make things worse my girlfriend moved out here and found a job she really loves.

Does anyone have ANY help or input? I can't tell if I'm overreacting but I just know it feels very dysfunctional compared to my past jobs.

TL;DR moved across the country for a job based on how it was sold to me....started out good but slowly devolved into a very dysfunctional work experience that is making me deeply unhappy. Feels like a relationship where the other person shows their best side for a few months until you're in deep, then suddenly becomes a monster.",22Mar2018,1
210,"I'm not too sure how to properly explain this, nor do I know how to approach it.

I have this friend. For anonymity sake, let's call him David.

David enjoys stuff like Dragonball and Titanfall. He enjoys particular scenes and aspects of each of these shows among a plethora of others. Keep this in mind.

After David watches these things for a while, he begins to imitate voice lines and concepts from those things. For example, in Titanfall, there is a particular quote, ""Flame Core Online"" that he likes to say from time to time. Another example would be when he imitates a shotgun reloading. However, the problem stems when there are certain real life situations that we encounter.

If there was a test that was particularly hard, the way he would talk about the test is not the typical explanation of why the test was hard or maybe his feelings on why it was hard or how hard it was. Instead, David takes those lines and actions he imitates and says it ""applies to the scenario"". To me and most of Davids friends that I talked to about it, not only is it not funny, but it just doesn't make any sense. It's even worse when some of the time, I don't even know what he's imitating or talking about, so I have to pretend that I understand. The worst part is that he does this for virtually everything possible and repeats the same things, rarely coming up with new material, which will just consist of new things to imitate.

I'll admit, maybe it's just me that finds this really annoying. But I don't know how to tell David how annoying what he's doing is. I don't really want to upset him. It seems that he very much enjoys doing this, even if very few people laugh or get the joke (I assume he's doing it for a joke). I need some advice on how to tell David that he needs to stop doing what he's doing because it bothers me a lot (to the point that I sometimes can't even be in the same room as him) without upsetting him.

I haven't spoken to my father in two months, and not for lack of trying on my part. I have called, left voicemails, texts, and videos of my children. I've asked my grandmother if he was busy and she said no more than usual. Now I know my dad works a lot, but I've been trying to call him to update him on his grandkids for almost 3 weeks now and haven't heard a word. So I tried to call my step-mom, who I know is literally just sitting in the garage smoking and playing on Facebook. Sent to voicemail, five separate times. 

I have high anxiety and they know it. They even are the ones who told me that I may need to be medicated for it because I immediately think worst-case scenario. They also know, because I told them, that even accidently cutting contact with me can automatically make me feel like something is wrong. 

What can I do? I've talked their ears off about this and there is no change. They always tell me that they don't think it's fair that my kids aren't really a part of their lives, they always are trying to get me to move home, and yet they ignore me.

Sometimes it'd take a week for me to reply, but he'd leave nice and helpful messages during the lapse. And I'd do the very same for him.

He goes by ""Thibault"". He has a PhD, and lives in France. He used to teach in a university, and was looking for a job the last time we spoke. He says his English isn't too good, but it's actually great, for the most part. He's got several cats, and three siblings.

It frustrates me so much how I could tell you about his dream vacation and what he hopes to achieve in this world and why he thinks it's funny for ladies to swear in French, but I can't even tell you basic human things, like his last name.

I swear, I'm just looking for him to make sure he's okay, and to thank him for helping me through one of the roughest depressive episodes I've ever had.

Somewhere where I would fit in more politically, that my job would be valued, etc. However, I'm scared as fuck to do it. I'd have to go all on my own, with very little money, and I don't even know where I'd want to go. It's likely I'd want to go someplace where I've never even visited--I haven't had the opportunity to go to very many places. I just crave something different and new, and the chance to start fresh.

How do I get over the hangup of leaving my family, friends, and home behind? How do I decide if this is the right thing to do or not? How do I even decide WHERE I should go, if I decide to leave here?

I'm just so lost. I feel like I can't even do any job hunting for after graduation because I don't know where I want to be. 

Any advice is useful! Thanks. &lt;3",22Mar2018,1

I will be leaving food for both him and dog, weed for him (legal state), and we have a hotub available for him to use. With these, I still need to pay him, but not sure how much.

234,"Long story short my girlfriend of 9 months refused to ask me to help her change her oil, something I very easily could have done myself, and paid a LOT of money for it. I asked why she didn't ask me. She said she feels that I do a lot more for her than she does for me. And it's not that she doesn't WANT to do things for me, but she doesn't know how, or isn't very good at them.

I asked her to elaborate, and she said that I've helped her with car troubles, and cook for her regularly when she comes to my place. She said she doesn't know how to fix things, and besides my efforts to cook with her and encourage her, she doesn't feel confident in her cooking skills. I love her to death. She's someone I want to grow with as a person. But this is really taking a toll on her self esteem. And while I didn't tell her this, she's right: She doesn't have a lot of random practical skills that would make up a ""jack of all trades"" personality. She doesn't know how to build or repair most things. But I don't care about that. I don't feel like I should rely on my partner, as a man. I told her that while I admit it sounds sexist as a man, I just assume that fixing a car, redoing plumbing, or being able to provide for the woman I love is something of a standard of what it is to be a ""man"". So it's not something I think much about. I assume I'm just putting in the standard.

However she's worried I will naturally lose interest in her and as she said ""Upgrade to someone else"" because she can't provide certain things for me. I'm still not able to think of what ""things"" those would be. 

I get that a relationship is supposed to be equal in, equal out. But I don't know why she resents herself (her words) for something like this.",22Mar2018,1

237,"Hi Reddit, I'm dealing with a choice about my future that has no bad outcomes, but is a tough one to make nonetheless.

I'm a single 25 year old guy who runs an online business for income and can basically work from anywhere.

I have been living in City A (a dense East Coast city) in the same building as my sister and a cousin of mine for the past 7 years. I have friends here and really enjoy being in the city (24 hour access to food and being able to walk everywhere is awesome). I am very close with my family here, particularly my sister, who has dealt with anxiety issues since we were little.

Despite being very content here, I sometimes wonder if there was more I could be doing with my life. I'm not very ambitious, but my life here is somewhat stale aside from running my online business.

I've considered traveling, but am often held back because I'm the only one who can calm my sister down when she has her panic attacks (aside from our mother, who lives on the other side of the world). We have been two peas in a pod since we were little and I'd never want to ""abandon"" her. 

I've been given a job opportunity in City B (a sprawling West Coast city) where my Uncle runs a very successful commercial property business. He's getting old, has no children, and needs to retire. He's hoping I will join the company with another cousin, who is currently overwhelmed with trying to carry on his legacy alone. The three of us get along great and I like City B a lot (perfect weather and great hamburgers). The income from my uncle's properties will eventually get passed down to me and the rest of my cousins, as well as my sister. I don't really need the income now, but it has the potential to be a huge company, and may be able to support our family for generations to come.

I currently fly back and forth, and enjoy working with my uncle part time for a couple weeks a month, but so far havent been able to leave my sister to work there full time. On the other hand, I feel like the business won't grow much without my help, and if I really want to ensure a comfortable life for myself and the rest of my family, I need to dedicate all of my time to the business.

SO REDDIT, CITY A OR CITY B?

-----------

TL;DR - I live in City A with my anxious sister who needs me to calm her down. I make a living, but also have the opportunity of taking over my uncle's large business in City B, which will eventually support our entire family financially. 

I don't want to abandon my sister, but also want to help my uncle run his business. City A or B?

238,"Hello redditors, I need your advice..

For some background information:

- I'm currently a 21 YO male who's about to graduate with a measly 2:2 Economics degree. 

- I've been at university for three years, and it's been the most depressing period of my life. 

- I've been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, and prescribed antidepressants (Xanax, which I stopped taking after a month because it didn't help)

- I'm pretty sure I suffer dissociative disorder

- I have zero post-graduate prospects

With all these, I have no hope (or wish, even) of getting a job after university, since I just do not have any desire to work a 9-5 job for the next 40 years of my life. I feel like I do not fit in society. 

I had the pleasure of speaking to a few vets on happenstance, they all spoke positively about their experiences, and spoke very highly about how much it invested in them. I mentioned how I am fluent in Persian (while illiterate) and spent a year in the Air Cadets while I was at Secondary School, and they all said the same thing: ""Join the Air Force as a Rupert"".

I understand that as I am, I will need to focus on my psychological issues and physical fitness - losing some weight and ditching the depression. However, these are things I was looking towards doing after I graduated anyway.

The real question I have right now is, should I give the military a go? As I feel like I have no other real desire to find a job working in an office. Will the Military even look at me considering it's on my medical record that I suffer depression and anxiety?

It’s been about a week and a half and it gets a tad better at times, but at the same time it still pulls my heart or what’s left of it. I get sudden flashes of memories and I remain still just thinking about what we were as if I’m trying to relive that memory to it’s fullest. My mind &amp; self still have not understood nor want to come to terms that it’s over. 

It seems as though I cannot let go, unless it’s just too early? Through those 4 years I was molding everything we told each other into my head and I believed it all, trusted it all with everything I had. I feel like I gave everything to her, handed her my heart because I trusted her, gave my soul to be with hers. My mind and body feel drained, all this is extremely overwhelming mentally. 

Why can’t I let go? When will I be? I understand people say to keep busy, but I don’t have anybody to hang out with where I am and I’m not very social. When I was with her, my whole life revolved around her, all I wanted was nothing more than to just be in her presence because that gave me life, gave me the purest form of happiness. Now that we’re split, I remain alone, sometimes with completely nothing to do, thus leading to strong thoughts of what was. It’s constantly just sitting there, feeling that void of all emotions absent.

In the most truth of it all, somehow I believe she wasn’t meant for me and I truly think there’s somebody out there, but I don’t think I’ll ever meet them. I’ve never felt so alone, time will tell, as I’ve been told. But till that said time is told, I don’t have anything to keep my mind busy, nobody to hangout with. If anybody is reading this, I thank you for being there, &amp; if anybody comments, I greatly appreciate you reaching out, seriously.

I've tried telling them in a mature manner that there are lines I don't want them crossing, and I've given them several chances. However, they continue to have no boundaries and just verbally ambush me at every family gathering. I'm not sure why they specifically target me, I've never done anything to warrant it. 


I know plenty of you might say ""don't mind them, you're being the bigger man."" But honestly it's really starting to piss me off, the fact that they have the nerve to treat me the way they do gets to me.


The only reason why I haven't cut them off by now is because I have a great deal of respect for their parents (my aunt and uncle). But literally every time I see them, they really bring me down and partially reverse my progress with the depression. I've decided with 99% certainty to completely cut them off.

260,"This is going to sound really stupid and superficial, but please hear me out.

It’s not surprising for a 16 year old to claim to have fallen for a celebrity. That was me. And I could honestly tell you it was more than just a celebrity crush. I will not deny that I find him incredibly physically attractive until now, but his soul was more beautiful in every way, shape and form. I very clearly remember how much he inspired me to take on goals and challenges and how much he made me grow into a better person. It stayed like that for a year, his hardworking, caring, loving, polite, and humble attitude inspired me so much to become a better person.

I dreamed of meeting him one day, to thank him for being able to bring out the best in me. I dreamed that one day it would be my turn to take care of him and to ensure his happiness the way he did with mine. And when I revealed this embarrassing and delusional-sounding dream to my best friend, I was ecstatic to find out she felt the same way about another celebrity. I thought we could both work hard on getting to the right places to be able to be with the ones we said we loved.

I knew what everyone else thought. How much of what I saw from him is actually him? We all know celebrities have on-camera personas. And no matter how much the media and everyone else claimed that he was genuine, there is really a part of him I wouldn’t see unless I personally got to know him. I understood the risks and shame of taking on this dream. But I pushed onward.

Except now I’m 17. A lot can happen in a year. A lot of things happened and I wasn’t as updated with my dream boy as I used to be. I slowly drifted away from him. I acknowledge that he was once my happiness but now when I see him, those feelings are long gone. He is still beautiful but it doesn’t evoke the feeling of me wanting to be his anymore.

But my best friend still loves the celebrity she did from before, while my feelings for my dream boy are long gone. In fact, I’m developing feelings for people within my reach. She will be so disappointed in me that I no longer want to pursue this dream with her. She’ll feel incredibly disgusted with my lack of dedication. Up until now she still thinks I love him. What should I do? 

tl;dr: My best friend and I made elaborate and passionate plans to reach our goals of getting into relationships with celebrities we claimed we loved. I don’t share that dream with her anymore because I’ve moved on. My friend is petty, if she finds out I don’t share the dream anymore she will start a huge fuss over it that could end badly.

I feel so ashamed of myself. It never happened before. It’s the first time I actually fall in love with a girl.

She has her own circle of friends and probably is straight.
I don’t even know why did it happen. She’s smart, popular, beautiful, successful everything I want to be. She has everything I don’t.

I’m so jealous. And in love.

I don’t know what to do. How to get over it?

It affects my daily life, I start to act weird when she’s around... my heart beats faster

I hate myself for falling for someone who has everything I don’t, my enemy. Help.

he just waves it off saying “not everything has to be talked about” but i don’t get over shit like that. i have bpd and anxiety and i can’t just not have him tell me how he’s feeling about me. 

and i’ll try and and try to press him to talk to me but then at a certain point he’ll turn it on me and say that i’m “overwhelming him” and “i’m too much for him”. i try to explain that’s not what i’m trying to do and to please have a conversation with me 

at this point he’ll say i need to leave him alone and give him his space. and it’s hard because i’m just trying to resolve this conflict. and then he gets mad for not giving him space so eventually i will. 

after he’s had his space, which could be anywhere from a few hours to almost a week, i try to go and restart the conversation where we left off. then he says he’s “over it” and it doesn’t matter and i should just let it go and drop it. by when i don’t drop it and insist we should talk, he accuses me of “bringing up old shit” and makes me feel irrational for trying to resolve past conflicts that are still currently affecting me. 

this leaves me feeling shitty, depressive, paranoid that he’s going to walk out of my life etc and then we never talk about it because he doesn’t want to talk about it in the moment but then doesn’t let me bring it up ever again.

repeat for every single argument, big or small, that we’ve ever had. how do i deal with this? how do i give him his space but still resolve our conflicts. ",22Mar2018,2

287,"TL:DR       Okay so a little background here, we’ve been best friends for about 3 years now and I’ve kinda always liked her but it was mostly on and off, nothing too serious. We know each other better than anyone. Everytime she gets a boyfriend I can’t help but feel jealous but I get over it quick. This past summer she was single and I was ready to tell her that I liked her but next thing I knew she was already dating someone else. It hurt but I got over it pretty quick. It might be somewhat important to point out that I go to a different school not far from her since the beginning of this year (might transfer back next year). Once school started, we didn’t talk too much but with her it’s like we can go without talking for months and it’s like nothing happened and we can return to how we always were. Lately though, we have been talking A LOT over the phone and texting each other. She tells me that she wants to spend a lot of time with me in the summer and that she misses me a lot. This feeling of love started to grow on me and it’s so, so strong, I know it’s love because she’s on my mind 24/7 and I get jealous just thinking about her being with her bf. The thought of her being with someone else just kills me. Some nights I can’t even sleep thinking about her. I’ve been debating wether I should tell her now, wait some time to see if it’s real, or not tell her at all and just wait on until I get over her (if I can). I’ve thought of many possible outcomes and I’m very much in need of help. I will appreciate anything and everything. Thanks!",22Mar2018,2

290,"I don’t know what to do. I wanted to join the navy after I graduated highschool. My parents put in effort to convince me not to. I promised I would try college for their sake so that I wouldn’t blame them later for not making me go to school. I graduated highschool last year, got a job and went to college. I ended up quitting my job half way through the semester because I wasn’t able to juggle both things effectively. I hated college, and failed most of my classes. This resulted in me dropping out before they gave me academic probation and took away all of my financial aid. This is when I thought “there, I tried college, now lets do what I planned on doing from the start”. Shortly after dropping out, I started my enlistment process. This is when I started questioning myself whether or not I’m mentally prepared to handle the stress of military life. At the same time, my mom got really sick. And so I backed out of joining.

295,"Hi 

I feel stuck in my life at the moment and dont know where to turn or how to help myself and my family.

Going to where it all began (i will try to include as many detail extra which are relevant)

My son is 23 he asked to move home 6 months ago after a fiery relationship went south. At new year he went on a new year bender with pals for 3-4 days. We were woken 1.30am police banging on door looking for him. They literally raided the house(we complained after) searchlights in our kids rooms, 13+19. Turns out our son had been drink driving and then ran away from the police and they thought they saw him going into our house, which he didnt. In total shock of all this he was eventually found 20 mins later and arrested. Long story short he was charged for drink driving and obstructing the course of justice. Afterwards he confessed to taking all the drugs going and that he drinks to forget then needs an extra ‘thing’ at the end to forget. (His father abandoned him when he was 9. Im his step dad and brought him up basically. Love him to bits. We have spoken about his dad lots and he showed no signs of holding in emotion). He isnt a big drinker so only did the drugs when he binged once twice a month max. 

We got him into drug and alcohol help, with councelling and took him to gp. Sorted a good solicotor and stood by him with the promise he would turn his life around. Over the last few months he would be angry upset happy all the emotions but seems to be getting there.

This brings me onto why i post this.

I have so much anger for the hurt he put his mother, myself and his brother and sister and family through. We still have nightmares from the police banging. Knocks at the door loud ones scare us. If he is in a bad mood we have no time for it. Im not coping well with day to day life with him around, he is still living at home we support him emotionally the best we can but he has splintered the family and its a shell of what we used to be. As he moves on were left behind and i cant shift the feeling of anger frustration.

Has anyone been through similar, how did you cope? Does it get easier.

Thanks in advance

296,"Hey there everyone. If I could get advice on this ASAP, that would be grand.

I was supposed to go visit and sleepover at my friend's room (in a university) today and leave for work in the morning, but he told me earlier that's pretty sick (but to still come). Pretty sick, according to him, apparently means a lot of sneezing and coughing.

I personally have just gotten over a cold and am in the last stages of it, so I'm not worried about getting ill. What I'm bothered by is the fact that we would largely be in his *very* small room, with him coughing/sneezing in such a close proximity. I also imagine that he'd be more tired than usual, so that could cut into our hangout time. Sleeping together is out of the question now, so I'd have to sleep on the floor too. Then there's all the other things that come with visiting a uni such as finding/paying for parking, bringing stuff to shower in a stall, only having the one key to his room, no meal swipes since he used them all, etc. The plan was to play video games (I have to bring my PS4) and maybe watch something.

I know this seems super trivial and mundane, but I don't know. I really wanted to get out of my house for the day/night too because my family is irritating me atm. But I don't know if I would be more uncomfortable over there with him. 

So, should I do it? ",22Mar2018,1

300,"After several years working in education a health issue caused me to have to resign.

I was sad to leave as I made a lot of wonderful work friends and a few friends I still see outside of work.

My husband makes great money so there was no need for me to have to return to work full time after my recovery. I now work a very part time gig in a retail shop and am a stay-at-home wife.

We are expecting our first child and my mother wants to throw me a baby shower.

I'm really confused on the etiquette about asking people to attend. I work with three ladies at the shop who I know I want to invite, and obviously my couple of close friends. However, 5 people does not a party make, and I live far away from extended family.

I'd like to invite some former work friends, but I haven't seen some of them in person for years. We are friendly on Facebook, but as I'm sure you know Facebook ""friends"" can sometimes be a loose term. 

Basically, I would really love to share this special time in my life with people, and I would LOVE an excuse to see some former co workers I haven't seen in a long time, but I don't want people to think I'm inviting them just as a ""gift grab"" move. 

I thought about asking for no gifts...but then it's just an awkward social event with no men and no booze and my mom and husband say there's no point in going through the trouble and expense of hosting a party with no gifts.

A friend suggested a couples shower. That would double the attendance level, but doesn't address my wanting to see people I haven't seen in a long time.

What is the etiquette here? Am I overlooking an option D?

307,"Hi guys, I really need some help and perspective here, so I will try to lay this out as simply as possible:

-----

**History**

I've had this friend since high school, that quickly developed into a best friend. We've been threw allot together, and have been very close for about ~6 years. We've since moved to different countries, but remain in good contact.

We have allot of common interests, inside jokes, talk practically everyday (or a few messages) and work together on music. 

There have been many fights and fall outs through out the years, some that were rather serious, but eventually we always talked it out and resolved it, as you do with good friends. We are both male and early twenties.

**Similar Problems in the Past**

There have been times where he's straight up disrespected me, such as saying ""*Fuck you*"" mid-convo and then leaving until tomorrow, simply because ""*that's what he was feeling at the time*"" (his own words) and he didn't like a light hearted joke I made about him (we constantly joke) so I stopped making that joke. He kept trying to brush it off as ""*that's just how I felt* 🤷"" but I insisted that I wasn't OK with it, and asked him ""*you would be OK if I did the same to you?*"" after a day or so he lightly apologized and we moved on.

I've been very annoyed about MANY of his jokes that I found offensive (about my health problems.etc) and told him so, but this didn't stop him. He still pokes fun at sensitive topics he knows I will hate. But oh well, right? Classic example of someone who can **dish-it-out** but can't take it.

There was this one time where I hadn't opened Facebook Messenger yet, but opened Instagram instead, and answered him there first. His reaction was (his words) ""*Oh you can reply to my pictures but not to me huh??*"" ""*OMG this is the worst thing a person can do, to see messages and not answer*"" I was honestly about to reply to his messages (thay weren't important or urgent) but he made sure I felt terrible about replying on Instagram first for 10 minutes.

Another time, he promised TWICE that a music service of his would be free (his choice) because I'm a friend and he wanted to help. But last minute decided that he wants to charge me (approx. $1000) because he changed his mind.

**Current Situation**

Fast forward a bit, I had an idea for a cool yet simple product, and he told me I should sell it. I replied with agreeing and that I might actually invest in my idea.

I told him that If I actually make it, I'll give him a percentage of the product and company because he gave me the idea to make and sell my idea.

He flips out, (his words) ""*What, 1 percent? Then do it yourself*"" I said no, maybe 10 or 15 percent, just to say thank you. I would do all the work, because we're in different countries and this simple product is in my area of expertise. ""*50/50 makes sense, or maybe 60/40, but not anything less*""

I take a minute, maybe he misunderstood that I wouldn't need his help? In comparision, when he was starting his music label, I really wanted to be involved and asked to partner, but he declined. Saying ""*this is how it's done*"" and that was the end of it. I was sad but had to accept his decision.

**Back to now:** I explained that this idea of mine is so simple, why would I split and partner? We're far from eachother and this is a 1 man job.

He flips again, ""*You're being greedy, what a shame*"" ""*I wanted to sell it, but you would be hell to work with anyways, forget it*""

As you know (**read above**) I've had many opportunities to call him greedy, but didn't and tried explaining my thoughts in more respectful language. He's litteraly done THE SAME THING MANY TIMES but without caring, and now that he's not getting his way 100%, he's resorting to being a hypocrite and disrespectful.

After this I sent a few more messages, laying out why it isn't fair to call me greedy, and trying to give comparisons (like his label) so he would understand more.

It was at this point where he left in the middle of this important conversation. But he's done this before, saying that he needs to cool down because he's too ""*emotional*"" (his words again) and gets back to me later or the next day. Turns out he straight up leaves me on *Seen* for 3 days straight, reading every but not replying to any of my multiple messages the likes of ""Hello???"" and ""Can we talk? What happened, I was thinking"".etc. As you know, he would (understandably) be furious if I did anything even close to this.

So I expected him to come back and give his ""*sorry I had to leave I was too emotional*"" or a rebutle to something I wrote, but no. ""Sorry was busy"". What a conicidence that he was so busy that he could **read** everything I send but not even send a ""Busy talk later"" text for 3 days? And that he left mid-convo when he didn't get what he wanted?

After pointing this out, his response was:

""*I'm a hypocrite*""

""*I don't care, why should I?*""

""*Let it go, get over it, move on*""

It's painfully obvious that this was a *punishment* to me not needing to partner with him. How can I be *friends* or let alone **work** with someone who will ghost me for days when he's not getting his way, and then pretend that I'm too stupid to notice?

---

We're both adults here, I understand that people get busy and can't talk, but when it's obvious that this was intentional (leaving messages on seen for 3 days) and that he dips during important convos when he's not happy, and acts like I don't know what he's doing, It makes me want to stop being friends all together. It's like he's suddenly turned into this selfish douche-bag that feels he can treat people like shit and they'll just have to ""deal with it"". He's sending innocent messages like ""What did I do bro"" and ""What's up"" as if he doesn't know (I told him)

308,"Repost from r/confessions 

First time posting and with a throwaway account. I'm also gonna preface this by saying I'm taking up a friends advice to type/write out my current feelings rather than just keep it bottled up and maybe just hopefully I can gain some additional insight or just a little more peace. Apologies if this is all over the place and if there's any questions please feel free to let me know and I'll answer to the best of my capability.

I was inspired to do this post after I saw a r/coolguide on the concept of ""Ikigai"". After going reading it through and applying it in a more personal context it was amusing and too accurate when I saw ""Comfortable but feeling of emptiness"" which was the entire 3/4 of the venn diagram except missing the ""love"" aspect. I'm currently in my late 20s and I honestly don't know or rather I'm not sure of my life. And honestly this whole lack of ""assurance"" or confidence only started after my 1st serious relationship fell through.

I'd like to say I reflect a lot but I've also kinda of got a bit of a short fuse. A person with a lot of charisma that can lead and take charge. But from what I understand or from what others have told me, I lack confidence. I am a very blunt person. Superbly blunt. In terms of my personality, I push myself. I mean really push myself. Do I like to push myself? I'm not sure but I just do. Push myself mentality, physically, emotionally, etc. If there's a limit, if there's something in my way, if it's something I've determined or see as an obstacle I have to overcome it no matter what. In my head I have something like, ""If you don't overcome this you die, if you stop you die; therefore there is no choice but to overcome it. Stronger, faster; evolve. You must evolve."". I respect and maintain the status quo but if it's something is accepted by a group but I don't feel well with. Well... Let's just say I'm no longer friends or associate myself with these people. I don't long for romantic love as much and as desperately as I used to after my ex broke up with me. However I don't deny that I still want, envy it and am bitter at those who have it.

Now before you ask, ""so what happened with your ex?"". To quickly summarize, my ex was roughly 8 years younger than me. We knew each other through friends but didn't really talk to each other. One thing lead to another and then we started dating. My ex was (still is) young and had their problems before with bad relations and from what I knew they had been jumping into a new relationship each time one fell through. Didn't think too much of it. We dated for a few years until my less stellar relationship abilities caused my ex to basically jump ship. Oh and jump ship they did to another person in less than 2 weeks. I was able to piece everything together that my ex was emotionally cheating on me for the longest time and that final event was basically their ticket to jump to their safety net. It sucks when my ex said they would give me a chance to prove myself but then again was like ""nope, it ain't gonna work"". It sucks even harder when they attempted to make me the safety net when my ex wasn't sure of their current relationship as they were afraid they were going to ""screw up this new relationship"".

The last time they tried to get in contact with me was roughly a year ago when they attempted to text me twice (telling me they were going to visit and they would like to avoid triggering me""), a phone call, a voicemail (same message) and finally an email (asking if I had changed my phone number). I ran into them one more time at an event but as soon as my ex saw me, immediately stopped dead on their feet like slamming on the brakes and with a face like a deer in a headlight, then proceed to jump out, run out and pass by again with their current S.O. while avoiding me.

Yeah. I guess I avoided a doozy. Ok. Avoided a crazy. Yeah now I know what is co-dependent and how dependent they are. But damn if I don't miss them. I really do... I want to say how much I miss them but at the same time I also realize that despite these 2 years that have passed ever since they dumped me, even if I were to sit down to talk; I realize that I'm still hurt and that all that would come out of my mouth or my desires is to payback or have Hamlet type, Shakespearean level revenge.

Now my current life is... good? I mean I have a good job, good finances, I'm great with my family, engaging in my hobbies(?), working out (have a decent bod) and when I'm talking to people I no longer have the gloom doom and can mask it away with the charismatic personality and charms that I have and am. I honestly have a very blessed and lucky life. But in all honestly right now I still feel hollow and empty . Don't get me wrong, I'm like 99.9% sure I'm not depressed. Went to get myself checked and I don't have anger issues or depression issues just ""living out the current state"" of my life. I still feel bummed and I'm still faking it through life all because for the sole lame reason of... ""I'm not in a relationship"" or ""I miss what I had"" or ""if I only I got back what I lost"". Yeah... lame.... Oh right. I'm also self-deprecating.

I've heard the advice of going out to meet people or check with friends or put myself out there. Honestly with my work and activities I prefer to go home and chill afterwards. I mean yeah I go to an arcade and put myself out by playing various musical games and they draw attention. But yeah I don't feel the ""need"" to want to talk to women. Like it's weird, I want a relationship/date but yet I don't want to talk because ""it takes too much time and effort"". I honestly haven't found people that I've really wanted to ""chase"" or ""pursue"" or that I'm really interested in. I also understand that one of my fears is that I'll never be in another romantic relationship. Or worse I won't be satisfied with the next relationship as it won't meet my needs or my specific yet general wants.

I've gone through self-reflection phase; I've gone through the meditation/life-advice phase; I've gone through the religious phase; now I've back in the ""so this is how I was"" phase + baggage from recent experiences. Like really, I'm comfortable but feeling emptiness. I keep on trying to figure out my life. Where I should go? What should I do? What am I waiting for? It's just overall feeling of not knowing that makes me unsatisfied, uncertain and just lost. I'm not sure if I should be doing more like talking more to random people, putting myself out there even more, go to more bars, to go to more clubs or do more of... something(?).

TL;DR: Living a ""comfortable but emptying feeling life"". Few years back co-dependent ex ditched me for someone else a couple weeks later and messed me up. I'm very self-reflective, self-deprecating, charismatic and smart about me. Realize and know a lot of things about myself. Not depressed. Gone through many phases now back to normal ""how I was"" phase + trauma/baggage because of break-up. Engaged/active in activities. Want a relationship yet I don't want to put in the effort while also realizing that they are a hassle. Not sure what to do with my life. Not sure if I should do more.

315,"I struggled to find internships in the past. I've applied to the ones advertised on company websites and got rejected from all of them. This probably has to do with how I have a poor GPA and the competition is too big.

I asked a few professors about hidden internships and they told me how many companies have hidden internship opportunities. Since these companies do not publicise these internship opportunities, not that many people apply to them so it is relatively easy to get them. All of these companies are very small though and chances are they will not have any official job openings by the time I graduate.

316,"Hello, I’ll try to make this short. I’m in grade 12 and I’m a guy, and basically my friends at school who are girls have been really into parties and drinking and stuff since grade 10. My boys on the other hand have pretty much stayed away from that stuff, we go to parties once in a while with the girls and we drink a tiny bit, but we don’t get drunk or anything. I personally do not drink at all, as I don’t have a better time when I drink, and I try to stay healthy. Recently, the girls that I’m friends with started doing nicotine spray, and they are addicted to it. They can’t go a couple days without doing it. Also just recently, my friends that are boys gave into peer pressure and they like feeling accepted in parties and stuff, so now they like getting really drunk with the girls. The problem for me, is that now I can’t really go and hang out with my friends, because every time they hang out they are drinking and they have really hype vibes and they get super into it, and I just can’t because I hate drinking and I find it to be incredibly immature and boring to be doing that stuff. I’m really introverted, so I actually really like being alone and not going to those parties, but I feel like I’m losing my friends because of this. Any advice for any of this?

I went along with it for a couple of months until her stepmom found us naked in bed together. Shortly after that I moved far, far away and somehow his daughter managed to become my best friend. 

Now its five years later. I went back to visit. I figured everything that happened was so far in the past. It would be fine. Nope. When we were alone he told me how much he'd fantasized about me over the years and many other things. I was shocked when he picked me up and started undressing me. I got out of there before it went too far. Now Im going to see my friend for the first time since then. I am very upset.

They were also scattered on the sidewalk in front of my patio. Later i walked my dog and found them on the sidewalks on streets around my block as well.

338,"Going to try and keep it short.

Student, 24, last year, I like my educational path and want to study even further if possible. I fell in love with boxing approximately 4 months ago, and I always have had a knack for sports. I'm athletic and in shape, and I just love exercise. In 4 months I have developed my skills exponentially and have people tell me that for 4 months I'm really an outlier, basically telling me I'm really talented. At this point, I fucking LOVE boxing. I do it for fun and as exercise. I only sparred twice because I don't have a sparring partner, which went horribly as I expected, but it has consumed me. I train EVERY day. Now, I know that if I would devote more time to boxing, I might reach an amateur level pretty soon (2years?). I currently do not have the resources for boxing, and I'm wondering if not pursuing what I love is going to be something I'll regret forever. Till 4 months ago, I had no idea what I was going to do with my life. Now I know it has to be in boxing, doesn't matter what. Should I consider becoming a boxer after I get my degree, and work part-time jobs to get around, or should I pursue my original path, which is to get a masters degree in circular economics and minor business innovation?

For veteran box fans: I'm slick, fast, smart, flowy, rhythmic in every movement, and I try to look good while doing it.I do not know how or why I have this competence. All I need is proper boxing guidance if I were to pursue this ""dream"". I have this desire to show the world what I can do, a driving passion. Tell me the harsh truth.",22Mar2018,2
339,"***Please do not take my experience as justification to follow in my footsteps, taking Rx medicine that is not prescribed to you by a doctor can result in very bad and or harmful consequences*** 

This is not a post asking how I can get a doctor to prescribe me medicine. I have no desire to use this medicine for anything more than what it is meant for. Please read the story below and if you have good advice please share it. If you would like to just see my question scroll to the ""*"" towards the bottom, although the background information pertains greatly to the question. 

I am a 18 year old male High school student and today i tried Adorall. i am here to both share what i learned and ask for advice on approaching my parents.

For the longest time its sort of been a running joke that i have ADD, i understand that it is not something to joke about, but it has never been meant to be serious as much as it has been to poke at the fact that i have a very short attention span. I've never considered that it might be true until recently.

My grades have started to slip and my parents consider anything bellow a B average unacceptable. So in efforts to help my grades I went in search for my options. My first approach was not my idea but it is my parents first go to, loss of my phone. the reason being that I of coarse want my phone back so they assume i will try harder. This was true i did try harder, I began studying more and trying harder to pay attention. The only problem is that i still found myself unable to sit down and stay with one task.

I have always known of Aderall and what it was for, but never had interest in it because i am not exactly a fan of altering my way of thinking. Honestly the idea of taking Rx medication makes me slightly worried just because of there being an abundance of views on the subject from every point of view, making it hard to do any type of research. Eventually I found myself in the conclusion that i was going to try the medication myself and I'd decide if it was right for me. So i acquired an Aderall pill (I am currently unsure of the Mg measurement) and took it at school with my breakfast.

The reason I attempted to research the medicine was so that I was prepared for the effect and not put into any sort of situation where I was uncomfortable. One thing that I am certain of is that only maybe 10% of my research was even remotely correct. I was put into something that was so much bigger than the picture that the internet had painted. That being said, it was not a negative experience what so ever.

I was presented with a new mind set of being able to have a choice in my productivity. Normally i would sit down with a task and tell myself that I was going to do it and then 30 seconds later I would find myself doing the complete opposite because i was distracted by something. Today i was able to sit and tell myself that i was going to complete my school work and to my amazement the next thing i knew i was done. I was able to sit and listen to the teacher and grasp what he/she was teaching and much better understand the lesson. This was expected because it is an ADD medication so it didn't strike me as weird.

After a while of making self observations of what i was feeling, and looking at the comparison to my normal day, I came to the realization the i felt sort of ""free in my mind"" for a lack of better explanation. I have suffered from social anxiety since my freshman year. I often worry that I may sound stupid for something that I want to say, so most of the time i say little to nothing at all unless i am talking to someone who i feel very comfortable around. The presence of the anxiety is constant, but varies in severity. It can range from simple things like not talking, or being generally nervous, all the was to over analyzing the way i walk and grinding my teeth because I feel like people may judge me. After taking the medicine i felt free from all of that anxiety. I was able to carry on a full regular conversation with people who normally i would never talk to. I felt completely okay with raising my hand to ask questions and even volunteer some answers. I felt confident in the way I carried myself down the hallway and I felt comfortable in my own skin. I do not consider myself to suffer from enough depression that is worth worrying about, but after my anxiety went away i was a new person in terms of happiness. Not being under stress has never been a real option to me because it is just something that I've always had to accept having, but i was stress free all day, not saying that i wasn't concerned with school work, but i was concerned as apposed to worried about it. 

*
The medicine worked for me and changed my ability to learn and pay attention enormously, so i would like to see a doctor to consult about whether this medicine is something that could help me. My problem is that i do not know how to approach my parents about seeing a doctor.

My question to you all is, Do you have any suggestions to help me decide what to do? I think i will give myself a few days to think about it, but if i am going to approach them i would prefer it be some time soon.

I appreciate anyone who could leave a suggestion for me.

Thank you for taking the time to read my forever lengthy post I hope that if you also came in search of help with a common problem that my post was of use to you.

340,"So I'm in band and failed the most recen quarter, which is the first time this happened. I assumed I would somehow play in a competition despite this, and even said I was playing in that competition. I was told I was ineligible to participate today and I don't know if I can let my parents down now due to me struggling with grades the past few months after being an A/B student. Since the competition is during school and we get back at an hour and a half after school ends, I considered these two choices:
A. Tell them now last minute and dissapoint them and probably lose some reliability or
B. Stay after school and act like I went along, which means I stay behind when everyone else goes. However, if I get caught, I'm screwed.
