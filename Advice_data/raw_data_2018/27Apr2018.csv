0,"Hello everyone and thanks for reading!

To start I’m a 23yr old male and currently work as a server in a restaurant. I’ve gone through a lot of stress lately and am starting to feel very angry and fed up that I’m still stuck working at a restaurant after 4 years. I have a potential job that I could start this Thursday but it pays less however I feel that I would be a lot let stressed and be able to budget and organize my life better if I worked a normal 8-4 job. Anyone have any advice?

(Also the new job would be working for the humane society that I adopted both of my dogs from, so that’s sort of why I’m so excited/interested in it)",27Apr2018,2

5,"For the past 2-3 years, I've dealt with a plethora of mental health issues, from social anxiety, depression etc. to inability to fall asleep at night, and wake up in the morning. My senior year has been particularly bad, and I'm sitting here 2 months away from grad failing 5 out of 8 classes (two of which I am sitting at 10%) and so overwhelmed with my part-time job and school that I feel completely trapped. 

As mentioned above, I suffer from depression, social anxiety, and what I believe is insomnia, but my doctor and parents believe is simply a completely ass-backward sleeping pattern. The limit for absences from class for a senior where I'm from is 60. Although I am not positive on the quantity I've racked up, I'd estimate it to be well over 100, possibly nearing, or even over 150. I spoke to my school councillor and principle, and they said if I made the effort to improve my attendance, they'd waive the 60 class limit. So I made the effort. Went 2 weeks without missing a single class, which is absolutely unheard of for me at this point in the year. Fast forward another 2 weeks and I have been to 1, maybe 2 morning classes in the last 2 weeks.

I simply do not know what my issue is, my doctor doesn't know what my problem is, nor do my parents. We all know I've been depressed, and I've been prescribed anti-depressants and have been taking them, but they only improved my situation for a limited amount of time, and now I cannot get in to see my doctor again for a month. By that time, it will be too late, although it more than likely is already too late. I have absolutely zero motivation to do school work whatsoever, and on days I don't work, I just lie in bed or play video games due to sheer exhaustion, and lack of motivation. The worst part is everyone around me knows I'm more than smart enough to graduate. I'm a straight A/B student, but there's some sort of invisible wall blocking me from achieving my goals, and my lack of comprehension on why I feel this way is incredibly frustrating. The only people who know I feel this way are my parents, and my doctor. I don't like to tell anyone about my depression, because I don't want my friends to treat me differently and 'baby' me. Believe me, I love to joke around, and I can take a roast/insult like a champ. 

I have a very good and wide group of friends, I get invited out to parties, I'm confident in my looks, my family life is fantastic, and my parents blessed me with a beautiful car for my first car 2 or 3 months ago. I feel as though I'm living most high school kids dream life, and yet I hate almost every aspect of it. I'm essentially your average suburban white kid who lives in a big house, doesn't worry about anything financially, and has parents who make sacrifices to ensure every opportunity available to me is a possibility. All of which makes me almost feel guilty about being so demotivated and depressed all the time. To add on to all of this my brother, who is only 3 years older than me already has his entire life figured out and has found a fantastic career that he is overly happy with. It almost makes me feel as though I'm a failure, considering I will more than likely be the only one out of my friend group not to graduate, and I have absolutely no idea what I want to do after high school.

So, for anyone who has ever been in this situation, or knows someone who has been in this situation, or even has the slightest bit of advice, what do I do? What can I do? I feel like I'm drowning with not a single life vest in sight. Also apologies for the long post, and if I repeated myself at all. I'm kind of just rambling, and trying to explain my story as quickly and efficiently as possible.",27Apr2018,2

It's not that I was cruel to my younger brother--we had lots of fun as kids and pretty never got in fights, but he just didn't get enough attention from me or from my parents when our older brother got sick.

12,"So currently I'm not doing very well in highschool. I have anemia and lack of vitamin D severely so this has cause me to feel tired and depressed all the time. I can say this has definitely taken a toll on my grades. I'm failing so many classes right now and I just really hate the situation I'm in! We have one month of school left. I'm taking a good amount of honors classes, but not doing very well. It's not that they're hard for me I'm just not motivated. So I've thought about maybe joining the military?  I was hoping for the airforce. (I feel like the military will give me structure and teach me to get things done. I will most definitely become more motivated in college because it's leading up to what I hope to do in life. I've already failed at hs so this is why I feel hopeless about it).I know all you need is a highschool diploma and all they care about is the ASVAB scores(according to the research I've done). I really want to go to college and pursue my career in the medical field. I will put in 100% to make sure it happens. But how can I go about this without having to do community college?

I'm stressing out over my future and I don't want it to be ruined because I didn't succeed in highschool. Could ROTC pay for my college, I do what I need to do in the military and continue my education career and maybe become my dream job which is anesthesiology or something of the nature?

14,"There is a core group if about six boys between the ages of 6 and 13 that roam around the apartment complex wreaking havoc. They throw river rocks and regular rocks at me sometimes. Recently they all got skateboards and have been grinding the staircase leading to my apartment. The staircase seves four units, and there are 16 units per apartment building. They are townhome style, and they don't live in my building. I have NO IDEA who their parents are and have a vague idea if where they live.

Today after 5 minutes of failed grinds and flips rattling my windows I went outside and said ""Please do that somehwre else"". That's it. They said okay and left for like a minute. Three came back and started back up. Five more minutes and I contacted management to ask them to say something. They said they would. Ten more minutes after that and I was at my wit's end. I am 33 years old, single, and have no patience for this racket.

So I went back out on my porch and snapped a picture of the kids skating for management to figure out who they were. A kid asked what I was doing and I explained that, adding ""Since y'all apparently can't follow directions"". ""well, we did move three inches away like you asked"" one smartass replied. I said ""I don't give a shit how far you moved, fuck off"".

I'm not proud of myself for using bad language in front of kids but the way I see it is they think they are badass adults who can do what they want, and their parents think they are adult enough to be given skatboards and allowed to do what the fuck they want on other people's porchess, so maybe it is time they got spoken to like adults. As far as I know I haven't committed a crime. But I am concerned about parental backlash now. At least I might get to know who their parents are this time.

I have one of the three choices, go through radiation therapy, have surgery to have another layer of the section removed, or have the whole breast removed to have implants. I am afraid for my life for this cancer to grow back again due to my history of having many medical problems in the past but at the same time I am afraid once I lose my breasts and have fake ones my significant other will lost interest in me because they will feel significantly different. I've seen how some women's breasts look fake and it has me absolutely anxious at the fact if I go through that route I have a chance my breasts looking bad.

17,"I currently work in a retail job for a little over a year now and was hired by luck because the manager said I seemed nice. Anyway, I'm looking to leave my job because it's time to move on and management isn't that great but that's a story for another time. 

It first started when the manager that hired me quit and started managing another store. One of my coworkers recommended me since at that time she needed new employees but she said no because my voice is too quiet. 

As you can see, this started to be other places who I intervew for concern. I have a naturally quiet voice, even when I try to speak loud it can still get drowned out. It's just who I am, although I do socialize just fine.

Today it really got to me because I did a trial at one of the jobs I interviewed for a few days ago. Although mostly everything was fine, the manager pulled me aside and said her biggest concern was that my voice isn't loud enough to interact with the customers at the restaurant. I do understand her concern and I guess this is one of my biggest weaknesses as a person. I do think I can do the job well though besides that, which is something I am actively trying to work on. 

So, the advice I am asking for is how can I be a more vocal person or speak loud enough where employers will be satisfied? Also, should I send a thank you email to her telling her that if she hires me I will work on being louder? 

Tl;dr Naturally quiet person seeking advice on how to be louder since employers think I speak too quiet.

My AP psychology teacher was straight up angry with me for not taking it and she’s gone as far as to offer to pay for my exam and sign me up against my will. After telling her “no” multiple times, she backed off.

Someone had registered for their test and decided to not take it anymore, so that leaves a spot open for someone to come in and take their place. When my teacher announced this to my class, she singled me out and made it obvious for the whole class that I wasn’t taking it and that she wanted me to.

We've talked about how we're not wanting to settle down into a serious relationship (multiple times). That we just want someone to share ""right now"" with. 

At the beginning of April, I realized that I had feelings for him and ended up having a really big week with work and I started getting sick. I was super emotional and leant on him way too much and I think I really overstepped. I've apologized to him for this and we've moved on. 

It's hard because he's not great at communicating and I feel like I have to probe to get answers. He says that because he spends time with me, it should be obvious that he cares about me. So I stopped asking. 

Now he's not texting as much, he isn't making plans to ""hang out"" (we normally ""hung out"" every saturday-sunday afternoon). 

I feel like I moved way too fast for him too soon, and I'm trying to recover.

The doctor told me she strongly believes it is because of a peptic ulcer, or at least gastritis. However, they can't do a pylori test since I have been on antacids, so they want me to do a gastroscopy. 

In the meantime though, they gave me stronger antacids and stronger nausea medication, and I am on a bland diet. I think they are helping, but I still find myself with a few bad episodes a day, which is not allowing me to do the things that I need to do. I have a presentation tomorrow, and finals next week, and then graduation. My stomach feels worse when I'm stressed out, and I'm really worried for tomorrow, and for next week, but mostly I am worried about getting through the day tomorrow. Does anyone have any advice on how to lower stress even while having to do stressful things?

I've just been so depressed and I find myself crying because this is the worst possible time to not be feeling well. When I start feeling really sick, I get a panic attack because I have a phobia of throwing up, and I have a very hard time calming myself down, especially in public.

45,"Heya, this may sound weird but is there a company that I can pay to keep a DNA sample of me long term stable?

Like basically as far as I know, DNA starts to detoriate around the age of 25 and later. This process is generally known as aging and brings all the nice stuff of feeling bad, having bone pain, etc.

So in short, if we ever find a technology that can revert DNA, I will need a sample of how I was before my DNA went to shit. So is there a company that I can basically pay 20$ per year or some shit like that to freeze a DNA sample of mine without it detoriating? ",27Apr2018,3

48," I was driving in downtown LA the other day, going about 35\-40mph, when a man decides to cross the street – no crosswalk, no intersection, just in the middle of the road with oncoming traffic heading toward him. The woman driving in front of me naturally slams on her brakes. I did not have time to stop, so I end up rear\-ending her. 

When she got out of her car, the pedestrian came over to check that everything was okay and admitted fault. She also said to me, several times, that she wasn’t going to stop for the pedestrian \(because he most likely would have backed off from crossing\), but she did it anyway. There was no real body damage to either car, just a little paint transfer that could be buffed out. Both she and I were okay, we were cordial in speaking with one another, exchanged insurance info, and then drove off. I do not feel like the accident was my fault, nor do I feel like it was her fault, however, she has since filed a claim and I am trying to figure out how to avoid her claim going through on my insurance \- I can’t afford a spike in fees right now and I don't feel at fault for the collision.

I'm graduating in about two weeks from college. I know I'd like to pursue my Master's degree but I am so conflicted with what program to select for my graduate program. My interests are going in so many directions and I know I'd like to intern as a researcher to gain some experience and skills.

However, my parents want me to go to grad school right away. I kind of understand how I could lose my routine of going to class everyday and such, but I am not sure how to let my parents see things from my point of view. My ultimate goal is be knowledgeable and not have a degree just to solely have a degree, but because I want to know I've achieved something great in life.

I am so stressed about graduation and everything after that because life is hitting me so hard right now. I can't believe I'll have face to the real world so soon; I'm honestly really bummed about it. I don't feel hopeless but I just feel like because I'm not going to grad school right away, I'm wasting my potential.

 In addition, I'd like to have more skills and seem like a well-rounded applicant for whatever grad program I am planning to pursue, that is if I find one that suits me well.

Furthermore, my mom has also invited about 16 to 17 people to my graduation and some of them don't even know about my major being switched a couple of months ago. How do I shut out everyone else's opinions and just live unapologetically?

Also - does anyone know what happens at a graduation ceremony? Or has anyone taken some time off before grad school? Can you please offer me some advice?

Thanks!",27Apr2018,2
57,"When my mother met my father, she had just recently moved from Portland to a small logging town of around 20,000 people in Southeast Oregon. I am told by my father that she lived completely differently than the way she did when she was raising me. She was a frequent patron of clubs and took hard drugs, which she has recounted her experiences of to me directly several times in a very vague way, seeming to imply that it was a one-time experiment and that she vehemently regretted it. She was forced to move to the town of my birth after she was found guilty embezzling money from a legal firm and forced to bear a debt of many hundreds of thousands of dollars. In all likelihood, it was my Evangelical grandparents that had both bailed her out caused her to move, using the leverage of money to force her to live the life they wanted for her. She agreed to move, and in her early thirties, she married my father.

My father lived in a town of about 1,000 about a half hour away from my mother. His family had lived there since what my fathers side calls the ""Indian Wars,"" and was born just soon enough to see the mines his grandfather worked in close and the lumber mills that would define the region spring up before their eventual collapse in the 1990's. My father had serious neck problems for his entire life, requiring numerous surgeries on his spine and upper back. He was also on prescription painkillers, which very likely drew my mother to him.

Once the two were married, the relationship went as you might imagine. My mother began taking my father's pain medication. My father, as an open-minded person, didn't put too much thought into it at first. They were both relatively young, and he was open to the idea of recreational use of drugs. My father had long since begun regarding technicalities like the name on a prescription as nothing of significance. My mother's usage of his painkillers became a normal occurrence. For my mother, her life couldn't have been better. She could appease her parents which belonged to a bygone era of moral responsibility, and she could continue her flagrant use of drugs. However, my mothers dependence on my father would not bear the future with grace.

Their relationship inevitably collapsed, and my mother needed to protect her investment in my father. Perhaps he finally had enough, or perhaps it was my mother that became paranoid. Either way, I am convinced beyond a doubt that I am the product of my mother attempting to keep my father at arm's length and defend her source of painkillers. I was born on March 13, 2001, and almost immediately after, my mother was in court for taking painkillers during her pregnancy. By the grace of God I was a perfectly healthy infant of average birth weight and showed no signs of mental or physical disabilities. She was again found guilty, and again in need of financial assistance. This time, it was my father who drove the iron nails through his palms and bore my mother's sins. I was taken to a home that was stretched thin and on the verge of shattering.

And shatter it did. When I was barely four, my parents parted ways, my father tens of thousands in debt after coming to my mother's rescue, and my mother with a newly damaged relationship with her parents.

I have written all this to give you an idea of who my mother is, and how she might treat a young child. I grew up emotionally neglected. The way we interacted implied to me that conversations were inherently one-sided. I was to act however she wanted to see me or else I would be punished. Expressing myself or coming to her for emotional concerns made her angry with me. I learned that I would be successful with people so long as I was able to suppress how I felt and become whatever person they would most want to see.

At seventeen, that learned behavior has come to define me. I can count all the people I have made meaningful connections with on one hand. I have no healthy way to express my emotions to someone else. I obsessively avoid eye contact and compliments. Even a ""goodbye"" brings with it a sense of violation, like I have left myself exposed and vulnerable with a simple gesture of goodwill. I have a wardrobe of masks from which I can choose depending on who I speak to, and I have worn them for so long that my true face has ceased to exist, swallowed up by the safe reliability of playing everyone's individual court jester. I'm lost. I've been lost my whole life.

I don't know if this was the best place to come for help. I know for certain that this wasn't the best place to exposit my entire life story, and I hope you can forgive my rambling. I don't know where else to go. I just want to live a normal life.",27Apr2018,2
58,"Intervention Advice.
Not sure if this is even the best place to post this, but here goes. 

Summary: 
My sister and her husband are alcoholics. Children are involved. Myself, my parents, and possibly my brother have decided it's time for an intervention. I am supposed to find a specialist who can help. I am terrified. 

Backstory:
My sister has had issues with drinking on and off since she was a teenager. I didn't realize just how bad it was until two years ago at our family Christmas party. She assaulted my date by first trying to tickle him, then grabbing at his crotch and trying to put her hand down his pants. Everyone in the room froze in horror and nobody knew what to do. The next day she came over to our parents house with her husband, and joked about how she couldn't even remember the second half of the party. So I told her what happened. She thought it was hilarious, but I assured her that it wasn't funny. ""He's a successful musician, I'm sure he's used to it"" was her reasoning. And then her husband, who was drunk at this time, caught on to what had happened, and he was furious. They left and we all felt uncomfortable and upset. That night I got several scathing paragraphs texted to me about how I've ruined her marriage, and I told her that I love her and want her to get help. Because I can't remember the last time I saw her without a drink in hand, aside from while she was pregnant. (Did I mention she has two children?)
This only made things worse. She continued to rage at me via text, while I just kept repeating variations of ""I love you, I want to help you get better."" At one point I did lose my patience and said I would no longer come to her house to hang out and see the kids unless she got her drinking under control. The next evening she sent me another text apologizing. She said that she and her husband talked to each other, the kids, some cousins who had been living at the house, and her in-laws. They were going to give up drinking for good. It didn't work. 

The older child (age 10-12) and I are quite close, and I've tried to talk with them openly (but carefully) about what's been going on. One of these times, the child told me that there was a family secret their dad was never to find out (the child's father is my sister's ex husband, who was granted sole custody of his two children from a previous marriage due to his ex having addiction issues). It eats at my soul knowing that this child is being forced to lie to cover up an addiction of their caregivers. The younger child is a toddler, and while they aren't fully aware of what is happening, they already have clear signs of behavioral and emotional issues. Our own father was an alcoholic, and knowing how much of a negative effect this can have on one's life growing up and into adulthood is breaking my heart. 

It isn't uncommon for her and her husband to consume upwards of a gallon of vodka in a single day. There is boisterous laughter at first, but it soon turns to passive aggressive behavior, uncontrollable crying, and violent screaming and slamming things around. All in front of the kids. Her husband tends to get very touchy-feely with me and it is extremely uncomfortable. He attempted to physically hit me once over a minor disagreement at a Fourth of July party, but fortunately my brother (who is large and intimidating) stepped in to diffuse the situation. 

This past winter, her husband had to be rushed to the emergency room. He fell on the ice and hit his head because people were struggling to take his car keys away from him. My sister, who was also too drunk to drive, ended up at her ex husband's house. He refused to let her drive his child home in her intoxicated state, so he drove the child to my sister's house while she drove with the toddler (from her current marriage) in the car. My mom just informed me of this on the phone today. 

She called to tell me about the vacation that they all just took together. Needless to say I am glad that I was unable to go. The entire trip was most likely a blur that won't be remembered by my sister or her husband, and the details of what occurred due to their alcohol addiction aren't worth mentioning. My mom and I have decided that the best thing to do at this point is to try to have an intervention. I have been tasked with finding a specialist to get the ball rolling and to talk to my brother to see if he will be on board. 

I have so many fears and feelings about what might happen. How can both my sister and her husband go into treatment at the same time? What about the kids? The oldest can stay with their father (my sister's ex), but what about the toddler? How will separating the kids from each other and their parents affect them in the long term? Will it be worse than continuing to be trapped in a chaotic, toxic environment? How can the kids get treatment or support or therapy to help start to reverse all of the psychological damage the addiction has caused? How much money will all of this cost? WHAT IF THEY REFUSE TO GET HELP? WHAT IF THEY REFUSE TO LET US SEE THE KIDS EVER AGAIN?

Did I mention my sister was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as an adolescent? And that she and her husband also like to eat Xanax bars along with their alcohol? And they both have steady jobs as average blue collar Americans? Fuck.

61,"I've been working as a part\-time concierge in a senior assisted living center for about 3 months now. I was originally told that after my probationary period, which was 90 days from my start date, that I would be given a review and the opportunity for full\-time will be discussed and explored. I was even told during my probation months that I was going to be picking up the hours of someone they were letting go and that it would essentially put me into full\-time anyways. 

Now, 90 days out of my start date I'm asking the real questions\- wondering what comes next for me and whether or not full\-time will be discussed again...and now I'm being met with ""there aren't enough hours"", ""you really won't be offered full\-time until someone else leaves"", ""in 10 months I'll be leaving so maybe then there will be more hours"" and then\- and this just threw me\- ""well, you have to consider your absences\- if you're absent and you come in asking for full\-time hours, do you really think we're going to give it to you?""

I was out two days because I had lost my voice to laryngitis.

My job is to answer phones. I literally went in on the day I had no voice, regardless of that fact, and they sent me home because I sounded terrible. I then came back to work one day later and worked double shifts for the following two weeks to make it up to my supervisor because I felt bad that she had to cover me for two days because I couldn't talk and needed to rest.

Why is it employers hold illnesses against you?

Am I just doomed to forever be a part\-timer now because I lost my voice and they decided it meant I wasn't reliable and hired more people then they had hours?

I have no idea...I'm just so upset right now. Upset and disappointed.

I don't know if I should just stick with it and get more experience, or even see if I can wait out some of the other employees, or just update my resume and put myself back out there for something more concrete and definitely full\-time. I love this job. I love the people and it's definitely opened up my eyes to a whole new field of work that I think I would love to go back to school for and explore as a career. I don't want to just give up on them\- but I need to take care of myself and my family.

67,"Hi all, 

I’m posting here because I wasn’t sure where to go. My sister is getting married in August &amp; would like to have a wedding in our backyard. My mother is being very strange about it as it would involve cleaning up for guests, and we all know she’s going to explode any minute. 
Backstory on my mum: literally every single damn section of the house has some unuseful shit in it &amp; she refuses to get rid of it (a broken outdoor heater or 20 year old clothes with holes in them) There is no space to live, as the house is small and every room is stuffed with crap, even the ones my siblings live in. In order to distance myself from her, I live interstate, so I can’t be of much help to my sister. 

Anytime you even try to clean Mum throws a tantrum like a toddler. Probably worse, screaming, crying, yelling &amp; threatening. Once I donated some of my old clothes to those in need &amp; she screamed at me for being selfish and went to try and get them back (I’d already put them in the donating bin). I’ve had to live amoungst her crap and dirty mess for my whole life &amp; all I ever get from her is “I’ll do it next month”. She’s been saying that since before I was born. 

We all want to help her but she won’t let us touch it &amp; even if I try to exert some control, it is such an emotional rollercoaster that it’s not even worth it, as you then cop her rollercoaster of emotions. She won’t admit she has a problem and uses excuses “if we had a bigger house I wouldn’t have this problem”. 

I’m going back home for my sisters wedding and I’m planning to throw everything out and then take all the yelling so my sister can have an easier time doing what she needs to. Is there a better way?

68,"TL;DR I can't understand this one course in my university no matter how much I try. Am I stupid, and should I even try?

I have this subject, that is basically a study of electrical circuits. More specifically learning various types of them and how to calculate circuits parameters at different conditions and etc.

Its a one semester course that I had to pass on my freshman year in college. Nobody understood that subject and 90% of my classmates basically cheated their way out of it. But I was incredibly... I guess I've had a perfect combination of stubbornness laziness and stupidity to decide to learn it and pass it legitimately. Long story short I didn't manage to and dropped out. Now I have a chance to return back to my studies but I have to pass this course anyways. 

So my question is, do I cheat my way out of it or would it be ultimately better for me to try and learn it and pass legit. The thing is: it annoys me... no, it infuriates me being sleazy with professors, trying to turn in papers without understanding a word written on it, and I feel like I shouldn't give up to such challenges, as I know that in my future field of work I will have to learn obscure and difficult to understand things fast, and if I don't overcome this challenge legitimately I will fail in my field (I wanna be a programmer).

70,"So I moved to a new city a month ago for my fiance's career change. I just started heavily putting out job applications a week and a half ago (the reason I waited is because I was travelling out of state a lot for family issues).

I have been applying to positions that will hopefully get me started with a career in administrative work or similar. I don't really have any professional experience in this field, and I only have an associates degree in education.

I had an interview the other day, and they offered me the job. The job is a receptionist at a chiropractic office. The pros of this job is that the hours are awesome, the staff is nice, and it could possibly help me get started in administrative work eventually. The cons of this job is very low pay ($10.50 an hour), no benefits, and no upward mobility in the business (it's just a small practice.)

My fiance makes more than enough money to support us, so money isn't a big problem.

I am just worried that this job isn't worth it. I want to keep applying, and see if I can get something better. I am just tired of working shitty jobs (Work experience: shift manager at Subway - 4 years, sales associate at Jewelry store - 2 years, nurse assistant at nursing home - 5 years, assistant preschool teacher - 10 months). The reason for the short lived position as the preschool teacher is because we moved twice in one year for fiance's job. We are now permanently settled in.

My fiance really wants me to take this job for the good hours, and he thinks it will help me in the future when I want to find something better. I do see his point, and I do agree with him a bit, but I really just wanted to try to look for something a bit better.

What advice do you have for me? Should I risk continuing to look for something better, or is this a really great opportunity that I am overlooking?

So, I've constantly struggled with eating well and not overeating, and wondered if anyone might have useful advice.

I was doing really well last year when I was living in an apartment with my friend. We ate the same thing and she made dinner for both of use, so it was a little easier to stick to the meals we'd planned out. I also could work out more easily then, because our apartment had a free gym.

I started eating more junk around Christmas, and never really managed to get back into better habits.

I recently had to move back into my dad's house and have found it incredibly difficult to resist falling back into junk food eating habits. My dad tends to eat a steady diet of pizza, chicken tenders, and fast food, and gets offended when I don't want to eat whatever he's making. He also refuses to eat anything I cook, although I've never had a problem cooking for anyone else.

He knows I struggle with trying to eat well, but still tries to push me into eating junk. I find it really, really difficult to avoid eating junk food. To combat it, I would normally just remove all junk food from the house. If it's not there, it's not an issue.

Anyway, has anyone else dealt with a similar situation while trying to eat well and lose weight? How do you manage without people to support and push you?

Like I said, I've never done this before, but I do not lack confidence, I'd just never met a person that fit my ideal perspective of a woman as well as she does, this does not mean that the whole school is dying over her, but rather she would be deemed alright, but for me a 10/10, and due to me never finding someone else ideal, and this being my first liking, I am a bit scared of messing it up.

I don't think there is much not to fall on me for, I'm 6'3, play basketball, am fairly fit, and it is obvious I work out, I slightly lack on looks side of things, but I wouldn't say I'm by any means a deal breaker.

83,"Okay so. 
I've had a long string of bad relationships and guys that fucked me over pretty badly. I finally thought I found a sweet guy who cared about me and I've started to really really like him. We've been dating for only two months.
I never really stalk anyone's Instagram but I ended up going on his because he lives three hours away and I just wanted to see his face. I scrolled down and realized he had all of these posts of girls he had dated in the past and they all had these super heartfelt captions, where they just all seemed to have way more in common with him than I do.. and that he liked them wayyy more. And I'm slightly worried that I'm his rebound, he's only been out of the last relationship for three months and it seemed like he was super into her. 
He has never posted a picture of us together, or even taken one, and while he's been nicer to me than any other guy I've dated, I can't tell how he really feels. I've known him for a couple years through other friends and he was just always a really nice person so it's hard to tell. 
I know I will fall in love with him if I keep believing he's in love with me, even though there's this little voice screaming that there's no way he is.

Basically, am I overthinking? Should I ignore it or bring it up to him and just be honest about how I feel?

84,"I went back and added/edited a few things so sorry if this doesn’t flow so nicely...

So. I’ve (29F) been living abroad (small country in Middle East, I don’t feel comfortable sharing which one but I moved here from USA originally as a volunteer during conflict) for 6 years now, dating my boyfriend (32M, from this country) for 4 of those years. He’s been in school this whole time, though we knew each other as friends the year before we dated and before he was in school. Earlier on in our relationship we used to talk about getting married, and at some point in the last 2 years he said that he would be open to moving to my home country (USA) after he graduates, due to my extreme homesickness. (I also don’t speak the language in his country very well, and there are minimal professional opportunities for me anymore even though I’ve gotten a lot of great experience in my time here) But he hasn’t made any real plans to move, no matter how much I bring it up (trying to bring it up without becoming a nag or a burden) and his graduation is coming up this summer and he has no concrete plan, no long term visa, we’ve not even gotten engaged or married to even start a visa process in that way, no real plans to move, and I’m at the point where I just  want to settle down and get back to my family who I miss so much it hurts every day. (Also, his whole family lives in his country, the culture there is more family oriented, and his mother has a lifelong disease that prevents her from traveling) I also want to have children soon and can’t imagine raising them away from my family. He insists that he’s not so into his family and doesn’t really think about the fact that childbearing years come with an expiration date, and he’s not so concerned about it the way I am. When I first brought up the concept of children, his response was “did you ever think about living life with no children?” - that was kind of my first red flag that it might not end up working out because I want a big, close family. 

I finally told him that I have to move even if he’s not ready, and though at first he rejected it completely, in time (partly due to my misery in his country) he accepted that. He truly is a really nice guy, and gets it. I’m not my best self anymore in his country, and it has creeped into all other aspects of our relationship. I am home now for a family event, and I brought back half of my belongings. I feel so much more relaxed and comfortable here. 2 weeks ago before I traveled I gave notice at work, and told them that I’d give them an exact date of leaving upon my return from this family event (it’s a small county and I work at a tiny social org so there is no “2 weeks notice” thing, they appreciated the extra heads up) He doesn’t really talk about his emotions a lot, and though he seems sad, he understands that I just have to go. I can’t wait any longer for him to figure out how he’s going to enter my country, he never asked me to marry him (I totally would have just married for the visa, but he never wanted to do that if it wasn’t real marriage), etc. 

Now. My dilemma. I want to get back here as soon as possible, just get a new job, apartment, and start my life. All of my friends are married now, some with children, I’m turning 30 soon, and want to settle down. Im starting to accept the fact that we will likely break up, but as he says, he prefers to “phase out”. We love each other as humans, but it’s becoming more and more apparent each day that we have different values and want to live our lives differently, and because we are from two different countries this becomes a much bigger issue than it might have if we shared the same nationality, if our families weren’t an ocean apart. 

If I could leave his country and our shared apartment at the end of next month it would be the best for my personal situation because I’d have the summer with my family and friends, which I haven’t had in 6 years. And if I do have to move on and find someone else, summer will be an easier time to start getting over him than the fall (I’m from the east coast of USA)

So- the dilemma- his final school project that he’s been working on for 2 years, is due at the end of next month. And the three weeks leading up to that he has pre-scheduled army reserves (mandatory conscription) and will be very busy with that, and we wouldn’t be able to see each other during this time, possibly on the weekends we could. This country goes to war often, and there is talk that something might be brewing. If so, his army reserves will probably turn into something more serious. But it can’t be confirmed obviously until it happens. And I’ve lived through wars there before, they vary in seriousness. 

Do I wait 2 more months to leave, so as not to leave in the middle of what is probably the busiest and most stressful time of his life right now? And stay here during a potential time of war? Or do I leave in 1 month at a time that is more convenient for me and my family and potentially my future with someone else? And may also be safer for me personally though it would mean turning my back on the people I’ve grown to know and love here? 

I really do love him, and this is hard enough as it is. I don’t know if I can stand living with him for an extra month, knowing that we will probably break up and never see each other again. I know that relatively a month is a short time, but the past few months (really the past 2 years) put me into a severe depression already, tormenting myself about making the final decision to leave him and go back home. And I’m approaching an age where if I want to have children, every day counts. That being said, I don’t want to add any more stress on him by leaving in the middle of this crazy month where he has army reserves and his thesis project due all at the same time. And if there is a war- well that’s a whole other issue. Can’t really plan for that right now until it happens or it doesn’t.

93,"I have a thumb sucking habit as an adult and I have PTSD over going to new places or meeting other people.  Two years ago, one guy was sitting next to me on the train and he kept murmuring the word ""Ebola"" and it seemed he was in panic. I had to go home and washed my hands many times because I was afraid that perhaps his saliva spattered on my clothes while he was talking. I had to throw out the clothes I was wearing on that day because I didn't want to  suck my thumb after I touch it again. I didn't want to wash the clothes and wear again because I was uncertain the virus would go away after cleaning. This happens one in million but I'm afraid from the thought that I won't never be able to stop my habit completely and probably I will experience similar situation in the future because I'm young and still have 60 years to live\(maybe\).   

A lots of psychologists says that Habit is hard to stop if you've been doing it for a lots of years and it gets ingrained. I've been sucking my thumb in my sleep since I was a baby and now I'm 22. I have tried so hard to stop it but never succeeded. What makes no sense is that I've never had a desire to suck my thumb during the days and I never did it.

My habit affects my social life. My friends don't know about my habit and would throw about AIDS Joke. For instance, I was eating dinner with my friend and he told me that he became vegetarian because he had AIDS.

Here is another one, I was eating soup with another friend and he told me He also had AIDS as a joke.  

I freaked out after hearing these and I didn't want to meet them again because I was afraid of the disease.

I know this sounds crazy and I know you can't get such disease easily unless you touch or drink their blood.

Possibilities of the situation where my friends come to my house and bleed on my desk or table is very low However I get confused if the red stain on the table is his blood or ketchup after we have a dinner together.

Second how do I know if I’m depressed. Like what if you’ve been sad for so long you just think it’s normal. Nothing makes me happy Anymore. The other day I thought about killing myself just cause it would make it easier in my parents financially if i was gone I think. What do I do?

I can’t motivate myself for school. I don’t like it at all nothing interests me which makes it so hard to learn when everything you are being taught is boring - useless or you just don’t care about it. Like I can present myself well my teachers like me but every class is just shit. I don’t care about any of them. 

Third I don’t know how to socialize. I don’t go to parties or hang out with my friends. It’s just school - home. That’s it. Not to mention I go to an all male highschool so no females to even talk to as if I’d know how. How do I do that stuff 

And finally how do I figure out what I want to do. I want to have things figured out like career wise before college and I don’t know what I want to do. There’s nothing I’m really good at. Video games no, music stuff meh, academics, meh how do I figure it out?

Almost everyday I think about her, now I’m not saying I’m depressed over it, it’s just I reminisce about the happy times I had with her. I don’t know love cause I’m still a kid, but there’s one thing I want to learn as a teenager and that’s to forgive someone. I’m not perfect, she’s not perfect. What’s the point in fighting.

111,"About a year ago, i broke up with a guy that i was in a long distance relationship with for 2 years because i told him i had always wanted to experiment with girls. He was the first person i came out to. I tried all the lesbian dating apps and what not and i had small little nothings with a couple of girls. But recently I’ve been getting pretty serious with this one girl and we’ve been taking since December. and i really like her but i don’t feel the way i normally would if i had a crush on someone. like i don’t have the tingly butterflies feeling. but I LOVE having sex with her. (disclaimer: even though we have been talking a while it took us until feb-march until i actually even kissed her, and the first time we had sex wasn’t until april.) i had sex with quite a few guys (more than i could count on my hands) and i never liked it. sometimes it was even painful. When i was with her i felt so open and i was actually enjoying myself and i loved pleasing her. But i’m scared that I may only like the sex and not actually have feelings for her. And i’m not sure if i’m bisexual or what. that label doesn’t sound right to me at all and i cringe every time people call me that or ask me and i tell them bisexual because it’s simpler. i really don’t know and i don’t want to waste this girls time if i’m not even actually into girls romantically.

123,"I’m 19, girl with a very conservative family. (I’m not). My parents are very controlling. They always have been. But I took a semester off college and have been living at home again since January. I’ve felt for a long time that I should just move away from them and keep a relationship but no longer be dependent on them for income. 

I had a job in high school, but the money I’ve saved is gone bc college and life lol. My parents are well-offish and pay for my tuition, rent, and all other expenses. They gave me a small allowance at college for other spending things. Yeah. I’m spoiled. But they also are very restrictive. Since I’ve come home they’ve discouraged letting me get a job and even prevented me from going a couple times when I worked 1 hr/ week as a tutor. They make me go to temple (I’m an atheist, they’re trying to “save” me. Fr they even make me wear a healing stone.). 

My first year of college I did really terrible. I go to a really competitive engineering school. I was a lonely, out of state student. I was raped at school and had a pregnancy from that too. But I was 17 and afraid what would happen if my parents knew I was pregnant and didn’t tell anyone. I was super depressed and had tons of issues, it was a bad time. After 3 semesters, I took this semester off to mentally rebuild myself again. And I’m just so sick of my parents and they’re constant need to control me. I’m not a bad kid, I’m just some nerdy/Normal engineering major. 

They struggle to understand my depression and PTSD no matter how I try to explain myself. I’m on pills now and they always make jokes about me going to a therapist and taking medication. My dad is just kinda an asshole in general. 

The thing is I know they love me and I try really hard to build a good relationship with them. They make it so hard tho, they’re impossible to please and Now my mom has stopped giving me cash and will only let me use her credit card so I can’t even save up on the side like I did before. 

There’s a lot of family shit with my sister and my parents, it’s messy. But I’m kinda the peacekeeper and I try to be a good kid for them even tho I’m an adult now and they don’t treat me like one. They make my depression so much worse and I’m just tryna get better but they make it so hard living with them. 

I wanna take out student loans, work, save money, become independent and not have to deal with all the family drama anymore. But I live a cushy life and I’m scared to leave all the financial security they provide me with. 

Subleasing my nice apartment close to campus in the city because I already signed the lease. Finding a new cheaper place to live so that I can still go back to school. Figuring out how tf student loans work and becoming financially independent for the first time in my life. Credit, bank accounts, saving, paying for school. I have no idea how to do any of this. 

I’m planning on staying at home till August and figuring this all out. Working all summer and saving as much as I can.  Then moving back to the city and finally start living my life like it’s mine. 

But I’m worried that I’m making a mistake and just being over-rebellious and just take what I have and be grateful. They’re just my parents after all. And one day in 3 years I’ll graduate and get a job and can afford to move out.

Please give me your advice. I have no idea what to do.

125,I used to have a 3.8 GPA and I would be graduated now if this didn't happen. Earlier this year I turned 22 as a virgin. Partially out of trying to numb the pain and partially because I read a longitudinal study on virginity that found that 21 year old virgins were 5% less likely to be virgins at 25 if they were drug users I started using drugs. I used Alcohol and Benzodiazepines but the one I used the most was marijuana. I dropped to the minimum course load since I knew I was not very capable and I smoked every day and all the time I wasn't seeing family or high I was crying about being a virgin. I failed all three classes and now my degree will be useless even if I do graduate since although I am only four credits short my GPA will be so low that the degree will be useless so I'm thinking of dropping out and either committing suicide or doing a completely different degree. I cannot stand to be at my university anymore. What should I do?,27Apr2018,4
127,"I had always been a late bloomer throughout middle and high school. I never really thought much of it, because I eventually went through all stages of puberty... except for my voice. 

Graduating as a senior, I still thought maybe I would have a time in college where my voice would change. Still hasn’t happened, and now I’m a junior in college.

I’ve never had a girlfriend because I always focused on school, but now I’m so ready to be in a relationship. When I go to the bars, I will be hitting on a girl the entire night, only for her to ask me if I’m gay. It’s REALLY emasculating. I’m even called “ma’am” on fast food speakers and the telephone. 

I want to grow past this phase in my life. I don’t want people, especially potential future relationships to look past me because they think I’m gay.

I am told by a few people of how nice and kind I am, and I'm sure that I am. It's who I am and I can't change that. If I did change I would be forced to be unkind.  When my feelings get hurt by others I lose my smile and I want to retreat away.  I'm just not cut out for the general way of this world.  I had to stop and reflect on my actions and words. I asked my family, is there anything wrong with me? Am I mentally challenged and I had been living my whole life not knowing it? Like how a mentally handicap probably senses that people never get close to them and don't know why, they don't know why they never have a real connection or acceptance from strangers, they must know in their hearts something isn't right but never knowing it's because of how they are.  I feel like that. I've been dealing with my whole life. I even tried to repent and stop all things that would be considered sinning.

130,"Hi everyone,

I hope this is the right location for this. I live in Canada, where my parents have great careers that has allowed us to live a very comfortable life. I have been fortunate enough to have all of my tuition and other expenses covered. I come from a strict, but loving asian family. Ever since I was a child, my parents have had incredibly high expectations of me. So when I began university, my parents constantly pushed me to pursue a big name, prestigious career like medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, and the sort. Whenever I would question them why, they would always tell me that it’s because they earn a lot of money and that they just want me to live a happy, wealthy life. They want me to follow their footsteps.

This obviously stressed me out a lot. I didn’t do well in my first two years of university, panicked, and now do not have a good enough GPA or motivation to fulfill my parents dreams. I did however find a career that has ticked all the boxes in what I am looking for: Medical Laboratory Sciences. It has been a blissful finding for me as it encompasses everything that I want in a career, and then some. Here in Canada, salaries are great: about 60k - 100k in Alberta. Some higher positions pay deeper into the six figures and are attainable for me considering any further schooling that I take.

But it was never about the money for me. It is everything, however, for my parents. So when I told them about this career, they were supportive, but only on the surface. I constantly overhear them being disappointed of me and my choice because of the pay and because they’re so unfamiliar with the career. I can live a perfectly normal life without making a lot of money. I don’t need money to make me happy, but my parents are hard-wired to think this way as we immigrated to Canada from a poor country years ago. I guess my parents don’t want me to live the life they lived when they were my age, but things are so different here in Canada and I don’t think they see the point. I’m hopeless. Nothing I say can change their minds. I’ve come to the point where I am willing to say or do anything to help my parents understand me more. Anything will help.

i graduate next year and ill be 22 when i graduate. 

 

 

ive never been in love, dont really have good friends (just acquaintances mostly... ive tried my best to make good friends in life and try and put myself out there but I always end up with people who don't seem to truly think of me as their friend (leaving me when we go out, not wanting to hang out outside of school, ignoring my texts, etc.) ), have no solid career choice in mind, and im really scared about what will happen to me after i graduate college.

 

at the moment, im content with my life because i know i still have a year of university left.

 
 

but after graduating, im really afraid that ill end up going back home, living with my family in my awful hometown that i vowed id never go back to, have zero friends and get some crappy retail job and get stuck in that plateau of being alone and having nothing left in life to look forward to. i feel like the only way ive avoided full blown depression throughout my life is because i always had some new stage in life to look forward to. 

 

in middle school, it was highschool. in highschool, it was freedom. after that it was community college, then university, and now im looking forward to the great opportunities i am going to have this summer and next year. i know im going to have great experiences within the next year as Ill be studying abroad and have some other plans. 

 

but im really afraid that the next year is going to be the best and most memorable of my life and after that ill end up going back to my crap hometown, living a redundant crap life, and having no one there for me besides my parents. at that point i wouldn't have anything to look forward to and i feel like ill fall into actual depression or something worse.

So my brother said ""Could you just donate a dollar to her?"" I said no.

My brother called me stingy/cheap. I felt bad (and still do) but not enough to change my behavior.

Thinking more about this, it's not even the fact that I don't know her. I feel like it's truly because I don't want to give up a dollar or two.

Is this sort of attachment to a dollar or two normal? If it's not normal, would you say it's ok or a habit I need to break?

142,"Hello guys,

Not sure if this is the right place to ask. Hope it is. :P

I am thinking of buying some kind of gifts for my Japanese tutors. They have been helping me and some other students a lot, but since tutoring is voluntarily, they don't get paid. I don't know if anyone else will give them gifts or anything (probably yes), but this is just my way of showing gratitude. One of them is going back to Japan in one month. I am not sure what they like, since we don't get to chit-chat about random topics that much. I guess I can say that we are on good terms, but not exactly close friends. I don't know what they like, but I'll see if I can BS a conversation and ask them. I've heard that Japanese people like stuff that are hard to get in Japan, like American/Western candies or local products.

I have searched around for some good chocolate brands. I was surprised to find out that Hersheys have terrible reputation among chocolate enthusiasts. So which brand would you recommend? :) I would like one that is not too expensive, and offer good value for the price. I'm looking at somewhere around $25. Some of the ones I currently have my eyes on are:

- See's Candies (when you make a custom box, what the heck are those 10% ratio for each? How many pieces do you get? 2-3?)
- Lindt (seems good)
- M&amp;M? Maybe...
- Philadelphia Candies (anyone heard of this before?)
- Ferrero Rocher
- Godiva is a bit too expensive, I think...

Those are all I could remember right now. I think there was a few more European brands, but I forgot. Honestly, I am not crazy about sweets, but I have tasted Lindt, Hersheys, Ferrero, and they all didn't seem that much different from each other. XD So how do you rate these brands?

I am also worried that during the process of shipping, the chocolate might melt. Not sure if buying directly from the manufacturer's website would help, but I have seen plenty of pictures of chocolate being melted on Amazon.

144,"Repost from r/relationship_advice 

I'm going to be blunt while writing this, but please do not discount the amount of emotional intelligence and attachment I have to this topic when you read it. Haha. 

I am in my early twenties (f) about to move across the country to start over with a new job and hopefully school. Where I live now is simply not healthy for me for a number of reasons which I won't get into. 

Anyway, I have currently been dating let's call him Guy 1 (G1) for a year now. I had been dating Guy 2 (G2) for about 2 years on and off when I abruptly left him over something stupid and completely immature.

Lately, I've been day dreaming about what G2 and I did together alongside a bit of resentment/frustration toward G1. I know for a fact that I could go back to G2, but we would have to work on some things together. We have kept in touch throughout the past year, but it hasn't always been the friendliest contact.

I am absolutely horrible at decision making in this realm, actually I'm pretty fucking embarrassed to say this publicly but - I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons about dating both of them before I move away permanently. I'm admittedly codependent and I care for each of them immensely. Here is where my head is 

:::::

G1) 

PROS: Very sweet, charming, and incredibly handsome not to mention great in bed. He is artsy, dry-humored like myself, and most definitely would be considered metrosexual. We get along really well alone but also in either groups of our friends. He is insanely easy to talk to and absolutely no topic is off limits. The way this guy stares/softly touches makes me melt and he is never too far off from providing physical and verbal affirmation. I like the fact he let's me be a ditz and get excited over things like going to the pet store or seeing a specific moss on a hike. His parents think we are both weirdos so I don't have to put on face when they're around which is fantastic  Oh! He is also Atheist like me.
 
CONS: While he may be easy to talk to, he cannot hold an intelligent/difficult conversation, about half way in he concedes with ""idk, people are weird"" or something along those lines. He is also very concerned about how other people perceive him and I can tell it irks him if I don't dress up for one of his bands' shows. He is 28 years old, insanely in debt from student loans for a degree he never finished and refuses to finish, without a viable career in sight. Most of his free time is spent either playing music in his small town band or scrolling through Twitter. He REALLY likes to be doted upon/taken care of and a lot of the time I feel like I am acting as a pseudo mother (irks me because I take care of two elderly parents as is while doing to school full time and working 30 hours a week) by doing his laundry, dishes, and paying for most everything. While he claims to be romantic we did nothing for my birthday, Valentine's Day or our anniversary, so I'll say I was a bit disappointed. While mentioned marriage but doesn't really want children. He doesn't take me seriously when I ask him to do bigger things like get his passport so we could go overseas (which we didn't get to since he waited until the last possible moment). He is the definition of melancholy and a lot of the time I have to check his Twitter to see what kind of mood he is in before I go see him... Lastly, since he's so concerned with looks and style I'm afraid to move to this bigger city, I feel like his eyes wander and he will end up dumping me for a more hipster girl thag looks good next to him on Instsvrsm. 

××××× 

G2) 

PROS: God damn this kid is smart, we met in an honors course in college actually. He's driven, ambitious, and has a life ahead of him at only 22. He's an awkward kind of cute and not my typical ""type"", but adorable nonetheless. He takes pride in the things he does and refuses to settle. He gives great back rubs, we like the same music, food, coffee, movies, etc. He splits the bill with me and when I wake up he usually has coffee and breakfast made for me. We have comfortable silence and I swear he will follow me anywhere. He is musically talented, but he's not a show boat because he is realistic enough to know it's not going anywhere special. He is serious, wants kids, marriage, to travel and all of the things I want to do too. Lastly, he is willing to fix and work on everything together even going as far as buying books like ""The 5 Love Languages"" to try harder for me and tries his best to understand.  

CONS: His body odor is almost as fowl as his breath... he showers, but I know for a fact there isn't much scrubbing happening in that 10 minute period - I'm lost as to the fish breath thing though because he does brush his teeth regularly. He is socially awkward around my friends which makes me not want to invite him to social events. He is religious which causes us to butt heads when I poke fun or he tries to tell me he can't be there for x or y due to church. I dislike his friend group because they seem very superficial which is fine because they don't seem thrilled when I'm near anyway. I'm like 95% his parents don't like me, no matter how many times he tries to reassure me and I avoid holidays with them as a result. I feel like I have to protect him if we are in a tough neighborhood too, I don't think he would defend me if something were to go down - only mentioning  this since we traveled a lot together. He understandably has trust issues with me and I rarely get a moment of peace if I'm not next to him at this point. Healthy relationship communication has never been his strongsuit so we argued a bit and I felt like there was a lot we could never talk about. Also... the sex is just kind of a turn off to be honest (keep in mind he smells bad) since he's so awkward/quick, I'm always stuck being the dom which stinks because I'm a sub generally.

I'll stop now because that's already a shit ton to read, but my issue is that whenever I bring the subject up to my friends they discount it, change the subject, or say there will be new guys where I move so I dont want to bring it up anymore. My parents and I aren't close enough to discuss this sort of thing and they would offer little guidance anyway.  I'm really struggling here and I'm just looking for some unbiased stranger opinions because this is plaguing my brain with guilt. ",27Apr2018,2

154,"My best friend's car wouldn't start when she was supposed to take her dog to the pet store to update his vaccination. Under complicated circumstances, her car is currently at the dealership, getting diagnosed/fixed? She rescheduled her vaccination appointment to very early tomorrow morning.

When I met up with her earlier today, she asked me if I would drive her dog to get his shots in the morning. I told her I didn't think it was a good idea because my mom would be super mad at me since this is a new car (bought it in December) and the dog's nails are going to scratch the leather seats or the interior. My boyfriend also agrees that it's not a good idea to have an untrained dog in a new car. But my best friend said it was the only time she could have it rescheduled.

Later on when we were alone, she asked me again, reiterating it's the only time she'll have to get it done. She can't take an Uber either because apparently they won't allow dogs? (I looked it up and it said some UberX allows it but it's based on the driver's preference).

I'm really bad at saying no so I told her maybe if the dog is kept in his cage... But she says that the cage is dirty/gross and she'll just hold onto him. I'm not really consoled because the dog is extremely hyper and he hasn't gotten a bath yet. This dog steps in his own pee frequently since he permanently uses a training pad. When I pet him, he feels grimmy. I asked her if she can bathe the dog and comb him out (since he's white and sheds) but she says she'll do it after getting the shots (I think it's because it's already late).

I'm really uncomfortable having the dog in my car but I feel like I would be a bad friend if I can't help her when she's in need. What should I do? Is there a car service I can call her to get her to her appointment? We live in San Francisco if that helps.

155,"I've been working in restaurants for years and I am fantastic server, at 22 I have a pretty impressive resume. However I just relocated for school to a very rural town which is deep in the mountains of North Carolina. Nice restaurants are few and far between and my stupid ass got fired from last place because I complained about management (stupid I know! But you just gotta learn from your mistakes and move on) anyways I got offered a job at by far the nicest restaurant around. It's a dream job for me but servers had to pass a written, extensive af test and we have to score a 90 on it. Now I don't test well, at all. Especially not written tests because I have mild dyslexia I've learned to survive and thrive with dyslexia and it's never, ever impacted me at work. Mainly because the systems at most restaurants are color coded which makes it a breeze for me to enter the food! But this test killed me. The content was intense and the small print/ bright white paper/ heavy black lines made it super hard for me to decipher the content. I got 3 tries. I thought I had aced the last one. Nope. Apparently I got in the low 80's and the owner called to say they could no longer offer me the position. I had thought when a server couldn't pass the test they were moved to bus but apparently they don't have bus openings, that or they just think I'm too stupid. I'm fucking crushed. I really, really, really needed this job and I was so excited. I feel like a stupid fucking failure but I also don't wanna give up. It's finals week and this all too much for me. I feel into a really deep depression when I lost my other job and i feel like I need to always be working. Should I reach out and tell the restaurant owners something both professional and heartfelt that will give me a chance to be on the restaurant team? I'd wash dishes, host, anything. What do I do? What would you do/ say? 

TL;DR: didn't score the 90 I needed on my server test and now the restaurant doesn't want me, but I want them.",27Apr2018,1
156,"So... my friends dislike using splitwise and calculating by area to determine the pricing for the rooms. They wanted to base their pricing off of current market prices around the university. Doubles range from 550\-700, while singles typically range from 750 to 1200. We recently came across a location for an incredibly good deal. Normally this 2 bed and 1 den location goes for 3150 but we were able to snag it for 2562.

The Den\(single\):

* 8'6'' x 10'
* no closet
* Bathroom A \(shared by 3 people\)

The 'Regular' bedroom \(double\):

* 12' x13'
* decent sized closet for 1 person \(would be split by two people\)
* Bathroom A \(shared by 3 people\)

The 'Master' bedroom \(double\):

* 11'x13'
* walk in closet \(perfect for 2 people\)
* Bathroom B \(shared with your roommate\) \[Larger than Bathroom A\]

My suitemate Kristine thought it was fair to split the pricing:

* Den: $690
* 'Regular' bedroom: $435 /person
* 'Master' bedroom: $501/person

I  was talking to a current resident at the location and he stated that their pricing for the same layout is currently:

* Den: $750
* 'Regular' bedroom: $1050
* 'Master' bedroom: $1150

So if we calculate the percentage each rooms pays according to his pricing \[ Den: 25.4&amp;#37;,  'Regular' bedroom: 35.6&amp;#37;, Master' bedroom: 39&amp;#37;\] and multiply it by our total rent it comes out to be:

* Den: $654
* 'Regular' bedroom: $455/person
* 'Master' bedroom: $499/person

But then Kristine thought that the pricing for the 'Master' and the 'Regular' should be more spread out in pricing. And it is impossible to find a single for $654 unless you live 30 min from campus by driving, \(and that it is rare to even see a single for 750\). Similarly, it is impossible to find a double in the high 400 range, let along $435. Kristine was arguing that singles have a lot of benefits such as personal space, privacy, sleep... etc...  But at the same time this room is SUPER tiny. I've spent so much time talking about pricing, I feel so exhausted. We have been arguing about money and I feel like any amount of friendship we has before this whole ordeal has diminished. It probably doesn't help that for some of the locations we were looking at I was willing to pay $950 for a 12'2"" x 10' 5"". \(Total housing cost was 3300 for that location\).

Note: Initially Kristine thought it would be fair to have the prices at:

* Den: $739
* 'Regular' bedroom: $418 /person
* 'Master' bedroom: $492/person

...but I was able to negotiate it down... but it took about 2 hours of painful negotiation...

158,"I'm turning 25 in a few days, just for reference. 

Right out of high school I started working. I've worked factory jobs, warehouse jobs, retail jobs, at a tattoo parlor, and at a mechanics shop over the past seven years.

I was miserable at every single one of them. About three years ago I got married and my wife convinced me to go to college, so I quit my factory job that paid well (but I hated) and went to school. I went to college, took summer classes and graduated early. Took me a year and a half to finish a two year degree, and ever since I graduated I haven't gotten a single job. My wife has been supporting us. My degree is in graphic design, which is totally useless, and I can't get anything with it. I'm really not even very good at it, and because of that I started teaching myself web development, but people I've talked to about that don't believe I'll find much work doing it because the market is oversaturated with young people in similar situations trying to find work with a useless degree, and also because I'm in a small town in Arkansas and I'd have to relocate. 

Another problem is that when I was 18 and worked at the tattoo shop, I got free tattoos. So now I have two full sleeves and my hands are tattooed. It's all heritage related; nothing vulgar. However, people deem that unprofessional and now part of my life is ruined because of a stupid decision I made as a kid. 

Right now I'm depressed. Miserably. I've been prescribed anti-depressents and I regularly see a therapist, but none of that is going to help because I simply do not enjoy my life. My wife is the only thing that brings me happiness. 

I simply don't want to go back to deboning chickens in a Tyson plant, but I feel like I'm just going to have to accept being unhappy. 

Any advice?

I am 23 male, overweight, first generation immigrant, currently single, no criminal history nor abuse alcohol or smokers or consumes drugs including marijuana. No friends. Live with my mother In a townhouse she owned in a decent neighborhood. However the air is often stench of marijuana from neighbors and screaming of Indian children playing in the public lawn. I have an AA and working on certifications at a local college. I once was a vendor at Microsoft, employed by a international game studios to work on some language quality assurance on AAA titles. Now, I am still a vendor at Microsoft, however my employer have changed from that studios to a international firms that have businesses is pretty much all aspects but I have been out of job (not fired nor laid off, completely blind here) for 1 year 4 months. So that time I have 0 income. I have spent all my savings and living on borrowed money from my mother with her very little paycheck to support both of us. Besides cost of living, I have flushed a good chunk of my hard earned money on citizenship, failed after appeal. I have tried looking for other jobs and so far none replies a few was rejected but still a handful ""under review"". Now I have also started looking into part time jobs.

Bear with me here, I chose to enclose my personal life here to you strangers because I really need some advices.

Some history, I'll keep it as short as possible...

I was heavily peer abused and bullied before I immigrated.

Moved to U.S. during high school freshman year, started with ESL and I quickly hop out of it in less than a year. Made 'friends' which I find it ironically questionable because these 'friends' I never hangs out with them not that I don't want to but I was never invited. (I was told I should make the first move but then I wonder why others don't have to do it, too? WHY ME have to initiate??) Have them listed on Facebook, but very lonely here. Have a few on Instagram but also never hangs out in reality. Basically I have no friends. Had a couple I made through workplaces but they were all busy at their own life so we really only hangs out for the last year and that's pretty much.

Had an average high school grade, not well known among peers but I knows people. Went to a state university for a year then returned hometown to local college and got AA recently because university wasn't for me and the costs were terrible for an in-state and had struggles academically.

Had several relationships, like 5 but only *One* is real, rest were practically imaginary and one way love. The real one however defined the depressed self I think. I don't know really... Basically I was cheated, turned out I was a backup for her until the relationship is about to get more intimate than kissing and the boyfriend showed up. We handled like gentlemen.

My mother is an optimistic narcissist, that's what I believe. She belittles me every now and then, accuse me of playing too much video games when last time I use Steam was last week and PS4 was played over half a year ago. She also despises me not look for a job when I AM looking for one but it's not like I'll instantly receive a counter offer. I can't move out because I have no money.

Attempted for Citizenship but failed after appeal, because I voted but I really didn't know that and back in high school it wasn't educated at all yet the government claimed I was lying so they denied my application.

I have done quite a sheet of volunteer works and I enjoy to do so - until the pessimist self kicks in and tell myself ""I don't get pay for doing those works why am I doing it, nobody appreciates anyway"" I stopped proactively doing volunteering and now into passively seeking.

I want to make friendships that sticks and not just another +1 on Facebook. I want a relationship, I am looking for a job, studying for certifications but everything is so piled up I am so lost.

164,"Hey reddit.

I'm 19(M) yrs old, youngest of 3, living in Australia. My brother (23) has been abusing drugs (Ice) for the past couple years. He doesn't really admit to it but we know that he's 100% on it. He regularly loses his job and disappears over weekends, making it difficult to contact him. When he eventually comes home he just crashes for hours (15 to 20+). My mum loves him dearly. He used to be a good kid but now hes just a complete and utter selfish piece of shit. 

My Father has lung cancer and was undergoing radiation treatment, but caught a fever after 2 weeks of daily radiation. The other night, he woke up from a nap late in the afternoon and could barely breathe so we rushed him to the hospital. He almost died that night because my mother and I were visiting my sister who just gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. He's staying in the ward at the moment, and he finds it hard to do any activities even if they're just mundane tasks, or his breathing suffers. 

His health doesn't look very good from and I need advice on what I should do to help my family should he pass away, particularly regarding my mother. My sister is amazing, and always ready to lend a hand when she can. She will probably take my mother in if my Father passes, leaving my brother on the street, which is probably for the best. I suggested kicking him out of the house multiple times but my parents could never kick him out of the house, as they are very loving parents. I think my father will make it through this sickness, but even so, he'll still be left looking after my useless brother (lost his license).

I live by myself 4 hours away by plane and I'm using my leave to visit them for 2 weeks. I want to know what I can do to help. What can I do about my brother? He's been abusing for years and my parents have tried their hardest to get him off the drugs but they're so easy to come by in my town he just gets back on it every time. His selfishness has put my family through so much stress the last couple years and I cant help but think I could've done more to help.

How do I wake my brother up?

169,"Hi guys ,
(first post here)

I have some sort of a big issue here. I am turning 24, just graduated college, and I got my first REAL relationship. 
I got my first girlfriend at 16, didn't last more that a couple of months. After that I dated a few girls, but never got to anything serious. The girls I have dated were like really good friends (except for the first one that I mentioned first), we texted a lot until late night, went out, had fun, but never got to anything serious (I mean sex.. some of them I didn't even kiss), even though I dated each, on average, 3 months (some even more). I was pretty happy in high school, did a few fun things (although not as much as I really wanted). 
In college (actually, almost a year earlier), things got a little worse, my family, which always gave me a hard time (not in the positive way) went through a lot, depression, money problems and a lot more (they divorced some years back as well). We were never fine, but at that time, it really got to me. And I wasn't really the same anymore. As I didn't have a father figure in the family (well, I did, but it wasn't the father figure I needed), I had to take all of his responsibilities, and I always had to take care of them. I became easily annoyed, and I pushed away from everything, and focused on learning and studying alone. It was kind of a refuge for me, where I kinda felt safe, because I couldn't really talk to anybody about my problems, especially my parents, who would blame me for things, rather than helping me with my problems (and I really think I needed help). They always were like that, whenever I had problems (real problems, not getting a scratch from falling off a bike), they never tried to find a solution. They either blamed me for being needy and ungrateful (even though I didn't have much to be grateful for, believe me), or just ignored me, thinking that anything I had would pass. And it didn't always just pass.
Now, after graduation, I got a pretty good paying job, and I can now afford the things I couldn't afford in college (I mean really, I couldn't afford very much in college). I'm trying to get some distance from my parents, because I can't solve their problems forever, and I feel like it's working (small steps, but it's working).
Now back to my big problem: I told you that I just got a real girlfriend. Let's call her Anna. Even though I didn't have much experience before, I really felt something with her, from the first few times that we talked and met. We have been together a couple of months now, and I'm kinda in love with her. We appreciate each other because we are very understanding, we hang out a lot together, but we also go out separately, each of us with their friends (and I see a lot of my friends over reacting on these sort of things, especially when they are at the beginning of their relationships, some of them even after a lot of time).
BUT. She is (obviously) more experienced than I am, went through some shitty relationships before, and I didn't (ok, maybe the first one, when I was 16 and I saw her kissing another guy, but we were 16 and we were together like 2 months. It hurt, because I think I loved her, but that's all). And Anna is afraid that I will want to experience more. She said that she wanted to see how it would be with others (a few years ago), and she says that I'll want that too, at some point, especially knowing that she had done that. And she said that this will kill me if I don't. Before she told me that, I didn't really thought about that, I was just happy that I found her. But since then, I'm worrying constantly. I feel very good when I'm with her, but when I'm at work, or I'm not with her, I start worrying again. And I can't help but wonder, what if it's true? What if I'll want something else? What if I'm going to lose her because I didn't get to do these kind of things in college, and I'll want to do them now. I really love her, but I don't really know what to do. It bugs me that she thinks about this too, and she told me that a few times these two months. She even said that she considers letting me go and have my fun with a few chicks, but she's afraid that I won't come back to her. I mean, I don't want other girls now, but if this will fix the problem... I really don't know what to do, I just want to be happy with her, and I want her to be happy with me. And I want to get these things out of the way, but I don't know how. I don't want to be frustrated in our relationship and end up hurting her. 

I'd love to hear what you guys think. Thank you in advance!",27Apr2018,1

Anyway, I’m a final year university student whose expertise revolve around Asia. I met my girlfriend at the end of my first year, we’ve been in a long distance relationship ever since but we see each other quite often considering the distance. Anyway, I’m madly in love with her but I’ve gotten to an awkward position in life.

I’m now stuck in a position where it seems I have to choose her or my career. Basically I would have to move to Korea for a whole year to gain some experience. The problem ofcourse is the time difference gap and the fact we won’t see each other anywhere near as often. I know if I go to Korea and we broke up I’d just spend the whole duration just emotionally broken anyway but my career requires that I travel a lot. I’ve obviously spent 3 years at university getting a degree for this exact field so it’s not like I can just change career but I also don’t want to leave her.

175,"Going to try to summarise this as well as possible. 

I met a boy back in October in Edinburgh. We both knew I would eventually be moving away for a job in December, but still hung out frequently until that point. We had an amazing connection and every hang out was amazing.

I made my move and tried my best to put it all behind me. I still thought of him on occasion and we talked very rarely at this point. I made a return trip up to Edinburgh at the end of January and we decided to meet. We had an amazing day together and it rekindled a lot of feelings for me. I went back to my current city with him weighing on my mind and it was at this point that I realised I really liked him. 

He obviously felt the same because he decided then that he would come visit me and ended up doing so in mid\-March. Leading up to the visit, we were chatting almost everyday via text. Because he was making the effort to visit and reach out regularly, I was under the impression that he wasn't quite over me yet in the same way I wasn't over him. So while he was visiting I sat him down and told him how I felt about him to which he very clearly said, ""You have a life here now and I don't want me to hold you back from finding someone here"". 

The communication following the visit was quite infrequent. In one conversation I directly asked him his reasoning for making the trip in the first place to which he responded, ""to chat and hang out. Obviously if you were here I would want to be with you all the time."" 

\*\*\*On a sidenote, I'm not really liking my job at the moment as well as I would have liked. And considering this was my sole reasoning for leaving Edinburgh in the first place, I am very keen on getting back as it is my home and I still have friends there. Obviously I didn't want my situation with this boy to cloud my decision to go back, so I decided to make a return trip to try to feel out if a move back would be the right decision for me outside of him.\*\*\* 

So, I made the return trip to Edinburgh about two weeks ago and was immediately happy to be back in the city. I hung out with a lot of friends, enjoyed the sunshine and just plain loved being back in a familiar place surrounded by people i love. He and I met again and had another wonderful afternoon together, to which I told him that I was applying to come back. 

We have been speaking a bit more since that meeting, but he is again being more distant as the time since our last meeting goes on. He seems very keen when he is with me and then sort of gives up on me.

 He knows I am actively trying to come back, so I don't understand where his hesitance is with all of this. I understand that it would be hard to ask him to make a decision now regarding us, but feel like I'm in some sort of limbo and it's driving me crazy. I much rather know now before I make my move back if he won't be in my life at that point so I can properly get over him while I'm at a distance.

 I also don't want to scare him away by demanding an answer from him now. But I do want to give myself the opportunity to find clarity, and move on if need be. So how should I frame this to him?

180,"Apologies for being vague but I am trying not to get too caught up in the details.

Six months ago two friends and myself decided to go into business with one another selling a fairly unique product. We've spent the time since doing all of the startup business stuff (market analysis, consumer outreach etc etc). The work has been divided up pretty equally and through this process we discovered what areas of the business we each would do a better job at. One of us is a great saleman, another is more of the legal expert/marketer and I'm more of the oversee the production process and handle daily operations. Or at least that's how we envision our future roles thus far.

When it came time to raise capital it was pretty clear that the vast majority of the funds we needed to get going (170,000) would be coming from a single partner (like 160,000 of it). 

We've reached the point where we need an official operating agreement so we can register our LLC, and some disagreement has arisen when it comes to how ownership and profits will be split.

The money partner/salesman believes that they should receive 80% of ownership/profits with the remaining 20% being divided between the other two. 

Now I totally appreciate the huge financial risk that he is taking, but 80% ownership seems a little too much, especially when it looks like the work required of each member in the future will be fairly equal. 

I voiced my disagreement with this share percentage and the backup reason given was that if the buisness failed, he would need to own 80% so that he could write off the investment as a loss (the reasoning he used was that if he would only be able to write off a percentage of his investment equal to his share of ownership).

My question is this: is that truly how writing off an investment works? Can he only write off an equal percentage of his ownership of the company?

Whether or not that that is the case, are there any suggestions for a more appropriate share of ownership? Is possible to allocate 80% of profits to him until his investment is returned at which point it would return to a more equal percentage?

181,"Apologies for a long post, and for formatting as I’m on my phone... also hoping this is the right subreddit to post in.

For background: we live in a small 3 bed flat. Last night my other flatmate (I’ll refer to as B) also had his girlfriend over who both work jobs which they have to get up for early in the morning.

So last night at around 12am my flatmate (A) has a couple of friends over, they’re in the hallway being loud and I stick my head out and say “if you’re going to bring people back on a week day, keep it down cause B and his girlfriend are sleeping. They apologise and flatmate confirms that his friends are leaving and he’s going to bed himself.

I go to bed and wake up at 3am to two loud buzzes on the doorbell (imagine one of those horrible buzzing doorbells and then hold that up to a speaker and that’s what our doorbell sounds like).

I obviously panic at this point as we live in a major city and I jump to thinking it may be intruders (granted, I don’t know why they’d ring the bell but hey I’d just been woken up I wasn’t thinking straight) 

I go into the corridor and A is up and I say “who the f*** is that” and he says “I don’t know I’m going to find out” and goes towards the main door. I hang back (I won’t lie, I was scared), and he opens the door to two people stood there. 

Then he says “I told you not to ring the bell” so at this point I realise he knows them and I say “are you f***ing kidding me” and walk back to my room. He then invites these strangers in to the flat and puts them down in the spare room for the night. 

We have an informal policy that if we have overnight guests we’ll let each other know beforehand (just to save jumping out of your skin if you go to the bathroom in the night and a stranger is there) 

So I’m annoyed that a) he invited friends over to stay without letting me and B know
b) he lets them come at 3am despite knowing flatmate B and his girlfriend have work in the morning
 and c) when I’ve jumped out of bed thinking there’s intruders he doesn’t think to mention point a or b 

I just need some advice on how to tackle this with A, or if I even should.
He’s young and has never lived away from home before but I don’t think that’s an excuse for lacking common decency.

I have been travelling for 3 years now. Originally I started travelling when I just turned 22, I have a college degree, it was supposed to be a 4 month deal. But I loved it, I stayed, I continued to take on menial hospitality jobs that didnt fulfill me, but enabled by travel and allowed me to live in really cool places with little risk. 

I just turned 25 and I'm sick of being a waitress. This was never the plan. I do not want to be a 27 year old waitress. I didnt know what I wanted to do, I am still aborad, my employer talked me into applying for a visa to stay another year. Tis visa has cost $1500 in total, and involved a lot of effort and stress. I have constantly been on my boss and on my co-workers for help with applying for the working visa, its increadible long winded and stressful. 

In my gut, I want to go home, or at least back to europe to 'start my life'. There was a period where i actually thought the visa wouldnt get approved and I kind of grew to accept the fact I'd have to go home... and I was relieved! I realised that going home would actually be a good thing for me.

But, I feel like im in too deep. My coworkers are congratulating me for getting the visa. I am visiting home for a couple of months but the plan is to come back out here. Maybe I'll change my mind once I'm home. I should never have agreed to apply for the visa. I'm
itching to get my life started and right now its on hold.

TL;DR -went through long expensive process to get a visa approved to stay in another country as a waitress for another year. Now it's approved, I've changed my mind and want to go home.",27Apr2018,7
185,"So yesterday, after I bought a Mother’s Day card to put my letter in and mail it out, I finally gathered up the courage to call my grandmother. 

She answered and I said hello. Immediately she knew my voice, and was so happy that I called. She said I made her day by calling her, and that she prayed for years that I’d finally contact her. We talked for awhile, and she told me about how she had seen my formal pictures, and she caught me up on family events. 

She said for two years after the no contact order was issued, she continued to search for me. She would drive up to my Mamaw and Papaw’s house looking for me or at least be able to see me playing in the yard, but those two years were the years I traveled a lot with my grandparents so anybody was rarely there. She didn’t know that my parents had bought a house below my grandparents house, before moving back to Ohio, so she looked for me at my old house until she realized it was empty. She lost 20 pounds and all kinds of hair due to stress. 

My grandmother kept all of my old toys, but she gave away my clothes to kids who needed it, so I know she’s doing better with the grieving process. She asked, “Did you keep your long hair or did you chop it all off?” I told her my curls would be ugly if I chopped them off, and she goes, “Good. I always loved your beautiful hair. It reminded me so much of Denise’s and what about Basketball or Softball? Did you do that?” I told her I was to short to do basketball, which I’m 5”5 and I have no idea how I’m that short considering that side of the family all are like Amazons, and my mom’s side isn’t short either. 

There are a couple of things I wish she hadn’t said, but that’s the personality that the whole side of that family has. Like when I said I searched forever for her number (she lives in backwoods WV and I’m now living in another state, plus the phone numbers I found online weren’t hers) she said, “Well I’m under [name] in the phone book like I always have been.” When I told her we didn’t get phone books for her town when we lived in the same state, much less now that I live 6 hours away, she says, “You could’ve called the directory, but whatever.” Then she told me about this laser eye surgery so that she can see perfectly fine. I said that that was great! That finally she could get rid of her glasses. She says, “I never wore glasses all the time.” Lies. She had me thinking I was crazy for a good 10 mins, because I knew she wore glasses everyday for 30 years of her life. When my Mamaw got a pair like hers (they were those big funky 80s glasses) I told her to get rid of them because I couldn’t stand to see them. So I know I’m not fucking crazy, and I even have pictures of her with them on doing normal stuff. I mean, maybe she was embarrassed, but still I do want to talk to her. That’s just her personality, and she’s never lied to me before, so I figure she has a good reason for it.

As I was going through the pictures that my great aunt sent me, I noticed how much my grandmother resembled Jacklyn Kennedy in the face. Like they could be twins! Especially when she recently got the same hair cut. I told my grandmother that, and she said during the Kennedy election, people would tell her she looked like Jacklyn’s sister. I went through the rest of the family photos, and noticed how much they resembled the Bouvier (Jacklyn’s family) family. So who knows, I might share the same common ancestor with a former first lady lol. 

Anyway, thanks for the advice everyone. Really it means a lot to me to be able to talk to her, and you guys truly helped me out. So a million thank yous and I’ll keep you updated!

186,"I have gone to 4 schools in my time (3 primary, 1 high) and at every school most everyone has hated me.

In primary school I have always had a few friends that were usually the other losers of the school. By losers I don't mean the smart nerds or anything, they hated me too. I mean the annoying kids that nobody liked, they even got on my nerves sometimes but they were all I had.

In high school I had a group of kids I hung out with that I called 'friends' but they were not my friends they were just nice to me so I hung out with them. They never hung out with me outside of school and I always used to see them hanging out together after school at the shops or hear them talking about the party they just went to together.

I only had one person in high school that I would call a friend. He is very smart and talented but I have not seen him in a couple of years.

I have a best friend that I have know since primary school and I don't know why he likes me. He has become one of the 'cool popular kids' but he still loves me as I do him. I am going to his party in a couple of days so that will be fun. It will be the first time I have hung out with anyone, since his birthday last year.

I also a friend that I have met at a youth group. But I have not seen her in about 6 months. I don't think she likes me, she said she was busy the last two times I asked her to hang out.

With most of my friends they will not ever invite me to hang out or even initiate conversation if I don't first. I don't message anyone anymore because I feel like a nuisance.

188,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Well about a year ago I started working at this daycare in my town as Lead Teacher. I dont want to do this when I grow up but it was a good gig while I went to school. The pay was alright, 40 hours a week, great.  

It was not great.  

The director was a liar who was manipulative.  She blamed everyone but herself.  She picked favorite employees and shit on the rest.  Employees constantly talked about quitting and probably 10 people left while I worked there.  Everyday when i went to work at 6-8 am, I never knew when I would get off and it would usually end up being close to 6.  The negative environment caused other staff to treat it like a high school with all the gossip.  I really chose this job to spend time and teach kids so I was obviously not interested.

At the beginning of this year, licensing came and the company was written up because it turns out neither LEAD teacher in my classroom was actually certified.  This is the fault of the director, because when she hired me, she counted my credits and said, ""That works, you have enough credits to be a lead.""  Seeing as the company was written up, they had to get a qualified lead in that classroom.  The director then signed me up for two online courses that I had to complete to become the lead officially.  The company paid for these courses, I have a copy of the receipts, 153.00$ each.  I finished one course, and at the end of the second one, I took FMLA leave due to my mom having back surgery.  I turned in the proper documents to get approved, which did.  The day before I left, I put in my two weeks. I had had enough.

A week later, I am on leave and I get my paycheck, which has 306$ deducted for ""reimbursement for classes.""  I sent the director a letter in the mail asking for documentation with my signature or acknowledgement of reimbursing, she could not provide it.  Now a month later and I am still going back and forth with the OWNER. He is sending me the same wrongful documentation stating that my name written on the receipt in THE DIRECTORS HANDWRITING is acknowledgement I would have to reimburse them if I did not work there for X amount of time.

I really don't want this to happen to anyone else who is trying to leave this company.  There is nowhere in the handbook with this policy and I feel they are illegally withholding my money.

I have an awesome new job NOT at a daycare, so the money isn't detrimental to my survival.

189,"I know this is a post that probably gets seen here every other day, but I still wanted to make sure I had as much advice as possible going into this

The person I want to confess to (16F) has been friends with me for about a year and a half, this is mainly what worries me about confessing as we've been good friends for a while. I've already decided that I will absolutely confess my feelings no matter what by the end of the semester and I will force myself to, but I'm starting to think about doing it earlier than before as I want to get the weight of my shoulders.

The main thing I'm unsure of is how to go about doing it, I originally thought that doing it privately in real life would be best, I can't think of a place to talk to her completely in private, and I feel that I'm putting her on the spot by doing that and knowing her she'll have a hard time coming up with how to respond no matter what she thinks. As well as I find it hard to personally bring myself to do it person, although I could force myself if I wanted to.

I think doing it over text would be the best way because she can respond more easily and probably articulate whatever she thinks better, and if she does reject me it'll be easier to talk to her normally the next day as we never had a real life encounter. I only feel that texting might come off as ingenuous and there's no real life element to fully get my feelings across.

I have asked someone out over text before, and they said yes but that relationship was an infatuation, here I feel like I've definitely have real feelings for this person and I definitely want to confess.

Edit: an extra note than me and her are planning to go to a convention together with some friends around May 20th and I feel like confessing before that could either completely ruin it or make it a lot better depending on what happens.

Basically, I'm looking on advice on how I should confess and when based off this information, as well as anything else people here can offer to the table for help.

191,"I met a boy back in October in Edinburgh. We both knew I would eventually be moving away for a job in December, but still hung out frequently until that point. We had an amazing connection and every hang out was amazing.

I made my move and tried my best to put it all behind me. I still thought of him on occasion and we talked very rarely at this point. I made a return trip up to Edinburgh at the end of January and we decided to meet. We had an amazing day together and it rekindled a lot of feelings for me. I went back to my current city with him weighing on my mind and it was at this point that I realised I really liked him.

He obviously felt the same because he decided then that he would come visit me and ended up doing so in mid\-March. Leading up to the visit, we were chatting almost everyday via text. Because he was making the effort to visit and reach out regularly, I was under the impression that he wasn't quite over me yet in the same way I wasn't over him. So while he was visiting I sat him down and told him how I felt about him to which he very clearly said, ""You have a life here now and I don't want me to hold you back from finding someone here"".

The communication following the visit was quite infrequent. In one conversation I directly asked him his reasoning for making the trip in the first place to which he responded, ""to chat and hang out. Obviously if you were here I would want to be with you all the time.""

\*\*\*On a sidenote, I'm not really liking my job at the moment as well as I would have liked. And considering this was my sole reasoning for leaving Edinburgh in the first place, I am very keen on getting back as it is my home and I still have friends there. Obviously I didn't want my situation with this boy to cloud my decision to go back, so I decided to make a return trip to try to feel out if a move back would be the right decision for me outside of him.\*\*\*

So, I made the return trip to Edinburgh about two weeks ago and was immediately happy to be back in the city. I hung out with a lot of friends, enjoyed the sunshine and just plain loved being back in a familiar place surrounded by people i love. He and I met again and had another wonderful afternoon together, to which I told him that I was applying to come back.

We have been speaking a bit more since that meeting, but he is again being more distant as the time since our last meeting goes on. He seems very keen when he is with me and then sort of gives up on me.

He knows I am actively trying to come back, so I don't understand where his hesitance is with all of this. I understand that it would be hard to ask him to make a decision now regarding us, but feel like I'm in some sort of limbo and it's driving me crazy. I much rather know now before I make my move back if he won't be in my life at that point so I can properly get over him while I'm at a distance.

I also don't want to scare him away by demanding an answer from him now. But I do want to give myself the opportunity to find clarity, and move on if need be. So how should I frame this to him?

Last weekend I was at a wedding. Towards the end of the night, they put on a slow song and the DJ says every couple needs to come to the dance floor. I get off the dance floor and sit down, realizing that nearly the entire room is on the dance floor.

About halfway through the song, I happen to see a girl - one of the bridesmaids - sitting alone on the other side of the room. I don't know her, but she looked kind of sad. She was soon joined by two other girls. I thought to myself, ""Why don't you go up to her and ask if she wants to dance?""

But then my brain went haywire. ""No, don't. She'll tell you 'no.'"" ""You don't even know her. She'll think you're weird."" ""All your friends will see and you'll be embarrassed in front of them.""

And earlier in the evening, during the bouquet toss, all of my guy friends who were at the wedding told me I should go up to the girl who caught the bouquet and get her number. But I kept telling them, ""Maybe later,"" or ""No, that's okay.""

She kept saying phrases like "" no no no"" over and over so eventually i said "" fuck off!"" and hung up the phone thinking it was some random person possibly on drugs just harrassing the number. The person called back in a few minutes so i picked up the phone and said "" I said FUCK OFF!"" and hung up. Like two minutes passes and the phone rings again and it's a regular person now . The person on the other end said "" hi i'm cindy and alice told me to call me this number and "" and i don't know what i was thinking exactly but i cut her off and said "" I don't know you people stop calling this number!"" and hung up on her mid scentence. At that point i recalled my mother does under the table work caring for an old lady who had a stroke named alice who can only say a few stock phrases. I felt like a dick and told my mom what happened and she was understandably pissed. So this morning i said let me call them and apologize because it was a misunderstanding and my mom said not to and she's going to talk to them i'm assuming. So anyways I got to school this morning and got  a message from my mother and she asked me if i am taking any other drugs besides my ADHD medication. I said no, why? She said because you've been very paranoid and agitated lately and for a guy who's always "" going hiking"" you've been gaining weight. She says it would explain the incident last night and  a few other recent events where i basically freaked out about small things because i blew them out of proportion. My mom's all concerned about me now and she said i just don't want you to end up in jail maybe we should only take the medication twice a week etc. So at first i was like ok well it's probably just my mom thinking too much into things so i told my friend. I told him what my mom said about how i've been paranoid etc lately and he said he 100 percent agrees i have been different lately and i need to calm down. I think i've been gaining weight because i did notice that my stomach is a little bigger then it normally is, but mentally i don't know i think i'm ok. The only thing that's concerning me is that my friend agrees with my mom, i have had a few events lately where i've gotten like upset and mad and blown things out of proportion and one other thing. Basically my ADHD med, vyvanese, helps me keep my shit together but lately at the end of the day i've been kind of falling apart and becoming a mess. Like for example i was playing runescape the other day after school and i could not for the life of me recall how to get to a place i frequent often in there called port sarim even though i've been there a million times and i just find myself unable to concentrate and like the other day at the end of the day i went to get my little brother a meatball and dropped the pasta on the floor and i swear i put a little meatball in the dish for him but maybe it fell out because it wasn't on the plate when i gave it back to him and just weird little things like that have been happening.  This is a recent development though and things like this never used to happen when i would take vyvanese . Until like maybe a few weeks ago i'd take vyvanese and be  on the ball all day. So yeah i have no idea what's going on, or what i should do, but i seem to be kind of falling apart for no reason.

196,"Any advice would be appreciated as I am at a loss right now.

My father has been a workaholic all his life, inheriting that trait from his abusive father, and the only thing he knows or acts like he cares about in life is his business. He has always been somewhat erratic in his emotions, but after business took a bad turn a few years ago and he had to sell our childhood home, he seems to have snapped.

I always thought my dad cared about me, but it's becoming less and less apparent as time goes on. He recently threw my brother out of the house, claims he only has one son (me), and is packing his stuff up tonight and leaving my mom, brother, and myself in the house.

I feel like his behavior is not rational or sane. We are literally the only family he has and he goes from saying he loves me more than anything to saying he is ready to disown me (a fight recently occurred but I had nothing to do with it) every other day. 

I feel like he needs to be on medication or in therapy, and we have tried having family discussions about it multiple times. He always promises he will listen to us and then a day later does a 180, says how he is how he is and does not want or need to change. He is emotionally abusive to my mother and brother, and his temper seems like it's not far from turning physical.

Regardless, we all love him, do not want him to leave the house or our family, and I have no idea how to proceed from here. Do I let my parents get divorced, do I keep trying to talk some sense into my dad, or do I just give up on this half ass relationship with my father. He is so narcissistic he probably thinks we have an amazing relationship when it's anything but. As the oldest son I would hate to ruin my relationship with my father, but I feel like my main responsibility is taking care of my younger brother and mom. My dad always says it is the three of us versus him, but he is the one that keeps pushing us into situations where we need to take care of each other emotionally from him.

I'm so conflicted because my dad has been an amazing provider all of my life, but a shitty father. I feel for him as working is all he knows, but at what point do I stop excusing his shitty behavior.

200,"I used amphetamines, namely adderal and ritalin, for roughly 6 months straight once or twice a week never more than 30 mg of either at once. I quit the adderal after 2 months as it gave me hallucinations and made me extremely aggressive (my sister even pointed it out). I switched to just ritalin with some vyvanse mixed in for heavy duty work loads and was generally fine. Never had an issue with withdraw or need after quitting the adderal and was fine for two weeks when I couldn't get any. I chose to quit for reasons I forget back in january and have been clean for 4 months.

Here is where things get complicated. The grading period where I was taking the amphetamines my grades were better than they have ever been since elementary. I was able to do my work and even exceeded expectations. I wrote, filmed, and edited and short film in 2 days, editing for nearly 8 hours straight on a sunday night and going to school fine the next day. My mom even commented one time while I was working on amps, saying ""where did my old son go? who is this new guy who does all of his work?"".

I’m finishing up a web dev program in a few weeks and I have the opportunity to either dig in where I am or move to another part of the country. Basically I’m between staying Atlanta or moving to Denver. On one hand: I’ve spent more time in Atlanta, my family lives in Georgia, I have more close friends in ATL. On the other hand: Denver has better weather (IMO), more outdoor activities, and the city overall has better metrics than ATL (safety, education, etc). Both have good tech scenes to help me get started in web dev.

If I go down the logical checkboxes, Denver is definitely where I should go. The only thing that keeps me from going all-in is knowing that a majority of my close friends live in ATL. You hear people say at the end of life that they wish they spent more time with close friends and I’m worried that might be something I regret as well. If I don’t move to Denver I’m worried I’ll regret never trying. Any tips on how to approach this decision?

204,"Okay, so a little bit of background. I was hired to be the camp director of a Boy Scout camp, which has been an absolute dream of mine since I started 9 years ago. I've personally helped hire and train almost all of the current staff, and (without trying to toot my own horn) the staff really look up to me (mostly age 14-18). 

I knew, going into this job, it was not going to be easy at all. I've been the program director (#2) for a couple of years, so I was finally ready for the challenge of the summer. As the months of planning, hiring, and organizing went along, I've been feeling less and less respected by the camp's council. I've been given shitty mandates to carry out, including having to let several staff go and tell our counselors in training (CITs) that they can only work part of the summer instead of the whole thing. Registration numbers are very low for this summer, which is why cuts needed to be made, so I can understand that. This is where the advice is needed...

As I've said, our staff count had already dropped from the prior years; however, I got a call from council saying that I need to, at less than 2 months from the start of camp, tell all of the CITs that they cannot work at camp and to cut 11 more paid positions. Putting aside the fact that I don't want to let go of 11 amazing employees, these staff cuts will leave the camp's program to suffer. For example, last year we had 10 lifeguards for our waterfront (8 is a fair number to run the area well with everyone working to their max). This year, we have 4 allocated to the waterfront. These cuts will leave us with a program of poor quality, create safety risks, and tank staff morale. On top of that, which is what pushed me to consider walking, I was told to ""Deal with it, it's your job"" when I told the council that I refuse to fire all these young, excited staffers because it was not fair for me to carry out their decision. I talked to my prior camp director, who is impressively wise, and he said that the situation is not going to get better for the summer and that he would not be putting up with it. In his words, ""I've never seen or heard of a camp director being fucked as hard as you are"".

On the other hand, I've hired and worked closely with all of the staff that would be remaining to work on staff. I can't get over the guilt of feeling like I would be abandoning them. I also know that camp would be in a worse situation if the camp director left, and I'm guessing that other directors will quit if I do. 

My wise mentor told me that this is ""uncharted territory"" for him, which terrifies me because he always has an answer. Help me, /r/advice, you're my only hope. ",27Apr2018,6

206,"I have a thumb sucking habit as an adult and I have PTSD over going to new places or meeting other people.  Two years ago, one guy was sitting next to me on the train and he kept murmuring the word ""Ebola"" and it seemed he was in panic. I had to go home and washed my hands many times because I was afraid that perhaps his saliva spattered on my clothes while he was talking. I had to throw out the clothes I was wearing on that day because I didn't want to  suck my thumb after I touch it again. I didn't want to wash the clothes and wear again because I was uncertain the virus would go away after cleaning. This happens one in million but I'm afraid from the thought that I won't never be able to stop my habit completely and probably I will experience similar situation in the future because I'm young and still have 60 years to live\(maybe\).   

A lots of psychologists says that Habit is hard to stop if you've been doing it for a lots of years and it gets ingrained. I've been sucking my thumb in my sleep since I was a baby and now I'm 22. I have tried so hard to stop it but never succeeded. What makes no sense is that I've never had a desire to suck my thumb during the days and I never did it.

My habit affects my social life. My friends don't know about my habit and would throw about AIDS Joke. For instance, I was eating dinner with my friend and he told me that he became vegetarian because he had AIDS.

Here is another one, I was eating soup with another friend and he told me He also had AIDS as a joke.  

I freaked out after hearing these and I didn't want to meet them again because I was afraid of the disease.

I know this sounds crazy and I know you can't get such disease easily unless you touch or drink their blood.

Possibilities of the situation where my friends come to my house and bleed on my desk or table is very low However I get confused if the red stain on the table is his blood or ketchup after we have a dinner together. 

Also, one of my friend confessed he was a pimp once and he got hurt when he was hanging out with me at my house and he bleed on my coach. I'm afraid he has HIV and I didn't wanna sit on the coach again.

210,"Long story short, I have never fit in with the male stereotype of masculinity and have always been more a feminine person. This contrasts sharply with how I was raised so it was never brought up to me as a child or possibly how I acted. I remember always trying to kiss my brothers growing up and them being freaked out, but me never thinking it was weird. This has went on throughout my life and due to me having a higher pitcher (almost unisex voice people say) to be called gay and ridiculed for things I could not changed. Now this happened as I was in fifth grade and still living a sheltered homelife, I never found out what being gay was until I was around that age. Slowly my life turned into me resenting the word gay and always identifying it as a bad thing, because of how it made me feel for people to call me it. 

Now fast forward about 5 years later and I'm a quiet person, and being attracted to females (being in a single ""relationship"" in 7th grade that was only kissing), and I'm hanging out with my friends, being the insomniac I am I went upstairs to go to sleep and as I lay there (they are in the adjacent room) one of the other friends comes in and just lays on tops of me and fondles me (grabbing my underparts and stiffening them). This lasted about 30 seconds to a minute and stopped when he decided that it was way too weird and that my friends even stated ""it looks like you're touching him"", I was awake for this whole affair but played it off as being asleep (not that I could move as he was overweight and I am a tiny 5 foot 6 boy)

 Now fast forward about a year and a half later and I work at a job, at this job my thirty going on forty something boss makes some offhand remarks about how attractive I am and how ""I'm not gay, but I would totally fuck you"" and then for the next three months would grab me and scold me and make me feel like I couldn't be who I was without some negative drawback and made
Me feel numb and wince whenever he would grab me (this was purely sexual, no fun and games there). 

Now the thought of ever being with a men has been ruined and burned by the past events of my life. Take in the account that I am still discovering who I am as a person (currently in a relationship with a bisexual [but very very gay] girl who dresses very dyke and like a lesbian, I realize I'm attracted to her more masculine features. Such as how hairy she is, her deeper voice, her short hair, her male stances to name a few and it makes me wonder if I am just not being able to come to terms with who I am because of my past. 

tl;dr: not relationship advice but life advice, have had gay thoughts throughout my life and never had an outlet or even talked about being gay with anyone besides my current gf (only briefly), but my past makes me weirded out by this and scares me of how some will react.

215,"My girlfriend and I started this new side job that her cousin referred her to. Then I came along as well to see what it was about and decided I would do it essentially because of the free training that comes along with it. At first I noticed the normal salesman attributes in conversations with the main boss. He was very complimentary but mainly to my girlfriend. Nothing creepy or out of line but just very complimentary. 

I started to notice on top of this he made majority of eye contact with my girlfriend each meeting. At the end of each meeting we would all shake hands and he has always quickly just grab my finger tips and squeeze (that classic dick handshake). Which I find extremely disrespectful and unprofessional from a business standpoint. Looking forward to the possible financial gains I stayed optimistic and told myself its just him being a classic sales person. 

Come the next meeting we come with prepare lists of potential clients and start to discuss all about the business and starting out and more information about training. He concludes it with incentives for us to complete in a short period of time after I comment about a piece of electronic equipment on the desk. He offers me his extra one and then looks at my girlfriend and says ""and if you complete it I will give you $200 because I mean you are the better looking one."" I go look up what he offered on Amazon right after...can get one for $20...

After this they offered up another incentive for something else, and it was a meal with them at local place. Which like we are a couple so its like you are having us compete for us to go on a meal with out each other when we already have busy schedules and barely have time to do that ourselves. 

After this I started to really just get bad vibes. We haven't met since this but I feel like its going to progress into more and more things such as this. I mentioned it to my parents and they instantly had the same reaction. When discussing it with my girlfriend she was very uncomfortable about it and didn't like it one bit but is also use to men giving her similar compliments when coming through her line at her other job. As well as that because her cousin works there is is very optimistic about the potential money we could earn and does her best to ignore it.

I am very mixed about what to do because I just kind of don't want to start something or see any women in that environment that could quickly escalate to sexual harassment. Especially when at times she could have to go meet clients just with him. I feel like that is a really out of line thing to do. Same time I kind of want to stick it out for the training, see how it goes, and if he comments anything, I just mention it to him this is out of line and unprofessional. I fear this will lead to provoke him though. 

I'm kind of stuck in my head about this but I'd like to get some opinions on this. Am I being paranoid from friendliness or is this something I should be definitely be watching out for at this point? Should my girlfriend and I be pursuing something like this? Should this be something one of us needs to discuss with him if it happens again?  ",27Apr2018,10

We are in the south, where naming a child after the father is fairly common, but I don't want a ""Jr."" My wife wants to give our boy the middle name ""Thomas,"" which she says is a family name, but can only point out- Her brother, and a distant grand-Uncle as having the name.

Here is my beef- Thomas (brother in law) has 2 children of his own (girls), and neither of them is named after my wife, so why do I have to name my boy after him?  I feel that if our son is not going to be named after me, than I don't want him named after anyone else in our immediate family.  

I thought that a deal where she gets full middle name naming rights, with the caveat that the only name I do not want is ""Thomas,"" was a good deal.  But she has stated several times that ""Thomas"" is still on the board.  I have very little leverage here as my c-section date of May 4th was accepted in the deal.  (StarWars birth reference...so what, wanna fight about it? 

I feel that naming my son after my brother-in-law, who is healthy and alive with a growing family of his own, is emasculating.  I feel that it is a very deep gutting of my status as a man.  I am trying to not be all *patriarchy* and stuff, but I feel that this is a jab at me since for the girl name she didn't want any ""family"" names.  So...the logic that I am in, is that it is not okay for girl family names, it is okay for boy family names....but within the boy family names it can diverge from the Father's family name line.

I was obviously devastated with it I'd grown up with her from about the age of 11-12 but I confided a lot in my one best friend. For anonymity sake I'll call him S. He had been my good friend for year but when I broke up with my gf we became super close, playing games late into the night on Xbox, talking on the phone and such. Suddenly, it took a surprise turn when jokingly asked me if I'd ever thought about guys. I laughed but I remember it spinning my world on it's head as I realised that I had. Not only inly had I thought about guys but I'd thought a lot about him specifically. 

Well one thing lead to another and before I knew it I was arranging to stay at his house. Well the night was so beautiful, I truly have never felt happiness like that night. We stayed at home playing tomb raider and fell asleep, cuddling together on the couch watching aeroplane (I know that's funny levels of detail but I want you to understand the feelings). Well we woke up and I kissed him. And when my lips met his every single stupid little problem I'd ever thought mattered melted into nothingness and in that moment we we're complete. I walked home that morning with such a stupid grin on my face but I was so happy. After another night together and an escalation (never had sex but came close) we were talking about being together. I really wanted to but he didn't want to because he hadn't really had a girlfriend before. So before I knew it he had a girlfriend. She was my ex girlfriends really good friend and before I knew it I was back with my ex.

Flash forward about half a year. I was missing S and decided to reach out to him and found out he had broken up with his girlfriend recently. We talked and talked about music about life. There was such a spark between us. Obviously I didn't want to cheat on my girlfriend so I avoided flirting but I couldn't help myself. We ended up going out together to see the movie Zootopia. It was such a perfect night and convinced me I loved him. Well my girlfriend flipped out and I told her everything ive told you up until this point.  We ended up staying together for about a year before we broke up over differing life choices (University and careers and such). Well in this year S has managed to go from a cute, socially awkward introvert into the centre of a pretty large group of what were the ""popular"" kids back in school. I know we still have the same tastes in stuff because I've stalked his Instagram as weird as that is. 

This is were my plea for advice comes in. I've found myself with a rebound, a girl that I've been with for a few months but she is really attached to me and had a shitty life growing up but I've found myself trailing off her and back to S. But, and this is the question, What do I do? Do I message S and risk being made fun of by everyone and losing friends, girlfriend. Do I explain that i think I'm gay to him? I don't even know what would happen if I messaged him and I think he might have a girlfriend right now. Just, I don't even know. I needed to tell this to someone. If you've read all this way I'd appreciate anything you could offer to say to me.  

Thank you all

232,"A little bit of background. My wife was born premature, and as such has very bad lungs. We were at a bonfire the other day, and some smoke from the fire got into her lungs giving her a really bad bronchial infection. Cigarette smoke also gives her these infections. For some reason, when she smokes weed it doesn't seem to affect her as much, but I know she is still causing damage to her sensitive lungs. I tell her I'm worried about her and she mostly just treats me like I'm lame or I just don't want her to have fun, which isn't true in the slightest. I've already suggested edibles but she won't. She only wants to smoke because she has these 2 friends that are major potheads and are high 24/7. I feel like they pressure her into being high with them any time they hang out, but she won't ever admit that. I just care and am worried about my wife. I'm certain that doing it every now and again is largely harmless, but when she hangs out with them several times a week it's not every now and again. They also do harder drugs which she has so far avoided but I'm scared one day she will try those too. What can I do? I'm really worried for her.",27Apr2018,1

Me- can I come to your house?


Guy- sure if u want to


Me- okay I have friends along so I can just say hi quick or something


Guy- ok?


Me- what's your address?


Guy- if u want we can wait til Saturday for alone time


Me- eh I would kind of like to meet u in a public setting when I first meet you..no offense


Guy- ok


Me- what's your address?

Didn't reply to me


Me- alright fine goodnight


Guy- okay be that way


Me- I keep trying to make an effort to see you and you keep being difficult. I'm scared to meet people by myself


Guy- well I want to see you but just one on one. Well that is something you need to get over


Me- if u weren't just after sex you wouldn't a problem meeting me when I have female friends along


Guy- that is all you think


Me- I don't know why you won't meet me just because I have friends along


Guy-  bad day at work and irritated because of it. Not that hard to figure out


Me- okay you could have just said that 

Guy- I did at 7pm..not that hard to figure out


Me- goodnight in going home


Guy- okay I guess


Me- *thumbs up* 👍 


Guy- be mad at me then good god


Me- I'm not mad


Guy- sure looks like it


Me- I'm upset but not mad


Guy- still same thing. I only meet people one on one. Sure looks like you're mad


Me- r u mad at me?


Guy- kinda


Me- plz don't be :(


Guy- why? You think all I want is sex, when I just want to meet you one on one


Me- ya so we could have Sex


Guy- I haven't had sex for 1.5 years. If I just wanted sex I would have told you that but I didn't


Me- okay sweetheart


Guy- yep


Me- smile


Guy- nope


Me- do u honestly like me or no?


Guy- ya why


Me- I like u too


Guy- good


Me- :)


Guy- just irritated from work and sore and want a kinky massage


Me- meet one on one where


Guy- I'm not doing that tonight


Me- yeah I know but if we ever do meet in person someday


Guy- I haven't figured that out yet since you don't want to come to my place


Me- how have you not figured that out??? U act like I have never made suggestions or anything. You just want to meet at your place to fuck


Guy- good god that's why I gave up on sex because that is all I ever hear


Me- u getting mad at me for not being comfortable meeting you for the first time alone is not okay. Haven't you ever seen the shit on the news about girls being kidnapped and put into human trafficking? If you cared about me as a person and not someone you are trying to fuck You wouldn't be upset. I'm not asking you to hang out with them or anything. It just makes me more comfortable to have someone else around that I have known for a while just in case something happens to me.


Guy- I'm not like those stupid people good god


Me- the thing is that guys that usually say they're good guys and they're not like other guys, are typically like guys that are exactly like. Haven't you heard of Ariel Castro? If not, look him up which I doubt you will do. He claimed he was a good guy but he kidnapped three girls and kept them locked up in his basement for like 10 years. 


Guy- I work for a living and have my own house and land. I wanted a serious relationship but I can't get one from ut (not sure what he meant by this. Not sure if he meant you or one or something else)


Me- I want a serious relationship too but everyone I have met on pof either just wanted to have Sex or friend zoned me.


Guy- welcome to my fucking world


Me- right yeah it sucks


Guy- no shit


Me- I'm sorry...I honestly didn't mean to be rude. It was just that I was already in ----- and wanted to see you. I just want a relationship so bad and I like you so much


Guy- I know you do


Me- aww you can tell?


Guy- ya

Guy- ya???


Me- okay


Guy- I just want to cuddle

234,"From late adolescence, I have been suffering from depression. Depression, along with my self anxiety and natural introversion has pretty much fucked up my significant years from around 16 to adulthood. I thought it would get better when college came, but turns out freshmen year was the worst year of my life. I had an image of what college was going to be like and all that prior to stepping into college.  

Unfortunately, my horrific experience at an orientation camp at college set the tone for my whole college experience really. I joined this residence in freshmen year where they gave verbal abuse to freshers, which was some bullshit about strengthening one's mental strength. Anyways, I was scarred by that experience and was so hurt from that \(especially considering I was suffering from depression, self anxiety, and introverted self before that\). What's worse is that some random dude from that residence just came up to me one day after I quit that orientation camp and normality resumed, and he said to be ""I find those who quit the orientation such pussies"". That felt like a fucking punch in the face and my self esteem reached an all time low as if it weren't already. At that moment, I really wanted to just fucking punch that prick for even having the ego to say that and not knowing what I was struggling with. But I let it go.  

Anyways, I spent pretty much the entire freshmen year trying to force myself to enjoy college even though I knew I was struggling. I would try and force a smile around people when I was so done. I met a few ""friends"" but I eventually ended ties with them in the spring term as I just got so depressed and they were constantly making fun of me \(well it was more sort of banter, but I just couldn't take their shit anymore\). What's worse my grades obviously suffered as well and I pretty much spent the whole of my second year trying to chase my GPA, which led to further downfall of the lack of building meaningful friendships and sense of isolation for most of my college life.",27Apr2018,1

She is forgetting many things and her general brain function and planning for the future is diminishing. She is maxing our all her credit cards on ridiculous purchases she will never use. She has only told me that she has Alzheimer’s and made me promise not to tell anyone before telling me that she had it. I feel like she needs help but she will never forgive me for breaking her trust and exposing her. She doesn’t want to lose her independence which I very much understand, but she needs help with finances and doctors appointments and maybe it will get her son and daughter to actually begin to visit her(she is a very negative hateful person so no one visits her, it’s sad but she only acts so hateful as a defense wall in my opinion).

237,"So me and my boyfriend have been together for about a year. I commute to my college nearby and I've been living with my parents. 

So ive always had an issue with being able to talk to my parents. I live with my dad and my step mom and they are incredibly controlling.My step mom specifically is controlling  and she is often really obsessive and yells a lot and is really critical and rude. Ive posted and a few other subs here and many have stated shes emotionally abusive to me. 

In order for me to go out i have to talk to my parents in advanced together and have all the details. Ive been do scared to even talk to my parents that i have missed a lot of things in highschool me and my first boyfriend never went on a day and now me and my current boyfriend rarely see each other cause i get so anxious. Sometimes my step mom is already in a mood and i don't want to trigger moor yelling/ criticisms. Hell even when they say yes its often  met with a lot of accusations ""why are you going to the park are you trying to have sex  ,i find it suspicious you're going to the movies"".Or dates end up being unsatisfactory because im yelled at when i get home.

So i me and my boyfriend go a while without seeing each other sometimes.He works at a overnight job and it doesn't really help. 
During the day hes asleep mostly and he's up when I'm not. Hes off on Tuesdays and Fridays and that's mainly the only time he's awake during the day. Sometimes he visits me during my long breaks at school but a lot of times he's tired and knocks out as soon as he gets off in the morning. We keep texting each other an inconvenient times. hell text be at 2am on his break and ill text him at 12pm.A lot of times lately well text each other like 3/4 times and its really frustrating.

I get jealous whenever we are together and he talks about what he and our mutual friends have done on his off days. My friends see my boyfriend more than i do. We are both really close friends to this same girl. He's known her all her life and ive known her since middle school.He has a lot more female friends than male so he often spends a loot one on one time with his female friends. Although i trust him not to cheat, i feel jealous of the relationships he has with his female friends. I feel like he's closer to them than he is to me.  

I honestly feel left out of my friends in general. Im constantly feeling lonely and left out of everything. Im constantly alone and i almost never spend time with my friends or my boyfriend. I feel like a drag on everybody when i talk about things going on a home. My boyfriend has gotten so numb about our relationship. We basically been holding out that our relationship will get better when I move out of my parents house. 

 Ive been telling my mom about my step mom's behavior and she's been encouraging me to move with her.But my mom lives in a different state She had has said for awhile that i could move in with my aunt whom lives down here. The main issue is i don't have a car. Ive been back and forth thinking about what to do. If i live with my mom i don't think my relationship would survive with the way its going now. 

I have been feeling so conflicted about what to do with our relationship. Idk how much things would improve with me moving out i feel lost

1. She slams all doors. No. shes not on her period or anything. I think its habit. Imagine waking up at 5am wth a sudden shock from hearing the bathroom and bedroom door being slammed shut. Like who tf close door by slamming it. Even the fridge door is loose now, the rubber that was attached to the fridge door was loose and the freezer sometimes not working. I had to fix it every single time, so the ice creams and chickens wont turn bad. 
2. She also slams the light switch! like gurl chill. just push the button slowly and effortlessly not BAM!. Damn, she must be a descendant of hulk or something. I dunno. 
3. She washed dishes like she was in some sort of competition to see whos making louder noises will win. 

tbh, at 1st I thought she was in a bad mood or something and I'm like ""Yeah, I do that sometimes"", but then she started to do it every day, then it clicks on me. ""Ah, in her hometown the door must be made out from heavy tons metals""

I already talk to her nicely like ""Can u close the door slowly, especially when its dawn"" and shes like ""yea sure"". But nothing change.

240,"I hope this post won’t be too long, but I need to provide some back ground info...  

I’m 23 year old. My limited work history: I started out in a retail chain store as a cashier, worked my way up to floor associate, and I had my sights set on department manager, but you had to be 21 for the position, and I was only 19. Seeing as I was stuck in a part time min wage job for the next 3 years or so to even be eligible for a raise, I decided to look around for a new job.   

On a complete whim, I decided to take a job selling Hot Tubs on a trade show route, and this job was amazing. I’ve spent the last 4 years traveling between 6 states, working a 100% commission job, and I thrived!  In the beginning of 2017, I decided I wanted to take a break from traveling, and made arrangements to quit, but my boss let me know I was welcome back any time.   

I got a job almost immediately at one of the big 4 cell phone companies with an authorized dealer. (This was a franchise store instead of a corporate store) The job was great, but I had some personal issues with the way corporate dictated the store was run, and absolutely no issues whatsoever with my new boss, who I’ll call “John”.  Worked for John for about 4 months, let him know my concerns, and told him I was going to go back to my old job selling Hot Tubs. We left on great terms. That was July of ‘17  

Fast forward to this month, April ‘18:  John calls me up out of the blue last Saturday, we hadn’t spoken at all since I had left. Along with the cell phone franchise, he had opened a second store in the neighboring building where he did cell phone repairs and sold used phones. Well, John tells me he is opening two stores about 100 miles away from where I worked for him originally. One is another franchise store along with another phone repair shop, and he asked me to come work as the manager on the cell phone repair side. I’m meeting with him tomorrow to find out more info on what The job will entail.   

So I have a couple concerns, maybe some kind strangers from Reddit can help me out with their thoughts or ideas.   

My first concern, is I have absolutely no history of management. Does this sound like a situation where I might be biting off more than I can chew with my limited work experience, or does this sound like a good atmosphere to build the skills to become a great  manager?   

My other concern is, I don’t necessarily have a passion for retail. I don’t know if I want to make a career out of it. I’ve had a couple people recommend I take the position, because even if it doesn’t work out long term, it will look great on a resume. I know I’m fairly young, but I really want to settle into a career soon, instead of wandering blindly job to job. Is retail management something I can make a solid career out of, or is it more likely going to be a dead end job with limited potential?   

I have no idea yet what salary I’m looking at, that is going to be discussed with him tomorrow, but in anticipation for this meeting, I was wondering how I can bring some of these concerns up with him while still portraying enough confidence for him to know I’m the right person for the job if I accept it?",27Apr2018,6
241,"Probably the most South Asian question ever asked, but I genuinely cannot decide between the two. I like both options a lot. 

Reasons I may like Engineering

- I like designing stuff 
- Highly analytical field
- Love Physics and the sort
- Father was an engineer so he got me pretty interested
- Engineering related courses in HS have been fun for me

Reasons I may like Medicine

- The human body intrigues me
- I tend to be good at helping people
- Perfectly fine with talking to new people 
- Somewhat have a career path set for myself
- Have volunteered at a hospital and enjoyed my time with the MD I was assigned.

Here is where I need advice! They want a CERTIFIED medical assistant. I'm not currently certified. I went to school got a job, when I went to get certified 6 years ago I was going through a divorce with a small child, something happened at the testing center... long story short I just didn't end up getting certified because... I had the job!

So this is where I am at... My job interview is Tuesday, I got online found an accredited place I can get certified, they SHOULD have my transcripts today. I paid to take the test on May 15th which I assume would be the time I would start the job IF they decided to hire me. It's just cutting it real close and I would still have to pass the test. 

If they want a certified MA they are probably requiring MA's to put in orders which you can only do if you're certified. 

What do I say in the interview? Do I let them know I'm not currently certified but I'm scheduled for the test? Do I avoid it?

245,"Hello all! I'm 18 and my sister has always been an asshole to everyone. It got so bad that I would occasionally have to leave the house because her tantrums were unstoppable. She would get in trouble for drinking and leaving the house unwarranted, just the usual highschooler stuff. The bad thing was that she didn't think she was in the wrong.

Fast forward to her 19th birthday, where she was being mean to me and I told my parents she needs to get kicked out because I have noticed that she is ruining all of our lives. So as soon as she gets a job at a hospital, we kick her out. Needless to say she was not happy and the apartment thing did not work out because she spends way too much money, and thinks she is too good for a financial advisor. 

She then lived with my grandparents, ans things were going fine except after 2 months she didn't want to abide by their rules, so they kicked her out. 

After a while I told my parents since she was basically homeless, she could live with us for a couple months to save money. So that happened in July 2017, and she has been with us since then.

Through these 8 years my parents have stopped spending time together, disagreeing on most things, and seeing a marriage counselor. My sister just lost her job because she lied about being sick right after a vacation. For the past month we have been trying to kick her out again, but she just will not leave. 

The problem now is that she refuses to get a part-time job because it's worse than her job at the hospital. I have been telling her to get one but she yells at anyone (even Grandma) who tell her to do it.

It has been years. My parents have drifted apart, I have depression and a little anxiety, and my sister is leeching off my family. What do I do?

246,"So basically I started off at a 4 year school, didn’t know what the fuck I wanted to do. I was playing baseball on a partial scholarship. Left that school, quit playing baseball, took a semester off, then went to a trade school because I decided to pursue engineering because ive always been interested in engineering and how things work since I was a kid. 

This program says I could get my bachelors degree paid for while learning a “blue collar” trade like electrician, welding, pipefitting, etc. while making *good* money and having my tuition completely paid for. Takes about 6 years. Sounds too good to be true right? Theres a catch that I kinda overlooked because the offer looked so nice.

For the first 4 years you only come out with an associates degree. Then if you want to continue to get your bachelors you have to complete for it by getting selected for an advanced “white collar” trade like cost estimation, design, etc. 

And then from *that* group of people they only select 10 people annually out of the entire program to get their bachelors and they all have to have honors standing with their GPAs. I should also remind you that this is a mechanical engineering degree so it’s not going to be easy and im kinda nervous about the classes to come. 

I have a lot of pressure on me from my family, (particularly my dad) to get this degree. Im not even half way through the program yet. Im basically a part time student, full time employee.

249,"tl;dr at the end.

For a little more than a year, I lived with a guy who... maybe should be on some kind of watch list.

As a child, he ticced a lot of the boxes for future\-psychopath warning signs:  Bed wetting, arson, sexually abused his sisters for years, and tortured animals.  He spent a lot of time torturing animals in a little shed on his parents' property after they pulled him out of school \(for jabbing a sharp pencil at another boy's head\).

*To my knowledge,* he has never acted out as an adult.  However, when I met him he told me that he had just recently ""changed.""\-\-he had fairly recently converted to Buddhism. He said before becoming a Buddhist, he had concrete plans to kidnap joggers, rape them, and ""butcher them.""  That's the word he used, *butcher.*  He didn't just want to dispose of their bodies, part of the fantasy was chopping them up in specific ways.  Relevant:  Cutting meat is a big part of what he does at work.

He acts like he just stopped being that way when he found his religion... like when he was twenty\-seven\(or so\) he had these fantasies; he had purchased supplies and picked out a specific park in this city where he would kidnap someone; but by twenty\-eight, he says he was a changed person.  I don't believe people change that much, that suddenly.

He's approaching his mid\-thirties right now, which means statistically, he's coming to the age when many fledgling serial killers act out for the first time... and his girlfriend just killed herself.  I'm told she had seemed despondent recently.  He says he ""blames himself"" because he had talked her into going off of her antidepressants.  Also:  Word has it his sister \(who lived with him until recently\) has also been showing some signs of major depression and expressing suicidal thoughts.

This happened around a month ago and I'm told he's ""just now getting over it.""  They were together for a year, she threw herself off a bridge, and he's already ""getting over it"" after a month.

I've been keeping my ears open for word about this guy ever since he and I parted ways. I often wonder about him.  I really think he's a level\-ten\-high\-risk potential serial killer.

Aside:  He currently lives in an apartment across the street from a park where a jogging trail runs through clusters of trees... not that I think he'd kidnap someone in his own neighborhood... it's just creepy.

251,"I have no self discipline. My apartment is a disaster, I'm not taking my meds consistently, I don't practice self care, and I'm honestly surprised that I even still have a job. I'm barely scraping by at this point.

A lot of people use a ""rewards"" system. Like, ""If I do a good job with X, then I'm going to reward myself with ice cream."" But the thing is... I'll just reward myself with ice cream anyways whether I do X or not. 

Me being inconsistent with my meds is even worse. Without my meds, I experience bad psychosis and I run the risk of getting thrown in the hospital. Still, I occasionally won't take the meds even though the risk isn't worth it. I'm just lazy and have no self discipline. ""Don't feel like it,"" is my shitty reasoning.

What are other forms of self discipline I can use?",27Apr2018,3
253," \(Update at bottom\)

I’ll start this off saying we are both 15 and we were at school for an after school club and we left at 4:30 with intent on going to the store and coming back when a banquet thing starts,

So anyway we walk to my house and then I at money for the store and we start walking to it. We had to cross the road to get to the sidewalk that leads to the store so we wait for a gap and we think we see one so he starts walking but I look both directions again and I see a car so I yell his name and he didn’t even look at me and just kept walking. After this he flys up in the air after hitting the hood of the car and I run over to him,

I was really afraid he would be dead but he was okay and we thought he broke his leg but it turned out to only be a dislocated kneecap \(thank fuck\) but anyway so I’m fucking shaking and I don’t know what to do so some people start running towards him to help and he whole time I was just so scared.

After he’s put in an ambulance I get asked what happened by a cop and my grandma goes to call his mom because he got hit right in front of my house. I went to see him at the hospital and he’s okay and no broken bones but I just feel so at fault. The reason is that I was the one who brought up going to the store, Also I should have tried to pull him or something but I didn’t all I did was yell, and now I just can’t stop thinking it’s my fault and I keep seeing the accident in my head and it keeps repeating. I’m just so worried and I cant stop picturing it I really need help tho I’m going to the school councilor tomorrow but I need some advice

\(Update\)

He texted me this morning and he said he wasn't coming to school today which is understandable and he also said he has a fractured sacrum \(not real sure what that is tho\). Also i ended up getting pulled from all my classes today and am in the guidance office rn writing this update and I would still appreciate any advice because i still keep replaying it in my head and cant seem to get over it.

263,"Tl;dr - Mom is threatening to throw me out. No job, almost no where to go. Any encouragement would be nice.

Ultra long version;

So I moved to a third world country from the US when I was 11 and my parents divorced when I was 14. I lost contact with my dad after that.

Anyways  after that my mom and I kinda fell into depression. I eventually got my shit together and was able to finally have stable human relationships agains when I was able to study my dream major at college and throw myself into my work but my mom....not so much.

At the beginning when my parents had recently divorced it was just the small occasional outburst that I didn't fault her for. And then it slowly got worse and worse, but not by much. I tried encouraging her to go out and make friends, talk to a psychologist, visit her family more but it didn't  really help much. Now she's  addicted to television (much like Joy's mother in the movie Joy, if you need a mental image) but I digress. During her outbursts she'd scream and very very occasionally hit me, but would normally stop when I'd  get a panic attack or show extreme signs of distress and apologize profusely and promise to change.

And then I go to college and she gets way worse. She starts acting  extremely manipulative and overreacts to every single thing I do and deliberately  tries to hurt me (for instance, she knows my public image is extremely important to me so she would go out of her way to embaress me and tell all my family about how shitty I am.) when she's  the tiniest bit angry (like me leaving the milk out, for instance) and starts screaming and swearing. It's  not THAT bad at first, until it starts escalating to the point that she's  threatening death/suicide (""I will kill myself and die and then you'll be happy!!""/""My heart will give out and I'll  die and it'll  be all YOUR fault!!! You'll  have to live with the guilt forever!!! You'll be crying over my grave!!!"" Even when I've  told her multiple times to refrain from saying these things  since she's  the only person I have.) And once she literally dangled herself from our window four stories up to clean  the windows apparently (only me screaming and calling for immediate help when she refused to get down stopped her.) And ignored an emergency-level medical condition because it would be totally okay if she died (again, me panicking for help got her to the ER.). 

(Yes, I'm sure I don't do anything worse and it's really over these kind of small things. No, I do not swear or talk back beyond ""Seriously, stop it. Do you understand what you're  saying right now?!?!"")

And then one day my mother tells me she'd be unable to pay for me when I move abroad (we're middle class, but moving back would be INSANELY expensive) and I should get back in contact with my dad so he would pay. I do, and he's  surprisingly friendly (if not a bit rude, casually calling me bitch and asshole when he's  slightly mad, but nothing as bad as my mom. I don't  care.). But my mom gets even worse, and I'm  not quite sure why. ""You suck, moron!!"" turns into ""This is why your father abandoned you in the first place, you piece of shit!!!"" In response to forgetting to take out the trash and ""I'm  gonna die because of YOU!"" turns into ""Kill yourself!! You're  a hazard to everyone you know!!"" (Not gonna lie, that one still hurts.). She'd punch me in the taxi because I forgot my wallet. I'd  get slapped on the arm and pushed hard into things because I'd  disobey something small. One day I come home late because I had stayed at college studying and I couldn't  get a ride home and the next morning things get so bad I escape and get ready for college at her house.  When I come home late it's  all ""Fucking move out and go to your dad's  place. You being here is a pain and you hate me anyways."" from then (I never said anything but that I love her and it's only her harsh words that hurt me). Normally she'd stop by the next day, but it's  been a couple days now and keeps saying that. She keeps telling me to pack my things and go and throws my shit around. I'm  not quite sure what to do anymore.

She's on pills.  Won't  see a psychologist to see if she needs an update. 

No one will take her to the psych ward for a checkup because ""family reputation"".

I do not want to crash at a family member's place. She will find me. My family is on her side. I will have to go back and everything will start up again. I don't  want that. Also they have their own lives and most likely would be unwilling to shelter me. Again, family rep might be in danger here.

Moving to my father's place means having to deal with the women he brings home, and most likely I will lose ALL contact with my mother's  side and this is a BIG no. This is the worst case scenario.

A job isn't  possible. It's  a long-ish story and I've  talked enough

All my friends cannot house me for a long period of time, or they have their own issues. They have their own lives and I would be unable to repay them. I don't  want to confide in anyone for personal reasons. 

All I think I can do right now is hope and pray and wait another two years so I can move back abroad.  Any advice on how to deal with this would be nice.

Sorry for the long post. I'm  just really upset and tired right now. Don't  know what to do. I swear to god, is this normal?? I'm I right for being upset???",27Apr2018,1

265,"Hi reddit! I’m currently interning at my dream company and have had the perfect intern experience. I had the opportunity to apply to a few full-time jobs and got an offer! However, it is for a position I not all that thrilled about. I applied for this position for interview experience and as a “back up” to be quite honest. 

I feel like the job may make me unhappy, but it’s only an 18 month commitment. The benefits are amazing and so is the company. The pay and schedule is not so amazing. I would have two days off but not necessarily weekends. I’m engaged and I would be getting married sometime during the 18 months I would be committed to this job. I’m worried about starting a marriage on a completely different schedule as my future  husband and never seeing him...

268,"Okay so this might be a little long winded, but I'll try my best. I \(20/F\) relocated and moved in with a roommate \(32/F\) for my first time about a month ago. I told her that I would be planning to stay until August when the lease was up, or the very worst once my boyfriend came down if she didn't want him to live with us, I'd give her notice and he and I would find our own place. I didn't find out she didn't have a job and that she just lived on just disability until I moved in, which is fine you do you, it just says that she lives paycheck to paycheck and if something happened, I would need to be the one to cover more than I should. Our rent is $1,100 but for an unexplained reason shes charging me $600 a month \(which I didnt mind, it was only till August\). We never really sat down to hash out bills, or for me to be signed onto the apartment. The first night I moved in, she immediately asked for $100 of rent right off the bat because she ran out of her oxy prescription for the month, and had a friend that sells them. I gave it to her, in my head I figured just $100 less to pay later. About two weeks later she just disappeared. Like gone. No notice, text, note, anything. She was gone for about a week and a half, her friend came over to feed her cat once and wouldn't tell me where my roommate was. Which is fine, she's an adult, but she has control over all the bills and our electric bill was coming up soon. A small text or something would've been fine. Sometime within that week n a half, her old roommate just walks into the house overnight while I'm sleeping, and leaves a really threatening note about taking her off the lease, which scared the shit outta me because my roommate has talked a lot of shit about this ex roomie and her mental health. That was kinda the last straw for me, I sent a text with the picture of the note to my roommate, and she didn't respond for another two days. She sent me a long text saying she'd been in the hospital for her bad back. She then kinda weirdly rambled on about how she would let my boyfriend move in, but only if we payed $950 a month \(fucking ridiculous, we could get our own place way cheaper\). I told her I'd think about it. Earlier this week, she came home and I told her I was going to be finding a new apartment. I said I didn't want to completely fuck her, so I would pay for May's rent. I got accepted yesterday to move in on the 15th. Now I don't really wanna pay a full months rent just to stay for half the month. I talked to her about this last night, and she started crying. Like, sobbing. Saying that if I dont give her the full $600, she would need to borrow money from her friend, or starve, that I was going back on all the promises I made her etc. I didn't want to bring up all those issues, I kinda just kept it at not wanting to pay for a full month. She said she technically can't make me do anything because I'm not legally bound, and she ""doesn't know her rights"" in this situation. I told her to relax, and I'd talk to my boyfriend about our finances. Anyway, again sorry this was long winded. I'm just asking if I should be the good guy and just give her the full months rent, or skimp and give her half? My boyfriend and I would be giving the rent and paying for the new apartment by the skin of our teeth, and I don't really want to be in that situation. Anyway, thanks reddit!",27Apr2018,3
269,"I don't seem to get anywhere dating,I've lost all hope. It seems like every girl likes stringing guys along for fun, or attention. The girls I do like, I don't have a chance with, don't give me that if you don't try bs either. It all really boils down to looks, and let's face I'm not good looking at all. It's so frustrating seeing my attractive friends get away with shit that I can't. One text book example was saying something and getting a wierd look from a girl, my best friend at the time was very good looking guy and said a very similar thing but made it creepy. In this case he was cute, so he got the pass. Im ugly so I get a bad look my way. This is just one example, I've noticed this plenty of times. Just in general I've noticed how much easier it is for him and others like him. Also my body is going crazy atm, it wants to have sex very bad. Not long ago I had a bad day and the hormones kicked in and did they kick in hard. I ended up hanging with some girl I knew I didn't like and don't find attractive. It went ok but through out the time we spent together I was conflicted. I could tell she wanted me to make physical contact but I just didn't like her but my fucking hormones we're going crazy with being a 20 year old virgin. The whole time I had this gut wrenching feeling, very conflicted my body wanted sex but I just didn't like her. I felt bad because I knew she wanted a boyfriend, I just don't want that with her. I just wanted fuck. I ended up not doing anything thank God, she had a history of try to kill herself in the past. It could have ended badly. Then theres the girl I fell for in middle School, at that time (middle school) me and her were very close friends, the typical guy falling for girl shit happens. I decided to distance myself by the end of 7th grade because I simply didnt have a chance and it hurt hearing her talk about her boyfriend to me all the time. She got mad, and called me a buncha shit. Fast forward first day of highschool, Surprise! You guys go to the highschool! Luckily through out Highschool I kinda didn't think about her too much because we just had been separated for to long and had different social circles by this time. Well everything was fine until senior year, we got assigned sits next to each other. This basically got us talking again, I started catching feelings but nothing happened other than that. Fast forward couple months after Highschool I get shit faced and decide to hit her up. And... I fuck it up with her by leaving my phone out while drunk one night, and one of my idiot cousins thinking it was funny sent some cringe shit. Basically I had told them how great I thought she was and how excited I was in general and they thought it was funny seeing me crazy for this chick and would give me shit like etc ""Ooo he's in love"" just shit like that in general. Well doesn't matter point is I fuck up, over the course of the next two years I get couple of chances to get with her again. Again I fuck it up. Now here I am thinking what if? It's been two years since Highschool and I can't get over her. Its so frustrating I keep thinking how much better my life would be with her, having imagery scenarios with her which the worse cause it may make me feel better temporaryly but it's very unhealthy to keep doing that. I just want to get over her. On top of this I'm not sure what I want to do with my life career wise. Did I mention I my dog died in October?

273,"Hi all, I'm bisexual but definitely prefer men and make no secret of that.

A few of my best friends are straight guys and this week we all got together to hang out for a few days - I'll make this clear now, I have NEVER made any sort of advance towards one of my friends.

Over the few days we spent together I picked up on some homophobic vibes from two of the guys, but mainly one - the one I feel closest to. We've always had a really great friendship and I've always felt 100% comfortable around him and in the past he's seemed the same with me.

He'll happily listen to me talking about my sex and do the same, we've always been really open. I noticed both of the guys dropping a few 'faggots' and a couple of '_____ is gay' moments - while this isn't a big change and we've used language like that around each other for years - this felt more pointed, less playful and it got my back up but I let it slide.

My friend who I'm most concerned over seemed uncomfortable being physically close to me and I don't think we shared even a sofa the entire week. I made a joke about him being a bottom (that my other straight friend kind of started) and while he'd normally play into the joke he abruptly cut it off.

We got really drunk one night and I went wondering upstairs to throw up but ended up crashing in his bed - which imo isn't weird at all; I've shared beds with the other two guys no problem. He asked me to move but I wasn't really responding so he slept in his freezing spare room under a sheet with no pillows. 

This is going to sound silly, because I didn't want to share a bed with him- I generally don't enjoy sharing a bed with anyone - but I can't get away from the thought that he was too uncomfortable to stay in his own bed with me in it.

A few months back I told him someone at work had been introducing me to people as 'gay' and how it had left me feeling uncomfortable - not because I'm insulted by it - because it's incorrect. He told me I should call them out and was quite supportive. I can't tell this is all in my head or what, but I can't get past it. Am I just being too sensitive?

I'm worried that's something has happened to change how he/they view me and our relationship. They're not particularly PC friendly guys and I don't want to seem like I'm whining - but I don't know how to, or if I should, raise this issue with them.

I'm so worried I'll lose them if I call them out but it's taken years for me to feel super comfortable around straight men and I can't sit on this. What should I do?",27Apr2018,2

279,"I won't be able to give you guys the full picture without writing a whole book about everything that happened. So I will just talk about one example that makes me extremely uncomfortable. 

We have a huge Akita, which is a dog breed known for acting aggressively without any signs, that attacked me.I'm not talking about a mare pitbull or a German shepherd. I would be able to defend myself against a German shepherd. Our dog is big even for an akita. Last year I had to go to the hospital after my mum's boyfriend's dog tried to kill me. I could have died. What happened was that I was standing on the stairs with the dog behind me. He started growling as he attempted to jump on top of me. This wasn't the first situation like this that happened with this dog. I instantly jumped off the stair and ran out of the house, to the front garden. Since the dog is much quicker than me he managed to catch up quickly. As I landed on my back I stuck out my arm in order to prevent the dog from getting to my neck or any of my internal organs. He bit deep into my arm and started to shake his head in every direction (dogs like him do this to increase the damage.) It hasn't even been 30 seconds before my mum's boyfriend dragged the dog off me. I went to the hospital but before that, he deleted the recordings from the cameras at the front of the house. I had no choice but to lie in the hospital; who would even believe me? I waited in the hospital for a really long time while in pain and boredom. Neither my mum or her boyfriend said a world to me. They just sat on their phones, checking social media and wasting their time as I sat there with a bleeding arm. I then had to wait until the next day to get stitches but I did get some medicine to help me deal with the pain.

Before that accident, I have been telling him that the dog has been acting odd and becoming more aggressive towards me. He told me to record a video as if I was being delusional. I told him that I couldn't even leave my room but he ignored me. It's not even like the dog has never done anything like attacking someone before. We had many situations where he tried to attack our other dog (we gave her away for her safety) and even a situation where he attacked a child out of nowhere. No, she wasn't annoying the dog, she didn't come anywhere near to his food, she wasn't a stranger, she was just standing next to her mum. So considering this and the fact that the dog has attacked me before (never to the point where I had to get stitches) it was just ignorant of him to ignore my concerns about the dog. He placed my life in danger. I now have more than 10 scars on my arm, many small ones and one big one. 

Nowadays we do keep the dog outside the house but not much has changed. I often wake up to see my mums bf with the dog in the kitchen or see him and the dog spending a whole day in the front garden. That prevents me from using the kitchen or going outside. Right now the window is opened in the toilet, I can't use it because if I try to close it I will be mare centimetres away from the dog. I asked them to close it but they refuse. The dog is still very aggressive towards me. When they feed the dog they live the kitchen door that leads outside open. As soon as the dog saw me, he tried to jump into the house. Thankfully the chain prevented that. To this day, my mum's bf defends the dog against ME. I never landed that dog in the hospital yet somehow I am the problem. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can deal with this situation? At least this part of it because there is way more than this that I could talk about. I don't feel comfortable in the house where I live. I do plan to move out as soon as I'm 18 but is there any way I can get back on my mum and her boyfriend?  I want that dog dead.

282,"A guy I know from work who I consider an acquaintance called me back in September (I live in central FL btw). He had an issue with the hostel he was staying at  so I offered him my couch so he could take a few months to get situated and get back on his feet. The idea was for him to get out of hotels and hostels and find a more permanent living arrangement.

We work as freelance AV technicians for events and tradeshows so the work is sporadic and sometimes it can take 30 days to get paid. He has no bills, uses WiFi to make phone calls and uses public transportation and taxis to get around, so a by January he should've had more than enough money to get into a roommate situation or a cheap 1 bedroom apartment.

Well apparently part of why he's in the situation he's in is because he's shitty at managing his money. He doesn't have a bank account, just uses an Amscot card, which I guess makes Uber not an option for him. I'm assuming he has no credit too. He's had to pawn his stuff on multiple occasions too and at this point has nothing left to pawn.

To give u a background on my living situation, I stay in a cabin at a campground that my friend manages. My old apartment caught on fire do to my downstairs neighbor flicking a cigarette butt that was still lit on the front porch last year. So a good friend offered this place at a decent rate since it's a unit that they reserve for managers in training which he doesn't have or expect to have for a while.  I have no lease, I just pay monthly, which is awesome. I also have an 8 yr old daughter who I get when I'm not working. It's a 2/2 so she has her own room and bathroom.

Sorry this is so wordy, anyways, since I don't have a lease, I can't follow standard eviction procedures, I would need to get my friend involved which I don't want to do. Over the past few months this guy has been having degrading vision. He says it's blurry, he can barely read his phone, can't see a computer screen. He has a cataract in one eye and a detached retina in the other, which he just had surgery on 3 weeks ago. You have to look down and put pressure on the eyelid near the retina to let the lens set, or something along those lines, eyes are not my specialty.

He can't work right now, he can't donate plasma, his funds are drying up and he's running out of things to pawn and I'm stuck with him. He went to social security today and they said he needs an appointment and is saying he's struggling to get someone on the phone.

What can I do at this point? he doesn't have family around that can help him, he's 60 years old and I guess he has burned a lot of bridges. He doesn't have a key, doesn't receive mail here, but I'm worried if I lock him out and throw his stuff on the lawn he'll either get law enforcement involved or make a scene and get law enforcement or the management company involved and could get me kicked out of here, and I don't want to put that on my friend.

He drinks a lot but not when my daughter's here, I'm certain he has other vices but there's no evidence of it. It just didn't make sense for him to be completely broke this past January when he had been living rent free since mid September.

Any advice would be appreciated. I messed up by not giving him a deadline, and not addressing this sooner. I told him yesterday I need my living room back and asked him how much longer he needs to which he said he doesn't know. I said it sounded like it's gonna be another couple months and I explained that it's been too long since January. He said he's trying. Part of me would like to get him blackout drunk and load all of his stuff up in my truck and drive him a few towns over but I know that'll bite me in the ass. What can be done without messing up my own living arrangement?",27Apr2018,2

285,"I am 25, female. I’ve had emotional problems my whole life I feel like due to an abusive/neglectful upbringing of craziness. 

I’ve lived on my own for a year now and thought I’d be doing better when I moved out. I’m feeling bad lately though. 

I don’t know where to start. One thing is I feel frustrated because I try really hard  at work and do a great job, and my boss says I should get a promotion but has told me that the director is unsure, and basically I think he doesn’t like me because he’s said I don’t smile enough and he may think I’m not sociable enough even though I do better work than anyone else. I really want a promotion for more money, I really have hardly any good clothes, I want to buy nice things for my apartment, but I’m broke.

I get so much anxiety picking out clothes and home stuff. I’m still defining myself and am changing who I used to be. I’ve always wanted to be the creative, happy, adventurous free spirit but I feel like I really am the practical, down to earth, logical and rule following type. I want to change my style. I guess I am really similar to sister who is 10 years older, she is an excellent role model, and I feel myself turning into her, because when I make decisions whatever I logically conclude is exactly what my sister would choose or do, and I get anxiety feeling unsure of who I really am, I just feel like I’m copying my sisters footsteps. 

I also get anxiety about cleanliness. My house needs to be perfectly cleaned and spotless before anyone comes over. I do it compulsively and rush around the house cleaning things. Idk, I wish I could be more relaxed about it.

I am just unhappy and not confident. I currently work full time in an office, go to school part time for business, and date a guy whom honestly I don’t think he’s a good fit for my future, as he is a stoner lazy type, he is sweet but also a man child, I feel like I am teaching him how to be an adult.

291,"I have a thumb sucking habit as an adult and I have PTSD over going to new places or meeting other people.  Two years ago, one guy was sitting next to me on the train and he kept murmuring the word ""Ebola"" and it seemed he was in panic. I had to go home and washed my hands many times because I was afraid that perhaps his saliva spattered on my clothes while he was talking. I had to throw out the clothes I was wearing on that day because I didn't want to  suck my thumb after I touch it again. I didn't want to wash the clothes and wear again because I was uncertain the virus would go away after cleaning. This happens one in million but I'm afraid from the thought that I won't never be able to stop my habit completely and probably I will experience similar situation in the future because I'm young and still have 60 years to live\(maybe\).   

A lots of psychologists says that Habit is hard to stop if you've been doing it for a lots of years and it gets ingrained. I've been sucking my thumb in my sleep since I was a baby and now I'm 22. I have tried so hard to stop it but never succeeded. What makes no sense is that I've never had a desire to suck my thumb during the days and I never did it.

My habit affects my social life. My friends don't know about my habit and would throw about AIDS Joke. For instance, I was eating dinner with my friend and he told me that he became vegetarian because he had AIDS.

Here is another one, I was eating soup with another friend and he told me He also had AIDS as a joke.  

I freaked out after hearing these and I didn't want to meet them again because I was afraid of the disease.

I know this sounds crazy and I know you can't get such disease easily unless you touch or drink their blood.

Possibilities of the situation where my friends come to my house and bleed on my desk or table is very low However I get confused if the red stain on the table is his blood or ketchup after we have a dinner together. 

Also, one of my friend confessed he was a pimp once and he got hurt when he was hanging out with me at my house and he bleed on my coach. I'm afraid he has HIV and I didn't wanna sit on the coach again.

293,"I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. Fair warning, I’m not great at summarising so please bear with me.  Hi, I’m a woman in her early 20’s. This post will be about me asking for advice on what to do in regards to my father’s actions towards me. As a preface, I must say I’m quite the conservative type of girl. I don’t dress sexy at all. I’m always covered up but it’s not like I look like a nun either. Also, nothing horrible has happened. I love my father very much, always have and always will. He’s been a great father and provider for the family. 

But recently he’s becoming older (now in his early 60’s). What I’m about to tell you has never happened before until the past several months. Basically, he invades my physical personal bubble. Let me explain. There are times where he’s driving, I’m in the passenger seat, and he’d be telling a story or talking to some other family member in the car. He would motion my way and his arm/hand is always too close to my breasts. I always feel like “woah!” one second too late because obviously these are quick gesturing motions. The first few times something like this happened, I just brushed it off because I thought that maybe he was getting old and can’t gauge properly how far is hands/arms are extended. But it’s been happening more frequently. 

Another example is this one time, we were at the airport as a family. I was sat between him and mother while waiting to board the plane. The two parents were speaking to each other with me in between. Mother simply leaned her body slightly but father put his hand on my seat (next to my thigh) in a way where his finger was touching my thigh (not skin to skin, i had on jeans) in the attempt to lean towards mother to talk to her more clearly I presume. I felt very awkward and just left to go buy snacks. 

I came to the conclusion that he can’t gauge his movements properly anymore because it hasn’t only happened to me. Other family members, male and female, have been on the receiving end of his oddly inappropriate distanced gestures. Sometimes my brother would be sitting on the sofa watching tv casually then our father would come sit right next to him, thigh touching thigh. My brother then feels awkward and moves away a few inches. There’s also been times where he points at something and almost pokes my brother in the eye. 

I don’t know what to do. I think father’s quite oblivious to this issue but for me personally, it’s gotten to the point where I jump every time he enters the room. I just don’t want to be in a situation where I feel awkward like those mentioned above. 

Is it possible he might be developing some sort of dementia? I’d greatly appreciate any advice any of you have whether you have a friend who has experienced something like this or you yourself know of anyone like this. (prefer to receive messages over comments, thank you :))",27Apr2018,2

I have complained about a few neighbors due to that either: their dog is not supervised and is out on a leash (which is not allowed according to the rules), neighbors are blasting music and it's disruptive - and I have called the cops before, but now they're saying to just call the cops - they don't give a fuck anymore apparently, but the worst neighbor who did that before has moved out, so there's been no overnight music blasting, which is a relief! 

I have stopped complaining about the dogs unsupervised and I've learned to ignore them when they start barking (and one runs at me - long leash...)

These new neigbors however, they played music one night (maybe I overreacted, but it only went on for an hour, but since I'm right next door, it seemed too loud so I did call the police but it was over later).

They only speak spanish so I can't really tell them to stop littering. I told the office twice about them littering and they said ""Have you spoken to them?"" NO BECAUSE I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH. 

I am really worried that I could be evivcted for this, but I don't think it's legal for them to do that. Overall, I have complained about the neighbors (overall) under 10 times (less than I expected), I've learned now to ignore the dogs and the dogs out and about (letting the front office call animal control). I did report a few expired vehicles, but they're still there (but someone else said they are doing something about it so I've learned to ignore it).

My mom said if Icall the police on the neighbors as often as I did (mostly for the neighbor who left) that I could be labeled as a nuisance caller, but I called the NON EMERGENCY number and the situation was always resolved. 

I'm really worried and upset that I could be evicted, so I'm trying to not complain as much (like I said I ignore the dogs now and the expired cars - which I've noticed a decrease now). But the new neighbors are slightly annoying with the litter and I may be a bit paranoid about the music due to the past neighbors when they partied until 3 AM and I had to be awake at 4 AM (not a nice night and they turned up their music even after the police came). 

Can I really be labeled a nuisance caller for calling abuot noise complaints over non emergency?

Can I really be evicted for complaning?!

No nasty comments please, I'm TRYING my best to ignore people.

Edit: I could complain about the neighbor idling his car and revving his engine, but they don't do it often.

Edit: The only good thing the office knows about me is that I've sort of adopted one of the feral cats they know pretty well and I would occasionally come by with new pictures of the cat and they are all shocked about how tame she is now...

I am currently in a three person relationship with a married couple, both 28 years old. This relationship started as an accident three years ago when we met on a hookup app to have just one threesome before I moved to a completely different state. The threesome slowly turned into more, with me still living about 8 hours away. Fast forward a year, and my boyfriend has convinced me to move back home to live with them.

I have also tried to leave 4-5 times. My problem comes in with my boyfriend becoming controlling and manipulative whenever I try to tell them I am leaving. My (kind of) girlfriend will then become very emotional and scream that I am a terrible person and ask how I could do that to her. On other occasions, I have tried to just pack up and leave without telling them to get away. However, my issue comes in with my family. they do not approve of this lifestyle, so there is no option to tell them about what is going on. Every time I have left, I tried to go down to my parents and block them on everything and turn my location off. However, my boyfriend knows where my parents live, and will physically drive down to their house. And if I don't drive to meet him to make up, he will not hesitate to show up at their house and have them find out. (I would be disowned if they ever find out). Also, I'm not sure how they do it, but every time I try to break up with them in person, they somehow talk me out of it after a 3 hour long discussion/crying session.

Money is not my number one concern, and I enjoy working where I currently work, but I do not want to sell myself short.

So my question is this: Does having my Associates at this age really add much value in the eyes of an employer? Should I be looking for a different job that would pay more? Should I ask for a raise?",27Apr2018,0
317,"Brief background: I'm in my late 20s and work as an associate at an excellent financial institution making around $50k gross annually.  My wife is 33 and works as a part-time barista at a coffee shop.  We met 1 years ago and got married 6 months ago.  We are working hard to build our net worth over time.  We both have university degrees.

The story:
My wife has no family.  Her mother passed away when she was 6 in a very bad way I will not describe here and her father passed away 5 years ago in a car accident. Her family distance themselves from her because it brings them painful memories. She has two or three friends scattered around the globe that she practically cannot meet more than every few years. And then she has me ... we live together happily and working hard every day. She recently met her family and had a bad experience as they criticized her looks and destroyed her self-esteem. She said she will never meet them again. She also met my family who welcomed her with warm open arms. We had a great time and she loves us. She is desperate to do everything she can to be with me forever. She is extremely insecure when she is with me but does not show this side outside of home. I gently told her that I will not be going anywhere and that from now on she needs to try less hard to do so much for me and that she needs to take the time to rest her body and soul. I told her that she needs to learn to love herself and take care of her body and soul in a healthy way. I told her that I will help her do this and develop into a confident, strong individual.  She seemed thankful. But I'm not sure if this is enough. I know it will take time for her to become a more confident and happier person. She worries she is not enough to be part of my family. I tried to be in her shoes and it suffocates me to imagine living in a world with no family to love and care and with few friends around the globe. I don't know what else I can do for her now and going forward ... I am just thankful and impressed she didn't become addicted to any substance or stray to darker and rebellious sides of the world ...",27Apr2018,0

I’ll keep it short:
I’ve been slowly pushing away all my friends, I don’t talk to a single one of them anymore. I realized they were of no use to me , were actually pretty bad influences (always drinking and smoking) and non of them stimulated me intellectually however now I feel so lonely.

328,"I work in London.

There’s a supervisor who doesn’t like me - I’ve known from the start. When I was in this persons team I never received support and if I ever needed anything and the only way to try was asking my next in lines assistance, he’d say he’d do something but never did.  Since moving but in the same department he doesn’t look at me, he’ll do a round for everyone and will ignore me, I’m a good worker. I get good scores in my assessments and haven’t ever had a problem/got in trouble with anything

He’s spreading rumours about me and over the weekend somebody suggested that he was dating a colleague of mine. I laughed at the idea because I thought it was funny and next thing you know I’m being reprimanded for something someone else said just because I laughed. 

I want to speak to my HR about it but don’t feel comfortable telling them because I feel like he’d know it was me even though it’d be anonymous. 

I wanted to excel and go for so many opportunities but this person would always pull my application. I never understood why when I contact the recruitment team, they would say it was withdrawn.

What do I do? I don’t want to leave because I see myself gaining experience and qualifications then moving on but it could take up to 2 years.

Most recently I was awarded with some vouchers and never received them. When I went to my HR it said that said person had claimed them. When asking the person - they said they’ll find out from them to see if they can get some for me as if they never claimed them and already had them.

So about ten years ago my cousin got in a fight with my brothers wife. I took my sister in laws side and argued with my cousin, admittedly I said some abrasive stuff but honestly I didn’t see it as a huge thing, I’ve probably had harsher words with friends over fantasy football and been fine a day later. 

So my cousin seems to decide she’s never going to talk to me again, it’s now been probably ten or eleven years. I’ve tried a couple times to make amends even though to me it seemed a little ridiculous that it should be necessary but I did nonetheless to no avail. 

Honestly I’m at peace with it, i’m now 41 and if she doesn’t want to be in my life it’s really no skin off my back at this point. 

So my mother who has a history of being about as manipulative as a human being can be just for some context here has stayed pretty good with the cousin, and she asked last night if she can take my daughters (12,10) on a vacation to my cousins house. She lives in Cali close to the beach and all the touristy stuff.

I told her you know what I’m fine with it as long as my cousin shoots me an email, I need to hear from her, just to chat, clear the air, establish a line of communication whatever, because I just don’t feel comfortable letting my kids go on a vacation with someone who has refused to speak to their father for a decade, it doesn’t sit right with me. But if she’s willing to do that, I’d have no problem with letting them go.

So then my mother throws a complete grown woman temper fit, starts saying she (my cousin) isn’t going to do that and starts carrying on crying and being absolutely ridiculous talking about how I’m ruining a perfectly good trip for my kids.

I was very transparent about this history to my boyfriend and he trusts me. I love my boyfriend and would never do anything to sacrifice my relationship. I am not attracted to my friend in a romantic way anymore, and I’ve been very clear about that. 

Anyway, I got piss drunk at the party. I’ve gotten piss drunk before and I handle myself fine. I just usually excuse myself to go to the bathroom and hide away for a while. So that’s what I did. My boyfriend planned to pick me up in a couple of hours. 

My friend found me in the bathroom after a couple of minutes and we started talking. This is where it gets really blurry for me. The next thing I remember...we’re on the bed and he’s touching me. I remember saying I’m too drunk and I have a boyfriend (he knows that), but he kept going and I didn’t have the energy to resist. I fell asleep and woke up again to him getting a condom and on top of me. That’s all I remember. I woke up when my boyfriend called me later to ask where I was, went home and showered. 

This all just hit me now. I feel so sick to my stomach, and guilty and very dirty. I feel like I brought this on myself by going to the party of someone I used to hookup with. He probably thought I was interested in him?? I don’t know. I can’t believe my friend would do this — he’s a nice person and is very socially liberal too.

I remained close to her, she was depressed and needed someone in her life that would support her. Plus I didn't want to make things awkward in class. 

Even after we stopped seeing each other, it didn't stop us from acting like a couple on a daily basis. We we're constantly flirting, texting, and hanging out. We fell back into seeing each other a few times but it was fleeting.

342,"Hello Reddit! This is my first time posting on r/Advice.

So I’m a college student about to graduate in two weeks. Recently I started talking to this girl that I work with. Me and her have been friends since October, right before she started dating a friend of mine. They broke up about 6-7 weeks ago, but I had no intention of doing anything when they broke up. We got closer during that period and we started to hang out. When we first started hanging out, I thought that it was friendly. The more we hung out, the more clear that it wasn’t the case. No sex or anything, just very handsy and flirty. Our texting and snap chatting drastically increased and we are always around in each other at work. This week we have spent a good amount of time together and things seem to be going well. I haven’t asked her out on an official date because 1) I still didn’t believe this was going anywhere, I’m terrible with dating and 2) I did not have a conversation with my friend about me seeing his ex, out of respect, I wanted to give it some more time. Last night we went to dinner before we saw Avengers with friends. Instead of me paying I insisted that we split the check. Things seem to continue going well last night but this morning after I told friends about it, they believe that I severely screwed up and possibly ruined chances with her. Since then I’ve been in a bad mindset where I screwed up and my chance is over, even though we are still talking today. I am not a very confident person but I had some confidence talking and hanging with her. Now all of that is shot.

I am a 31 year old single guy living in London. I have a good career and live with a 31 year old who is also single. I am fairly little bored in my job. I've been doing it 8 years at the same company and have been promoted several times. I am respected both internally and externally with colleagues and clients. Things are going okay at work right, not great but not bad either. I am concerned about leaving my company with the way the economy is and the Brexit situation. I had always worked since graduating from uni. Never really taken a break.

Most of my family live in London. In Dec 2016 I broke up with my ex-GF who I had been with for 8 years. 2017 was a rollercoaster. I sold my house. Moved in with my new housemate. Rehomed pets. Tried to work out how to be single again. 2017 was a tough year of recovery really.

My finances are solid and my savings are thankfully very good, I've saved up nearly £200k over the years somehow mainly by being prudent in a long term relationship. I have a car and a decent salary but I still cannot afford to buy a property in London in the location I would prefer to live so I continue to rent with my friend.

I've recently discovered I have a passion for certain genres of music and have been exploring that the last few months which has been fun experimenting with it.

I have several close friends but not an army of friends which I feel lots of people around me do. Maybe I'm wrong.

I imagine a lot of people would be over the moon with my situation but I honestly feel quite lost in life right now. I don't know what to do next or have much drive in me anymore.

I generally come home after work and either do some exercise at the gym, play some video games in the lounge, chat to my house mate, go on a Tinder date (or date from someone I perhaps met in a bar) or if it's a Fri or Sat get completely smashed in a bar or club with my mates.

Everything feels so shallow and pointless. Perhaps I just need to get my head down and work through this but I really feel directionless for the first time in my life.

When I went to community college in maryland, I met a lot of people from different countries from Africa can and felt welcome, but when I transferred to New York I found it hard to befriend. I not used to how New Yorkers talk and if I were to speak regularly they may think I’m weird or boring but the worst part is I’m just not smart socially. People tent to talk with these kind word that I don’t understand and like I said before, I don’t want to be perceived as a loser or a boring person, how do I meet people and befriend th easily.",27Apr2018,0
359,"So, I just turned 14, and I won't explain it all, but basically, I'm in a position where everyone in my family is trying to get a stable source of money due to some poor decisions made by one specific person. That includes me. I've applied to one place before (the only place where I live that hires 13 year olds legally), and got 2 job interviews there. Both were unsuccessful, but they were 1-on-1 interviews. As soon as I turned 14, I applied for McDonalds, as I knew they hired 14y/o. My application was accepted the same day as it was submitted for a group interview. This is what scares me - working there, I'm going to be fine. But something about a group interview absolutely petrifies me. I really just don't know how I'm going to deal with it. Being an introvert, how am I meant to combat this? Thanks in advance.",27Apr2018,1
361,"Hey all. So last year I had a nasty break up with my ex of 11 years. I was pretty POed at him and when he wouldn't grant me space, my roommates intervened and had to kick him out.

He and I run a business based on our cartoon work. Since we have a loyal audience and such, we both decided to be civil, finish our project and dissolve our business.

My old roommates, who are also cartoonists, offered me to live with them back in their home state. They said we can try creating some concepts together and grow my audience. I passed because I was seeking a life out in Los Angeles.  I needed to see if I can be a cartoonist at a studio. After a few months, It didn't work out and I had to move back in with family. 

About a month ago, I saw this email for creatorsforcreators.org which could award a winning comic concept with $30k, industry contracts and more. At this time, I was jobless with very little money to my name. The only thing I'm certain I want is to be a successful cartoonist. I thought this was a great idea to dust off an old concept I've had in the works for years. Problem is, my ex had a hand in creating it. Now I don't mind giving him a credit or even working with him again for this one off. He's not my boyfriend anymore, we interact strictly via email and we keep it strictly professional. 

This is an important project with over 10 years of work put into the concept. I see this as both a way to get this big story out and closure for this chapter of my life with my ex. 

My old roommates found out and they were outraged. They don't believe my ex deserves any success or recognition, especially from me. I told them this would benefit me and turn my life around  and their answer was ""you had the option to pursue cartoons with us and you passed on it.""

There was no way I could have predicted Los Angeles would not work out and if this grant could change things for me even if it means I may have to interact with my ex a little,  why can't they just be happy for me? It hurts.  And even if I work on this alone, I will never deny my ex a special thanks. Dating aside, he was really good at being my creative consultant. They don't want that for him either. He spent 11 years with me. To believe he had no influence on my work is... crazy! And to deny him at least a special thanks for his consulting work is wrong. 


They've cut me out of my lives and I can't help but wonder if I did the wrong thing.  Advice?

368,me and a really good friend had a huge falling out. We havent spoken in months but now theyre leaving to a different country. My main issue is that I was always the one to reach out and make an effort and I felt they had just moved on and didnt care about the friendship. Should I just get over it and make the first move to reconcile? Because I keep thinking that the possibility of them brushing it off is so much worse than trying to salvage this friendship. ,27Apr2018,0
369,"Thank you in advance for any advice.

I am planning to put in my two weeks on Monday. Do I need to disclose in my resignation letter why I am leaving? I am suffering from severe anxiety, a lot of which steams from the job itself, and have realized that I need to leave for the betterment of my health and for the company. 

The problem is that it's a fairly small company and everyone treats each other like family. Upper management is aware of my anxiety however I know that when I give my letter my manager is going to be upset with me and want to know why. I don't think they realize the severity of it. 

How can I say the very minimum without burning any bridges (if possible)? Should I just tell them why? 

I appreciate any help.",27Apr2018,8
371,"Two weeks ago, a friend of mine had his car and savings bonds stolen while he was away on vacation. I happened to have crossed paths with the car thief when I was coming back from the gun range, and still had my bow and quiver out of the case (I was too lazy to put them away). 

I followed the car until we were way outside of city limits, and by that time had already contacted authorities. Shortly after, the man figured out I was trailing him, and he pulled over. Without thinking, I grabbed my AR15 and the loaded magazine, and drew the gun on him. Little was I aware, there was a second person in the car, a female mid 30’s with tattoos all over her arms. 

The man was enraged because I accused him of stealing the car, he tried to claim that he bought the car. I told him that the car is matching the Facebook post my friend posted. While I was focusing on him, the girl made a dead run away from the scene. I let her go, one thief to turn over to the police is better than none. 

After the police arrived, I filled out a written summary of what transpired. They were great, they were happy for me (sadly, they kept the magazine for evidence). 

The story took a more frightening turn after I was done with the PD. I was scrolling Facebook, and entered in the name of this guy on the search tab, upon finding his name I opened up his profile, and found that he made a post about me. 

It went something like this: 
Criminal “Got out on bail, thanks (friend’s name)” 

Reply from the criminal’s other friend (friend 2) “what happened?” 

Criminal “Got accused of stealing a car, innocent until proven guilty” 

Friend who got the mention “No problem man, I hope I don’t meet this kid on the streets, or bad things could happen to him. I got plenty of ‘erasers’ I’ll make his life a living hell. How did he stop you?” 

Criminal: “pulled an assault rifle on me” 

.... 

So I won’t lie, I read that, and my heart sunk. My FB account doesn’t have restrictive privacy settings, I know the guy probably doesn’t know my name, yet. This has just been a panicky deal for me. 

What should I do? Do I engage in the conversation these lunatics had?
