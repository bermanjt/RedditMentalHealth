0," I’m a 21 y/o college senior who doesn’t have the motivation to do anything. I know I should care more about school and having a successful job, but I just don’t. I have no idea what I want to major in still (I've changed my major 5 times), after 4 years; I’ve started to fail classes because I have no interest whatsoever. I honestly don’t know what to do at this point to change my mentality; I don’t know how I can get the motivation to do these things. ",28Sep2018,1
1,"I never thought I could get this far until I did, but now that I have, I’m afraid I won’t be able to live up to my potential.

I will graduate with a 4.0 GPA in Biochemistry. I have volunteer hours and experience as a CNA. My husband is in the military and is willing to gift me his GI bill. I could take the MCAT and apply premed. Assuming I get in, I could graduate nearly debt free.

But we have 2 kids (one barely a teenager, the other a primary schooler) and we are the sole caregivers for my mentally disabled brother. Assuming I could get accepted, that’d be 4 years spent studying away from my family. After that, countless hours training and working as a resident. The kids would be in school, but my brother would need a day nurse to check in on him. We have no other family support and money is already tight. It would be a long time before I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. I’m not sure I could work it out when our schedules and wallets are stretched so thin already. And what if I failed somewhere along the way?

I started my degree thinking I’d be closer to knowing what I should choose by the time I graduated, but I’m not. Logically, it might be better to set my sights on a short-term goal. Maybe a physician assistance program? That’s only 2 years and I could still work in my field of interest. Assistants supposedly have better work/life balance. I’m 30 now. Maybe I could try for med school in my 40s if I’m still not satisfied with my career. But will I regret not even trying? My first child was born when we were very young and we’ve dug ourselves out of tight spots time and time again. I’ve put my dreams on the back-burner before already... Maybe I should apply just to see if I’d even get accepted. Being rejected would certainly be a different story than not even trying...",28Sep2018,1
2,"So I have this girl who has been one of the best people in my life for the past 2 years, beat me out of a depression and has brought me out of my shyness quite a bit. Naturally I decided to spoil her with a few gifts I knew she would like and a card detailing what her friendship means to me. To try to give a little bit of what she gave me.  


Things turned weird when she decided to send me a wall of text asking to give up on loving her like that, that it made her awkward that I had feelings for her when in this case, I really don't. I made no notice of that in the card or when around her and I'm baffled she reached that conclusion.

I **don’t know how to deal with a serious crush in such a long time** ...

&amp;#x200B;

but this is more of a rant instead of asking for help, so i’ll put down some background details of myself then i’ll get to the point, which you can skip it if you don’t like to read my wall of text, but what the hell.

So i’ll just lay down the history between me and girls and how i behave usually when i deal with things like this. i’m 21, and i believe i only seriously dated 2 girls in my life, and the rest were either just things, hook up or were over after the second date because i’m weird. oh, how weird am i? a few words to describe myself. I get jealous a lot and i would say it is scary for a guy, i’m quite needy as well, i wouldn’t say that i am an introvert but i feel like i’m little bit of both. oh, i feel like i’m also extremely shallow, which is kind of bad because i see things pretty clear and i believe i’m just bit chubby and literally an average looking guy, which it held me back when it comes to dating because most of the time it’s either i get shot down easily and i just feel like i would feel ashamed of the girl i’ll be with of how she looks like, i know it’s bad, so most of the time i just took the easy way out, which actually is a good thing for both ends.

Between my 18-21 years old year, i gave all my time to tinder, that is because my first ever relationship when i was 16, it lasted for almost two years and my life changed after that. i would say i got hurt quite a bit and up to this point i still stalk my ex after like 6-7 years. anyways, during the tinder years, it was mostly just me rushing into whatever possibilities and see if i could last. friend of mine reminded me a person like me will get nothin out of tinder because she reminds me how big of a relationship person i am, but at the same time, being at university will basically make you horny &lt;- not true but my case is special. which now i have already stopped using it because it took me that long to get out of it, but, it was nothing but fun. but during all this time, i was still trying to look for myself and look for what i want. i do fall for people easily and most of my friends say i have a different kind of thing with a girl almost every month, which is kind of bad for myself because it’s totally not what i want. in that case, i always hurt myself for rushing something that i could’ve at least built more of it to maintain a better relationship, but, my second ex had destroyed my faith into dating and it took her 4 months of dating to tell me she only see me as a friend and felt bad for me. well, i did take a way shorter time to get over it but still, it hurts.

i personally have no trouble of meeting people and having friends, i have some really good friends, some school friends, basically pretty good in socializing so now i started to think that, wow, did i do something wrong because as i recall, i loved being in a relationship and an actual legit one was like 7 years ago, okay, you are prob thinking i’m those kind who just wanna get into a relationship with whoever and ill be fine with it, maybe you are right, i am scared of being lonely, i am the most needy dude in the world, but that is just who i am? idk, i tried to change and stop myself overthinking almost all the time, but i feel like maybe i lack of someone like a guardian angel or wingman type of thing that could help me to see the bigger pic, which it worked but i feel like that’s cheating in life, i want to grow up, meet girls in a proper way, be less negative and fall in love like most love stories, but in reality that’s not the case.

OKAY THIS IS TOTALLY OFF TOPIC SO HERE COMES THE DETAILS OF THE CRUSH

i’m a third year student, she’s first year. i met her like 3-4 weeks ago and i greet her the first day of class, and of course, i find her attractive and here comes all the problems.

1. she and i are prob friends for like 2 weeks, and i already got really jealous when i see her talking to another dude, which is ridiculous for me but i tried to control myself, but i can’t.
2. i think about her all the time, but now i’m scared of rushing everything even as a friend so i always play mind games to reply late and show how chill and not caring i am, but this is gonna be a problem if i want to take a step forward, right?
3. when we talk we hit it off right away, but one thing just bothers me is, when i found a seat first, she will never come join me and just sat like right behind me. but when i go to sit with her with there’s a project or something, she’s fine and she talks more than i do, so did i overthink?

so yea, that’s all the details for now, and if i had to rate, i’m prob a 6/10 kind of dude and i see her as a 7.5-8/10 kind of girl, i know this is pointless but i guess i just want it to let it off my chest... so yea, thanks for your time. i would prob need more advise in the future but for now that’s all. hit me with all you guys can, good day.",28Sep2018,1
6,"So I've been planning on just finishing the year and moving out studying college in Canada and things kinda got out of hand and i failed a few classes,

and according to where i live (Iraq) i have to redo the entire year like I've never done it before however if i stay here for much longer I probably wouldn't be able to take the amount of stress i'd be going through.

I was wondering if i just move out in a few weeks do i have to redo the year also or are there other simpler ways to finish the equivalent grade in Canada (or maybe just straight up go to college).

7,"My friends are all in their early 20’s and live together in a rented house. Two are a couple and one is a single male. I usually couchsurf at their place one or two days a week. I love them to pieces but their personal hygiene isn’t so great. There’s some habits like leaving dirty laundry around the living room or not cleaning their toilets, and there are other habits like leaving food on the counter or in the cabinet until it literally begins to rot. 

I help out by vacuuming, taking out the garbage, cleaning the catboxes etc. but recently the whole house has smelled strongly of rotten garbage. My mom and I visited today and we were shocked at the odor permeating the whole house. We aren’t the only friends who have noticed the smell/lack of hygiene. It just gets worse every week. 

It is also worth noting that two of the friends that live there struggle with depression and it’s hard for them to maintain a routine. I understand and I don’t want to shame them but I also worry about them. Today I found a big bag of potatoes in their cabinet that were rotting and smelling. How do I tell them that I am worried about them and the state of their house without shaming them or hurting their feelings? They are really great friends. ",28Sep2018,2
8,"When I am walking places, I don’t look at the faces of those around me. I’ll easily walk past friends I’m going to meet or even family members no bother. I’ve noticed it more and more. 


Yesterday it happened three times, one time with a friend walking directly up to me saying my name repeatedly and I didn’t register it was them until they were right in front of me waving in my face. I also went in a café to meet a friend and didn’t see them despite actively looking for them and them being sat looking over at me. My eyes are fine, I don’t use/need glasses, I’ve had them tested because I thought maybe that was the reason for my issue. 


I think this is connected to a memory/facial recognition issue I have. I have met people 10+ times and still can’t remember their names or point them out in a crowd. It really sucks because I am basically going through life either offending people because I can’t recognise them or just not using their names ever. I remember conversations I’ve had with them if they bring up things we’ve talked about but never what they look like. Sometimes I remember what they were wearing but that’s useless because people change clothes. I have old flat mates who I know now but it took me ages to learn their names, and now they live with new flat mates who I’ve met a few times but can’t remember. There are people at college clubs I’ve known for multiple years but because I saw them once a week I literally had to sit on Facebook looking at pictures of them repeating their names to get it stuck in my head. 


Occasionally though I’ll get someone who I remember after a single encounter (I still wouldn’t notice them walking down the street mind), but normally that’s because have an odd tattoo, earring, accent or skill. I’ve even had hook-ups with people and not known their name in the morning…no drink or drugs involved.
I am a uni student and I do well in exams with A grades. 


My mental math isn’t the best though and I struggle in waitressing/barista jobs where I have to remember drink orders because I forget what people have ordered or where they are sat. I have to carry a list of what is in different coffees because I keep forgetting how to make a flat white despite making several a day. However, I remember conversations well and odd facts and details that I can bring out that surprise people with their obscurity. Also, my friends describe me as reasonably witty, I am quick enough with a joke and participate in the debate team….but also I am very gullible, I fall for all the ‘gullible written on the ceiling’ jokes. I got a taxi to the post office yesterday, I asked the taxi driver if he knew it and he sarcastically replied ‘no never heard of it’ and I responded ‘oh no bother’ and gave the post codes. If ‘oh sweet summer child’/’is this woman that thick’ had a baby that would be the look I received. 


I don’t know if ‘poor memory’ covers what this is. 
What is this? Any ideas? Am I just dumb? It’s really not me not trying to remember names…I’ve tried the tactics of repeating their name in my head a thousand times whilst looking at them but 20 mins later it’ll be gone. Who would I even talk to this about? A doctor?

Any and all advice appreciated. ",28Sep2018,1
9,"Hello Reddit, i don't post on here a lot and in fact i made this account just for this to be honest. Im a 20m and my GF is 18, we have been together since secondary school, there was a breakup on my part but apart from being a little on and off at times we have been together for 4-5 years, i thought she was my one and only, i trusted her hands down without fail on everything she said. She has severe depression and anxiety that she has dealt with and tried to make it as easy for me as possible i assumed it was just from her dad abandoning her and her mum when she was 7 and went off to new Zealand with his new girl he was cheating on my GF mum with. Evil to be honest.

Until i started to realize that i was losing interest (slightly), the things i thought were cute and loved now agitate me, i found her anxiety a little cute sometimes and now started to annoy me, but i put it past and people have always said relationships require commitment, i stuck through with it for a long time thinking it would pass, which it did we went on holiday and spiced things up and things were going good. Then something happened, a phone call from a unknown number called her phone, i was laying next to her and asked who it was, she said it was bullies from school. I knew it wasn't since its half 2 in the morning and that she never mentioned bullies before so i answered and a guy said ""who's that"" ""where is (GF NAME)"" i freaked a little since something like this has never happened and someone calling at half 2 is strange, so i asked who it was and blah blah and he said something about him doing stuff with my gf recently, so i got mad and assumed my GF was cheating on me, the guy said he did some grim stuff you get the picture and as her bf you don't wanna be hearing that, and i ask her and she tells me this was 4 years ago when she was 14 and he was 22.... 

I wont even lie after that night something changed, after talking with her and her going to the police and all that stuff, she has PTSD from what he did. She tells me that i literally saved her life and she tried to commit suicide a few times and has gone therapy for it before we met. She is crazily in love with me, she will do anything i ask and in some ways she is the perfect girlfriend, but i know there is something that she hasn't let go and since hearing that i don't know why and i know it shouldn't but i cant help but other-think things and that phone call that night and the way she dealt with it so calm that night but tells me that she has ptsd and it effected her. I feel like i am her lifeline she is only happy when she is with me and she has self harmed when we have had arguments and it all weighs me down and im just so so scared that she will end it and i honestly think she will, i have been so supportive and helped her with everything but i just feel like i need freedom and time to explore my own interests and motives in life and care for my mental health too i have thought about ending it a few times but ive been worried and this was before i even knew that thing happend with that 22 year old,shes told me a few times she relies on me too much, i feel like i cant talk to anyone about it apart from you Reddit. 

I dont know what to do, what shall i do?

11,"

I was working as a caregiver for a woman with dementia for about 18 months. I love the job. She’s a super sweet woman, we’ve developed a bond, but her husband on the other hand is a complete douche. The past 18 months has been hectic for me.

I found myself complaining a lot, not about the job, but the verbal abuse I’ve suffered from the hands of the husband. He would say things like “I can buy you and sell you, you’re not in my category,  you’re beneath me, you’re an animal, you look a little sad, maybe you should commit suicide “ that’s just a very small portion of what I’ve endured from him. At first I would just ignore him, but when I ignore him he would try to provoke me even more when he notices I wouldn’t let his harsh words get to me. 

I gave up the job before and I told him I work too hard to let anyone abuse me in anyway and this will be my last day here. He took my phone and hid in somewhere in the house. He chased me out of the house crying telling me to give him a chance to talk and apologize and he would give me my phone back. We talked and told me he’s under a lot of pressure because the thought of getting older scares him and he’s really not happy with his life. Not an excuse to be mean to me, but I forgave him and continued to work for him. I tried to hang in there as long as I could.

I dealt with a lot of his craziness. Three weeks ago, he really really pushed me over the edge. I was off Wednesday and Thursday and when I came back on Friday he said he wanted to discuss something with me and of course I said ok, let’s talk about it. He then said “I don’t want to talk about it right now” so I said “If you’re not ready to discuss it now, why bring it up ?” He then said “I just don’t want to” so I left it alone. 


The next day I came to work a little early to see another woman there and I was very much confused. I’m automatically thinking I’m going to be replaced. It didn’t really matter to me at that point. I asked the boss to just give me my money so I can go. He kept insisting to talk to me and I told him there’s really nothing to talk about... if there should’ve been a discussion there should’ve been one beforehand. This was a complete surprise to me. He wouldn’t let me leave so I really stepped out of character and I cursed him out which frightened him because I’ve never acted in that way. I demanded he give me my money so I can leave. He said he was going to the bank to go get it. That bitch came back with the cops. They did not arrest me, but I did end up storming out in tears. I felt bad acting the way I did because I let him get the best of me, that’s not who I really am. 

He called last night to let me know that my check is still there and I can pick it up anytime, but he wanted to have a discussion with me and give me the job back.

He would constantly tell me I’m the best worker by far, I make his life so much smoother and he would never get rid of me. I do practically 90% of the work so the other women won’t have to work so hard. I buy and prepare the meals. I really put in a lot of work, effort and time to make sure everything runs smoothly so I am deeply saddened by this. Her tell me all the time I make his life so much smoother, he’d never let me go and I’m the best employee yada yada. It’s a great job, it’s very selfless, it pays decent. And I stayed as long as I did because I really did love caring for the wife. She practically became my family.

19,"We don't necessarily have a problem, she's very professional, but I've noticed she is not very interested in collaborating with me and will do anything to avoid giving me a chance to shine or accept my ideas. 

I have advocated for this person, gone out of my way to help her and was even part of the decision made to hire her. I've been so nice to her. But once I got promoted and she got to take ownership of where the bulk of my work is contributed, she's done nothing but exclude me from opportunities, refuse my ideas and avoid recognizing or involving me in anything she has a say in. 

What sucks is she can't seem to fathom the idea that sometimes talent can be just as valuable as experience. Despite me advancing quickly there and consistently getting positive feedback from higher-ups, she isn't investing in what I offer to the team although our leadership is.

I'm not perfect but I am always kind and always committed to doing great work. The only response I can get from outsiders is that it's jealousy and resentment due to my talent and success in a short amount of time. I will say she has a very corporate culture approach to work when I'm more of a flexible, start-up type. I am a lot more 'quirky' and unconventional and I think we just don't mesh well. 

I am worried about this because despite how I often respond to her antics with kindness and transparency, nothing changes. She does nothing to empower me as her colleague and she has been given control over something where she can impact the success of my work.

I'm worried about how this could play out in the long-term. I am not going to talk to anyone above us about it because it's not productive and she is crafty about how she goes about it. Plus, that would obviously just create more resentment. 

I've never considered someone could be this jealous to the point where they'd go out of to prevent their own team member from succeeding. I'm not sure what else I can do besides continue being kind and not let it get to me, but I just wonder if you were jealous and annoyed by someone to the point where they would avoid working with you, what could they do to change your mind?

21,"Background: I made some friends 3 years ago, two guys in particular. They were the closest friends I've ever had. I felt so understood and at ease. We hung out nearly every day for over half a year, then they moved to different parts of the world. 3 years later we still chat online, but it's hard because we are all slowly changing as people. I still care for them but recently I haven't felt excited or motivated to chat with them. I ignore calls because I know they will want to talk for 2 hours or more while I want to be alone or pursue other things. Also, the distance is a strain.

The thing is they are half (literally) of all my friends whom I keep in touch with, the other two being my ex turned friend and my best friend from high school. I want to branch out and find new people to spend time with who actually live near me, but feel like I'll have to tell my old friends that I will contact them less. 

Then I wonder if the problem is me. Am I not opening up or engaging enough? Why am I avoiding them? Can I adequately juggle my long-distance friendships with new ones? They *have* told me that they have me as a friend because I'm attractive, and they make some dumb jokes (-\_-) but we have a great time when we chat. If they lived near me, I would undoubtedly be hanging out with them no problem, but because of the circumstances I feel like easing up on my dedication to our friendship.

How do I figure this out?

I’m tired of my family not trying to understand what I have to say with every situation and walking all over me. They don’t try to understand what I have to say. Apparently to them, just because I have anxiety/panic attacks, I am not an adult or showing that I can’t handle anything. I want to leave but when I come back, I either can’t come back home or will have consequences. Help. I don’t know what to do. ",28Sep2018,1
28,"My professor announced to the class on our online school portal that her father has passed away and that she will be taking some time away. For some reason I feel guilty about this, like I should repay her somehow for assisting me so much in this class. 

Would giving her a card or just my condolences be alright? I don't want to upset her or make her uncomfortable, and I'm generally unsure of how to give best wishes in scenarios where the person has lost someone close to them. I personally (thankfully) have yet to experience the pain of losing someone very close and dear to me, though I can only imagine how horrific it must be. 

Would just leaving her be to grieve and carrying on in the class normally when she returns be better? I'm conflicted. ",28Sep2018,6
29,"For context, I’m a 21 year old female who identifies as pansexual.

I reached out to a friend I hadn’t seen in a while yesterday, wanting to see him again. He told it to me straight: I’m unreliable. And I agree. 

A lot of the times I’ll make plans and cancel semi-last minute because I’m simply not in the mood. That’s really the only way to describe it. I’m not in the mood to have someone come over just to have sex or I’m not in the mood to go out and pretend that they’re into me for more than sex. Maybe it’s a boundary thing.

Or I’ll spread myself too thin. I’ll talk to people online, promising that we’ll meet up, and it never happens. Usually I’ll ghost them, because I’ve been “nice guy’d” too many times and don’t want to run the risk of being called a bitch for the millionth time.

I think it’s because I have too many sexual based relationships and I get tired of the pattern of meeting in public and then having casual sex for the foreseeable future. I wanna date, ya know? Maybe I put out too easily. (But you can’t blame me for enjoying it.)

In my heart of hearts I know I’m a shit person who’s milking these poor souls for their attention and not following through on my promises.

36,"A little backstory:

One of my roommate's boyfriends is hated by all of our other roommates for several reasons. He comes in a lot and just starts rambling conversations and randomly brings his friends in. He comes into our rooms uninvited and he sits on my bed when he comes into my room. Me and several others think he may be on the Asperger/ autism spectrum because he is socially awkward and doesn't pick up on social cues. However, because its awkward we haven't told our roommate, his girlfriend, our issues with him. He comes over way too much and when we hear him knock on the door we don't answer.

When he comes in, he tries to hug everyone and its super awkward because its unwanted and we aren't even close with him. If he ever tried to hug me in front of my boyfriend, he would FREAK OUT (because we both don't like him) and I'm worried it will happen some time. We've had to make up excuses like ""oh im sick"" etc and I narrowly avoided a hug today as I said ""oh I have to go get something be right back"".

How do i approach this situation? Also should I go to him or his gf about the hugging? I have social anxiety and hate confrontation and I don't want to be mean. ",28Sep2018,1

38,"A little background, I am a 24 year old bisexual male and recently started trying to date, therefore, I am pretty new to the whole scene. So I met this guy on a dating app. We kinda started off slow talking, but eventually decided to meet. Prior to meeting, we set the date up 2 weeks in advance and for the entire 2 weeks, we were texting basically all day, everyday. Those texts were your normal cutesy texts - good mornings/nights, sexual innuendos and just daily life updates. On top of the texts, we were snapchatting each other a lot. We eventually met and had our first date on Friday. We totally hit it off; we had a ton in common, conversation was always flowing and we generally had a really good time. We went back to his place and had sex; dont worry, we cuddled and watched a TV show be jumping right into it. After we did the dirty, we hung out for a couple of hours longer before we both had other prior commitments and had to part ways. All in all, we spent the whole day together and I think we both had a really good time. When I got home, there was a text on my phone that said ""Hey, I had a really fun time text me when you get home"". We texted a bit that night, but nothing was different. I definitely left the day thinking that we would have a second date. I was even optimistic to think that this may turn into a relationship down the road, but knew that it would take some time to get to that point.

The next day, I neither texted him nor did text me because we both knew we had a full day planned and it wasn't worth bothering each other. That following Sunday, I texted him and he did not text back as promptly as he had the week prior. The conversation, or lack there of, was disjointed and not as flowy as it had been previously. I did not think anything of it because it was still the weekend and I knew he was probably busy. Monday and Tuesday we did not text at all. I opted to just snapchat him because I think I was waiting for him to text me. The snapchat responses were scarce and short. I thought it was weird that he was not talking much to me, but again, I did not want to think much into it. On Wednesday, I snapchatted him again and got no response. I thought it was weird and started to ponder about lack of response. I texted him that night just to say hi and ask him how his day was. I did not get a response until hours after I sent the text. I know that sounds paranoid and clingy, but the responses the weeks prior were prompt. He eventually texted back and it was just a weird response. I asked how his day was and never got a response...even 24 hours after sending the text. I didn't try to talk to him all Thursday because idk if he even wants to talk to me.

Idk, maybe I'm just being super self conscious about the whole situation because I'm new to dating? I want things to work out between us two, however, I don't wanna seem desperate, which I know I am right now. Maybe I'm just wanting things to move faster than they need to. I just don't know what to expect after a first good date because I'm not use to really hitting it off with anyone. Maybe all he wanted from me was a hookup and I just misread his signals all day? Please someone just tell me if I need to chill and just let things flow. Or if I'm wasting my time and I should just keep dating a not let this petty situation get to me.",28Sep2018,1
39,"I just graduated from high school recently and am looking to move into an apartment with my friend. I had a decent paying job at a coffee shop in my town for 3 years up until May of this year when I quit and went on a road trip with my friend before college. When I got back, I decided to do a lot of dog sitting jobs before going to college. I make very good money doing it, but it’s money from a lot of different people, not just one person, and it’s not an official occupation. I’m wondering if you guys have any tips on getting an apartment with no official form of income? My parents would co-sign the lease for me, but I would rather not depend on them for that unless absolutely necessary. My friend who I am moving in with does have a job if that makes a difference.

He says it makes me ""boring"" as I don't do anything else when I have access to it. However, it seems as if this is partially due to the fact that on the occasion I can use it, I get the urge to binge-use it because I'm otherwise restricted from it so I want to get as much use in as possible.

65,"This has a bunch of backstory in order to understand fully. There is a TL;DR at the bottom, though.

&amp;#x200B;

I met this group of people back in 2015-2016 during my sophomore year of high school. This was on Tumblr and these people were mostly around my age at the time, as well as having a fandom in common. We got along fairly well and we even made a Discord server for all of us. I considered them friends, and they all considered me a friend as well.

In October of 2017 of my senior year, I was talking with one of them over Discord IM. I was angry about something that didn't concern them, and I was being needlessly cruel to them (younger me was prone to letting my anger get to me, but as an adult now at 18, I want to correct that behavior). Afterwards, I completely forgot about the conversation as the messages are somehow gone from my DM history.

... I would be reminded of this convo later down the line with some ugly news.

On April 17th of 2018, 6 months later, I was indeed reminded of that convo by the person I was needlessly cruel to. But... I was also told that the group I considered friends were pretending to get along with me, actually hate me, and had a secret chat where they said not-so-pleasant things about me. I was sent screenshots of the chat, and the earliest message was around the time of my unneeded attack over DMs. The hate even went as far as them sending me anonymous hate on Tumblr because they thought it would be 'funny' to do so. I was crying and sobbing almost the entire day; I then ended my friendship with the whole group and blocked them all.

It is now almost October of 2018, I'm enrolled in my first year of college, and... I still miss them. I find myself missing them and I don't know why since they treated me terribly. Any advice for helping me move on easier?

In the last month or so she's gotten very touchy feely and sending me pictures and telling me I'm hot and sexy. I don't mind the attention but lately I've been wanting more and we recently had the chance so I took the opportunity. It didn't go very far because she started feeling guilty which is completely understandable. But since then it's all I think about and how much I enjoy being with her. She still says she doesn't want anything sexual but she keeps making advances as well as talking dirty to me every night. I don't know what to do because on one hand she makes me feel amazing and complete with the way she talks to me and just how she is as a person.

68,"Hey guys! So, right now i’m a First year studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at UT Austin. I love ECE and I seriously think it’s really cool, But sometimes I find myself wishing i’d decided on Mechanical engineering. I just think the knowledge of Mechanical would be awesome to have, but sadly my school doesn’t offer a minor in this field. I just want the knowledge and not the jobs associated with mechanical. I really don’t know what to do because at UT it is extremely hard to change majors. Is it possible for me to learn about mechanical on my own? Any recommendations?

I’m 25, been in pretty crappy health for a year and not working.

71,"When I was in 7th grade (about 12-13 years old), I had this terrible art class, but I had a few friends, among them was this one girl (let’s call her G for simplicity’s sake.) and we got pretty close. I actually liked her very briefly, but nothing came of it, or even close to that. We were just good friends, and that continued until high school, when we just kind of went our separate paths. Eventually I ended up making an Instagram, and she found me, and that’s how we’ve been keeping up... until I noticed she blocked me there, and on Snapchat. 

First, I thought it may have just been an accident or glitch, but I tried a different Instagram account because I had to ask her something. (I was trying to find a birthday present for her brother, who I mentored in my senior year.) I never got a response, and lo and behold, I check a few days ago and I’m blocked there too, so it definitely wasn’t an accident. I don’t think I ever said anything weird or rude, especially considering we didn’t talk much anyway, and in the last days of high school, she signed my yearbook pretty happily, left a message thanking me for taking care of her brother, and recalling our middle school days. I can’t think of why she’d block me, and I feel like I’m bothered by it when I really shouldn’t be. I thought we’d always be friends, even if not as close as we used to be, but evidently, something seems to have happened. I considered asking a mutual friend (spent 3 years in marching band with him, he’s really close to her) if he might have any idea, but I haven’t yet. 

Can anyone suggest any possible reasons why this may have happened, or even why I’m so bothered by it, and then what to do about it?

He has lost his keys several times is sings yells slams doors, even broke one and its lock at night time (after 23:00 which by our landlord should be quite hours... Thats why im awake now). Another one is just plain messy. She smokes weed in her room regularly, smokes indoors with her friends in general and leaves cigarettes and tabaco just wherever... The other 5 flatmates are OK... Also there is music canstantly blasting outside.

The thing is, I can't get quality sleep. Part of it has to do with the noise. The other part is that I do not really feel safe. The other thin is I'll be starting a part time job and feel that I'll need more rest than I can get now.

I am really hesitant to file a accomodation change request because a) I will most likely swap with someone, and that means the person also was not satisfied about something in his accomodation, what if I end up in a worse situation? b) what will my new flatmates think of me? Will they see me as weak/untrustworthy? Will friends think less of me? c) I'm unsure what kind of evidence I should provide in order to justify switching...

Basically I said something to a coworker, that she took the wrong way, it was miscommunication I am sure of it. But it was still a shitty thing to say to her. 

I told her I was offered her job a few years ago, and she thought I meant I was offered her job currently and that she was going to lose it, so she ended up quitting the next day, but my manager got her to come back. So she's coming back tomorrow. 

I've never had a really delicate situation like this so i'm unsure of how to apologize to her. I think she thought I was boasting to her.

82,"A few weeks ago I applied for an assistant group leader position for an after-school program that basically watches over kids which starts in a week. Positions range from counselor -&gt; assistant group leader -&gt; group leader -&gt; higher up staff. I worked there over the summer (so I'm familiar with the upper staff for the most part) and was recommended for the assistant position for the school year by a group leader. As the program starts soon and counselors have already been given an orientation date (this Monday), should I go out of my way to contact the organization or even the group leader who recommended me to begin with? I'm asking as this has really started to trigger my anxiety again (I have to say again because when I e-mailed them my college schedule, I never got a reply back like ""thanks, we'll get back to you"" or anything despite triple checking that I sent the e-mail to the correct address) and I'm not sure what to do as they made it obvious that not many others were recommended for the assistant position -- it was implied that I would be almost guaranteed the position by an upper staff member. Would my best option be to just wait or make a call? If I do make a call, is it worth asking if I can be granted a counselor position dispute the application being closed? I didn't apply for it prior to the closing date as I assumed I would get the assistant position.

83,"Hi everyone! I’ve [18/f] been nannying/babysitting over the last couple years and I’ve loved it. I got an offer from a family friend to pick up her kids after school everyday of this school year and take them to their extracurricular activities. She offered $85/week and I agreed. Little did I know, this was going to take up a lot of my time and gas!

The mom told me that two days a week I’d be taking her daughter to dance classes, and I used to go to the same dance studio which was relatively close. Therefore, this was not an issue... or so I thought. She failed to tell me that the studio had been moved a lot further away- about 30 mins there and 30 mins back. I spend at least 2 hours and as much as 3.5 hours in the car picking up her kids and taking them where they need to be. I go through a tank of gas every week, which is a lot for someone who only makes $85/week. Nearly half of that is put into gas.

This was my initial problem at the beginning of the year when I realized there were a lot of details missing in her original offer. This past weekend she asked me to stay the night with the kids and get them to school the next morning. Between Sunday (the night I stayed over) and Monday (when the mom got home), I spent 11 hours of extra time with the kids, not including sleeping or getting up early to get the kids ready. The rate at a low standard where I live is $10/hour. I received my paycheck today, and for those 11 hours I got $15. Nope, not a typo. $15. Nearly $100 underpaid.

She texted me saying “Money sent. Sorry it couldn’t be more” and I immediately felt bad. She’s a single mom, widowed about 3.5 years ago, and I’ve known her for the past 4 years. I understand her situation, but at the same time I feel like I shouldn’t be at expense for that. I gave up my Sunday and Monday hoping to earn a little extra money and I hardly got anything. They have a very nice custom-built home and maids that come to clean and I know they spend a fortune on the daughter’s dance classes as I used to go there and she takes wayyyy more classes than I ever took. 

My parents both agree this is wrong of her to do, but I’m too shy to say anything to her in the event that they really are tight on money. My parents think I should just do the bare minimum from now on. My boyfriend thinks I should demand the money I earned, quit, and work with him at an ice cream shop. His idea is very hard for me to do as I’ve known this family for a long time and I feel like it will burn bridges. What do you think of this situation and how should I handle it?

I'm kind of losing it at this point. Idk what to do. My fiancée is about to be 9 weeks pregnant and we're both trying to find jobs in a new city. She's currently going to college (actually, she's missing a *lot* of class because she doesn't want to walk 30 minutes through a sketchy unfamiliar area to get to her bus stop).

I've been applying at a bunch of places but my applications keep getting denied. I can't really do manual labor because I've got 2 compression fractures in my thoracic spine and scoliosis/kyphosis. Doctors won't prescribe me any pain meds becaus I used to use drugs (176 days off meth and everything else, honestly never crave anything other than nicotine which I've been off for a couple weeks).

I have a bad feeling my fiancée is going to drop out like I did (couldn't afford it) and she's going to lose her scholarships. My dad offered to help me out by buying me a cheap travel trailer about 30 minutes from the college. It's gonna cost $400 a month plus utilities so that's a crazy good deal in Texas.

Anyways, my fiancée is hanging out with a “Christian group” tonight and it's really triggering some of my old mental issues. This group is known to harass and torment fellow students and I don't think it's a good idea for her to associate herself with them. Quoting what she told me before she went after I told her I didn't want her going. *“Well 1. You’re not here and 2. I want to go with my friend so I’m going to go.”*

I just need some serious live advice here. I told my counselor from my mental health clinic that I no longer needed help a month ago, but now I'm kinda regretting that.

95,"I currently live in Miami and planning to move up to Chicago with my boyfriend. 


We have a place there ready by Monday (Oct 1). As for me, I will be bringing my car up there and planning to move by Oct. 14th, that way I’m able to put in my 2 weeks notice and have enough time to pack and move everything. My boyfriend is willing to fly down as well and drive with me which is amazing.


The living situation is set and my boyfriend offered to pay for rent for the meantime while I build up enough income so I can help. And I am so extremely grateful for him!!


As far as jobs, I am leaning more into customer service reps and recruiter jobs since I’ve had experience with both. So, I have been aggressively applying everywhere through LinkedIn, Craigslist, Indeed, Ziprecruiter and even reached out to r/chicagojobs. I’ve had more luck through LinkedIn and Craigslist which is great!! I’ve had **many many** calls and many emails as well which surprised me since I didn’t think I was all that qualified. 


I’ve had 3 years of extensive customer service/sales experience and currently am a recruiter for veterinarians, have been doing it for a year now so I’m not very experienced. The recruiter jobs fell through and thought I wasn’t the best match and found better candidates 🙄, I’m applying for cs jobs through Craigslist and luckily enough I have an interview on the 17th!


But more of a concern for me is, there are some that fell through as well because I’m not physically present. I can tell them that I am available around so and so time, but it doesn’t stop them from looking for more candidates who are readily available and are local. So I thought of just biting the bullet and move there and look for a job there. 


I figured since I was able to receive so many calls out of state, how much more in state and where I’m available for an interview on the spot or the next day? But the risk is not knowing when I will land a job. I have enough to pay for a month or 2 with my bills, but I’m scared I may not have something by then.


Has anyone went through this before when moving out of state? I figured since it’s a city, its not hard to land a job right away. I would say my work experience is reasonable enough but just want some insight anyway.


Any feedback is appreciated!

Anyways her mom does her fasfa for her because obviously she knows all her information but the money that comes back from fasfa goes straight into her moms account and when questioned about it she says things like “ don’t even you owe me” “don’t worry about it and get a real job”. 

My friend works in retail and attends a 4 year university on financial aid but she lives at home. She is scared to stand up to her mom she says she will destroy all her clothes and will hit her and will kick her out if she goes against her. 

She also has a joint account with her mom (her mom set her bank account up in high school she’s been afraid to change it because her mom sometimes will give her small amounts of money for gas or something but she also randomly takes money out. I know that this isn’t right but I don’t know what to do. I can’t stand up to her for her and I don’t want my friend to get kicked out. 

I told her if she hits her she will go to jail for domestic violence. She says she won’t learn her lesson even then she would come out and make her family hate her and she would definitely try to have her on the streets then.

104,"This is a throw away account. When I was 15 years old I was raped by my high school boyfriends cousins friend at an overnight lake get together. It was a terrifying experience that I have lived with for 17 years. I told my then boyfriend and he made the obligatory tough guy high school comments about beating the guy up. But nothing ever came of it. Nothing was mentioned ever again. I felt ashamed. Like I allowed it to happen. I didn’t want anyone to know. I was 15. And the man was 20 years old. I had only met him the day before. My girl friend and I needed to use the restroom after having a few beers. We were at the lake so portapotties were quite far. My friends cousin drove us to the portapotty. I admittedly had a few beers, I was 15 and it didn’t take much to make me drowsy. I fell asleep on the way back to camp. They left me in the car because everyone was sleeping in their cars anyway. I woke up to a man on top of me. I panicked. I grabbed at him to defend myself, his hands were down my pants. I grabbed his large puka shell necklace. I remember thinking, this may be the only identifying factor, remember this necklace. But he couldn’t get my pants off, he struggled. He told me we needed to go to the boat. I was terrified. He walked me stumbling with my pants half down through rocks and dirt. I was barefoot. I begged for my shoes. We walked by multiple cars of our friends sleeping, I wanted to call out to them. I was so afraid. I was afraid they would think I slept with him. We got to the boat and he forced me down. He had sex with me. I stared at the corner of a cream colored room wishing I were anywhere else. The only thing I said to him was “please don’t cum inside of me, I’m not on birth control.” He made me stay there as to not alert the other people around. In the morning I got up and left, another couple was happily socializing on the boat deck. They stared at me. I felt ashamed. I told my high school boyfriend when we got back to town. He basically told me he wanted to kill the guy. And it was left at that. I have hid this for so many years. Rationalizing it away. I couldn’t tell you the month. I couldn’t tell you the day. But I can tell you that grabbing that puka shell necklace, frantically trying to break it so that maybe there would be evidence is very real. I watched with hope as she spoke. I finally looked up the statute of limitations in the state I was raped. There is no timeline. I could bring charges. But today I watched a woman go through hell. And I should be empowered. But the response from the Republican Party has me disgusted. It has me utterly convinced that there is no hope. Victims are shamed and ridiculed. I can’t come forward.

105,"I work in a school as a counselor. I get a lot of parent calls wanting me to help their kids with various issues regarding grades. One lady called about her sons password to his student account and said one of the teachers hasn't been updating it so she has no idea how he's doing in class.

This was a teacher who had no student account login all last year..I assumed hers was still messed up, so I went to my assistant principal, who helps with those issues, and told her a couple kids had mentioned they had no grades from her and that a parent had called about it. I asked her if she could fix it and get her a login and then I left.

I had to talk to this parent again and let her know to check it later, but while on there this time, she logged in again and it was showing grades. And the previous day it wasn't. I then logged into my account to see if I could see anything and saw a few grades. I felt stupid because apparently the teachers account was working. I wrapped up my call..

And then my AP literally shoved the door open with her shoulder and entered my room and looked very mad. She leaned over my desk and asked me what the problem was because the teachers account worked. She insinuated that I was trying to cause drama, I tried to explain how hers didn't work last year and I honestly thought it was still messed up and was just trying to help her out. She still ranted at me.

She had also been standing outside my door listening to my conversation with the parent. This parent was ranting about how she emails teachers and no one responds and that no teachers are helping her autistic son gather his makeup work. I told her email was good because she'd have documentation ..as proof she's tried to get help and to reach them.

I've worked there for years and know some of those teachers won't help kids out like they say they will. I didn't tell the parent this though. But I do make sure to tell people to always document communications, especially if the kids have IEPs.

My AP ripped me for that too. She said I should not be telling people to document and again acted like I'm a troublemaker. She gave me a speech about how I need to let parents talk to teachers. The problem is, teachers often ignore parents so I get stuck with it.

She just totally ripped me and made me feel about an inch tall.

Then the teacher came in upset and said the AP had entered her room in front of her class and made her login right then and was rude to her in front if her class. I felt so awful that I got her in trouble but I didn't know AP would act that way!

I'm just feeling so awful about this tonight, I'd never try to cause trouble for anyone. I hate she got in trouble and I hate my AP thinks I'm drama. I was just trying to help.

Do you think I did anything wrong here?

106,"I'm kinda writing this on a whim here, I don't really know what will come of it so bear with me because I haven't thought this through.

I'm a 17 year old kid living in Canada with my parents and younger sister. I've struggled with thoughts of what you might say is depression but seeing as I've never been diagnosed I'm hesitant to call it that. I should love my life. My family is by no means poor, we live a very average life style and my parents are not in anyway negligent. I go to a good school and I have enough friends to where I shouldn't feel this way. 

It all kinda started in gr 8, and it started on a very positive note. I meet some new people for the first time that I felt I really connected with. They liked video games but not the same ones I did and this allowed me to connect with them really easily. They got me into PC gaming and I really enjoyed it(obviously). I started talking to them on skype everyday and it was really a great time in my life. I'm not a very sociable person so to find people I liked and who liked me was a real anomaly in my situation so I jumped at the chance. We had a blast for that year, and even into the next when we all went to the same high school for grade 9.
It all kinda started going down hill about half way through my sophomore year. I lost some of the friends I had made from middle school and made new ones who had the same interests as them. We would do basically the same thing as we always did but for some reason it wasn't working like it used to. I would play with them for hours, laugh, chat and have fun, but when I got off I would always have this sinking feeling. I dismissed it as just wanting to keep playing with them and went on with my year. I soon realized that it wasn't that at all. Even when playing I would have hours of fun and laughter as always but then, like a light, mid game or mid whatever we were doing, it would completely knock the wind right out of my sails. 
It was junior year at this point and I began playing a game called Overwatch competitively. I played it nonstop for the year and after thousands of hours of practice and hard work, managed to make it to top 500 in North America. After reaching this goal I thought I would feel relived (seeing as all my hard work had paid off), but i wasn't. I started using the game as an outlet for all of the shit that I was struggling with internally. I became very negative, and even the game wasn't satisfying me anymore. I thought that maybe if I reached top 500 I would feel like I was worth a damn but it was the opposite. I said very nasty things to people in my games all the time and taking all of my inner-turmoil and concentrating it as anger and frustration toward others. I started resenting myself and the game so when the summer before senior year came around I decided I needed to stop. I uninstalled the game and tried my best to start going out and talking to people in person(people being my close friends). Once I started doing this I realized who I was surrounding myself with. Because of my awful social anxiety I had subconsciously surrounded myself with people who didn't talk about anything personal, *anything*. They would always deflect with a joke or a quip and I started taking notice. I had blamed these terrible, terrible feeling of loneliness and, dare I say, depression on things like games other outlets for so long I hadn't thought that maybe I was the problem. Keep in mind that these feelings had been stewing and growing inside me for years now and I still hadn't told anyone but how could I? I hate asking for help so sharing anything personal with anyone goes against everything within my being. On top of this, because I had quit Overwatch, my biggest distraction and outlet for all of this, whenever I was alone, I was plagued with a sea of hurtful and negative voices crushing me with every word. I couldn't stand it so I set my sights on trying to make myself better. I tried everything in the book. I read and learned about all kinds of mental health issues and how to over come them, but nothing stuck. After spending the final month of my summer on this I was completely out of ideas. The feeling of worthlessness and self loathing had more then doubled and school was starting up so I did what everyone does, I started talking to an old friend from elementary school who went to my highschool and started doing hella drugs. I wasn't an addict or anything but they offered a GREAT escape from what was going on in my head. I knew it wasn't a long term solution but I didn't care anymore, all I wanted was for this feeling to go away. I wasn't an avid user at all, I would just go out with friends and smoke. Still depressed and demoralized the school year started and I was back in the fray, but this time with no safety net. I found a new group of friends which was a major thing for me. I was able to talk to new people and hearing what they had to say was amazing. I thought I was improving. After a few weeks of developing new friends, I had a week to myself. Everyone was swamped with work so no one could hang out and I was alone again with my, oh so wonderful, thoughts. However I thought that with all of the new friends I had made I would be okay, feeling accomplished for taking a step out of my comfort zone. 
Boy was I wrong. 
It was the same as before. All of the feelings came back but stronger than ever. I didn't know what to do. I had thought that maybe if I had made so much progress with myself that those feelings would at least die down or go away altogether. And yet there I was, thrust back into the abyss.
I realized at this point that maybe there was something else going on here. After a full night of thinking I decided to talk to my Dad about it for the first time (this was a week ago). I told him everything (kinda). How I felt like dirt, how whenever I was alone I was suffering and sad. It was a shock to him, but he told me about all of his mental health issues. He suffers from severe anxiety and this caused him to go into serious depression later in life. He told me about his psychiatrist and how he has a therapist and everything. I thought this would make me feel a little better but it really didn't. 

He offered to take me but I said no. 


I'm terrified. I had pondered the idea that I might have a mental health problem before but I never gave it any real deliberation. The idea that something might actually be wrong with me in a way that I can't fully control is so so scary to me. 
I don't want to label myself and have to live the rest of my life with it hanging over my head. I know its irrational but I'm stumped(to say the least). I don't know what my friends will think of me and I don't want anyone to treat me like damaged goods. Even my dad has been dancing around me like I'm a time bomb. I have been sitting on this for a while, maybe for to long and this is kind of my last shout. I don't know where to go from here and I terrified at what the rest of the year holds if I don't sort this out.

I'm sorry this was so long but even in this I've still left so much out. I'm really really bad at sharing my emotions and experiences with anyone, even in this anonymous text post I know I haven't shared everything that has gone through my head(you know old faithful, suicide :) ). I'm just looking for some guidance on where to go from here.

110,"So my husband has cheated on me (only online but still cheating to me) repeatedly for the last 3-4 years (that i know of. Doesn't admit until he's caught) and today he said he only had 20$ left. I asked how much he took out of our account yesterday and  he said he withdrew 40$ from our account which whatever. It's 40$.

 Then I got the mobile banking app today and noticed there was a withdrawal of 125$ from yesterday. Not 40. So I asked him if he took 125$ which whatever if he did he could've took it all and i wouldn't have cared its not about the money its about lying about it. I showed him and he's like idk why it says tht i only took 40$. Like ok the bank doesn't usually make mistakes like tht and he got very defensive yelling saying he only took 40$. And i told him just tell me the truth thw bank app isn't gonna lie but you have many times. Just tell me the truth. He stuck to his lie. So I said fine I'll just go to the bank and ask to see the slip YOU signed for thw withdrawal amount.

 I got a block away from the bank and he admitted it was 125$. Why lie about that??? I honestly wouldn't have cared! And i told him that. So then i got to thinking ok how do you only have 20$ left? You were at work all night how did you spend 105$?! He again got very defensive and said he bought gas, cigs, food, and drinks for work.

 So I said fine 10$ in gas ok...subway was maybe 10$ , cigs are almost 8$ , NOS was 2 for 5$ and two teas for 99 cents is 2$. That comes to about 35$. That's still a big chunk of change missing from the story. He kept yelling saying I told you what I bought! And I kept coming back with the numbers. I told him I'd go into tht same gas station and buy all of that just to prove it. He still is sticking to his story and idk what to think.

 I told him idc what he spent it on it has nothing to do with the money. It has everything to do with lying. Acting like always saying ""idk"" is an acceptable answer and brushing it off like I always do. The one time I noticed and dug deep.

 Still don't have answers and I'm assuming he spent it on his phone for snap premium or some other dirty stuff ugh. But he keeps saying he didn't. Doesn't make any sense. Idk ... Just tired of feeling so disrespected. I'm not even worth the truth and that hurts .

 I should also add that we have a newborn and a 3 year old together. Some of the things I've found on his phone in the past year make me feel like I've been punched in the stomach. Male4male Craigslist ads asking to meet up and make glory holes and bottoms? (Sorry i don't understand that shit) countless dirty Snapchats from random girls, MeetMe accounts. Phone sex ads , MeetMe account under a totally different name.

 I've asked him calmly multiple times about the male for male stuff and he gets SO MAD. And just avoids it completely . I still never get answers about anything I've ever found. It hurts so much. I just don't get it bcuz i never reject him for sex . I work and make good money, I cook, i clean, im a pretty fun person to be around if I'm tooting my own horn here. 

I just don't get it. And leaving is on my mind but 6 years and all the good is what i keep holding unto. Everything thinks we're the happiest perfect family because I don't spread our problems. But I've been hurting for so long and I'm starting to just be used to it. He acts so happy with me usually and then lives this double life. Help...plz.

111,"This is a rewrite of what I just finished writing. It was a lot so I erased the backstory (but if anyone wants that info I can make a separate post.. somewhere?)

Basically, my mom has been with this verbally abusive man for more than a year now. My mom's never been known to yell or argue, but he LOVES to. So he constantly gets in her face and yells over the tiniest things (she's cooking dinner and he's angry because he's trying to sleep on the couch, etc). He's using her for her money, but since he got her into some debt, she has to rely on him until she can get out of it, hence why we are all still stuck together.

He hates me and talks badly about me to my mom, despite me being far from a bad person.

I graduated among top of my class in high school, I am going to business school, I bought my own car, I have a perfect GPA... I don't do drugs, I don't drink, I don't even cuss!

His issue with me arose from the time I kicked him out of our house while we were in the process of moving (we had to leave because he pulled a gun on some drunk college kids in our apartment complex because they were close to his vehicle and the cops were called). This was after months of them fighting over small things and me being so angry listening to him disrespect my mother like that. All I said was they should break up and stay apart, and then eventually kicking him out after he starts telling me I know nothing about ""love,"" and am just a dumb little kid (I was 19 at the time and am still in a healthy relationship).

&amp;#x200B;

So now, on to the story. Sort of.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I'll explain the layout of my house. As soon as you walk in, there is a light switch. to the right are the bedrooms and my bathroom, to the left is the living room and dining room, along with the sliding glass doors between them, and the kitchen farther back.

The night before, I went to the backdoor to let my dog out, and had turned on the living room and restroom light as well since I was going to shower after. My dog didn't come, so as I went to get him, I noticed A had turned off the bathroom light. I noticed he had also turned off the living room light and was planning on sleeping on the couch like usual.

So as not to be RUDE, I turned on the dining room light and backyard light. This meant walking back to my room in the dark. Whatever. I immediately turned on the hallway and bathroom light, then went to grab my clothes for my shower. As I come out, I see him turning them off and walking back.

At this point, I was annoyed and told him I was using them, so do not turn them off. Of course, once I got out of the shower I noticed he had turned off the hallway light (mind you, he doesn't pay any bills except a part of the rent, and previously my mom had complained about the house being dark and for him to stop turning off the lights).

&amp;#x200B;

So, the following day is when everything blows up.

I get home, the house is dark, he's in the backyard barbecuing and taking a break from laying on the couch watching TV. I turned on the front door light so I could lock the door, and (yes, out of spite) I turned on the living room light, but also the hallway light since it's always so dark going to my room. From inside my room I hear him come inside and say ""You're gonna get it now.""

I was confused at first. I thought he was threatening the cat like he always did, but then I hear him go outside and come back, and he began messing with the hallway light. My mom came out to ask what he was doing and demand to know why he was getting to upset over a light.

He goes into a rant about how I'm doing it to annoy him and I always do things like this. At this point, he had been bad mouthing me to my mom for months. VERY angry, I come out of my room to defend myself. This grown man constantly says horrible things to my and makes me out to be such an awful person. Aside from me being a legal adult (I'm 20!!) he acts as if I'm doing drugs, stealing money, lying, sleeping around, etc. I don't even skip class! Ever!

So as I step out, I completely explode. I have never raised my voice or yelled at anyone, but I was just so fed up and done with all the anger and hurt I had bottled up for more than a year because of him.

He always starts fights and yells, but that day I learned that I can yell so much louder than him.

I screamed at him. I demanded to know why he treats me so awfully when I literally do nothing to him and avoid him as much as possible. I'm either at school, in my room, or staying away from him at my boyfriend's house. I was so angry, but I demanded to know what he wants from me. I said things along the lines of:

What do you want from me?! I do what you say, but if I  make a mistake, I'm sorry. I don't do it on purpose like you think. I don't care about you. I leave (to my bf's) to get away from you. You act like I do drugs, steal, lie. I go to school, I get A's.

My mom was holding me back, hugging me. I was so angry I was crying. But he just moved the conversation to things from the past. He even told me if it wasn't for me getting involved in their fight during the move, this wouldn't be happening. ""But you had to get into our business."" I demanded to ask what he thought would happen with him fighting with my mom and constantly bringing her down and calling her stupid. What did he expect, really?

He also said, ""I don't want to be your dad, your step-dad, or your friend."" Yeah, as if I ever wanted/would ever want any of those things from him.

Eventually he turned the attention to my mom and all the things wrong with her. He loves to point his fingers and get in her face. His favorite line is, ""It's YOU. YOU do this."" He even tried turning me against my mom by saying she complains about me! Hello! I am her daughter!! We complain about each other!! But we still love each other and mean nothing by it!

He kept leaving the hallway we were all arguing in, then coming back to add something. After he finally left to a different room, I clutched my mother sobbing quietly before retreating to my room to cry.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, a day later, he acts as if everything is fine! He's back to driving in my mom's car instead of taking his motorcycle, and is sleeping in her room instead of on the couch (as much). I don't care if he feels better after yelling at a 20 year old petite girl for a grudge he's been holding for almost a year... I am angry and upset, and it's only 2 and a half months into the year-long lease.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I deal with all this? I've never felt so angry and upset. I've never cried for hours like that, and even now it's all I can think about. I'm so fed up. I legitimately wish he would just hurry up and die already. I've never thought that before! I've become so negative and angry, and any little thing immediately makes me annoyed. Yes, I started doing things because I knew it would make him mad (being loud in the kitchen, talking loudly, turning on lights), but I had gone months with not doing anything because why would I? And also because I knew he would just yell at my mom about it.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I cope with this? I'm already planning on getting two jobs so I can help my mom with bills, but I take 15 hours a semester and am paying for my own college. I'm always so tired and spend all my time doing homework. I've been stressed for months and it's been so hard staying strong through all this. He's just so awful, so mean. I can't do this anymore. I'm beginning to crack. All I want to do is curl up and cry. I want to run away, but I don't want to leave my mother alone with him.

A little over a year ago, I was into somebody who was very close to me. Over the summer, neither of us could drive so we texted 24/7, in the beginning of summer I told her I had feelings for her, but she said she had to think about it. The whole summer passed and we still talked all the time and go super close, she even started saying things like wanting to cuddle w me and other lovey stuff. Still then, she never said she never answered if she was into me. But finally, the day before summer ended and we could see each other, she told me she liked me too. Then she ghosted me for a few days and started dating some other guy. I confronted her and asked why she lead me on for three months, and her reasoning was that she basically used me as a back up guy incase this new guy didn’t like her back. I told her off and cut her out of my life.

(That guy cheated on her like three times, unrelated but karma exists)

I *did* get frustrated with a customer, but he was being overly rude and demanding towards me, and my co-worker at the time thought I was justified in getting slightly angry.

So here I am, confused and slightly hurt. I don’t think I’m a rude person at all, and I honestly can’t think of anything I may have done to upset or hurt anyone. As far as I remember, I’ve been perfectly polite and pleasant with all my co-workers (even shy), and I thought everything was going great up until now. I guess I need advice on how to deal with this, because it’s all very new to me. At my last job I was well-liked and I was never complained about once. I’m very perplexed at this whole situation.",28Sep2018,4
125,"I'm a chronic insomnia sufferer. Usually if I have a bad night I just tough it out, but I'm actually job hunting (behind my company's back of course), and have an interview tommorow after work that seems really promising. I want to be sharp and not show up after a long shift on 2 hours sleep. Can I call out here?",28Sep2018,1
126,"I posted about this a few days ago, but ended up deleting the post because I wanted to mull it over for a while longer before going for advice.

I live in a college apartment with four other people. We're all seniors, and all of us are very close friends. One of these roommates is a girl who I have had feelings for since last December. In the time I've spent with her, those feelings have only grown. She's very affectionate and sweet, and likes to cuddle with me and kiss me on the head/hand/cheek, and hold hands with me while we walk places. I'm pretty sure she likes me too.

Now, I know that dating a roommate is generally a bad idea. I have a quick defense for it. She and I have been close since long before we were roommates, and I have a good feeling about her. Even if the relationship didn't last forever, it probably wouldn't fall apart in a couple weeks, and it would end civilly, as she and I are nonconfrontational people who rarely start drama-- rather, we abhor it. Another thing to note is that we're seniors, and will be graduating in May, so we won't be living in the apartment for long. And we don't share a room, just the apartment. She and her best friend live in the room on one side, and I live on the other side with two other friends. If we needed space away from each other, we could get it easily.

But yeah, maybe I'm just being too optimistic. Another option is to wait until we graduate, THEN pursue her. That sounds kind of stressful, but doable. I'm good at waiting, but I'm afraid that she'll find someone else by then.

Should I go for it, or should I wait? And if I do wait, do you think it would be wise to talk to her about it (tell her how I feel, and that I'm wary of dating while rooming together, asking if she'd be okay with waiting until after graduation) or should I just leave it alone? I don't want to ""just get over her."" I really like this girl, and I'm so scared of messing this up.

Tl;dr Yes dating a roommate is bad, but could this work anyway? If not, what should I do?",28Sep2018,1

Without a car, it's 3 buses and an hour (20 minutes driving) to get there while the other place is 30 minutes and 1 bus (or a 5 minute car ride or 20 minute walk). Did I mention that this is a cannabis dispensary in a slightly ghetto side of town and that I'm a tiny women without much street experience? It's not even safe to walk to the car at night forget waiting at a bus stop (when it's 12:30 am after a late close). My co workers who don't drive have talked about street or bus harassment they experience, especially if people see that they work at a cannabis dispensary (we also just kicked out one of our regulars for being hostile and inappropriate to the female staff, no way hell do I want to sit at a bus stop with that). 

I just got settled into this supervisor promotion and now that my car is really on cusp of being un-drivable (it needs a $2500 battery btw) and the reality of the crack head bus stops looms nearer I'm having a hard time staying as long as I'd like to.

132,"Okay! So. I've posted about this in r/relationships before but deleted that one after everything happened and just went on with my life but there's new development and here I am turning to the internet once more. 

I (21F) had a thing with a guy (24M) in college and while we both liked each other, we'd insta message literally everyday, all day. We didn't date (for outside reasons that aren't necessarily pertinent to this story) and one day he just dropped off and didn't like me anymore and me, an anxious egg of a person, was very uhhhh let's say hurt and kinda shattered by that because I already have self esteem issues and that just. Was terrible. I acted weird about it because I am awkward and cringey and I admit that. But got past that, didn't talk to him for a bit, after a while he'd try to talk to me by sending me memes and I just decided to not burn the bridge and we became friends again, and talked a bunch again but not like before. I still had feelings, I was confused by the way he'd act with me, and he had become more sexual with me (i am like a target for sexual activity lol because i am very open with these kinds of things) and I let it happen because I'm a pathetic human. We fooled around a few times. Anyways. From the beginning he would always have moments of being kind of an asshole to me but because he was just doing it to me I looked past it (again, pathetic, i know) 
But during the time we were getting to know each other, he was becoming good friends with another girl. I didn't have a problem with that but they seemed very close very quick and I just told him early on if he had feelings for her to not flirt with me (because i knew he'd choose her over me. Ah, pathetic once more) 
Flash forward to one random week in july when he was on and off talking because he was staying at above girls place with her roommates. At this point i was just like whatever, I'm not expecting a relationship out of this (even if I still was a bit attached. I get attached to people when they show me any kind of attention and he gave me a LOT in the beginning so it was tough for me to break away) we're just being sexual and that's alright then he tells me they want to a party or something and he fucked someone on a bunk bed. I told him I had no interest hearing about that, and he stopped talking about it. I of course began to overthink about it, was it a rando? Or was it her? Anyways, once he got back home he messaged me again and we memed a bit, then he sent me a picture of his cum in the aforementioned girls hair. At first honestly I laughed at it. I didn't respond. But then i went to the bathroom and woke up a bit more (it was morning) and I just started crying. It was something I already knew was happening, but just that confirmation and him sending that to me knowing how I felt and being so heartless about it was what hurt a lot. I responded questioning why he would send that if 1. i didn't even want to hear about the fucking and 2. I still had feelings and 3. She didn't know he was sending that. I told him i wasn't going to talk to him for a while, and that was that. The next day (after writing about this in r/relationships, lol) i blocked him and I told her about it because I thought it was shitty he would send a picture like that without her knowing (and who else does he send pictures of her to?) 
She very obviously didn't know, and we talked a short bit about what happened, she apologized for him, i told her he disrespected us both, and then we stopped talking. She unfollowed him and that was that. Now it was time to try and get the whole situation out of my mind. That took a while. It still sparks in my mind sometimes, but certainly not as frequently. 

Now, here's the tl;dr ish part. The girl whose hair he came in and sent a picture of to me is seemingly """"friends"""" with him again. She posted a picture of him today (and had put him in her insta story a while ago) and it legit made me sick to my stomach. And I have been questioning for a while unfollowing her, for my own sanity. I know it's my choice and I'm not forced to follow anyone, but I guess I just wanted to hear opinions on the matter. Thanks if you read (or at least skimmed) this far. And yes this is a throwaway account because he knows I use reddit and I don't know if he'd see my posts lol just making sure even though he probably wouldnt. ",28Sep2018,1

135,"I feel as though I am an adult but at the same time very much like a child. I wasn't granted a standard childhood, I took care of my family first. Always. That went for my friends as well, I've always wanted those around me who I care about to be taken care of. It doesn't matter what it costs me because they're worth it.

That is my greatest blessing as a person I feel, I feel like that's who I really am and want to be, able to help those I care about succeed. The issue that comes with that mindset is that I never feel as though I'm good enough. 

I constantly feel inferior to those around me and value their happiness over my own. Very rarely I will decide to make myself a priority, but that never lasts. There's always a family member, friend, random uncle I havent heard from in years, there to snap me back into the same mode I've been in for most of my life. It affects my relationships both socially and romantically. 

I feel like that somewhere at the very center of my being, something is wrong. It can't be normal to feel like everyone is above you and you are merely honored to know and associate with them. 

I've never really done this sort of thing so here's my first. ",28Sep2018,2
136,"I know this doesn’t relate to academics but I was curious if anyone had any information on this. 

I’m a first year living on campus at a local CSU. Before moving in, I told my parents that I felt like living in the dorms was a bad idea and that I wouldn’t be happy. They persisted, along with my older sister, that this would provide me with the “college experience” which I understood so I applied for the full year for housing. 

5 weeks in and I absolutely hate it. I’m a social person, I’m on a sports team, and I have friends so it’s not that aspect. I’m someone who needs their space, regardless of who I’m with and I have generalized anxiety disorder so the whole environment just isn’t working. 

My roommate isn’t the problem. We’re friends but the other day, I walked in on her with a guy, even after having the agreement we’d let each other know when people would be over. This made me feel some resentment toward her, even though I know she didn’t mean any harm. 

I also simply don’t relate to anyone in the residence halls. All of my friends are older,  ranging from 20-25 (I’m 18). I feel like I matured quickly (not necessarily a good thing) and I’m just not interested in running wild every night, like most of the people on my floor are and I believe that’s in part to me having a lot of freedom in high school. 

So basically, I’m asking if anyone has had any experience with leaving their housing contract early. I don’t plan on leaving before the semester but I’d really rather not come back for spring 2019. I understand that there would be fees but it’s honestly made me miserable. 

I’m also eternally grateful to even have this opportunity and recognize my privilege. I just don’t think it’s good for my mental health. Thanks for any help.

138,"Background information:
I'm currently in Grade 12 and have started deciding on University Apps. I'm from a Preppy Canadian Private School with a mediocre Grade 11 Average at 86. I had a very early midlife crisis and dropped out of Physics 11 and couldn't make myself take Chemistry 12. I have what I would consider decent amount of extracurricular activities but nothing over the top like National Team or anything. 

Since I can't do Science at most schools anymore, I've decided to go into Business. However, I've heard that my average isn't high enough for any Canadian School like ""Rotman"" or ""Sauder"". Should I forget about trying to get into Business straight up and instead opt to transfer in second year?

In that case, what programs are worth taking for the first year?
How do University courses work? Do I still go with 8 Courses a year via 4 per semester? 

I know this seems very broad but I'm pretty much at the end of my rope as I have no clue what I'm doing and my university counselors practically don't exist.",28Sep2018,1
139," 

I made a whole throwaway for this, because I am embarrassed and also a little paranoid. But I feel really frustrated and stressed right now. The trigger today was that I just suck at phone calls. The first time I made one (a call to a doctor's office), I didn't even give my name. It's a year or so later, and I've hardly made any phone calls since. The problem is, now my dad has been trying to get me to make an appointment for a lesson. Whenever I tell him that I don't know how to make phone calls, he says, ""Well, you have to learn eventually, you know,"" and I know he's right, but how do I learn? Is this some kind of innate knowledge? Whenever something like this happens I just get really frustrated. 

I'm not using to making or receiving calls at all. I hardly contact anyone, even my friends because another problem is I struggle socially sometimes and never make plans outside of school. Anyway, my phone is always on silent. This turned out to be a problem, seeing as the instructor is trying to get into contact with me. I didn't even anticipate that I'd have to have a phone conversation with this person, but duh, I guess. I have enough trouble leaving a voicemail, so how will I be able to have a live conversation?

When I left a voicemail, I really wasn't sure what to say. I ending up saying something really vague. And then it started saying, ""if you are finished with you message, blah blah blah,"" so I freaked out a little and just ended it. Now, a call will be coming in the next few days, and I don't know what to do. I'm not available all the time in the first place, although I think they realize I'm in school. Missing the call is part of the problem, but having to have a phone conversation is the other part. 

And then I think about all this, and I feel like I'll never be able to leave my house/parents. Many of my peers are wholeheartedly motivated to get their drivers' licenses, or have them already. I'd assume most don't cry over feeling like a failure after a phone call. My grades are good, but that's about it. I've done no volunteering because I overthink that too. I have one extracurricular activity. I study and surf the web. Most of my texts relate to school. My friends don't even know about my interests because I don't want them to think I'm weird. I wouldn't tell my friend who I liked even though she kept asking for months back in middle school, since I was afraid she'd tell someone. 

I feel like I always use that I don't know how to do something as an excuse, like I'm whining. I think I'm afraid of failure and ridicule. Maybe I have to suck it up, but I don't know if I can. I'm not brave and get upset easily. But I have to hide it. I've cried more this year than any year that I remember, and it's always alone. I know this sounds like some rambling, stupid, over-dramatic teenage angst. Is this inner turmoil really normal? I just don't know what to do, because things ended up this way. On one hand, through examining myself I've found some things that I kind of don't like. However, I feel like all I do is look inward and never try to look at the whole world around me. ",28Sep2018,1

I got offered the internship a month ago, it pays very scantily (300 below minimum wage) this is quite normal for the country I’m working in, but as I am not rich, it was fairly stupid to accept this. At the time of accepting, my reasoning was that I could use a small amount of inheritance money to get by and that I should be grateful for the opportunity. I kept telling myself it was opportunity of a lifetime and I was rejected for all jobs previously, so believed I had no right to be choosy. I was then told that all holiday pay etc would be deducted and that I had to sign up for a course which was a further 400. Some weird compulsion kept me going in spite of doubts and red flags. This low self esteem I had and a sense that I should be grateful about all I can get. Many other hiccups happened along the way, but I eventually came out. This week all my accommodation viewings pulled out and as of next week I’ll have nowhere to stay and  slowly but surely I am running out of money. I don’t know what to do.

148,"Hi all, one of my oldest friends was diagnosed as bipolar when we were in middle school, however she didn’t tell me about it until a few years ago. i do not think she is taking any medication for it, and is a bit of an alcoholic. We are both now in university, going to different schools, but we still keep in contact. When we were younger we’d argue a bit about silly things and i’d brush it off at the end of the day, but she always held onto her anger for much longer, sometimes even for months at times. I’ve never been a judgemental person so I would always just let it slide, and only when she told me she was bipolar did all the outbursts start to make sense. She can be really cruel at times and I understand that she doesn’t mean it, but she rarely/never bothers to apologize after, which makes me think that this is an unhealthy friendship. I understand her condition, as I have taken quite a few psychology courses and shadowed a psychiatrist last summer, but it seems as though she uses her bipolar as an excuse whenever she is being just flat out mean to me. Earlier today we were on the phone and she was complaining about something I had previously dealt with, and so i explained to her what I had done when I was in that situation, but she just became angry, claiming that i always acting like a know-it-all, and called me a few obscenities before she hung up. I’ll admit, her statements hurt. I definitely would not consider myself a know-it-all, and I asked my other friends what they thought and they said that I only ever offer advice if I genuinely mean well. I was not trying to belittle her, and I even explained that, but she wasn’t having any of it. I genuinely don’t know what to do, sometimes her words keep me up at night and it effects my mental health, but I don’t want to be a bad friend and drop her completely. if anyone else has had experiences similar to mine that they’d be willing to share it would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve been to multiple doctors to try to find the cause, and all of them just say it’s psychological because of my age and try to put me on ED medication. I don’t want to take Cialis consistently for the rest of my life. I’ve tried it, and it’s a world of difference when I use it, but I want to find out what’s really wrong.

Idk if I caused myself nerve damage somewhere playing sports, whether it’s a sign of a more serious illness etc. I was wondering if you guys knew some of the biggest medical reasons why an erection won’t happen, but with medication it does. I’m not exactly sure how Cialis works but I just know without it, there’s no sign of an erection happening with a woman. Even when trying to watch porn (which I don’t do much) it’s quite weak. And for years I was perfectly fine before all of this.",28Sep2018,0

He works a job now that he dislikes and doesn't really know what he wants to do with his life, even at 25. I told him once I get a job he can quit and do whatever he wants. Get a trade, go to school, pick up a craft, whatever, I just want him to feel fulfilled with what he does. We have toyed with the idea that if we have kids, or even if we don't, he can be a stay at home husband. We think that he'd actually like it, he's a guy who finds stuff to do to keep himself busy.

157,"My roommate and really good friend has a habit of doing really late night runs.  We live in a pretty dark residential neighborhood.  She's a young attractive female.  Usually she's gone for 90-120 minutes.  But tonight she was gone for three and a half hours.  She has work in the morning and its unusual for her to be gone this long.  She wasn't picking up her phone or responding to messages.

She is ok.  She finally got back to me that she went to a friend's.  I don't really care where she went as long as she's ok, but we do have a bit of a history of her not wanting to feel checked in on by people, and me worrying.  I guess she'll be upset I blew up her phone.  My question is, is it reasonable for me to ask her for a heads up if she goes out running late and ends up going somewhere?  I don't need her to tell me where she is or who she is with or anything like that, but just a text saying she's not coming home.  I expect her to be upset if I ask her to give me a heads up next time.  Am I being unreasonable?",28Sep2018,0
158,"Dear Reddit,

How do you remain friends with co-workers with superior titles both during and outside of work? I have a co-worker who is one of my closest friends outside of work, however we tend to butt heads at work and it is making it difficult to remain on good terms while on the job. This is unfortunate because I thought everything was fine, until it was brought to my attention (by someone else) that they had a problem with me. This led to my supervisors having a meeting with me and discussing my co-workers concerns, instead of my friend simply confronting me on what they had an issue with. We both apologized in a teary hug, but I still feel uneasy about the whole thing. I guess I ultimately want to know how others have harmoniously worked alongside friends with superior titles (i.e. Doctors, Pharmacists, etc.). Any insight would be helpful. I really do not want to lose this friendship. Thank you.

PS. We are both Taurus signs. Stubborn and non-confrontational afffffff :)  ",28Sep2018,1

160,"I’m 18, from Dallas, Texas, and just graduated high school about four months ago. I decided I was going to take a gap year to work before going to community college, and catch up on things that I hadn’t gotten the chance to do.

I want to do graphic design, or writing, or photography. Something creative. I want to help others while also expressing myself in my work. I want to contribute something from my creativity.

I spent the summer winding down and looking at what work I may want to do for a year, and I started looking into retail. I couldn’t get a job anywhere for shit. Four job interviews at Best Buy, two at Target, One set of interviews at the UPS Store, and I’m probably just going to have to go back to working at restaurants.

I find myself unable to get a job that I want still and my mom told me I’m going to have to give up and not be so picky about what I want to do. She told me that it’s silly of me to apply at Target and all of these other places, and that I should just do a nearby restaurant instead. I’m going to have to do just that, but after so much effort trying to work at the places I want to, and time after time being told no, I just feel so unmotivated. I don’t see myself as someone that can help or even do shit right. Every job interview I feel like I’m a fuck-up with no chance, even if I put the false facade of confidence up. I don’t contribute even though I want to. We’re not super well-off and mom gets by check-by-check. I just mooch off of her and other people and I’m tired of taking instead of giving.

On a different level, I’ve wanted to do so much for so long in terms of a long-term career or even just projects. I’ve dabbled with photography, video editing, captioning, freelance graphic design, making a visual novel, writing, being an author, drawing, illustrating, vectoring, making a clothing brand, or streaming, to name a few. Since I have so much free time while I try to get a job, I’ve been trying to do a few of those things both to express myself and make some money on the side. But I get repulsed with myself and my work, or I find it to be too hard, or I just run out of ideas. I can never finish anything.

When I try to be creative, I find myself unable to finish what I’ve started despite leads, ideas, and passion. I stop working on it because it just feels like it’s declining, and here I am back where I started. A few days after quitting, I’m starting something new and then getting repulsed by it.

When I try to find a job, I find myself picky, unable to land what I want, and feeling like I’m wasting everyone’s time. I get told no to everything I want and that’s the harsh reality. Getting what I want is nice, but unrealistic. I’m going to have to resort to something I don’t want to, inevitably. But if that’s the reality, then why even try? If the inevitable is settling for less, why am I trying so hard for more? I find myself back at the beginning, ready to cry and try again.

I don’t know, this is a bit more of a rant than anything. If you have any similar experiences or thoughts to contribute, that’d be nice. I’m just alone. I can’t do anything. I try to be positive and smile but when I’m in bed at night I’m crying and negative.",28Sep2018,1
161,"This is a super long story, but I'm trying to keep it short. My boyfriend Jack (M28) and me(F27) are together for 5 years. Two years ago he met another female Anne because they attended same classes in college. They became friends and played online video games together. Both at their own homes. Around 1.5 years ago, Annes relationship ended and she started to fully focus on my man Jack. 

Flirting(by both of them) , late night texting, sending selfies, ""borderline sexy-ish"" pictures, Anne tries to make him jealous, cries for attention and what more. I told him to stop, Jack said I was overly suspicious and it was just friendly banter. He said he did not have feelings for her. He always allowed me to read their texts but refused a meetup between me and Anne, because he was afraid I'd go full crazy on her.  I found out he has been to her house once to "" play video games "" and lied to me about it. He apologized but claims they did not have sex.

Some time ago, Anne befriended one of Jacks friends ; Rob. Since the time his friend Rob hangs out with Anne, Rob reacts very angry and unfriendly to Jack. As if Jack did something horrible to Anne. But this does not make sense because Anne still acts all lovey dovey sweet to Jack.

So..fast forward to September 2018. I never met or spoke to Anne until now. Jack and I are on our way and we suddenly bump into Anne on the subway. We are stuck together for 10 minutes. Anne does not make eye contact with me, stares and makes secret laughs at Jack, touches his hand ""by accident"". Very awkward and uncomfortable.

One day after this meetup, Jack asked me to sit down. He discussed the topic with his best friend Tom. Tom knows Anne a little bit. Tom opened his eyes and made him realize that Anne's behavior is not respectful towards me. Jack also told me that at the meet-up with Anne, he gave me a kiss but he saw that Anne made a nasty face when he did this. This made him think and he wants to confront her. I did not see that Anne did this.

Tomorrow he is going to force a conversation with her and asks whats going on and why she behaves like this. If she has feelings for him. This was all his idea, I did not suggest this. I asked him if he can record the convo with his phone and he agreed. So I have been suspicious about all this for 1.5 years. I have been afraid they had sex.

My question to everyone who reads this; I know you guys are not mind readers - but how big is the chance that Jack speaks the truth and did not have sex with her. If he cheated on me, why would he discuss this weird behavior of Anne with Tom? If they had sex it's pretty clear where all the behavior is coming from right. Or am I being mindfucked? If he wants to gaslight me - why bring up the weird meetup again? Why tell me that she made a nasty face after he kissed me - because I did not see it and this makes me worry. I also did not notice the hand touching by Anne, but Jack replaced his hand told me this afterwards. Is he manipulating me? 

Thank you.

TL;DR Partner had an odd relationship with a female friend, who behaves weird towards me. Is this a red flag?",28Sep2018,10
162,"I’ll make this as succinct as possible: I was fondled when I was 9, kept it secret (with the exceptions of mental health specialists and certain friends), and am now - while nearing my thirties - contemplating whether or not I should just tell my parents the truth.

It’s hard to rationalize why I kept it a secret (maybe because we’ve had some family drama that I never wanted to contribute to) and it’s hard for me to rationalize exactly why I feel like it’s necessary to be forward more than seventeen years after the fact (perhaps it’s just the current culture that rightfully commends bravery).

I suppose that a part of me never wanted my parents to feel like they were insufficient guardians but I also fear that if this detail were to leak to them, it would make them feel even worse that I went to others before I went to them.

But at the same time, I ponder about whether or not this personal detail will have them question the nature of my bisexuality (I haven’t even come out to them yet) and whether or not things will forever be strained between me and them due to me confessing that I wasn’t comfortable enough to talk about this - even as an adult.

What should I do? Should I carry on or is there an adult and calm way to be open that doesn’t invite my mother (who has anxiety/sensitivity problems) to feel worse about herself or my father to be even more disappointed in me?

163,"What i mean by this is, can I refuse something that is proposed by teachers? Like participating in an event? I know I'm being vague but I don't know how to else to ask for advice. I'm always thinking in what situations am I allowed to say no, especially in the context of school. No, I don't want to go to this event, no I don't wanna do this, because the more I think about it the more It seems like I don't have a right to refuse because everything that is proposed by school is mandatory, isn't it? Like there is this 'baptizing kids into high schoolers' thing going on today and all freshman classes are going to have to think something to introduce themselves and my class is going to have to sing in front of the whole school. Also this baptism involves doing a task, thought up by seniors which can potentially include being egged. I am skipping today in fear that my homeroom teacher will force me to go to this event. 

The plan was to go to school today, be in all classes, and then call mom to pick me up and leave before the event starts but I would probably have had to meet with my homeroom teacher and tell her that I'm leaving but her probable reaction just shoned me away from going to school at all. I just didn't want to deal with her because she is just that type of person. Also the school accepts only 6 days of parent justified absences, so I already wasted one today.",28Sep2018,2

165,"As the title says, my family is always on the verge of snapping, its been like this for as long as I can remember, and I've only recently realized that its not normal. My sister and dad are the worst of the two, my sister snapping more frequently but my dad being far more aggressive. Without even noticing it I've learned to always stay calm around them to avoid conflict. When I have to ask about something, I keep a calm tone and make sure I word everything carefully, but that still isn't enough. An example of this happened last night when we were making dinner, I have some ceramic pieces I made in highschool, some of which I'm proud of. Today I noticed there were some rocks on one of them, my sister collects rocks so I asked her in my calm tone ""Did you put rocks on my ceramics piece?"" She replied by snapping and saying that they were my moms, and how they were trilobite fossils, not just rocks. Not only changing the subject but deflecting it altogether, and pointing out that I was wrong about something. Its been this way for as long as I can remember and I don't know what to do. Both my parents come from narcissistic families, one of which was heavily abusive, the other manipulative. Moving out isn't an option and I've never been good with confrontation, so talking to them about it isn't a great option either. My Dad also used to be slightly abusive, I remember him slapping my sister and I a couple times but he hasn't done that in around 10 years.

166,"Earlier tonight (~11:00 PM PST) I was in a local shopping center with my friend in my car after getting some food. When I dropped him off to where he was parked, a van cut across the parking lot and stopped behind our cars. I started to exit the shopping center via a 4 way stop. The van clearly had the right of way and I was waiting for him to go, he didn’t move so I assumed he was waiting for me. I went ahead, gave him a courtesy wave and got onto the Main Street. At this point I wasn’t at all suspicious because we were both just leaving the shopping center - pretty normal. I was going just slightly above the speed limit on my way down the street and this van was tailgating me. He easily could’ve overtaken me and gone around as there was nobody else in the other lane. At this point I was growing a little suspicious, so I wanted to test if he was following me by going around and circling back to where I initially came from (which is also the exact opposite direction of where I live, just to play it safe). I take a right from the Main Street and speed up a little bit, the van is still behind me but not as close as before. After about a mile he took a right into a neighborhood and I kept going. I reach the end of the street and take a u-turn to go back home, where I see a similar looking van going in the opposite direction. 

I’m not sure whether it was just a  coincidence or if I was being followed. Given the circumstances; it being late in the evening, the van waiting for me to go first at the 4 way stop even though he had right of way, him tailgating me, etc., it’s not difficult to imagine that I was being followed. 

Ultimately, my question is, what precautions should I take following this incident? I made sure that I wasn’t followed home, but I’m not entirely sure what to make out of this, and I may be overthinking it, but any advice would help.

169,"I have an interesting neighbor to say the least, hes an old man and lives with his even older dying father. Hes always been a strange person, but generally friendly when we've seen each other or talked. Despite his friendly personality when we talk, he plays these passive aggressive games with me and my dogs and i don't know why. He keeps his windows open throughout most the year, the only time i see them closed are during the hottest days or summer or the coldest nights in winter. This makes it extremely easy for me or my dogs to hear him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few dogs so i let them outside multiple times a day to get some sun, play and do their ""business"". But almost every morning since we moved in about 2 years ago my neighbor has made these howling noises/variations of them throughout the morning. He will start making these weird barks going ""burk burk burk burk burk"" super loudly and in a rapid succession. It usually only last for a stint of 30 mins to an hour periodically. He changes up what he yelps out , sometimes its a literal ""WEEEEWOO"" like a siren over and over or just variations of odd phrases to purposely get my dogs barking. Hes even gone to the extent of silently saying their names to try and get them to come over to the fence to make his noises at them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its fall now so i like to keep my windows open at night and in the mornings to get fresh cool air in the house, but i am getting sick and tired of these games he plays. Every morning its him purposely making my dogs bark or doing other forms of noise in the backyard like ""taking out the trash"" over 15 times a day slamming the trash lid. Its odd he does this because he also ""sicks"" his dog on mine every time they bark for over a few minutes. I assume he didn't like the barking because of that, but Ive heard him tell his dog to ""go get em"" a few times in the morning which makes the dogs have a barking battle till i bring my dogs in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine trying to sleep in on a sunday to only be waken up by your neighbor whistling and barking at 7AM like a psychopath, which i think he might potentially be, My family hasn't confronted him because my mother once got into a conversation with him after bringing him sweets for a holiday (she felt bad for him being older and without a wife), but it turned weird real quick. She said he went on a rant somehow about how he was a hitman for hire before and killed a bunch of people in the war and thats what he was good at, like weird shit. My mom bailed and none of us have talked to him much since, i am not sure if hes delusional or a potential veteran. 

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing hes unstable i am afraid of a bad confrontation with him if i mention it and think he might just have some serious mental issues he can't help. What do you guys think i should do about this situation? All i know is im fucking tired of hearing 20 ""WEEEEEEEWWOOOOOOOO"" in the morning

180,"After 4 months of asking, my (31f) partner (38m) of almost 5 years agreed to find a couples therapist. He wasn't necessarily resistant before but a year ago we relocated to the country where he grew up and where I am not comfortable with the language so he was going to go through his personal therapist to get a recommendation for a good English speaking couples therapist. Well, we finally found one and hopefully will begin next week. 

We have a mostly good relationship (and are expecting our first child in December). We have the same goals and values, pretty good communication and a lot of love, but there are some pretty big underlying issues. In a nutshell, I am sensitive and emotional, and he is judgemental and controlling (not just with me.. just in general) and it leaves us with certain needs not being met. We talk about these issues frequently but we talk in circles and really just need someone else there to help us objectively. 

For years I have been fantasizing about someone else hearing the issues I have with him and listening to someone else tell him what I've been telling him this whole time.

My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for a year and a half and have been long-distance for a year. I don’t think we were together long enough before going long-distance as we were only physically together for 6 months before he had to go back to his home country. Pretty soon after he left, I started thinking about my ex a lot. I thought this was because I never got the closure I needed. However, soon after giving up on that avenue (4 months), I developed another infatuation for a guy which lasted 3 months until I found out he was gay. For the year we’ve been apart, I’ve been crushing on other guys for 7 months out of 12. I haven’t acted on any of these infatuations. However, at this point, I feel like the relationship isn’t even worth it because the feelings are gone and I feel like I’ll just look for another guy to idealize to fill the void. 

He wants me to move in with him in two and a half months, but I’m feeling really conflicted. I don’t want to move to another state for someone I’m not crazy about, but this moment is what we’ve been working toward for the past year. If the issue is just the distance, we can move in together and live happily ever after yada yada yada. If the feelings are gone and there’s no chance of reclaiming them, I’m just putting myself into a much more complicated situation by making the choice to start living together.

183,"she is only 17 &amp; has already been giving oral sex to guys around 20-25 year olds. basically, a guy dms her on instagram, they exchange numbers, be a couple, get intimate &amp; then gets dumped. it’s always her who’s getting dumped &amp; not the other way around, &amp; usually happens after intimacy. 

she’s doing bad in school, academically. she’s failing every subject &amp; doesn’t plan on to change herself. she even stated that she doesn’t want to further her studies. 

i tried advising her that the guys who dated her were all in it for lust but she denies it, even when the guy’s intention was as clear as day. after the usual fuck-and-break up, she’d rant to her girl friends about how the guy is a dick to her &amp; what not. i personally reached out to her &amp; told her that they were all in it for her body, they never really loved her to some extent. she denies it every single time. 

yesterday, she was absent. she facetimed me around 11pm &amp; showed me her hickeys. i felt my heart sank. i knew what happened to her. i knew she had sex. i then asked her if she had sex, &amp; she proudly said yes. i asked if they used protection &amp; she said no. i was devastated. i told her that the chances of being pregnant is relatively high even though he pulled out. she denies it yet again. i told her that she could get stds, again she denies it. 

sex isnt as common here in my country compared with other countries. how do i talk to her about this? how do i talk to her without having her to deny everything i said? i can’t just leave her be. she’s my friend for 5 years, i can’t just let her become a cum dumpster.

184,"I realize and have been told by many that the only person who can make that decision is me, but maybe you all have some other answers.

I’m almost 30 years old, and for whatever reason I am just tired of school. Simply having a job would be okay for me, but perhaps I am settling? I’ve been doing different areas of school my whole life, such as music, art, and writing, pharmacy, and most recently nursing. I keep trying to force things because everyone says I need a bachelor’s degree. Let me be clear and say I have an associate’s degree in transfer studies—one of those degrees to go to a university with to finish up with a bachelors. I guess I am just fed up with trying to make something work. Nursing was going to be my saving grace since my community college offered a fasts program and I’d come out making good money (without a bachelors even), however I’ve come to realize that it wasn’t what I wanted. This cycle was a continuation from past ideas too. 

I have 9 years experience working in pharmacy and can usually use that to my advantage to get a job, which has been helpful. Anyway, because of that I have someone able to get me into a hospital pharmacy tech position, which is awesome! They’d likely pay around $18-20/hour. To me that seems like a good deal, and evidently there is room to grow. However, should I truly forsake a bachelors in order to just simply work as a pharmacy tech and hope I advance one day? Otherwise, my options are thin. I’m not a very committed person when it comes to school, but I would like a degree because I know it will help me advance. But from past experience, I know that trying to rush a degree has not worked. My friends keep telling me to do graphic design and work for a big company when I get out, which sounds nice when you look at a GD’s salary (30-60k/year). I just feel like tuition cost and such at a university is bogus, and like I am scared to commit because it could be a waste of money like before. That and my other fear is not having enough money when I’m older. Could $20/hour sustain me? Any help will do. Thank you in advance.",28Sep2018,1
185,"So this started 3 weeks ago, a strange man has been coming to my boyfriends building (atleast once a week) asking the reception/porter at the front desk if the person/s living in flat 8 are in or when they will be back. Flat 8 is my boyfriend's apartment which I had recently been staying in while he was out of town for a whole month (and while I was in between moving). I moved into my own flat a few days ago, which is basically good timing in terms of my safety, because the same man came back a night after I had left- but now he was fed up with having no access to the apartment because of the porter not allowing him up. After denying him- the stranger waited till he finished his shift and beat him up so bad he was hospitalised.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend called me and told me what had happened and we were both in shock. I was so frightened to hear what had happened as the porter is a good friend of ours and he was defending us and all residents' safety. We were both aware someone had come to the building asking questions to the porter previously we just didn't think it was of any concern.

As of yesterday, The police found the man and arrested him, we are aware of his name and a lot of details about him personally but theres absolutely zero ties to us. His phone was searched and in the phone, was a picture of my boyfriend and his phone number in a photo- not saved in the contacts which was extremely weird. This has me now realising its targeted but what crime was meant to happen?- I'm very unsure of, I feel the person was definitely hired by a third party and he was very amateur (he got caught in under 36hours) and was found at an airport trying to leave town.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriends family are aware and have advised him to not go back to his apartment, but I'm now feeling so paranoid being alone in the city and I'm just on edge because its somewhat bothered me that theres obviously someone out there trying to hurt my boyfriend and possibly could have hurt me too. What I keep trying to figure out is what type of person would do this? is it money motivated/potential robbery? business deal gone bad? or something personal? I have a feeling its a personal vendetta but we can't think of anyone who would want to do anything like this.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend asked me recently if I had any enemies and I said no of course not, I asked him the same and he said no too. The only person who has bothered us in the past is an ex-boyfriend and he lives overseas so I just wouldn't have a clue why that would be associated in recent times and my boyfriend said he only had one acquaintance / ex-friend that he had troubles with in the past but would think that an altercation from 5 years ago would have zero basis now.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what baffles me, what potentially was this person ordered to do? I'm very on edge and can't sleep much at all ..I'm so extremely paranoid. I want to know your opinion, if you were a criminal and could plan to hire someone and have these circumstances happen- what would your motive be? what would you be looking to get out of this- scare someone? simply hurt someone or worse? I want to get to the bottom of it so my boyfriend and I can just be at peace and he can come home to his apartment. This is absolutely mind twisting because we simply have no idea what a possible motive would be- therefore we don't know who is doing this.",28Sep2018,6

I would also like advice on if I could've handled it differently.
For a bit of background, I'm a very sick lass. My lungs are crippled with Emphysema (21 years old and still no one knows why or how), and I have immune issues.

Now, my immune issues basically means my immune system is basically shot. I can get a flu vaccine, but I don't make antibodies to any other vaccines. Not even pneumonia. A single cold can send me to the hospital for at least a week, due to my immunities (or lack thereof) combined with my lung issues.
I have had the vaccines that my body responds to. But even the flu shot doesn't make one fully immune.

Due to the current state of my lungs, it's a 95% chance that I would NOT survive, if I contracted the flu.
----------
Now here's where my title comes into play

I have some neighbours in the apartment near mine. A mother and her child. Kid's maybe about 6 years old or so.. I can't tell, cause I was going only by looks. Generally nice folk, if a bit raucous at times. Anyway, her son really liked dogs, and had seen mine on my balcony one day when they were arriving home. Apparently he spoke to his mum and.. well, eventually, that led them to my door.

They asked if they could visit to let him see and play with the dog. Mind you, at the time, she was being very polite and cordial with me.
 Normally, I am a very, very reclusive person. We're talking about 'I only go out maybe once or twice a month' reclusive (going on a 5 minute walk to my mailbox at near the apartment lease office doesn't count). However, to a point, I've a softspot for children.

I had to consider the question very carefully, given my immunity issues, but also due to the fact that I didn't want to disappoint her son. So I started relatively simple;

I asked her if either of them had been sick recently. She mentioned he had the flu, but is almost fully recovered. 
Red flag #1.
Then I asked why he had gotten the flu, and asked if he had his vaccine. She said no, that she doesn't believe in vaccines and that they could be dangerous.
Red flag #2.

I  then tried to explain to her, calmly, that I cannot and will not let them in my house. Ever. Unless they're BOTH vaccinated. Well.. she didn't take that very well. Even after I explained to her my immune issues, she basically said 'We're your neighbours, you're supposed to be nice to us!'. Her son seemed more or less understanding, but she basically pointed at him and said 'Do you see how upset you've made him!?'

...Her son was just sitting there giving me a smile. Not the 'Hah, I'm giong to get my way' smile, but just this genuinely sweet,  warm smile, though I could tell he was a little disappointed.

I was forced to just close and lock the door on them both. Leaving them standing out there in front of my apartment. His mum calmed down a good ten minutes later, and they both left.

I just want to know. Was I right , or wrong for turning them away? It seems trivial, but it's been bugging me a little bit. I feel mixed on it; bad for disappointing the little boy, but good because I was.. well.. I was basically keeping my own life safe.

200,"I'm writing this to get it off my chest, I'd rather not let anyone close to me know. 

I'm  just about to finish my undergraduate degree in 2 months. I have lost all motivation. My life seemed all planned out. I'm not sure what exactly happened along the way.

I have medical school lined up right after I finish my degree, currently doing a paid internship at a big  IT company (Forbes Top 50 regarded Companies). Broke up with a loving girlfriend of 3 years.

Over the past few weeks I haven't gone to work, left without a notice, I couldn't deal with the pressure from college and work. Instead of focusing on finishing my degree, I just keep procrastinating. I feel sleepy all the time and cannot do anything. I'm starting to struggle with my degree, just passing everything. I just need to pass everything to get into medical school. My girlfriend couldn't deal with it, so she left.

I have spent hours and hours programming, ""improving myself"", constantly working to get where I am. In this process, I have lost all friends, most were too busy socialising and networking at the time.

I've started hating my passion of programming, I don't think I can handle any more programming, it feels like demeaning work. My other subjects all seem difficult and every time I try to catch up I just feel like giving up. I feel like I've blown my internship, no one has called me, I haven't received a word yet. I don't feel like waking up these days. There's nothing lined up for me.

Right now the only thing which I feel could make my life better is - if I got into med school and became a doctor. Even this idea seems to be slipping away. 

I regret not going to work, I regret not telling anyone about this. I regret spending so much time working - work which seems to have led to nothing. I regret not spending time with my friends or my girlfriend.

I feel like I've fucked up my life. I don't even know what the purpose of my life is anymore. There has been nothing that made me happy for months. Am I just a tool for society to function better? I don't know.

I keep wanting to dream in order to spend time with my friends from school and my girlfriend, I wish my life was simpler. I wish that I took my life a little easier, I wish I still lived with my parents. Maybe my life wouldn't suck.

My mind has been hazy for a while now, so please ignore grammatical errors etc. 

I know harming myself won't fix anything, I've attempted it once and decided never to do it again. =&gt;

Sleeping pills + Alcohol + cold beach. In the face of death I just laughed and realised that it was pointless, the things leading me to death were pointless.

But now I feel like life itself is pointless, so is death. Death right now sounds like a happier option.

Long story short:  
Should I still try med school? If so how can I motivate myself to study/do things I hate?

How do I deal with loneliness?

How should I deal with my internship?

How should I deal with wanting to have friends and my girlfriend?

How should I deal with suicidal thoughts?

How should I deal with the meaninglessness of life?

How should I fix my hazy mind?

201,A couple of years ago when I was about 13 my mom told me that my dad had molested my sister (his stepdaughter not that it makes it any less gross). At first I was outraged I didn’t want to see him I told my mom to kick him out and divorce him. My mom didn’t... we won’t get into the part of my mom in this post. He has always been an amazing father to me. Always there for me... my mom was constantly so absent that he filled both roles. I loved him so much still do but a part of me always kinda resented him obviously. Sometimes I’d have flashbacks of times when his behavior with my sister was a little weird. At one point when I was younger I thought he loved her more. Until I grew older and realized what was going on. I resented my sister all throughout my childhood because I didn’t always live with her. She just came out of nowhere one day and “stole” my seemingly happy existence. I look back now and to think how selfish I was just makes me sick. Some part of me still thinks maybe she lied because I don’t want to believe that my dad would do such a thing. I moved half across the country because I just wanted to escape the weird. My dad is in the hospital now due to heart problems and I just can’t bring up the courage to call him. He’s so old like 80.

209,"So, lemme get some backstory before I get into present day. Our school provided a trip to Europe over the summer which I went on. The other person here, who we'll call Aidan, also went. In the school year prior I'd already seen him and really preferred being left alone due to how he's acted. Instead of that I got roomed with him every night and it was hell. There was one point that he got into my fucking bed while I was in the shower because he thought it would be funny. Another time he left the room for absolutely no reason without telling the rest of the people in there, then came back like nothing happened. He even stole money that a kid had out because he's a piece of shit. 

So, since then the next school year had started. He was trying to get into our friend group and we had to tell him twice before he could get it, yet he still doesn't seem to care and continues to get at us.

What I find especially creepy is how I've told him directly that I don't want to have anything to do with him, and he still keeps trying to get near me. It's on the border of what feels like stalking. He'll follow me when he can, try and get near me, stand over us when we're eating.

TL;DR - gf shows all the signs of someone using cocaine. Have questioned it and she has denied it multiple times but some behaviour doesn’t add up. Is this just who she is or is she lying about drug use? How hard is it to hide a coke habit? I need advice and second opinions.

So I (21m) met this girl (20) 4 months ago and we have been in a relationship for just over 2 months. I’ve always known her as a very energetic, talkative and confident person. I’ve never tried any other drugs apart from weed which we smoke quite a lot of together.

I first thought she may be using drugs mainly cocaine, about 2 weeks ago when we were out in the city. She went to the bathroom twice when we were out that day and came back out with a boosted mood and being more talkative than normal. I did that evening ask her if she had ever tried or experimented with drugs and she denied it. I took her word for it but as time went by I started to notice more and more warning signs. If she is doing it then she is doing it in small amounts and sometimes I think she does it in front of me.

My suspicions do not all come from the fact that she was more talkative than normal one time. A lot of things have made me feel this way such as;
She’s a very sociable person and has a lot of friends who I know would partake in such activities such as snorting coke. 
She is constantly touching and wiping her nose at times. 
She doesn’t sleep or eat much but when she does eat she eats a lot of junk food in short periods of time. 
She has all her nails cut apart from her thumb and pinky nails on both hands. 
She often complains about headaches, feeling nauseous and pretty much ALWAYS wears sunglasses in a public situation. 
There has been times when I’ve seen her fidgeting in her pockets or part of her body before putting her fingers to her nose and sniffing. 
She has a very high sex drive and also loves to be massaged.
Her excitability and talkative nature is very up and down and can be stronger at times than others.

As I said before she’s a talkative and outgoing person but sometimes these things are very exaggerated and she talks non stop for 20 minutes straight. After a night at the bar she used the bathroom before we left and came out very talkative. After this we went to a fast food restaurant and during the time we were there she went into the bathroom with her purse for about 30 seconds and came back out dancing. We left shortly after and when we got back to her house I had never seen someone talk so much in my life. She was constantly bouncing her leg and moving and when we were watching a movie she just could not sit still. Itching and rubbing all over her body and in particular her nose.

I have spoke to her about all these things and expressed that it’s hard for me to not notice and think these things but despite that she swears and promises me that she’s never taken any drugs apart from weed. 
She always has justification for these signs as well. In the last 2 weeks she has used allergies, eczema and a cold as her reasoning for touching/scratching/sniffing her nose so much. 

It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I’m going insane and obsessing about the idea but it’s so hard not to when she demonstrates all these signs daily! Maybe she is just the confident talkative weird person she claims to be. I’m torn.
I love her and she says she loves me but I feel so strongly that she isn’t being completely honest with me because she knows I don’t think casual cocaine use is okay. Just thought I’d post this here with some of the reasons why I think this, just to see what other people have to say.

220,"Hello. 

I'm currently in my last year of high-school, at 17. I'm very interested in computer science and maths, and have almost perfect grades. 

I live in a pretty rough country (education-wise), Macedonia. Because of this I've always given it my all to grasp concepts a bit above the level taught in school, with varying degrees of success. 

My current plan is to go to university for Computer Science (European universities are far more advanced than the ones here, mind you) and hopefully move abroad after my 4th year to pursue a PhD in Computer Science. 

I'd love to do this, or even leave right after this last year of high-school but I'd be leaving my family consisting of my father and brother (my father is a widower). 

I can almost feel the pain I would inflict my father if I stay to live abroad, but at the same time I don't want to be set back and forever regret my decisions. 

My brother has no intentions of leaving, currently, and plans to stay and live a calmer life doing what he loves.

I should also mention that I'm homosexual, in a very backwards and unaccepting society, and simultaneously in a very religious family. 

Because of this, again, I believe that it would be more beneficial for me to go abroad and both pursue my dreams and be free to decide my sexuality.

This has been on my mind for a very long time and I don't know what to do... Part of me loves my father and wouldn't leave. But part of me hates him for not accepting basic things like sexuality. As for my brother, we can't stand each other, even in the best of days, so I won't be sorry to leave him behind.

Please, if someone has been in a similar situation or knows what to do, can you please reply? I need any guidance or advice I can get.

Thank you for reading all of this mess. Hope you have a wonderful day :) ",28Sep2018,1

230,"I don’t mind alcohol one bit, but when my husband gets too drunk, it makes me furious. He does or says annoying shit, but doesn’t remember it the next day so he doesn’t know what he’s apologizing for. It’s infuriating.

We got a little drunk last night, then went to bed. I work at 6am, so I really value my sleep. Well, after going to bed, my husband at some point got out of bed and drank more. He finished off the bottle of vodka (I only had 3.5 shots, so he basically drank a whole bottle by himself). 

When he drinks that much, he becomes incredibly inconsiderate of other people, especially me. He woke me up 4 times, on time because he drunk called our sister-in-law and needed to ask me a question about something he was supposed to keep between the two of us. He ended up telling her all about it. This HURT. We agreed that this was going to be a special thing between the two of us, and he promised not to talk to anyone about it. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. He’s ruined 2 surprise birthday parties, told other people’s secrets, and discussed MY personal business with other people. 

Among everything else last night, he left the oven on (I can’t even count how many meals he’s burned because of this), woke me up to take my covers, shattered his phone somehow, and made a huge mess on the front porch. I was already pissed enough about everything this morning, and then make it worse, as I was leaving for work I saw that he had almost finished off a case of 24 beers. This means that he drove to the gas station in the middle of the night to get more alcohol. Because he wasn’t drunk enough? 

I don’t want to paint him as a horrible person, because he’s an amazing man. I just don’t like him when he gets plastered. He doesn’t know how to control himself when he drinks and he doesn’t seem to think it’s a problem. 

How do I talk to him about this? I can’t make decisions for him or tell him he can’t drink. I also don’t want to baby him and control how much he drinks. I just feel like if he upsets me this much every single time he drinks, something needs to be done about it. I don’t even want to be around him right now because he broke my trust and made me lose so much sleep last night. I didn’t even say goodbye to him before leaving for work this morning.

I hope I’m making sense and I’m sorry this post is so long. I just needed to vent and ask for some advice on what to do. He’ll know I’m mad since I didn’t say goodbye, so how do I even bring it up without blowing up?

I am (20m) and I still live with my parents in the U.S. I have never really gotten along well with my parents and frequently have fought with them throughout the years. There were things my father did to me that honestly made me scared of him. He was the typical enforcer type dad, you mess up you get hurt or I destroy your stuff.

So a few days ago my close friends talked to me concerning the fact that I have anxiety, and needed to speak to a professional.  It has been a rough few days after I told my parents I was planning on going.

They have been trying to figure it out for themselves why I was having issues. 

I had never talked to my parents about the things they did to me when I was little. The day after, my dad would just pretend like it never happened. I have been avoiding talking to them about it for years due to being scared of repercussions. I finally decided to bring it up, because they were so confused on how I could grow up in their household and had these issues. I had three memories that haunt me the most, and those were the ones I told them.

 I'm not sure what response I was planning on getting, but I would have never guessed that they would just outright deny them like they never happened. they were standing their crying, saying they couldn't believe I would make this up about them. I confided a lot in one of my close friends, the one who first brought up that I might need help. He has helped me through a lot of these events and knows about them all. They had me questioning my own sanity until my buddy regrounded me that, yes, they did happen. 

I am not even sure what to say to my parents at this point, any advice is helpful. I still care about my parents and I know they cared about me, they just wanted the best for me but didn't know how to do it right. if you took the time to read all of this I appreciate it.

239,"There are 5 of us who are working as temps at an I.t firm. Our hours are generally 8 to 5 with a one hour lunch. So here's the issue. One of the coworkers is constantly coming into work an hour  early.

The problem with this is one of the heads (who already doesn't like us) sees that coworker and asks where the rest of us are and he replies ""they aren't here yet"". This apparently happens  constantly according to another employee who asked us why the rest of us are always late.

The firm is regrettably bad with communication so the head very likely thinks we are always late. Another issue is that coworker nags us to finish lunch early (we are a team so we are always together). The rest of us tell him ""no way"" but he keeps pestering us that eventually we give in because it's hard to relax with someone constantly saying ""okay let's go, come on guys"" every few minutes.

 I don't mind finishing lunch a couple minutes early if we're busy but the coworker inhales his food in 10 minutes and immediately starts bugging us to finish up. 

He also overreacts to minor mistakes and says ""before you all do anything ask me first"" which is absolutely ridiculous. Lastly he keeps bringing up any mistakes we do to the boss. The mistakes are always extremely minor and already fixed, there is no reason to bring them up.

I have been working at a company for about a year. There is a coworker who, one day, told me about how he doesn’t have anywhere to live in the same town as our job. (He lives about 44 minutes away). So, me being nice, told him that if he needed anything he can ask me. Mind you, we are NOT friends and barely talked to each other. 

Well, the next day he asked to sleep on my couch (at the time, he was sleeping in the lobby at our job). I said yes. We work long hours, so when we got to the house he was telling about his life, child support issues, etc. well, the house that i live at is a room for rent, and we had an extra room available. (Hopefully you can see where this is going.) 

Fast forward two months, and I’ve been driving us to work in the morning and I’m getting to the point where I’m starting to hate him. He smokes, which I don’t, so when he gets in my car there’s smoke residue. I have to alter my work plans because he needs a ride to and from work. Also, he told me that by the end of this month he’d have a car. And now, it’s a different story. 

I don’t know what to do. But I feel like I want to quit my job or move just so I can avoid him. I like driving alone because it allows me to Think and mentally prepare for the job. I like listening to my music without feeling judged for my music styles. He’s also passive aggressive and makes sly comments on how I should be driving. I’ve checked him a few times about his passive aggressiveness, but that doesn’t alleviate the issue of being a chauffeur. 

It would be different if he was family/close friend but he’s not. He’s literally a coworker who I was trying to be nice to.

Should I do it just for the sake of getting it finally done and get to this FWB thing with her cuz I don't have currently better options and it probably won't be bad (but not that good either) or wait for a more ""interesting"" opportunity?

253,"It's worth noting that I'm more than twice her age; and I'm as confused as you probably are disgusted at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to family circumstances, I'm occasionally spending time with a seemingly normal 11yo girl, a very distant relative of mine. Her and her mother are staying in the house temporarily.  Girl obviously developed a crush on me. Keeps staring at me, seeks any excuse to hug me, etc.... No big deal, I thought it was cute at first.

&amp;#x200B;

It got weird a few nights ago. We were sitting on the couch, she's watching cartoons, I'm messing with my phone. Out of nowhere she sits in my lap, missionary style (I don't know how else to call it?), facing me, puts her arms around my neck and kisses me on a cheek.

&amp;#x200B;

\-""Uh Katie, what are you doing?""

&amp;#x200B;

\-""Playing a game""

&amp;#x200B;

She managed to plant 2 more quick kisses on my cheek (getting uncomfortably close to my mouth) before I lifted her off me. She wouldn't let go of my neck at first, but eventually I managed to sit her down next to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her if she plays these games a lot. She vaguely described that she ocassionaly does with her best friend, who's a girl the same age. I honestly never played these games with my friends, but I heard girls can be much ""closer?"" with their girlfriends, eitherway I didn't prod too much further. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tell her that we should probably do something else, implying that there's more appropriate games we can play (Monopoly?). It must have came out wrong though, because without missing a beat she says:

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""What would you like me to do to you? ...Or I can kiss you again?""

&amp;#x200B;

The audacity and phrasing of the question stunned me. I never been painted into the corner with 2 false alternatives by a child. I chose 3rd option of ""We should call it a night"". She looked somewhere between sad, disappointing, and embarrassed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't decide what I should do:

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1: Tell her really sternly that this behavior is innapropriate, and she should never do that. She's very self conscious and sensitive, and I'm afraid to make her feel like she's a bad person for what she did. I once told her jokingly to tie her shoelaces properly so she doesn't trip, and she still obsessively fixes them anytime I'm around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: Talk to her mother (dad is not in a picture... I know, shocking!...). I suspect her mother will chew her out, and tell her to never bother me again. I think that would be an overreaction, that might also damage her self-esteem.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3: Try not to be alone with her anymore. Ignore her affections as much as possible. Continue to gently remove myself out of difficult situations if they arise again.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm leaning towards Option 3, since it requires minimum actions on my part. This allows me to avoid confrontation, spare her feelings, and preserve certain amount of normalcy without it getting too weird.",28Sep2018,2056
254,"So I am almost 30 years old &amp; I feel like I have no genuine friendships. Not even one.

The person I talk to everyday &amp; share everything with is my mom.

Back in college I use to have a group of 4 core girlfriends.

Recently we stopped being friends (my decision) because I felt I had grew apart from them.

I no longer drink due to health reasons &amp; for some reason they couldn't respect that.

They would still try to pressure me or constantly want to know why. 

Also I just didn't respect the way they carried themselves when we went out. They would get so sloppy &amp; I just didn't feel that was what I needed to be surrounded by.

I specifically cut off the one I was closet too because she was the main one who would get sloppy &amp; try to pressure me to drink.

I actually think she has a drinking problem. She throws up &amp; passes out every time she drinks. She also would throw up on my property &amp; act like since we were girls I should be ok with it. 

I cut her off with love &amp; compassion &amp; told her I had to love her from a distance. She acted cool - but went on a rampage deleting me from everything, turning the other girls against me, &amp; telling almost every person we've ever gossiped about what I said. 

One of the other girls in the core group works with me (I actually got her the job &amp; begged my boss to look at her resume) stopped speaking to me because the friend mentioned above doesn't anymore.

So although that hurt - I know I made the right decision. I don't need that in my life. I do miss them sometimes &amp; having people to go out &amp; dance with or just even to text. 

I also have a best friend from the 5th grade that I talk to a few times a month. She lives 2 hours away &amp; she works a lot.

However although it hurts I know deep down she only talks to me as much as she does now because her boyfriend moved across the country.

Before when they lived together I never heard from her &amp; she wouldn't even go out to lunch with me.

I think their relationship is a bit toxic so she felt the need to be in his presence at all times to ""watch"" him. 

I'll text her about going on a trip or to an event (I've stopped wasting my time at this point) &amp; she just won't respond. 

Then when I finally talk to her she's like oh I probably can't get the time off I'm going to see my boyfriend.

So I know I could never really rely on her. 

It just breaks my heart &amp; makes me feel like maybe I am the problem. 

I always see all these women with their girlfriends &amp; I get so jealous because I don't have that.

I have no one to have girl talk with, to invite over to eat pizza &amp; binge watch tv, go to the mall with, etc. 

Even though I don't drink I miss going to an event &amp; socializing with my girls &amp; dancing. Then going home &amp; cracking up about the night. 

Sometimes I just feel like the older I get the harder it will be to make a genuine connection with another group of women.

A lot of women my age are starting to get married &amp; have families. 

Sometimes I'm just so lonely &amp; sad. I literally have no one (besides my mom) that I could call &amp; ask to get lunch with.

259,"Sorry this is a long on guys. 

So about 4 months ago I started a new job working in a factory which is pretty much 98% men. 
Now I’m pretty comfortable around men, I like to have a laugh and a joke and even if the conversation was to turn a little dirty I’d still join in an have a laugh but that’s only once I know the person and feel comfortable enough to do so. 
About a month into starting the job a guy walks up to me, for the sake of this post we’ll call him Bill, and the first thing he says to me is “try smiling, you’ll look prettier if you smile” now at this point I was on my 11th shift on the run starting at 7am an was pretty tired, I politely smiled at him an said I was just tired, straight away he asked if it was because my boyfriend has been keeping me up all night, I was shocked by how forward that was and just kinda nervous laughed.  
He went on to tell me how pretty I was and how all the men here will fancy me. 

That was the start of it, he actively goes out of his way to come and find me so he can talk to me, but only when I’m on my own, he asks inappropriate questions about my relationship and constantly tells me I’m pretty all while staring at me in a way that makes me really uncomfortable, a few days ago he hinted at taking me out on a date while my boyfriend was at work... 

I’ve told a few people about this and just been told to “be careful” as it turns out he’s done this kinda thing before, but no ones actually given me any useful advice on how to handle this, I’ve told my supervisor about it but said at the moment I don’t feel it’s complaint worthy, my supervisor basically said that Bill’s brother is one of the main bosses of the company so it’s doubtful even if I did complain anything would be done, which honestly kind of frightened me. 

I’ve never given Bill any signs that I was interested in him, he knows I have a long term boyfriend and I try not to give him too much information about myself, I don’t go out of my way to talk to him but will be polite if he talks to me, I just started to take measures to avoid him best I could, until today. 

I finished work at 2.30pm and left the site with a female colleague, I noticed a car parked up and assumed it was her partner as I knew he was coming to get her, but the car started slowly driving away and my friend walked in the other direction so I thought nothing more of it, I said goodbye to my friend and started the  15 minute walk to the bus stop, I heard someone shouting my name and when I turned around Bill was there, I knew it was his day off so was a little confused, he made up some story about how he had to pop into work for something an as he was leaving he seen me, he offered me a lift home but I declined, but no wasnt good enough and he kept asking, so I told him I wasn’t going home and made up a story about meeting a friend at the bus stop, so he offered to take me to the bus stop, again I said no, over and over again, but each time he just kept saying “come on, I’m going that way anyway” I felt like I had no choice but to say yes, the path I have to walk to get to the bus stop is pretty long and surrounded by trees on both sides and there was no one else around. I felt like I had no choice, when we got to his car a realised it was the same car that was parked up earlier but had started moving on, he admitted he was gonna leave because he thought I was staying with my friend, the car ride to the shop was pretty normal, he just chatted about cats an shit (he knows I have cats) then when he pulled up at the shop he asked if he could take me out for a drink, I said that wasn’t a good idea as I have a boyfriend and his response was “well we just won’t tell him” I told him I don’t lie to my boyfriend and I’m not interested in him in that kinda way, I thanked him for the lift and got out of his car, as I walked away he shouted he wasn’t going to give up trying. 

I honestly struggled holding myself together on the bus, I’ve never felt so shaken up in my life, as soon as I got home and locked my doors I burst into tears. Im genuinely worried about leaving my house as he knows the area I live in and I honestly believe he would just drive around looking for me. 

I’m hoping the fact that I’ve said I’m not interested in him will be enough for him to lose interest but I really dont think it will.  Im not sure how I’m supposed to handle this situation. 

TLDR 
Being asked inappropriate questions about my love life by a male colleague, he waited outside work on his day off and pressured me into getting into his car then asked me out on a date, when turned down he told me he wasn’t going to give up asking. ",28Sep2018,5
260,"so basically i just moved into a large apartment complex, the smallest building in the complex has been getting its rough re-tarred for no joke 4 months.

263,"Apologies for the incoming wall of text, but I am at wits end and I don't know what to do at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

So, we bought this house nearly 3 years ago in a quiet neighborhood.  We have a young daughter and the neighborhood had a couple other kids in it and is across the road from her school, seemed like a dream.  One of our neighbors had a son just a few months younger than my daughter, so they became quick friends and frequently played together, his parents were not immediately very talkative, which is okay because we are also both introverts, but they let him come play on our jungle gym with our daughter.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then i started to notice patterns of her behavior changing with us, so I started paying much closer attention to their interactions and found he was (unknowingly) manipulating her.  He would make her do something he wanted to do (nothing horrible, just like playing superheros or something when she wanted to do something else) and when he didn't get his way, he would storm off and she would chase him, trying to get him to come back, and he would come back with a satisfied smile that he got his way.  So we had a talk with our daughter about this and how she needs to let him go if hes being this way.  Things got better for now.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the parents started inviting themselves over now while he was here.  It was always out back on our deck, so we got to know them.  At first they seemed just like any other couple, though they were kind of annoying and something was a little off, they CONSTANTLY interupted when we were speaking, so we decided that our interaction with them would be strictly in regards to our children playing together.  Over the course of time, we found that the parents had very VERY loose lips and started just pouring out their issues and secrets without invitation to do so.  We found out their relationship was indeed not perfect, but not much more than that yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I do computer repair on the side and the dad quickly started taking advantage of that.  His computer had broken and he asked me to look at it.  It was literally broken, like it was smashed.  he told me something had fallen on it since it was in an odd location in their kitchen.  i told him I couldn't fix it as the motherboard was snapped in many pieces.  I offered him one of my old boxes that had just been sitting around, so i cleaned it up, and hooked him up.  Estimated worth around $300, but I figured it was an investement.  Some time passes and they have another child and the older child (my kids playmate) starts getting aggressive, so I cut off contact between the two.  Then the couple breaks up and the man leaves, but first he stops at my door and asks if I have another computer since he will leave the previous one with the woman and kids.  I told him yes, but not free, being that I just wanted him to go away, I gave him a slightly better box (Around $500) for $100 and cut my losses just to get him away, at this point he had become SUPER annoying and imposing.

&amp;#x200B;

The next couple months, the woman and kids moved out of state to get away from him, she told me it was because he was beating her and she had gone through about 20 new phones in two years because he smashed everything and broke things constantly. She said she calls him ""Mister Domestic Abuse"" laughingly.  She's told me he beats the everloving shit out of her constantly.  During this time I learned from all our other neighbors that they were relieved this man had gone because, and I am not exaggerating, no less than 10 of the 16 homes on our street had called the police on him for one reason or another in the past 5 years that they lived here, mostly because people would be nice to him, doing things for him, then he would return the favor somehow small and then demand they owed him, and he had gotten in physical altercations with multiple people, one family even moved away to get away from him. 

&amp;#x200B;

They returned home about 6 months later, but the man was not allowed over she had said.  I saw a HUGE change in the boy, he had become so sweet and such a well mannered boy that we were always glad to have him over.  Another two months and the man came back, I'm just going to sum things up from here because I think you see a pattern if youve made it this far.  A few more break ups, a few more changes in the boy, then finally...the woman said she was done and he was never to come back.....

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next (and most recent) six months, he would come back daily and bang on the doors, front and back, yelling and screaming, knocking on all the neighbors doors (including ours) demanding to tell him where she was.  After about the third time he knocked on our door, I told him to leave us alone or I'd call the cops.  His response was to pull his coat back, revealing a gun and telling me to go ahead, and tell them to bring an ambulance because I would need them.  This whole time we were still letting the little boy play (probably stupidly)  then this event, coupled with a specific event that happened with the boy, I completely cut contact with the whole family.  The event was the kids were drawing together and our daughter was drawing you know, hearts and butterflies and such, the boys drawing was a bunch of faces with the eyes HEAVILY scribbled through and crossed out and two figures holding something.  I asked what the drawing was and he cheerfully replied ""I have an arrow and I'm shooting (daughter) in the face, and she's holding a gun and shooting (daughter) in the face!""  So that was it.  No more contact.  

&amp;#x200B;

A week ago...she finally let him back in.  The boy came over (against my wishes) one day and started crying, white as a ghost, and asked me to hide him from his dad.  Apparently the boy disobeyed and the dad ripped the Xbox out of the wall and chucked it at him, narrowly missing his head.  I saw the dad coming so, shamefully I told him to go home.  I feel so fucking bad about that, but I have my own family to protect and I'm fucking scared out of my mind.  Also, I've heard intervention can make things worse for the family of the abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I have no fucking clue what to do.  The woman is obviously not strong enough or smart enough to let him go forever.  Or scared.  She CONSTANTLY drunk/high on pills and has been this whole time, and he's fucking dangerous and has a bunch of equally dangerous friends he brings around fairly often.  What are my options?  I don't think there is any solid proof of abuse and the woman won't testify against him.  I don't know for sure if he hits the kids, I've never seen bruises, only what the oldest has said about being scared of him and throwing the xbox at him, but it's so fucking clear hes TERRIFIED.

264,"i have a low self esteem, and whenever i try to say something positive about myself, there’s always a negative thought that just brings me down. i can’t help but think i’m so useless to everyone around me. i can’t achieve the grades my parents want me to have, i can’t hold conversations with my friends for long, i’m not a particularly fun person to hang around, i can’t think positively for my boyfriend. i cry myself to sleep thinking about all of my insecurities and i hate it so much, and i l try to distract myself from the negativity but most of the time i just get back to thinking negatively again. whenever someone tells me ‘you really need braces’ or ‘you’re really are blind,’ i try not to care about what they say, but hours later, i’ll think about it again and it really brings down my mood. i know it may be a joke, but it really hits me hard. it makes me feel like i’m not good enough for this world. that i’m not smart, i’m not pretty, i’m not fit, i’m not talented, i’m not interesting.

i tried going to a therapist but it didn’t really help me. i vent to my boyfriend about my self esteem issues and it usually helps letting out my feelings, but i feel like i’m only annoying him with my stupid insecurities. he’s really the only person i feel comfortable venting to, but i can’t anymore because i’m afraid he’ll break up with me because i’m so negative about myself. honestly, i don’t even know why he would date someone like me.

i hate a lot of things about myself. i can’t even name one thing i like about myself. is that normal? i don’t really think of myself as any positive traits such as ‘helpful, loyal, kind’ etc. because i’m not. i like to think i am, but then i reflect back onto past events where i was mean and lying, so that doesn’t really make me that positive trait of being ‘kind’ or ‘loyal.’

i usually distract myself from thinking about my insecurities by watching youtube, playing games or going on instagram. although i eventually get bored of doing those things, and once again i’m back to my negative bullshit.

i’m hoping i can find advice on how i can be more positive about myself, or if they’re anymore ways i can distract myself from my low self esteem.

I'm more than capable of all this things, but no matter what I try I can't stop being a piece of garbage long enough to get the ball actually rolling on new habits, I think I'm just naturally a horrible person and that  being a ""good person"" is completely beyond me. That I will always be an incompetent moron, stumbling through everything blind and disappointing everyone around me.

I try to start a new habit. Like going to the gym everyday for example, recently I've been making it almost everyday, but when I get there I fell like I'm not doing it to my fullest extent, but I can't bring myself enough out of my comfort zone to really push myself to get the results I expect from myself.

I feel like I make a great effort, but my efforts never pay off because I'm simply not doing enough. For example I failed an exam this morning worth 15% of my grade, I maybe got 5% on it, even though I studied, even though I was there paying full attention to every lecture, I even recorded my lectures and re-read them several times each. I fell like no matter what amount of effort i put it, I NEVER get results and it's frustrating.

LIFE IS FRUSTRATING.

Every failure brings more frustration, ""Why did this happen? Will i be this incompetent forever?' and then I get frustrated that I'm getting so frustrated. It just keeps compounding, and the only way I know how to deal with it is to slack off, which just leads to me being frustrated.

I fell like I can't enjoy anything, when I'm trying to have fun I keep thinking that I'm just wasting my time, I could be doing something else to improve myself, but I can't seem to get myself to actually do the things that will improve myself.

I feel like my expectations aren't too high either, I want to be a ""good person"", these are kind of my goals:

- Not be overweight anymore, I've been at a standstill with my weight-loss for a year now, I need to get to 180lbs, but I can't seem to go below 220lbs, no matter how I try to change my diet.

- I want a 3.7 GPA, I'm probably around a 3.2 at the moment, but I can't seem to get past that boundary, no matter how much effort I put into my studies.

- I want to spend money wiser. Every week I find myself spending way too much money on bullshit I don't need, buying lunches, or drinks, or any other amount of inane bullshit. I've even tried freezing my debit card to stop myself from spending but it never works, I still keep spending too much.

- I want to make a game. I have a history in Game Design and I haven't made anything in years, I can't seem to get projects off the ground, I get bored of my projects quickly, and when I do try I can't get anything to work.

- I want to be less cynical. I am INTENSELY judgmental, I have an opinion about everything, and it often leads to thoughts like ""Look at this loser."" when I pass a homeless person on my commute, followed immediatly by ""Wow, I'm an awful person, I fucking hate myself.""

- I'm terrified of disappointing myself and others, and since I do it literally everyday of my life, everyday I'm endlessly frustrated. Disappointing somebody literally makes me break down in tears, to the point where I can't function and it will physically hurt, I've literally lost jobs and given myself nosebleeds because of this. Honestly the only reason i don't think I've turned to substance abuse is because I hate drug addicts and ""lowlifes"" with a passion, but that's just my inner asswipe talking again.

I don't know what to do.

He got my mom pregnant, she threatened to keep him out of our lives if he didn't sober up and make better decisions, he went to one session and walked out halfway through and that's where the story begins.

I was 9 when I was told that my dad isn't really my dad and that my real father was looking to get to know me. I was given the option to get to know him and meet him and I, without a doubt, accepted it. I mean.. who wouldn't want to meet their dad?

Fast forward to 11 years old. I'm over at his place with my half-brother and half-sister and we're playing on the swings. They started to make fun of me and I retaliated by calling them ""losers"" because I did not appreciate them calling me names and bullying me. I had SUPER thin skin at this time due to being an only child and not having anyone my age giving me a hard time so it was expected of me to react the way I did. My dad cut me off because of this. He didn't like that I called his kids losers and that was that.

Fast forward to 16 years old, just about to turn 17. I get a friend request from him on Facebook and I accept it right away. he messages me and asks how everything has been going and I told him everything. My parents and I weren't on good terms and he took advantage of this in trying to sway me over to him. It did work. A couple months after my birthday I had ran away and called him. He answered and I told him I want to move in with him.

***""I knew this day would come""***

I was moved in with him within the next two weeks. It was so exciting living with my dad and being around my siblings. Safe to say, it was very refreshing to have a change of scenery. Everything went fine the first 3 months but things started going downhill. I will not explain in detail what happened until I left his place to live with my mom and step-dad but it contained a lot of arguments, threats to kick my ass, and me running away (again).

I didn't talk to him again for another year.

Living with my parents didn't get any better if anything it got worse.. I dropped out of school at 12th grade due to having too many credits to make up and the fact that I didn't want to go to school anymore. Fast forward a couple months and I move to a town not even 15 minutes away from my dad's town to live with my friend. I was lazy as fuck and didn't look for a job the entire time I lived with my friend and eventually got kicked out due to being jobless and not trying to help myself (once again entitlement got the best of me) so I moved back in with my dad.

He gave me two weeks to be able to find a job or else I would be kicked out of there as well. I spent those two weeks diddling around and smoking weed with my buddies because I truly just didn't give a fuck about anything. I got kicked out of there and had to sleep in the rain on a bench and that's where I'll end this background on the subject.

I didn't talk to him for a whole six years and he has missed out on so much of my life and vice versa. I ended up messaging him yesterday stating that I will give him one last opportunity to have me in his life. I had tried to message him a few years back but got no response (I don't think he even read it) and it hurt me, deep down, that my father wanted nothing to do with me. He responded and I was fucking ***SHOCKED*** about this. We are meeting sometime next month and we will be talking, catching up, and confronting our issues with each other.

288,"Almost every time I have an issue in a relationship I’ll avoid bringing it up because I feel like I’m acting crazy or overreacting. I think this is because in regular platonic relationships I’m very relaxed and easy going, but whenever romantic feelings are involved it’s like my emotions are kicked up x10. This leads to me not knowing if I’m overreacting or if my feelings are legitimate. Talking to my friends about it does help, but I’d rather not bother them with every aspect of my relationship.

I just got my own flat, meaning I bought it so I cannot move as easily away. I'm very happy tho!

  
Except, my neighbours above me seems to have a little daughter (by hearing it through the walls while going about my day), and she's much like a stampeding elephant. I wish I could just turn on Spotify so I could simply ignore it, which I tried countless times, even turning up the volume to VERY HIGH, yet these BASS stamps of her just penetrate through anything I blast on my ears. I cannot mute it, I cannot cover it, it's impossible to ignore and after 4 weeks I'm starting to run out of patience.   


I know it's a little girl, it's not her fault, but her parents could atleast give her some comfy homeslippers or whatever or teach her to learn how to walk by not landing all her weight into her ankles but walk more towards the tip of her feet which isn't so difficult.  


I have not dealt with these people yet, they don't know me, and they also don't know that I can hear that stampede this much. I want to talk to them, but I want to hear your advice and opinion first on how I should deal with it when I go up and be like ""Hey, I'm new here, nice to meet you. Could you pay attention to your stamping daughter, because it's really getting on my nerves""? I am very irritated and frustrated, and don't want to get this started on a wrong note.

My parents are conservatives, but they're not this hateful, I know in the past i've wrote about my father like he's some sort of fiend but he's since calmed down, is less violent, and mostly keeps his beliefs to himself and when he can't it's a lot less hateful than my brother. 

My brother cannot hear the name Hillary or Obama without foaming at the mouth, he carries around this chip on his shoulder where he hates women, minorities, and cannot be reasoned with. I have given up on him as a person because he does not want to hear from me, even when i'm not talking about anything political he just launches insults my way calling me soyboy and cuck, constantly insisting that I ""Speak regular"" because I talk in a calm cool manner he thinks i'm ""trying to act like i'm better"". 

My parents want us to get along and so do I but he is consumed with hate, he cannot go one evening without lashing out at something on television, i'm on eggshells constantly because of how he is, I have to choose shows that I feel won't make any mention of anything in the world otherwise he goes on these rants that are incredibly hate filled. 

I've blocked him on Instagram but I cannot stop going to his Instagram because it's where he spews most of his hatred, it's a portal to his inner most thoughts, and when I see someone try to comment and engage him he discounts them as easily as he discounts me. 

I'm not looking for advice on how to approach him because frankly he scares me, when describing the game Wolfenstein he said it felt good to kill all the socialists, and he clenches his fists in my face when we've argued in the past so i'm actually afraid he'll hurt someone.

I'm 23, recently left the military and moved back in with my parents to go to school full time. Unfortunately, due to timing, I have to start full time at a university in the spring so I've been taking one class a semester to complete an associate's at a CC before I transfer. In the military, I had my own place with my boyfriend and my dog, and I was so happy, so much freedom. I wasn't in Virginia, the place I'd grown up and hated so much. Moving back here was so depressing. I couldn't live with my boyfriend because he had planned to get out too, but that hasn't worked out and he's still in.

I've always clashed with my parents and my brother, and my opinions are completely different than their own. It's hard living here and feeling like a black sheep.  I've always struggled with depression and being at home hasn't helped that. My parents didn't let me bring my dog and they dislike my boyfriend. I'm definitely unhappy with my situation and feel very dependent on my parents. My sister has told me I need to learn how to be independent because I don't know how to struggle. I do agree with her and I hate that I still ask my parents for money.

Everything came to head yesterday when me and my parents got into a fight about some family drama. My dad, angrily, told me to move out in 2 weeks. This was enough for me to start planning to leave. I called my sister in another state and asked her if I could move in with her. She automatically said yes and that she felt it would be a good idea for me to go to school in Ohio.

Today, my dad gave me an ultimatum. Either I stay or if I decide to move out, they won't help support me anymore. Now I have to decide;

Scenario 1: I move to Ohio and get a full time job till January, when I can start using my GI Bill. I'd help my sister pay rent, I have my own car. I'm selling my motorcycle so I'll have money before I get there. I can either go to school in Ohio or just live there till January, and move back to VA and try to get my own place. Either way, I'd be more independent. I'd also have to drop the class I'm currently in, and take a W on my transcript.

Scenario 2: Stay at home and go to school using the GI Bill. I'm not paying rent so I'll keep all the money from the Bill. I'd be closer to my boyfriend in Delaware. I know this seems like an obvious choice but is it the best one for me?

I know not everyone has parents who will let them stay home, rent free and help them pay for school.",28Sep2018,1
308,"I’m considering quitting my job as a teacher.I cracked yesterday. There are tons of things going on. Between lesson planning, preparing instructional materials, and just trying to meet administrative demands, I am drowning. The analogy I used when talking to my mom yesterday was my job is to dig a hole, and I’m the only one digging the hole. Meanwhile, there are 3 or 4 other people constantly shoveling dirt back onto the hole I’m working on. I have frustrations about my curriculum team since we always seem to be on different wavelengths. I have frustrations about admin because I have no idea how to deal with the tons of different things we’re expected to do in a timely manner. I have frustrations at home because my girlfriend, who is a first-year teacher, has been having anxiety attacks and crying as she goes through trial by fire.

The moment I cracked happened when I was sitting down at the end of the day. Mentally, I was exhausted, so I just sat down and was trying to distract myself with my phone. Then, it dawned on me I was supposed to be in a meeting at a building 30 minutes away. I got back to my room to get my stuff together, and I just started crying. I cleaned myself up and ran to my car. Halfway through the drive, I started hearing words from a previous mentor I had during my student teaching experience: “Are you sure you want to be a teacher. I’m not sure it’s right for you.” In that moment, I started sobbing.

I’ve always had a lot of self-doubt. My last year of college, I worked under a teacher for my practicum. It was a nightmare. This mentor teacher was an excellent teacher for her kids, but not for me. I felt like every mistake I made was massively scrutinized from how I spoke to how I acted to how I planned. I admit, I was not the perfect student teacher. Planning lessons and implementation has always been a major weakness of mine. I figured that the more I practiced, the better I would get. However, it felt like no matter what I turned into this mentor, it would be garbage. So, naturally, I just kept up living to that expectation in my head. By the end of that school year, I had so much anxiety about my abilities… But it was my graduation year. And it didn’t make sense to change paths at the end of the race.
I ended up getting a job at an awesome school. The first thing I did was e-mail that mentor and say I got a job. I don’t remember their reply. The first year was tumultuous, but everyone always says it’s a struggle. By the end of it all, I was happy that I had made it. People complimented me often saying that I did not act like I was a first year teacher. I was even excited for my second year. I felt I proved to myself (and to that mentor) that I CAN do this job. 

I thought things would become easier as a second year teacher, but it’s really just more of the same. Constantly working extra hours, constant anxiety about the success of my students, and mounting responsibilities that seem way beyond my pay grade (not that I was ever in this for the money). The more my girlfriend talks about all these other jobs she wants to do, the more I want to go back to school.

I think about why I became a teacher in the first place. I became a teacher because I was inspired by the people who helped me at my lowest point when I was in school. From high school to college, teachers have always had my back and helped me. I think, being on the other side of the table… it’s just a different world than I was expecting. I know I make a difference. It’s the responsibility that comes with that power that is massively overwhelming. I just don’t think I’m well adapted for the constant rush that is teaching. I don’t want to manage 100+ children on a daily basis. I don’t want to constantly take my work home with me. I don’t want to spend 10-15 extra hours per work week just to do the absolute bare minimum of my job.

I think if I quit, I’d go back to school or try to work with my current degree (B.S. in Biology). Though, I hear that a bachelor’s degree in science doesn’t get you very far if you don’t go to grad school. The thing preventing me from making a decision is the reason I’m quitting: Am I just quitting because I think the job is too hard? Why even struggle through that first year if I’m just going to stop now? Or, am I quitting because this career never really was the correct fit for me?

Let’s say I do end up quitting.  I’m not sure if I should quit ASAP, wait till the end of the first semester, or just grind out the year.

I feel like at this point, my desire to do a good job is so low that I would be depriving my kids of a good education. At the same time, my attitude these days is not conducive for a well-run class. I just can’t seem to get out of my head and the kids read my face like a book.

There’s so many questions and I have no idea where to start to even begin to make this decision.

My (now former) boss has not returned a single call or text and neither has HR. I would like for them to say that they laid me off as opposed to termination.

I cannot get unemployment and have money to cover the next six months of bills but would like to get back to working.

What can my former employer tell a new employer? If they are allowed to tell them that I was terminated and why, how can I ever recover from this? I've never been so stressed in my life. I have a wife and children.",28Sep2018,0
312,"As a kind of side hustle I loan money out with a 15% interest rate. I recently did business with someone (contract and all) and he wants to do more business with me via do jobs for me for a cut of profit. How do I nudge away from him without making things hostile. Nothing wrong with the guy but I don’t want to be partners current or future. 

For example:

 Him: “I can go pick up the money for you all you have to do is point me in a direction”

Me: “it’s not that kind of business plus I have it set up so I don’t have to go up to people”

Him: “Exactly I can do that for you, like an armored truck”

Me: “uh I don’t think you’ll ever have to do that”

Him: “we do business right? You’ll include me so we can make this money”

I said we can make money together but Not as partners but as a hey I have something that needs to be done I can’t do it can you. He’s kind of taking it to a level it doesn’t need to be on. I’m somewhat worried.

The most I’ll do is get him to get me customers and I split profit.

313,"Just as I was beginning to get used to my first year of university I was hospitalized for a severely inflamed colon and horrible abdominal pain. These past two weeks have been a nightmare, I'm doing everything I can to try and distract myself from my discomfort and pass the time while I attempt to reintroduce my body to normal food and activity. 

However, owing to the fact that I lost 25 Lb in the space of a week(making me horribly weak) and cant concentrate on anything for more than 10 min i'm beginning to loose my mind. I've tried  distracting myself by starting new books and movies but but the medication i'm on causes hyperactivity which makes focusing extremely difficult. 

Even video games cant hold my attention for very long and I get frustrated and bored easily. The pain comes in waves and I need something to distract myself when the bad ones come on. I've been at my wits end lately as I've completely run out of ideas on what to do all day. I was wondering if anybody here has any advice, and/or has gone through something similar. Thank you!

317,"Okay, so as context, I have a girlfriend of 6-months, who I love very much. We are nearly perfect for each other, and any fights we have are solved within a day of us talking, and our relationship is pretty relaxed because we know that we probably won't make it past graduation because we'll likely be going to different schools, so we kinda just enjoy the time we have together. My mother hates her, because she sees her as manipulating me into spending more time with her, not my family. I'm 17, almost an adult, but she treats me like all I should focus on is school and family, but I want to go out with my girlfriend, or go places with friends. I'm not irresponsible, but apparently I can't be trusted on my own. 

Anyway, I recieved a certificate for achieving honor roll, along with about 100 other kids, and my mom wanted to see the meeting where I got the certificate. I said she absolutely could come, but I would rather she not because parents rarely go to that ceremony. I didn't ask her not to go, I didn't say she wasn't allowed to, all I said was that I, along with most other kids, would rather not have parents there. I understand that they'd be a bit offended by that, but I said it in the nicest way possible, and still said they could come if they really wanted to. She told me that if she didn't go, she wanted my girlfriend to take pictures of the ceremony or whatever, so I said sure. My girlfriend also recieved the award, so she couldn't take pictures, something I had accidentally overlooked. Her mom showed up, something I was unaware was happening, and she ended up getting some pictures. Not exactly good pictures though. I was upset, and I knew my mom would be upset, so I told her as soon as I could. I was out at the time, helping my girlfriend with an essay I had promised to help her with a while back, so I felt obligated to stay and help her finish. My mom was really mad, and told me the way I acted had solidified so much about me, and she was done dealing with me. I understood that she was mad, and tried many times to call her, and sent a few texts asking to talk. I was stuck needing to choose between my girlfriend and my mom, and since I had already promised my girlfriend I'd help, I stayed there. My mom never answered my calls.

I spoke to her that night, and in tears she told me our relationship had changed as a result of today. I didn't want that to happen, it was just a mistake, and I had no idea that it would go that bad. I just want to end things, whether that is running away, or just straight up ending my own life. It is too much because I can't choose. I love my mom and I love my girlfriend, in different ways of course, but it's not fair. I accept that I should have let her come, and I made a mistake, but I felt like it's childish to treat me this way. There is too much wrong with my life, I'm not a fundamentally good person, I frankly hate my own personality, but I can't change it. I don't know what to do. 

TL:DR, told my mom I'd rather her not come to an award ceremony. She said I'd need someone to take photos, and that photographer ended up being my girlfriends mom. My mom hated that and said our relationship has changed.",28Sep2018,1

320,"So, last night (Thursday) my roommate invited his friend from high school to the dorm to spend the night on our futon. I didn’t have a problem with this at all.

They went out to the bars all night and I fell asleep before they came home. At 3:30am, I woke up to them coming bursting through the door drunk as hell being super loud. They turned on all of the lights and started playing music.

After they got in bed, they talked for about an hour about how “crazy of a night they had”. For some reason they kept the music on all night. I wasn’t able to fall back asleep till around 5

321,"Ok, first some brief background info so you understand why I am asking (because normally I would just straight up ask her what her problem is -lol): My parents (mom &amp; stepdad) are friends with this other couple, and it is the wife of this duo that has the staring problem. She is someone that I only see probably once or twice a year (thankfully), but she is at nearly every get-together my parents have so I find myself faced with this issue from time to time. My mom is having a retirement party this Saturday, and I am sure that she will be there, so I find myself looking to others for advice because she makes me really uncomfortable.

Out of respect for my parents, I do not want to cause a scene with this woman; I just want her to stop staring at me. I use the word ‘staring’ but what she is really doing is glaring daggers at me. If looks could kill, you know? She will also wait until she knows that she’s got my attention and then whisper in someone else’s ear while she continues to stare at me, so the message is clear that she’s whispering about me. It is really childish and also very disturbing. Approaching her directly seems out of the question; given the hostility with which she glares at me, I don’t see that going down without some kind of loud confrontation. I simply won’t embarrass my parents in such a way. So what is to be done? Ignoring her only causes her to glare harder and whisper more.

I really don’t know what I could have done to cause her to dislike me to the degree that she would want to purposely make me so uncomfortable at my parent’s gatherings. I barely know her and I only ever see her at my parent’s house, so it certainly isn’t anything that I did directly to her. The only thing I can think of is that maybe knows one of my exes, as we live in a very small town with a viscous rumor mill, and you can’t sneeze without someone noticing and making sure everyone else notices, too. So, if she knows one of my exes, they could have told her anything. Exes talk shit, you know?

Anyway, any creative advice would be welcome. I do not care if this woman likes me or not, I just need her to live and let live. When I am at a party that my parents are throwing, my focus is on them and I really could not care any less what this woman thinks of me. There are a lot of people in this world that I do not care for, but when I see them I don’t feel the need to make them needlessly uncomfortable - I just leave them right the heck alone.

322,"My wife and I got divorced a few months ago, been separated almost a year. The past few years, at least in my view, instead of doing things the easy way, everything has to be attached to some form of drama/guilt/anger as in someone done wrong by her or screwed her over or ""poor me"" etc etc etc... Here is the latest example. I honestly am at my wits end, I am trying to be a good person/father and understanding since, even though we are divorced, she has custody of our daughter, and she is a good mother.

my brother is too young to understand or help, and my dad is not a particularly caring or selfless person so I can't imagine him helping either.

325,"i can't really tell when i'm either breaching or have already crossed some borders. it's a con i've had since i got out of my mum's womb. to start this whole thing off, i'm entirely aware of the fact that i was in the wrong in this scenario. if i make myself seem like the victim, it's just bad wording. 
a few weeks ago we were talking about something in our groupchat and friend a mentioned that our group's mutual friend started doing thing x. i knew that the mutual friend told friend a this info in confidentiality. going a few months back a similar thing happened with another mutual friend. they told friend b they did thing x and friend b told us about it, again, in confidentiality. i did the very opposite of the thing you should do in this kind of situation. i did not keep my mouth shut, outing friend b. i asked the mutual friend about it not realizing i would out my close friend. the mutual friend confronted friend b about it, and then friend b confronted me about it in the groupchat. same thing happened with my strike number two, the one that happened a few weeks back. to clarify, neither of the mutual friends thought about thing x (separate cases) as something Big. they were just dissappointed that they couldn't keep it private. these two ""strikes"" made friend a and friend b annoyed with me. i apologized and admitted my fault for the first case, but not the second. i did mention that i made a mistake, but i did not say sorry in any form. thought it would sound empty, so i didn't bother. we didn't talk much the next day, except for some banter exchanged by friend c and friend d about memes they sent in the groupchat. tension died off the day after that and everything went back to normal. just to note, friend a and b don't hold grudges but they just get more annoyed each time? like. they didn't hate me, they were just very Very annoyed with me. 
a few weeks after that, i joked about something, not meaning to insinuate something or be menacing, that had to do with a trait that i and friend e have in common. friend c and a thought it was mildly funny. but, friend d didn't. they called me insensitive and how i was hurting friend e's feelings, without either of us hearing friend e's input on the situation. i was just like ""bruh, it's just a joke n it has to do w me too so like???"" friend d rebutted with arguments of their own and so did i. it was just an argument along the lines of friend d saying i had no right to say that and me trying to defend myself saying that i meant nothing rude or mean by it. the conversation died off after that. i private messaged friend e and apologized about the joke knowing they would probably backread the chat after seeing the exchange of words between me and friend d. i noted in the short apology that if it sounded empty, it probably was - since i didn't feel like i did something wrong. friend e said that it was fine, they didn't feel anything by the joke because they've already ""been made fun of for it half my life so im used to it lol"". now, i did not know that our common trait was something friend e has been ridiculed for, thus i didn't think of it as anything when i joked about it since i had an entirely different experience on my side. i apologized again, this time with actual feeling of sorry in my words. friend e didn't reply.
recently, friend a was in charge of hosting an event over the weekend. the event wasn't anything super formal or really really important. it was just something that friend a cared about and was stressing with to get it to work well. they asked our friend group to help them out. i, friends c, d and e volunteered to help out with the prep during the week and be present during the event on the weekend when it was to be hosted. i wasn't able to help out with prep during the week from morning until early evening due to having college classes in that timeframe. i came by during the evening to help. on the day of the event some personal problems came into play and i wasn't able to attend. fast forward to a few days after when i was backreading our groupchat and realised friend a was shading me for being no help during the prep and being a no show. i brought back that convo by asking friend a what they meant by being no help, when friends b and f didn't even mention if they were going to help or show up. friend a expressed that they were annoyed with how i said i was going to help but did ""the bare minimum"" and would have rather had me not say anything like the other two have. i didn't reply to that since i felt angered and didn't want to say something i didn't mean. i got busy with school for a few days and didn't check the groupchat in a few days. when i got back, i said hi like i usually would, all cheery and shit with a meme sent right under it. i mentioned something about how the platform the groupchat's in update looked different and friend a replied to that by telling me to backread the chat. i did that. to sum it up, it was just friend a expressing their annoyance with me and friends b and d were agreeing with her, friend d bringing up strike 2 and the incident with friend e up. friend b was apparently not aware of those two things and confronted me about it the moment i read the chat's history. i was trying to brush it off by saying that ""yea, i messed up, but that was months n weeks ago"" because i wasn't really in for a conflict at the time. friend b said that the timespan between then and now didn't matter and that i hurt the entire group's feelings with those incidents. i didn't defend myself on that one since i knew friend b was in the right. friend b said i should stop fucking up or they're going to cut me out of the group. i got fed up and replied to the groupchat with ""bye then ex friends"". i left the groupchat right after sending that. there was no contact between any of us for about 5 weeks until today. friend a shaded me and i confronted them about it in a private message. friend a simply replied with a ""need i remind you who said bye then ex friends"". i read the message from my notifications.
when i left the groupchat, i didn't think of the argument as beef or something along the lines of that. like. i talked to friend c, and e after the conflict. even with friend d briefly. they weren't passive aggresive or anything. i wanted to stay friends with everyone, even if it was just separately on my part, because they were my closest friends. i did the thing i was afraid of doing. said something i didn't mean during a fit of anger.

334,"I'm completely torn right now. 
I don't know whether or not to go through with traveling to my friends wedding.

A little background - her and I met during high school and for a few years afterward drifted in and out of each others lives. We most recently came back into each others lives as really close friend about four years ago after I moved to a different state about 7 hours away from her. Both of us felt lonely and isolated and connected over that.
We've been able to connect and help each other with some pretty heavy and deep seated issues.

I consider(?) her one of my best friends. She's been a huge source of help when I needed it and I feel that I've done the same for her. She was even a bridesmaid in my wedding a bit over a year ago now. 

She's getting married in a few weeks time and the entire time I've known about it I couldn't be more excited for her. The couple went through a few moments of ""should we actually do this.."" but decided to go for it and I've been trying to be as supportive as I can be for her. 
I know how crazy wedding planning can be on top of everything. I've been making them a queen sized wedding quilt which I have sunk about $350 dollars into and every weekend for the past two months. 

The issue is that I've gotten basically no response from her for the past few months. I'll preface this by saying I have only a small handful of friends and can be little emotionally sensitive.

I'd reach out and reach out maybe twice a week via phone call/ voicemail, text and social media - How's life? How're you feeling? Can I help with any planning at all? Miss you, love you, care about you etc...

For the first couple months I would get little responses. Maybe a two or three sentence text - maybe three times a month. 

The past month (reaching out two to three times a week) I had gotten absolutely nothing from her - no call back, no text back, nothing (although she was watching my Instagram stories). Part of me was extremely worried and part of me was a little upset about being ignored.

I finally broke down last weekend and sent her a huge text explaining that I needed a little feedback, was worried about her, needed to know what was going on and why she was unable to text me back. What I got back was ""We're just fine! But I'm really super busy with work ect. so I'm spent at the end of the day and don't have the energy for loved ones or relationships.""

So here are my reasons I feel like I need to go: I consider her a close friend - not sure if she feels the same about me. She was at my wedding. I'm happy and excited for her. 

Here are the reasons I have a pit in my stomach about it: Its a seven hour drive one way and a weekend long affair. Being told that she doesn't have the time or energy for our friendship hurt pretty bad especially because I care a lot about her, have put maybe too much effort into reaching out and have sunk 200 hours into this massive ""love you guys"" project I'm making for them. I will be attending alone. I don't know anyone there. I feel hurt. 

I've had multiple people telling me not to waste my time but on the other end I have people telling me it's not a choice I can make and that I have to go.

TL;DR - A girl I consider a close friend is getting married in a few weeks. She has been outright ignoring me for months. She says its because she's to spent at the end of the day to put energy into loved ones and friendships. Her wedding is a seven hour drive away one way. I'm hurt. Do I go to the wedding?

336,"So I have this roommate, let’s call him John. I’ve known John for a while now, maybe 7 or 8 years, and I’ve always been cool with him. We are somewhat close and know quite a bit about each other. Awhile back we were both looking for a room mate and decided to just rent a apartment and move in together. At first it was all fine and dandy but I started to notice very quickly that he needs constant attention. That part I do not mind. I’ve always been pretty good with people and listening so I’ve never had a problem listening to him when he wants to talk. 

However, here’s the issue. We work opposite schedules for the most part so when I’m sleeping he’s working when he’s sleeping I’m working and I’ve noticed whenever he gets home from work the first thing he does every day is come to my room, unlock my door from the outside and just walk in telling me to get up, snapping at me, clapping at me, doing whatever he can to wake me up so he can talk to me about his day. As I said before I usually don’t have a problem with it but if my door is locked and I’m sleeping I would like to be left alone and not bothered like that.

So I guess my question is what is the best way to confront him about this? I wanna make sure he knows that he can’t just unlock my door and walk into my room trying to wake me up just because he wants to talk about his day.",28Sep2018,1

I thought ""maybe this could help me"" and accepted, but started to regret that decision later that day. 
I've started to worry a LOT: What will I tell her? What can I tell her without my parents finding out? Won't this be awkward? What can she even do to help (I honestly doubt talking alone will solve anything)?

341,"Well, here we go....
I am currently 17, M and have been dealing with deppression since i was 13. It all started back in 5th grade, all the way to 8th grade where i had a crush on a girl. I am a very shy and introverted person so i never really had the courage to ask her out, she talked to me a few timey but i could just reply with nervous ""yes""s or ""no""s. I was (once) a rather smart kid so i got into school at age 5, and so i always was the youngest wherever i went, however as i am really tall that hasn't really ever been an issue. Then, in year 9 i got into a ""MINT"" class (For people focussing on science, it's a german thing), where i met my current crush. I always noticed her, and i always thought she was cute. So i wanted to change myself. Back then i already was quite depressed, since i found out my mother was cheating on my father, and that kind of shattered my view on reality. So, fast forward a year and i am completely in love with that girl. She wasn't really the most popular girl in our class, although she was probably third or second. She never had a boyfriend, so i thought maybe i'd have a chance with her, i lost 10kg the last year and so maybe she'd notice me, and she did, however not really. We talked a few times (Over the last few years i learned talking to girls by... Well, watching online tutorials), and i noticed she'd sometimes look over to my corner in class. Maybe something would've worked out if i had the courage to ask her out or confess, but i'm still an introvert so... Obviously, i'd rather break my legs and arms than ask her out. So, lets look at m, current situation. 
A few weeks ago, she asked me and a few friends to go to a local theme park, i actually didn't have time that day, but you know what you do for love. She insisted on me and a friend of mine being in her group of 4, so i really, really thought something might work out between us. I was really, really happy the next 3 weeks. But now, i am more depressed than i ever was. Last thursday, before P.E. i overheard a girl say ""Me and (her boyfriend) wi watch Fifty Shades 2 this weekend"". And guess what my crush said. ""Yeah, i want to watch it too, but i don't want to at my own house and HE doesn't want to at his house."" I was devestated. I excused myself from the teacher, went straight home and basically cried myself to sleep. Next day, i went to school again, maybd i misheard her. Nothing really happened, we talked a few times, really only like 2 times over a week, and today, autumn break started. I went into a shower in  the evening after soccer practice, and showered for almost two hours, mostly thinking about my life and my crush. After i got out, i checkef my phone, and saw that i had a few Snapchat notifications. One of them, was her story. She's alone with a boy i don't know in her room and they're cuddling. So i, being home alone, start crying and writing a reddit post on r/advice about my depression. 

If you've read this far you are truly amazing. I really thank you for listening to my story, and hope you can help me deal with my life. Just as a last note: i do have many friends, and my family still loved me, but i have a lot of pressure on me. Sorry for language and writing errors.",28Sep2018,1
342,"I’m gonna make this short and sweet as possible. Basically, I was verbally made an offer for a dream job, but there have been some complications. Manager just got back to me stating there’s a job freeze until the beginning of next year and said that she will let me know if they can hire me sooner.

I was really worried about not getting the job as I didn’t hear back from the manager for about 10 days since i submitted my references per her request. 

But now she broke the silence and said she really sees me being part of her team and if I’m still available by the time they can repost the job, she’d be happy to have me on board. 

I was skeptical at first and thought they’re trying to BS me, but why would they go through the trouble of requesting references a week after the interview?

343,"21M college student. 

It’s seriously the worst few weeks of waking up I’ve been in. This 40-year old man plays loud music at about 8:30, and I like studying at all hours the day, sometimes in the afternoon, sometimes at 12-3AM.

He lives upstairs and plays this ridiculously loud radio at 8:30. I actually tried listening intently to see what the hell he was doing, today. The radio was relatively loud when he turned it on, I heard some beeps and he turned it down, then turned it up.

I was thinking:
&gt; What the hell is he doing?

So that was today... I woke up with a headache and feeling unwell.

A couple weeks ago, I text him asking if he can please turn down the radio.

&gt; No... time to be productive!

So I tell him my homework is due at 11:59 and I don’t have a reason to wake up right now. 

Then I send him a video explaining that night owls obviously sleep in, and not everyone wakes up at the same time.

&gt; That’s what bums living in their Mom’s basements say!! 😂😂😂 You need to grow a pair!!

So I calmly say ‘alright’ and consult a friend. 

He tells me verbatim:

&gt; It’s none of this guy’s business *how* fucking late you sleep.

So later this guy says to me:

&gt; Oh your home life made you a pussy,

One day I messaged him around 1 and he said:

&gt; Oh, doesn’t look like your being too productive  haha!

I text and tell him straight up:

&gt; Don’t say any bullshit about ‘what it means to be an adult’ then put me down. I don’t fucking put you down, so don’t put me down.

So recently, he puts on the loud radio at 9:00. 

&gt; I’m actually going to wake up at 10 man... can you turn the radio down please?

My alarm was literally set for 10, and he fucking turns the radio up like 50 more volume **immensely** louder. I was fucking livid.

That idiot told me he’s never slept in until noon *ever* in his life. No fucking way, that guy used to go to the gas station, get a 24oz beer, get in his truck, take a sip, and drive off. In other words he had a drinking problem, he was an alcoholic.

351,"I’m using a separate account from the one I usually use, since my parents and friends all know about me using Reddit. 

So, recently it’s been a pretty rough patch for my family. My dad’s opening a business overseas, and so far it hasn’t made much of a profit and he’s spent most of their savings on it. My mother, who hadn’t been working to take care of us has now taken up a full time job to keep up with the rent, bills, living expenses, etc. She’s pretty much always stressed out, especially since my father also came out as polyamorous. He now insists that he *needs* another woman to be happy and my mother can’t do anything about it. If you don’t know, polyamory (or being polyamorous) means you can love more than one person romantically. And ideally, everyone in a polyamory relationship **knows** that the relationship their in is polyamorous and fully accepts and likes this **since the beginning**. So it isn’t considered cheating, at all. But in our case my mother is **not** polyamorous and did not know anything about this until he, to put it simply, “came out” to my mother as well as me and my siblings. Now keep in mind my parents have been married for more than ten years! 

Now, I love my father. He’s battled with depression as well as a really harsh childhood. I also completely respect 
polyamory. And I’m grateful my father didn’t cheat or go fool around before this, but he does now have a “girlfriend”. My mother **consented** to this because she loves him and wants to stay with him, but it’s breaking her. And because my mother loves him so much, she sometimes gets jealous or sad, but my father won’t accept this and insists that my mother shouldn’t be jealous and that it’s toxic. But in her defence, I know she can’t help it. This has put so much strain on their relationship. They’ve fought so loud that the neighbours complained. There is also now a stain on our ceiling where I’m 99% one of them threw a cup of tea. They’ve threatened to divorce and even had a horrible fight on **their anniversary** over my father’s new girl. I’m quite sure there was one point where they got a bit physical, as in a slap or a hard shove.

I’ve recently found myself wondering if love that lasts actually exists anymore.

Now as for why I’m frustrated with my mother... I know she’s often stressed out as she works full time with rarely any days off and I we don’t have much money anymore. I love her, but she often explodes over the smallest things, like dishes that weren’t put into the dish washer, or a toy on the floor, or toothpaste that wasn’t closed. I have two other siblings who are under still in 7 and 9. And they don’t help too much either, but their only kids. Heck, I’m technically considered still a kid. I find she often takes out the stress on us, yelling and insults are an everyday thing. And when I try to point it out she calls it “talking back”. This has stressed me out so much to the point where I burst out crying at times. She’ll also use the fact that she works so hard for us so that I can’t say anything back or that if she lived alone she would be happier. 

I try hard to make things better for her, and for my dad, I wake up early to take my sisters to school. I pick them up and make them dinner at times. I help them with homework and studies. Yes, I get allowance. But it’s **never good enough for them.**

Secondly, she often reminds us (often in yelling fits) that we don’t have much money, but recently I’ve see that she had gotten eyelash extensions and a perm at a salon. When I asked her about her eyelashes she said she had just put on mascara. I’m not stupid. She was eyeing them a couple weeks back and her “mascara” stayed on even at night. She also doesn’t own “mascara” since she told me once she didn’t like heavy makeup and mascara was too much of a hassle. 

Now I have acne (only on my forehead), just like most people. But I’ve been working so hard to get rid of it. And it finally started working, I ate less junk, and washed my face. Now the final step was to get rid of all the dead skin and etc. On my forehead by going to her dermatologist to scrub it off. I was so excited. Unfortunately, my mother had told me just yesterday that we didn’t have the budget to. What pissed me off is she had just gotten her hair straighten professionally that day and she had told me “she blow dried” it before I came home. Her hair was straight and perfect, and I know she usually can’t do it that nicely. 

Now my acne is slowly coming back, little by little. I didn’t break my routine or anything, but it’s coming back. And the dermatologist will only scrub it when my acne is dried up or gone. I’m guessing I’ll have to restart this heavy process to get rid of it all once more only to have my mom brush me off again. She did this to my last summer as well, and at that time we still had some money.

I also wonder sometimes if I’m the selfish one. Maybe I should just work harder to help my mom. Maybe I’m really worthless? Or useless. Probably very useless. Sometimes I wonder if without me they’d be better off. I sometimes consider just walking out the door during one of my mother’s fits, but then I remember my dad threatening to do the same when they fought.

Sorry for this awful rant. This may not even be the right place to post this. But I need to let this out somewhere, I can’t talk to my friends about this and I’m too afraid to bring this up to my parents. I can’t keep it in anymore. I guess I just needed an outlet to take this weight off my shoulder.

354,"Trying to be extremely cautious as I write this to make sure I’m not caught out. Long story short a few schoolmates of mine got a pet hamster (as a squad thing I suppose) and have been posting their so called adventures with it all over social media. It does seem cute but they’re posts make me question whether the hamster is being taken care of properly or not...

For one, they’re bringing the hamster to school and all posts show are the hamster either out and about or within one of those small plastic ball toys hamster use (I don’t believe they have an actual cage/environment to contain him asides from the ball itself). I just wondered what they do when the hamster needs to sleep at night ? As I’m not sure whether or not that ball closes of air and also it doesn’t seem to provide the hamster much room to move either. This was a bit questionable to me (I couldn’t shake the feeling off that the hamster was basically a toy to them), I brushed it off as it didnt seem to be that big of a deal.

However earlier today one of the members of said friend group posted a video of another member vaping on the hamster, and personally I find that EXTREMELY concerning. Vapes could potentially contain nicotine and other chemicals that could harm HUMANS.. let alone a hamster thts barely the size of their hand! I can only imagine how sensitively their respiratory systems as a result of their extremely low body mass and small size. My question is.. is there anything I can actually do about this asides from report the post?

356,"So let me just give some background on personal characteristics and general life situation just so you have more contexts:

I work a very time consuming job, fairly isolating, but I've always been a loner so it's not that big a deal to me. I also am doing high school online. I've always hated school, with a passion. I mean, I just can't do it. I tried, honestly; up until 8th grade I was in regular school and I just... couldn't do it. I don't know how to explain it. My body and mind just... like, can't. It's like, almost painful to do it. So I cheated most of my way through middle school, and have been as well through high school now.

In terms of my mental state and social life, I don't have many friends and often have a hard time interacting with people. Others say that it's not noticeable from their end of the conversation, but I guess it's more in my head. The way I explained it to my grandma is that I overanalyze and overthink... EVERYTHING. Like, everything. Conversations, work, even walking into a coffee, sometimes I have to leave before they're even finished making it because I just get... anxiety, I don't know. Like everyone is looking at me or something. Even walking down the street, same thing. It's hard to explain. If I have an interest in something, or there is something that I enjoy doing, I can do it for 12 hours straight. But, if not, I just physically can't. My brain just says ""no.""

I mean, this type of ""OS"" (operating system) as I like to call it definitly has it's benefits (see next paragraph for my reasoning), but as I've been getting older, it's been a lot harder to deal with. Partly because as you get older there are more responsibilities at hand (which is where procrastination has been eating my days away), but also because of the overthinking and overanalyzing. Everyday I'm constantly thinking and worried about the future, adding up every possible variable, trying to come to some sort of concrete solution. But that's just it; I can't control the future. I can't know what's going to happen, and it's partly that uncertainty that triggers this compulsive over-analyzation. I've tried meditating and ""living in the moment"" or whatever, but I can't. Every now and then for a couple minutes tops I can achieve it for a second, but then it's gone.

So, now you're probably thinking the same thing that my parents, teachers, past friends, and everyone else thinks about me; you're just a lazy, ungrateful kid who's been too privileged to put any work in. This is what is so hard about all of this; that isn't the case. I've learned an IN DEPTH history on politics, economics, science, general history, etc all on my own time, without any help from teachers, schools, or any of that. Simply by research out of my own interest. I've taught myself how to use Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, Illustrator, Lightroom, and various other softwares all at a nearly professional level. I've started my own business's that have grossed 10s of thousands of dollars in revenue, I mean, I even took some of that money and traded crypto for a while and made over $20K in 4-6 months. I do taxes, sign and write up contracts and agreements, do marketing and promotions, and everything else that comes with running businesses, about 95% of it by myself.

It's not an issue of being lazy. As I wrote in the last paragraph, I can be a fairly productive person. I just... I can't explain it, but I just can't work. I know that sounds like I'm being lazy, but I swear I'm not (or maybe I'm just going crazy). The past, like week or so, I've been procrastinating every day, up until sometimes 3AM doing nothing. Absolutely nothing. The second I try to even pull up my email my chest starts beating, sometimes I start shaking, my mind get's filled with so much stress and anxiety, and I just pull away. Sometimes it's more intense, other times it's not. And I do not enjoy this by any stretch of the imagination; it causes me so much anxiety and stress that not I'm not getting things done. That everything I'm pushing off, I'll now have to make up in an even shorter amount of time.

I don't know what to do. I've tried going to my parents, but they're no help. They just tell me to ""manage my time better"" or they give me some semi-profound/semi-motivational speech and expect me to figure it out. I've been trying, but I'm out of ideas.

Let me know if anyone has any advice or wisdom for me. Thanks in advance.",28Sep2018,1

359,"I am at a bit of a crossroads. But I feel like I know what I need to do, more like I just need to hear it. 

My husband and I have been friends with this couple for a while. Recently, they have decided to divorce after less than a year of marriage - he was struggling with addiction, and lying to her about it. 

Both of these people were great friends to us, but we were drawn into this. He ended up staying at our house, without disclosing any information about why they were separated. We found out later that he was filming individuals at work and in his home while in private spaces - sick, and screwed up. Really. She would ask us to check on him when she ""didn't feel safe"". 

What really blew my mind was that my friend knew about him filming people and didn't disclose it to us until later. She knew while he was staying with us and put us in danger by not sharing that with us. Had we known that, he would never had been permitted to stay with us. Needless to say, we stopped speaking to him entirely. 

She won't accept responsibility for putting us in danger, and keeps deflecting to him. While I realize he could have told us, so could she. She keeps differing that her therapists told her not to tell anyone (which to me, is an excuse, and bad advice from the therapists), and saying that it was his responsibility, not hers and that she doesn't regret anything. I wanted to meet up with her, to discuss in person what happened and she stated that ""we disagree and there's nothing to discuss"" I went on to say how mine and my husband's feelings were hurt, we felt like she let us down, etc. She was not receptive to our feelings and didn't care, when I expressed disappointment in her she gave me the ""thumbs up"" emoji to my response of ""screw you too then"". 

I went on to block her on social media, her number and email. I feel very disrespected and hurt, and am wondering if there is anything else I should do, or need to do.  I'm feeling very lost, sad and disappointed but also relieved. 

Let me be clear - I'm content in my position. As is my husband regarding we were put in danger by her by withholding information. I'm not really interested in hearing how she could be right. I'm more or less looking for support. There is a lot more to this story, however, I'm keeping it brief. ",28Sep2018,1
360,"If you don't want a long post to read, you should give up at this point. Literally using bluetooth keyboard for this. Okay. Hi. I'm 18 years old. I have a friend whom we will call John. I've been best friends with John and tight with his family since the 6th grade. I am now a freshman in college.

 John's parents have a family business that I joined 2 years ago. This business is a tight knit one, everyone knows each other. Johns family is my second family. I have smoked weed and things like that, and have always been smart not to get caught. Smoking like I did was a mistake. John had gotten me caught for it over 3 times because of his carelessness and i've accepted his multiple sorries and apologies.

 This time I tried MDMA. John posted on a reddit thread about the experience, literally spelling out my name on it. John's parents found out because John was too stupid to even consider """"maybe I should use an email my mom doesn't have the password to."" It ruined me, it ruined my image, it ruined how his family looks at me. They tell me ""it's a mistake we understand"", but they say how much potential I have in life, in their business. It doesn't matter because they look at me like a broken, lost puppy dog.

Now is where I need advice.

I have realized how toxic this whole situation is. John's parents sat me down and talked to me about what happened, and basically told me I was the most important thing in John's life. They don't know what John would do without me.

But, I've realized John is not who I want to be around. He poses risks to my personal and professional life as well as his own. because of John, I'm under a microscope now. I want to live my life and make choices without been noticed or under a microscope, whether good or bad. John has been so careless and has gotten me caught enough times. All of those times were John's fault, I've always been careful. 

Me being so important to John is a problem because I no longer want to be around him. I hate parts of him despite being his best friend for years. He's done some wrong things, usually for his benefit that ended up fucking us both over anyway. But it doesn't matter. He forgets, because my life isn't his problem. He doesn't care enough to even think about if he could get caught. John doesn't think before he acts, he's proved this with his lust for the female body, as well as drugs, etc.

Being so close to John's family was because I wasn't close to my own. Every time John got us caught, it dug a deeper hole every time. Now its a hole I can't get out of. His family being so important to me, it rocked my world (in a bad way) when they found this out. 

I don't like John anymore. I love my job and his family, but I hate the way they look at me now. This is not me blaming him for the consequences if me doing weed or MDMA, but I am blaming him for not having a second thought before getting us caught over and over. For not caring about me enough to even think.

John is a brother to me in some degree, but I can't remain in this hole any longer. John and his family are basically tied to my life. I work for them full time, would always sleep there and eat there and I'll always be accepted, but walking into John's house is too big a reminder of what a fuck up they see me as. This will NEVER change, at least not in my mind. I am tied to John and his family because of this job and my past relations with them. I'm locked into this situation, this family, and in all honesty I don't know how to deal with John anymore when I'm so close and needed by him. Emotionally, I am his rock, I can't be that anymore.) I'm heavily invested in my job, they need me; and I mean it. I don't say that to sound full of myself.

This last stupid mistake John made of getting caught has put me too deep in the hole and I can't find the way out. Again, John's own mother cried while telling me ""You are the most important thing in John's life, more than us."" How can I leave John after that. It would be a betrayal seen by his family and John, when I really just don't want to live this life cursed by John anymore. Because of John's carelessness, I now constantly feel broken. I have lost a brother, thanks to his several betrayals towards me, whether he's tried to or not. John put his wants over anyone else's needs, and John will never learn to think first. I can't stand him anymore, but I have to. I hope this all makes sense, I tried my best to write this as if I'd submit it to a professor. If you've made it this far, I seriously thank you for your time and ask for your advice. Thank you all.


tl;dr - I love John's family, I love my job, I do not like John. What do I do.",28Sep2018,4
361,"At the time, I was attracted to my female friend. Without ever asking her permission, I stroked and played with my female friend's hair, leaned against her, put my arm around her, and played footsie. I never asked  her whether it was all right with her. It was very creepy and I was continually violating her personal space. I only stopped when I almost jokingly asked her whether she minded, and she clearly expressed her discomfort. Then I moved away and did not attempt anything like that again. That was when I truly knew what I did was wrong. I likely would have continued doing it if that hadn't happened. We did not discuss what  had happened at any time afterward; we still remained friends and on  good terms with one another. To this day, I have no idea how my actions  affected her, because I never asked her or apologized for my actions. I haven't seen her in a very long time. I don't know  whether she told anyone, or whether she is still experiencing  psychological harm.

I reject the belief that you shouldn't be held responsible for things you did when you were young. I am not interested in being forgiven or redeemed; no amount of good deeds can erase my actions. I have no  interest in making a self-serving public display of remorse; this is a useless spectacle  meant to shift focus from victim to perpetrator, and  is only a way for bad men to try to get sympathy and admiration they  don't deserve. I am only interested in taking whatever course of action  is needed to reduce any harm that I've caused, and that includes being punished with whatever consequences I might deserve.

Did I commit sexual assault? Does it matter if I didn't?

None of my family, friends, or coworkers know about this; they believe I'm a  much better man than I really am. However, I am unsure whether telling them would accomplish anything useful. I am not out to ""unburden""  myself; that is selfish. I am only interested in taking full responsibility.

I am unsure whether to write my friend a letter of apology, and what I should say in it. I have  heard conflicting things about whether this is helpful to victims. Some victims appreciate knowing that their abuser feels remorse. For others, being contacted in any way by their abuser would be harmful to them. I am also not sure about whether it matters or not that thirteen years have passed since my actions.

I have always known what I did was wrong, but I must have believed that it  wasn't that bad. Now I see that the reason that the world is so bad is because we let things like this slide. I only fully considered the  meaning of my actions after the MeToo movement began. This seems to indicate that I am much more worried about self-focused guilt and social consequences than the feelings of others, and this makes me disgusted with myself. I strongly believe that any attempt to take responsibility for my actions would only be a selfish attempt to head off the consequences of MeToo; this also makes me disgusted with myself.

I am involved in a creative pursuit, and I am considering quitting; the  world doesn't need any more woman-abusers in the arts. I don't know if this would be the right choice. Again, I strongly believe or suspect that I am only thinking about this because I am worried about experiencing public shame that I would deserve, rather than of the feelings of the person I harmed. Please take this into account when responding to me.",28Sep2018,0

We're a European (French) migrant family who moved to Los Angeles 18 years ago. We have all papers, some of us are US citizens, some are still green card holders. 

I have 3 brothers and sisters, I am the oldest and we are all starting to become our own adult version with our own respective views, morals and ethics. However, my brother is an avid Trump supporter who became enveloped in the idea that all non-GOP supporters and bureaucrats were out to disarm him and take his 2nd amendment rights away ...and it flourished from there. In the beginning I thought it was a joke, but when he started sending me Alex Jones clips and I stopped treating it like a joke but something very real. My mom doesn't see a problem with it, one because she isn't politically interested and my dad was a HARDCORE misogynist from Portugal.(they, of course, have since separated because my dad was abusive and drank)  

We've lived here 18 years and thankfully these horrible values my dad showed us did not stick with my siblings and i .. or so i thought. So i've decided to stop talking to my brother, because not only can I not understand why an immigrant would choose to support this administration but why my brother would support any of the ideologies the GOP is enabling.  My mother is heartbroken that I willfully chose to stop talking to my brother. She says politics and whats going on isn't important and she doesn't care about any of this. She just cares that her two eldest kids aren't speaking. 

So I am torn between guilt and my values, I feel selfish for doing this to my mom because I know it all stems for the bitterness I have from being raised seeing women treated differently than the men in my family. But all this DOES matter , not only as a woman but as a green card holder and immigrant and I feel like my mom is enabling dominant patriarchy with my brothers now because that's all she knows. 

I don't know how to go about this.. I want to be the mature person and not cause any family problems and not give any grief to my mother. But i also don't want to coddle her enabling.

My boyfriend and I have been together for around 5 months, and were close friends for almost 8 months before that. During the time we were just friends, he was getting out of a seriously horrible other relationship. 

The woman he was with was very manipulative, and constantly degraded him and guilt tripped him to get whatever she wanted. Whenever he would disagree with her, she would go into hysterics, threaten to call the police if he didn't do what she wanted, and even call his mom to get her involved in their arguments (they are both adults in their early 30s; no one's family should ever have to be dragged into something like that). She would refuse to let him see his friends, not let him do anything besides what she wanted him to do, etc. On occasion she would even get physical, slapping him, hitting him, and shoving him. Sometimes, this would even happen in public and in front of other people.

Finally he got the strength to leave her, and she went ballistic. She refused to be broken up with, and spent hours and hours texting him, trying to call him, harassing his friends, showing up places she knew he would be. 

Months went on and he tried to ignore her as much as possible. Still, she would do insane things like order a package to his address, and then show up at his house unannounced saying he's withholding her mail. He and I started dating a few months after they broke up, and this has continued the entire time we've been together. We both have her blocked on every social media outlet after she publicly blasted both of us on all accounts (she even commented on Venmo transactions between the two of us talking mad shit... umm what?).

Then at 4am today, his mom gets a call from her. She accused him of all sorts of horrible things (including saying that he and I are drug addicts, selling drugs and doing porn to support our habit) that were not at all true. His mom was obviously distraught, and called him crying. Now he has to assure his mom that nothing she's saying is true, on top of worrying about whatever next thing she might do.

In my opinion, this has gone on long enough. I'm seeking advice to see if anyone knows the best course of action here. Would a restraining order work? If so, how does he get a restraining order? Also, how I can best support my boyfriend through this time? The poor guy buries me in apologies if he so much as accidentally spills a drop of water. I'm trying to assure him that he's a good person and doesn't deserve this, and that I would never get so angry at him, especially for something so small, and hurt him. He recognizes that she was abusive but is tight on money because he works for a nonprofit, so the cheapest/most effective route to go on restraining orders and also therapy would be really really helpful to know. Anyone have any ideas?",28Sep2018,0

Those friends I was with are not Muslim but despite that we always got along, we never discriminate each other or anything like that. They alway respected the fact that I'm a muslim so I don't drink, they never forced me to. Well this time I was with them, and the friend whose house we were in (let's call him friend A, the two others are friend B and friend C) offered everyone a drink, he gave my two friends a beer and I got this drink which looked kinda like beer but he assured me there wasnt any alcohol in it. It was made with cherry or grapes, I can't really remember. I still checked the ingredients but it was very dark and I couldn't really see well. I trusted him and figured I would be okay. So we started talking and chatting about life, making jokes and all of that. While drinking the bottle I felt this weird sensation in my chest but I didn't really think much of it. After I finished the bottle, friend A looked over to friend B and said :""should we tell him"" and I was like ""what"". He told me there was alcohol in it and pointed to the label where it says ""3.9% alcohol"". I couldn't believe my eyes at first, friend C looked shocked as well and said he didnt know anything about it. I stood up without saying a word and left the house on my bike. There was a gate which I didnt know the code to so I waited and friend A came and opened the door while apologising to which I responded ""I thought we were friends"". I left and friend B and C followed me, they both kept apologising. Friend C kept saying he should've checked the bottle for me and felt guilty for not doing so, I dont blame him, it's not his fault at all. I just pedaled faster and eventually they just left. It was a very lonely ride and felt so so betrayed by them. I just got home and went up to the toilet bowl and made myself vomit by putting my fingers in my throat. I took a shower and faked being happy to my family because I don't want them finding out. I'm in bed right now close to crying. I don't know what to do.

A lot has happened since my last update. 

A - Mariana’s mom 

B - A’s mom 

C - A’s brother 

D - A’s new boyfriend

E - A’s former best friend

Firstly, I filed a complaint with CAS citing how I was treated and the fact that the agent did not follow proper procedure. 

CAS agreed that things were handled poorly but maintained that I had no rights pertaining to Mariana. The lady I talked to was very understanding, she said that they did in fact read the journal I made them and the CAS lady complimented me and stated outright that if I was a relative, even a distant one, she would be in my care no problem. 

Police investigated Mariana’s mother A’s disappearance. They found her. She was pregnant and living with D. She may potentially get deported back to Canada, I don’t know if that’s true or not though. She would not return CAS’s phone calls. 

I reached out to A’s brother C, as the grandmother, B, was not returning my calls. 

C and I talked. I asked him how Mariana was.  I asked about his sister. I explained everything. 

He told me the following: 

- screen caps of a group text where A responded to B telling her I would call CAS. A said “call them and tell them he touches little girls LOL”, verbatim. 

- Mariana was kept in CAS’s care while the process to cut A’s parental rights went on. 

- They said she was suffering from extreme distress. 

-  B was granted emergency custody but B was witnessed by Mariana’s personal CAS worker selling pain pills. When B was warned about selling drugs around a 4 year old, she stated that she couldn’t look after her and gave her back to CAS. 

-  Technically A still has parental rights. She played the system. 

- C finally admitted he wasn’t ok with everything but he couldn’t afford to take Mariana. 

- He put me in touch with A who was rude and obnoxious. 

A is pregnant again and she’s taken Mariana to the states. Currently, she is in trouble for a DUI she got. I don’t know the details. 

I called her and said outright that she should allow me to take Mariana in a closed adoption, where she would have visitation rights and she wouldn’t have to have her taken by CPS. We got into s big fight and I said “just because you don’t want Mariana doesn’t mean she should suffer or be abused. Let me give her a loving home.” 

I said to her there is a reason she dropped Mariana with me in the first place. I told her, deep down inside she chose me because she knew I would love her.

I cried during our talk and she teared up too. But after our talk she (according to mutual friends) went on a huge tirade about me on Facebook. 

My current primary goal is to get Mariana away from A. She is continuing to drink and do drugs, and her boyfriend is not someone anyone trusts. The grandmother is completely out of the picture. 

A’s close friend E reached out to me and said that she thought things were terrible and she fought against A and sacrificed their friendship to stick up for me. I found it moving because E wasn’t someone I talked to. 

I am trying to work out a deal with C. My lawyer, who is a redditor from the last thread working pro bono for me, promised to represent him in family court for free. We are urging him to fight for Mariana to get away from A and D so we can move forward with a closed adoption. C doesn’t want to destroy the family any more than this already has but he is considering it. He admits I am the only person who ever really cared about his niece and I’m probably the only one who can make her happy. 

Honestly it’s been hard. Emotionally it’s been really devastating to see Mariana go to such a bad place. I don’t know what she is going through but this has been torture for her. 

These months of struggle left me feeling bitter and angry, as well as depressed and helpless. It’s been hard to maintain a positive attitude. 

Every time I see her stuff in my apartment, I tear up and get emotional. I have been sleeping poorly and skipping meals. I haven’t been healthy since I lost her. Legally if C Doesn’t go through with his side, it’s over.

Sometimes I wonder if I could have just kept her.  Probably not, but she would be healthier and happier if I could have. I feel like the system failed Mariana. 

In my last thread, a young mom reached out to me. She was a few hours away irl, so we talked and ended up getting along very well. We’ve started a relationship, and we met up a couple of times. She’s been very helpful in helping me cope. 

Last time some people got weirded out over my emotional attachment to Mariana. This time I am not engaging with people like that this time. These kinds of people are the ones who think I should have hired a woman to do all the childcare stuff for Mariana, or left her to marinate in filth for weeks. These are the kinds of people who will never understand that I love Mariana and I want to be a part of her life to protect and raise and help her for as long as there is life in me. She’s family. 

I’m anxious. There is no telling what abuse Mariana will go through at home. A should have lost parental rights a long time ago but that process is moving slowly apparently. They may not be able to enforce it with A in the states now. 

So that’s that. If things are going to work out it will still be over a year before I see Mariana again. But more likely, it all ends here.

386,"Hey guys,

Lately (past month or so) I’ve stopped caring about every person in my life. Don’t get me wrong, I love my mum, and by nature I’ll always care about her, but aside from that there is nobody else in my life who I give a s*** about anymore. There are people in my life who are going through some really rough times, and of course I’m concerned about them, but aside from their issues I don’t really care about them. Usually, I’m the most empathetic, caring person you could ever meet, but for maybe 3 weeks I just haven’t concerned myself with other people’s goings on. What’s wrong with me? What do I do to get out of this? I want to care again, I want to be that empathetic person, but it’s just not happening, and I’m not alright with that at all. I hope someone here can relate to what I’m saying, or at the very least give me an outsiders perspective on what I could do to regress back to how I was. I can’t afford counselling, and free counselling takes months to get onto a scheme; I’m not going to wait that long. Please, don’t hold back.",28Sep2018,1
387,"Some time ago my mom told me about my father's domestic abuse. This includes an event in which she genuinely feared death. 

My parents separated when I was younger, and during this time I spent a large deal of time with my step-mom. Consequently, I am close to my step-mom.

I feel she deserves to know about my father's abuse but am uncertain whether my mom would agree to allowing me to reveal what happened (based on past conversations) . Mentioning what happened to my step-mom without naming names is not an option as she will know instantly who I'm referring to. This may get passed on to my father who may then pose a risk once again to my mom. 

I really don't think I can continue to keep this from my step-mom because I feel I have an ethical obligation here. Her future safety may be at risk. But there may be some risk to my mom in revealing the information too. Any ideas on the best way to handle this situation? ",28Sep2018,1

392,"So first off I want to preface this with I'm in high school and I'm going to mention more than one things so if you have any advice from experience I would appreciate it a lot.

First things first I'm quite lonely, I have friends, I'm not bullied and I have people to talk to during my free-time at school but I still feel extremely lonely. I don't have any very ""good"" friends, for an example there isn't anyone there that I know I can trust or anyone that I know I can talk to whenever I need to and at times I feel like they don't want to be my friends. And I know high school is hard and that people's moods change all the time and whatnot but it feels worse for me. Most of my friends still see each other outside if school and do stuff after school but I hardly ever do anything like that with anyone and that makes me even more lonely and you get the point.

(I realise this is getting rather specific so i hope no one from my school reads this lol)

Then there's stuff like the other day I had a home economics test and our teacher told us that the class with the highest average score gets a prize. (This was done to make us avoid telling the answers to the other kids who haven't taken the test yet) and then the next day I saw my friend looking at a picture of the test with the correct answers on it, I then went over to some of my other friends and told them. One of them told me that we should go and tell the home ec teacher and I agreed, I did want that prize after all. The teacher thanked us and said that she wouldn't tell anyone where she got the information from, but the next day I'm getting called a snitch and I don't know how they found out and apparently there are messaging groups and everything to find out who snitched and they somehow concluded it was me. Some of my friends were saying kind of playfully like they didn't really care that I did it.

So what should I do? Deny it? Confess? I'm honestly really confused and shit and I don't even know at this point.

This turned out to be much longer than I expected and I appreciate anyone who spent the time to read it. Thanks",28Sep2018,1

394,"I asked my little brother and apparently this has been ongoing behaviour for a while now. She locks herself in the bathroom and then weeps and begs to God or something. I'm an atheist and I don't have a good relationship with her but it sounds really concerning. She had an epic meltdown when I came out as gay two years ago but it seems weird for her to still be this desperate about it, so I think it must be something else. Her marriage with my father is has always been pretty loveless because he's kind of an asshole, is emotionally unavailable to anyone and probably also cheats because he often disappears and refuses to admit where he goes. He's also mentally ill because he suffers from paranoia and thinks some imaginary shady people are out to get him but he can't realize his illness and refuses to see a doctor. I'm not sure though whether it's any of these reasons because they aren't anything new, it has always been this way so I don't really know what's going on with her.

Recently I had told the farm to up their hours for me since I am not working the current show at the theater. And since I had available hours I have more time at the pizza place too. However my boss at the theater called me today and *begged* if I could run the current show for the entire month, starting in 3 hours from now running to the end of the month.

I know this will fuck up a lot of my schedules in the evening between the pizza place and the farm, but it’s my dream job.

Do I screw over my other jobs schedules on such short notice because my priority job needs me to work, or do I screw over my priority job because they didn’t give me enough time in advance?

397,"Hey I'm 25f, no prior mental issues... Well, besides having been the common teen trying to commit suicide. (haven't wanted to kill myself for half a decade now)

The thing that has finally brought me here is that tonight I... Well I kind of want to say episode. 

something small bothered me last night :

 (my husband mentioned something he saw which gave him away for having seen some porn via here on reddit which is something that I know that he does time from time, not often... Not fond of him looking but I understand)

I kept thinking about it today and suddenly start having anxiety about him watching porn any time he used the bathroom all day. (I know that he's not... I am quite sure that he semi rarely even looks through porn) but suddenly am sure he's rubbing one out instead of just taking a shower.

I should say now, our sex life is going pretty well considering 6 years married and having an infant plus a 4 year old to take care of. We're doing really good is the thing.

So yes. Spent all day with rocket high anxiety about something that I try to be okay and and am in practice.
I also had a sense of dread or impending doom all day. I just expected to suddenly have a brain hemorrhage and die. Almost was waiting for it to happen. 


Then I found the front door unlocked an hour after the kids went to sleep, an hour before I go to bed. I quickly get a sense of doom and find a flashlight which I use to fully check under beds, closets, behind doors.. (I knew I had just forgotten to lock but was really freaking out about someone hiding in the house)
I forget to lock the door on occasion but don't even bother checking to make sure no one came in... I live in a safe place.

I've been able to hide my anxiety from my husband so it hasn't been so bad... But days like this come time from time and it's just out of character for me.
Is it just normal for emotions to suddenly spike with intensity every so often?

400,"Me and my girlfriend have been in a long-distance relationship together for well over a year now, and now I finally have the chance to visit her in person, and we’re both ecstatic.

However, the relationship is complicated by my parents... I have kept the status of her hidden from them, and my girlfriend knows this, and she’s understanding as to why that is, despite feeling guilt about it, when she really shouldn’t be.

Why have I kept this a secret? Well, I’m from an islamic Arab family (No surprises there, huh?), while my girlfriend is Indonesian, and I know they wouldn’t take kindly (to say the least) to me dating ANYONE before marriage, let alone a foreigner who is also from a lower socio-economic class.

My parents and family are wealthy and highly-respected in their community. I know what they are like. They would always encourage me to marry a woman who is from a respectable, known family and from my own country. 

They are no-nonsense as fuck about this stuff. They’re also borderline racist to boot in regards to anyone non-Arab. I have heard and seen many a gossip about a local family member or friend who married some European woman or whatever and they would talk shit about that person for his choices like he is some kind of disgrace.

Yet marrying your cousin is still seen as something great and respectable to them. Yeah... I think you get my point about the sort of mentality they have.

But anyway, I don’t give a fuck about keeping her and my relationship to her a secret. My problem is long-term... How do I tell them the truth? We both love eachother and her parents know a lot about me and are open and accepting of me already... In contrast to my own family who know jack shit and still think I’m single.

What bums me &amp; my girlfriend out right now is that now that I finally have the chance to visit her, I do not know how to do it without something bad happening in regards to my parents. 

If it sounds odd, I’ll explain... 

I still live with my parents. I don’t have much of a choice. In this culture, you live with them until you marry. Not only that, but my parents are way too controlling and treat me like a fucking child even though I’m 27. 

I can’t just travel without them knowing. I can’t. I have to specify exact details. Why I’m travelling, how long am I travelling. Etc.

Now then, I wish I could just say ‘Hey, I’m going to Indonesia for a bit to visit my girlfriend’, but I can’t. And I’m not even exaggerating. It’d be foolish to say that as it’d open the biggest can of worms ever.

So what next? Tell them I’m going to fucking Bali or something for vacation? Well... They know I have never travelled alone in my life, and they know full well I’m not the tourist/adventurer/world-explorer or whatever the fuck type, so this would raise some suspicion, but I also could be too anxious about that... I don’t know.

How do I approach this? How can I travel to meet her WITHOUT my parents knowing the truth of the visit? I really don’t want them to fuck up this relationship. They’re such a pain in the ass for us.

By the way, please don’t give me that ‘You’re 27. You don’t need to worry about what they think. It’s your life.’ talk. You wouldn’t be wrong, but it’s too general of a statement that does NOT apply to me. If you’re living with them and you’re not married, it doesn’t matter if you’re fucking 27 or 17. They still have a tight grip on your life choices and freedom.

I find myself having constant stress and anxiety whenever something is going wrong when in school or at my internship. It doesnt help the fact that i continued with this second year of study when I was already considering switching to another study (European Studies) in my first year. I applied to that school and passed all the requirements for enrollment but in the end I didn't go through with it for a number of reasons:

1. I feel like this period of disappointments will go away so quitting now will be premature.
2. My mentor from my last years internship said I had it in me to become a teacher and I kinda feel obligated to continue so I dont dissapoint her.
3. I really like working with the kids, I just find it very hard to handle the parts of being an actual teacher (organizing a lesson, explaining certain things so they understand).
4. I feel like im exaggerating with how I see things. I feel like I cant handle dissapointments when they happen and when I continue with this study I will learn how to deal with them.
5. I have alot of self-consciousness, so I always think how people think about me (if that makes sense) so I dont usually go through with certain things I have doubts about.
6. I feel like my friends and family will judge me for being so indesicive. I already had troubles with deciding what is best for me during the time when I was applying for university. I feel like when I change my mind again it will affect my relations with the people I know and care about. And I know I shouldn't do that but I can't help myself.


There are also a number of things that stop me from continuing this course:

1. I have my moments where i REALLY wanna stop with my study but I always convince myself that it is only temporary and usually that feeling fades away when I'm home and feel safe.
2. I have this lingering thought in my head: what if I did switch studies? Would I have been happier right now?
3. I don't know if I have the skills to be teaching those kids. I find myself struggeling todo all the things an average lesson has to offer, organizing, being clearwhen explaining subjects, staying calm in my head and prevent all the thoughts in by mind from distracting me.
4. It doesn't help also that I really don't like my current mentor at my internship or the person who is supposed to help me with these kind of thoughts. I feel like my mentor is constantly judging me over my actions and doesn't like me. I try to impress him and do my best but from inside I always feel really... discouraged.
5. Mentally, I'm completely drained after just two months of school and I dont know if I can keep this up.
6. I sometimes feel like I owe it to myself to give myself a break and just quit. But I always think that im thinking to much about myself and the feeling fades away for some time until something bad happens again.
7. I feel unappreciated for my work sometimes. At school and at my internship.

When you're reading this please keep in mind that my mind is al over the place, I have trouble concentrating and I know that I said some things that may need further explanation or things I haven't mentioned at all, feel free to ask about those things so I can help you guys help me :)

She always finds a way to take everything as some sort of personal attack and acts accordingly. My dad needed to store some of his things in our storage area and when I brought his things back to him he told me some of it was missing. My roommate also put her things in our storage area so I asked her to check and make sure she didn't accidentally mistake some of his bags for hers. She thought I was accusing her of stealing. If I talk about succeeding at something she's good I have to sort of acknowledge that she's still better at whatever it is so she doesn't think I'm trying to one-up her and get pissy. I found some makeup in my bag I didn't remember buying so I asked her about it because I thought maybe I accidentally took some of hers. I had no use for  it so I was going to throw it away but before I did decided to ask her about it again. She thought that I was accusing her of going through my things.  there was a time when  I was letting her stay in my room if she got into a fight with my mom  and one morning she had got up about an hour before I was supposed to get up for work and started playing a video on her phone out loud.  I politely asked her to turn it off for a little while until I got up and started getting ready to leave.  she turned it off but started arguing with me about why I'm asking her to turn it off now when she was able to play her videos out loud in the past.  I told her it was because I was trying to sleep but she wasn't having it.  you just got fed up and told her it was because I said so and if she had a problem with the she could leave. Then she shut up. I have a bunch of potted plants on our back patio and today I went out there and saw trash in them. In the past I found cigarette butts and random pieces of paper but this time there was a whole water bottle in one of them.  So I asked her if her or her boyfriend had left it there and she went berserk. According to her I should never have asked her  that because there's no way she would do something that mean and I should have assumed the wind blew the trash into my plants.  now keep in mind we're on the second floor and  there was no trash anywhere on our back patio except in my plants so it looked deliberate. I just figured maybe her or her friends tried to chuck it over the railing and didn't quite make it.

But I was wondering if this was normal? I'm well over her so I'm not sure why I dreamt about her.

That sounds really crazy when I type it and how it has been a year. I’m still thinking about the past and dwelling on it like crazy but I’m sure now he’s moved on. We still go to the same school together. No, I don’t want to hear about how I should talk to him again. I’m pretty much done. I just really want to get over this now.

I found out today from her best friend that she's smoked cigarettes before and that her friend walked in on her having sex in the bathroom on Wednesday. She's done some stupid things before- I've caught her following a porn account on Snapchat when she was 12, or following inappropriate Instagram accounts, I've caught her sending nudes to boys, but as far as I'm aware, she just gets a slap on the wrist and she's told not to do that anymore. She's only 14 and bad behavior like this has been going on since she was 9 ish. I have no idea where to go because my parents haven't done a lot to stop her in the past and I've gotten mixed responses from my friends. One says to tell my parents immediately, the other says to confront my little sister first. I have anxiety and both of the options sound really scary to me, but I know I have to do something.

I’ve had a very hot and heavy relationship with this guy for the past 6 months but over the past couple I have seen traits that just make me uncomfortable. I know I’m not perfect by any means but loud obnoxious behavior in public really makes me uncomfortable and is almost a deal breaker. I am very involved in my education and he has no plans to go back to school, and honestly I think I would prefer to have a mate that is kinda in the same situation as me.
I have decided that I do not see this going long term for us, but the problem is I can’t bring myself to break up with him... or I don’t know how. Once I push him out of my life I will have no one but my mom and my roommate... and that will be lonely. I know I can’t have the best of both worlds and string him along just because I’m afraid of being lonely again... but I really don’t think I want to be with him anymore.

422,"I’m going to try and summarize things to the best of my ability, as this would be incredibly long if I went over every detail.

I met someone online a few years ago and we grew really close, to the point we seemed to know each other completely, people would joke about how close we seemed. At some point I ended up taking a break from my online life for a couple months to sort some things out. After coming back, I noticed that she seemed slightly different in how she acted. After hanging around her for another few months I noticed some bad decisions she made involving a group of friends she had been hanging around for as long as we had known each other. On top of that, there were some inconsistencies with what she had been telling me about her life up to this point. I had briefly mentioned this to her (only to have it brushed off with a light reassurement) but I felt the need to have a bit more of a serious talk about it, as it genuinely seemed to be a problem at this point, and I was becoming genuinely conceened. She ended up cutting off all forms of communication with me when I asked about it. I grew extremely worried and did some research, and after looking into a few things and fact checking everything she said, I found out that she lied a lot. From messing with someone who had some romantic feelings for her because a friend of hers talked her into doing so (he was part of the group I was worried about), to lying about her age (claiming to be older than she actually was) and giving a different name. It seems she’s a compulsive liar, but at the same time she told me the truth on a really personal level with some extremely personal information, so it seems she didn’t distrust me, as much as she just lies about basic things or when she’s pressured too. I tried to re-establish communication so we could talk things out and try to see eye-to-eye but she wouldn’t even say a word to me. It’s been awhile since we last talked and I’ve tried to move on, but I’m constantly worried about what kind of trouble they could get into and how they might be used by their “friends”. It’s become a major hinderance in my life, and it’s not getting any better.

I feel she doesn’t have any ill intent and can be very responsible when need be, but she’s easy to fall under peer pressure and have a habit of lying about things she doesn’t have to, so I can’t really dismiss things as if it was all just her fault or dismiss all of her faults in all of this. She also opened up my horizons quite a bit and helped me through some tough times. I certainely wouldn’t be the person I am today without her. I understand I probably won’t be able to be on good terms with her anymore, but I want to be able to at least make her see that doing these things isn’t okay and she should be more careful with who she surrounds herself with. I don’t want anyone else to be hurt by what she does, and I don’t want all of her lies to come back and haunt her one day.

Follow up situation that happens around the same time, I’ll try make this short.

A little after my friend first left, another old friend decides to pull something. Making a long story short and trying to cut anyone else’s personal info out of this as much as possible (since this is my post, not theirs), he ended up not liking me. He grew incredibly jealous of certain things and started throwing insults and blaming me for all his problems because of a mutual friend of ours that stopped talking to him for a few reasons. I ended up sitting down with him for hours through a lot of what he said. But this is someone who knows about the first incident and I told about my past suicidal thoughts (which weren’t “past” at the time) and he said a lot of hateful things. As I said, he also blamed me for a lot in his life. After a four(?) hours of this, I left him to blow out steam and I would return tommorow, but when I left he started pulling a “I’m so sorry” act while being careful not to actually take back anything he said. I decided to leave entirely when I realized how manipulative he was trying to be. He went around spreading some false rumors, which was annoying but manageable. But eventually he came back to me and basically said that if I didn’t listen to him whenever he wanted, he would spread rumors and slander to my first friend and the group I’m worried about. I had no choice but to give in to his blackmail. After months of constantly being blamed for everything, having my personal feelings constantly kicked at, and chances of even possibly reconnecting with the person that has me in a nervous wreck being on the line, something gave in. I kind of just stopped talking online as a whole. I didn’t talk much anymore anyways due to my state after the first incident, but this time I just stopped as a whole. I don’t know what they think happened, but whatever it is I think he stopped. The sad thing is that whatever happened, he started gloating. Treating my disappearence as a victory. That’s that, a few bad eggs spoiled the bunch for me, and I haven’t had any kind of social life since.

Thank you for reading all or part of that. I hope it didn’t feel too much. At some point this felt more like a rant than a formal request for help, sorry. Also, I’m sorry for vague time frames, but some events blur together in my memory due to all the events that happen, and it’s hard to track down specfic dates. Regardless, I would really appreciate advice on how to approach the first situation and what I’m even supposed to do with the second.",28Sep2018,1

430,"Hello all, this may seem.....weird(?), but I need a little advice.

There are two yard sales going on literally across the street from me and I really want to to go, I have 20$ in cash that I walked to the local gas station for earlier today, just for this occasion since I saw them setting everything up.

I love yard sales or second hand, but I have cripplingly bad anxiety. Like, I don't work, and I really never leave the house, unless it's for something somewhat important, or I'm with my husband. People in my(small) town seem to be quite close I think, and I don't chat with my neighbors, but they chat with each other.

I probably have this made up thing in my head about how they hardly see me unless I'm feeding my cat on the front porch, or leaving with my husband. It's around 5:30pm right now, and my husband is at work and won't be home until about 8pm. I was wanting to head over alone and shop around, hence the reason I walked to the gas station (that took a tremendous amount of effort and planning on my part), but I really think I will have a panic attack if I go and shop around, and I really don't want that in front of my neighbors or anyone for that matter. It's the feeling of eyes constantly on me/ the intimacy of yard sales. I'm already worked up.

I was thinking about maybe walking over and asking how long their ""stuff"" will be out, and if they could maybe leave it out a little longer for my husband to get home, and tell them he loves yard sales or something of the sorts. That way I can get in, and then get out fairly quickly. But honestly it seems more of a pain that way.

445,"I (20f) just recently started at this school where we all live in the same building and are around each other basically 24/7. Because the program I am in is 9 months long, we have been discouraged to begin any romantic relationships as they can cause all sorts of problems. This other student (18m) has begun showing signs of interest, whether intentional or not. At first, I thought he was being friendly and kind, mostly because I wondered if I reminded him of his sister back home (everyone here comes from different countries, and we’re all far from home). However, events in the last few days have made it more clear that it is otherwise, and I believe that he has interest in me. 

I have been quite forthwith with he fact that I am in a relationship already, not waving it in people’s faces, but not hiding it either. But, because of having to live in close proximity with the guy for the next nine months, whether it’s intentional or he doesn’t realize what he is doing, I believe clarity is needed.  So how does one go about saying/starting a discussion like this without 1)giving false hope 2) being a complete ass
