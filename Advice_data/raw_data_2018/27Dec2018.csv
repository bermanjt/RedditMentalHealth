2,"I’m 15 and a freshman in high school and dating has never been high priority in my life. You know with sports, a social life, and grades. But the most beautiful girl I have ever seen sits in front of me. I’m not afraid of rejection ,but the thing I am really scared of is that because almost all high school relationships are predicted to end I don’t want to be in pain and have this girl be in pain as well. Also, I don’t want this one chance to get to know each other have a terrible end and have the since of regret that I didn’t wait until I was older and had more time for a girlfriend.

3,"Hello to anyone who clicks this, but I've rented out places before, but in more ""professional"" circumstances, signing lease forms, etc. However, after recently getting a job a bit far off from where I am currently, I was looking into other areas, and found a really cheap deal on craigslist. The problem is, after talking to the owner/manager of the place, I feel like it is sketchy, or just a scam, but I have no proof, and I'm usually just skeptical in this situation. Here are some emails posted by the owner/manager with blurred out names, etc, and would like some advice if the situation I am in completely normal for people renting out, or if its just a scam, or if i'm just overreacting.

[Email one, with me asking some questions](https://gyazo.com/bc4769a8ea4e55853809aa8e438c3ea5)

[Email two, with me asking about utilities, internet, and possibly meeting on the 29th](https://gyazo.com/1deb1563fdd520ff882d1b2b41864d5a)

[Email three, responding to email two and owner/manager wanting the application form](https://gyazo.com/26f1b9274bf19112678f18be0ff654af)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not quite familiar with renting out a ""room"" or ""property"" that isnt owned by a company or such, and is this type of situation normal? Additionally not signing an actual paper form, etc really doesn't sit well for me. But yeah, the place is really cheap, and decent with pictures, so I was wondering what to do in this type of situation.

Thanks for your time, and hopefully I can get some advice on this.",27Dec2018,1
4,"Hey guys! 

New years is coming up, and my boyfriend told me that there’s a lot of family that will be staying at his house (parents house). I USUALLY wouldn’t mind, because Its not my house its his. But I just learned Im probably going to be on my period, and Im going to want/need my privacy and space. I told this to my boyfriend and he completely understood and apologized for not letting me know the size of the family (30+ family members will be staying. WTF) anyways, I work at a hotel and I can get a discount at a hotel, which is close to his parents house, but I feel like Im being a complete bitch. Does anyone agree or disagree? 

P.s when I get my period, I get really emotional/with bad moods wings, and bad cramps (I stay bedridden)",27Dec2018,1
5,"Hey people from Reddit,

I need some advice on what to do on New Year’s Eve. Well, it’s not a problem what you may think of, I actually have a problem because I’m staying at my friend’s house, me and him only and he invited me but I’m not completely sure about that. I mean, I don’t know him much (I started university in October and he joined to our group one month later more or less) but I started to talk with him first and I really like him. He likes me too but we are both a bit shy to each other, it doesn’t happen to other people (I don’t get it).

I would like if we meet at his house and there’s no awkward moment but I’m really scared of that, so I’m thinking what can we do together. We were talking about watching movies, playing games and other stuff but I have this feeling like it’s going to be awkward nonetheless. I don’t know how to behave.

Thank you in advance and I wish you happy new year! :)

6,"I have never told anyone this because i was afraid of what they might think of me or say. Here goes. So 3 years ago, back when i was doing my diploma, I met this girl. We met at the smoking corner, as one of our friends introduced as, and we hit it off almost instantly. We exchanged skype details and talked on skype as soon as we both got home. We talked everyday for a week, and no surprises, i started liking this girl.. She was a few years older than me, but it did not matter to me at that point. She said she liked me too, so we decided to go out and watch a movie together. We were holding hands, making out on escalators, etc.. all the lovey dovey couple stuff..  Anyways, another week passed after the movie, and the two of us went out with a group of friends, after which she invited me back to her place, to have sex. Now i was an 18 year old at the time, my birthday had just passed a month ago and, i was a virgin. so obviously if a pretty girl asked me to have sex, my hormones are gonna get all excited and say yes to this, so i did. We had sex a few times that month and also went out a couple more times after that. 

Now here's something i did not know about this girl... She had a boyfriend back home... if i had known that, i would have definitely been against all of this lovey dovey behaviour. She told me this after we had been ""going out"" for a month.  She said that she's doing all this because she doesn't like that other guy anymore, and is gonna break up with him when she goes back home in the holidays, so i agreed. Ofc i wasn't gonna say no and let go of this beautiful girl. After which, holidays had begun and she went back to her country. Here's something else i found out only after she returned home. Her bf had been living at her place, this entire time. Yup, you guessed it, they were sleeping on the same bed when she went back. This irritated me so much, but she said she was gonna break up with him, so i kept it together. In the meantime, while waiting for her to return, i was planning all these dates we were gonna go one once she was back. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few days in, she stopped messaging me as often as she normally would. When i asked, she said she cant message me when he's around or he wouldnt like it. Here is what i didnt understand... WHY WAS HE STILL AROUND?? This is why. She hadnt broken up with him yet. Instead, a few days later, she broke up with me. Not even directly, but through a facebook relationship status change that my friend screenshotted and sent me, asking me to confront her about it. When i asked her about it, she said its coz of her family pressuring her. Then i asked.. ""So, is this it? are we breaking up?"" and her reply was ""yes, im sorry."" and just like that, it was over. all my plans, gone. all my hopes of us being together, gone. it took me a few months to get over her. but i feel like it messed me up in the long run, because now, I still feel like theres an empty void inside me that im trying to fill. coz literally any girl i talk to and end up getting close to, i start liking. I just feel like im spending all my effort on getting a girlfriend, to sort of, fill that void.. because i love life hasnt been going anywhere, i need help guys. how do i overcome this feeling? i dont want to end up liking every girl i talk to, but its like i have no control over it. i just have this desperate need for affection.. coz in my head, the only way this void will be filled, is if i have someone who loves me, and someone whom i can shower with love. i could really use some advice as to how i can overcome this feeling of emptiness.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

got close to girl. girl became gf. girl already had a bf (that i didnt know about). broke up abruptly. now i feel lost and empty. looking for a gf in every girl i get close to. need help to overcome this feeling of desperation..",27Dec2018,1
7,"I hit my head when I was drunk tonight so passed out in bed (in my PJ’s).

Bf and I have been living together and dating for two years so we’re pretty set on each other’s boundaries and preferences 

Except tonight I woke to him fondling with my hand and using it to jerk him off, but I pretended to be asleep until he proceeded to rhythmically jerk himself off with my sleeping hand and I felt precum make my hand wet.  I quickly sat up and confronted him and he flat out lied, saying it was a joke and as he“pulled  my hand up one time” I apparently woke up- a complete lie, since he used my hand for a good minute. He proceeded to guilt me and ask why I saw him as a rapist. 

1) he knows I was raped and sexually abused in a similar way when I was a young teen/child 

2)”a joke”- he knows I’m prudish when it comes to physically sexual jokes. I don’t find that kind of thing funny at all.

How do I deal with this? What do I say? That I woke up and know he was actually using my hand to jerk him off? He’s  very defensive and angry that I got upset ",27Dec2018,1
8,"If I were to write out the whole story, everything that's been said or done to me by employees or managers , it would take hours. I've been with this company for 6 years, in the new building for 3. Since moving , alot has changed. The rules might as well have flown out the window along with any amount of respect you are supposed to receive as a worker. 
Let me give you a for instance : yesterday I had come back from a long weekend (yes I was forced to work Christmas day) 
And was going over the stock. Alot was missing. I made note and the first manager said there was nothing to be done about it. My job is based on the stock I have , so not having it makes my job that much more difficult. 
I waited for the second manager to start his shift and repeated my need for stock. He didn't hesitate to call the first one and both came in to directly accuse me to my face that I must have stolen it since it was ""there yesterday"" 
Which according to my fellow employees was not. 
I kindly and politely explain that I'm just trying to do my job. I sell the stock, you give me. And it's my job to tell you if I'm out. This inferred more attitude towards me and alot of tension as they both angerily raid the stock room while questioning my intelligence.  Because I ""must not be looking right"" 
When they couldn't find it and realized they had to fill out the proper forms and go to the main office to get my stuff, they were even worse. God forbid they do their job.

This is a normal day. 

I know what everyone is thinking. Just change jobs. Well here's why that's not as easy as you think. 
I suffer from severe depression and have difficulties working regular hours. I make a sufficient amount of money here to survive by working only 2 days a week. I honestly don't think I could work a normal job or do five days a week. 
And now you're thinking ""well if it's only 2 days a week, just deal with it"" 
And by God I wish I could. You don't understand what it is to be constantly yelled at and mistrusted and tested by people who think they are better than you.
My boss is a coke addict who I've SEEN steal from our safe to gamble with! Head office won't even bother looking into to because there is no one else who wants his job, so if they fire him or he leaves, they suffer. Manager once asked my friend to find him cocaine, and when he said no, he was sent home only 2 hours into his 10 hour shift! And again, there's nothing we can say or do without punishment. Such as losing a shift or being suspended. 

My days have been filled with just ways to get these horrible bosses out of my life! How I could sabotage them or hurt them as they have hurt me.
The rest of the job is wonderful. I have many many regular customers that only want to work with me. I make great money. And I don't work alot. But I'm still going crazy with anger! 

What's my next move here? Please be aware that I live on my own, with alot of debt , so minimum wage jobs are just not an option. And I have a degree in theatre so.... Not much help there ;) 

I want to slash his f6#king tires! I want revenge. He makes sure to make my life and those around me an absolute living hell and if it wasn't for him, (and a few other heads) my life would be bearable.

Sorry for the rambling ",27Dec2018,1
9,"So around 8 months ago i got out of an abusive relationship. Let’s call my ex Lucy.

Lucy would reprimand me for having intimate feelings and gaslight me when i was attempted to be intimate. She’d talk about how other men look great and would scoff at my body. She’d threaten suicide and etc if i didn’t praise her or tried to talk about an issue, etc.

Now the part about how she’d critique my body is what still scars me til today. She ridiculed me and humiliated me daily. I developed an eating disorder (i was obese. i’ve lost 70 lbs since then.) She would harass me about my stretch marks and if i couldn’t get hard, as my SSRIs that i took for depression affected my sex drive. She would talk about how beautiful other men were and how ugly my body was. She’d constantly call my body gross and disgusting and talk about how she wanted muscles and stuff. She constantly compared me to pornstars and how awful my body was to them.
 
Luckily i am out of that relationship. But i still feel pain from it daily. I’ve been with this girl who i really really really like. The difference between them is night and day. I’ve been with her for 4 months now. (Yes i know i got into another relationship fast. I should’ve recovered) Recently we were talking about sex, as it came up naturally. She told me she watches porn; which is fucking awesome, she can do whatever she wants. I watch porn, she watches porn, everyone watches porn. My problem is that it makes me gun shy and anxious because of what Lucy used to do. I know she’s not gonna i ridicule me or shame me. But i can’t get rid of that deep feeling where i get sick and anxious and just shut down. I don’t know what to do. I want to enjoy my self not only socially but physically with this girl, and my past experiences are making this.... extremely hard to say the least. 

I don’t have anyone to go to as everything from the past makes personal stuff extremely hard to talk about. I mean i have before, but i feel awful after i do it. I need advice.

10,"I'm 23 and I have found myself in a place where I have no friends and no social life and I have no idea how to change that. 

I've never been someone to have a million friends but rather one or two very close ones and typically a girlfriend. And I'm also not really the most outgoing person but certainly not awkward or an asshole. 
Over the past year my life has changed a lot and I have graduated from school, started a new job, and broken up with a longterm girlfriend, all of which have impacted my social life in different ways. 

I've tried to be social by going out and playing bar poker, something I really enjoy. The problem is I find myself in this weird position where I'm young enough to be most people there's kid and I'm not in school looking to party like I'm in college like the rest of them. 

Ultimately I'm just sick of working 5 all week to come home and have nowhere to go and nobody to do anything with. 
It's starting to make me really down. 
I feel like my life is slipping me by. Like my 20s are going to disappear and I'm never going to have a social life or find a partner or anything like that. 

I've tried to not let things pass me by. Going to movies, concerts, etc alone. Not letting that deter me from living my life. But it's really starting to eat away at me",27Dec2018,1

We chatted today over the phone, and he said today was best for him so I texted him my address (mistake, I now know). 

He calls me a couple minutes later, saying there's a great repair place close to me, and I should take it there first since they are the best. I told him I didn't really want to transport it, but he said I should just take it and if they could do it for around what I had offered in my ad, I should let them do it to save us both the trouble. I took it, they said they could fix it for a good price, so I left it with them. 

In the meantime, the CL guy is texting me other good places to take it if they couldn't fix it. He also said he called some friends who knew some stuff about the machine. I call him and tell him thanks, but the first place was good for me. He asked if there was any way for him to help, or if I was willing to pay him a finder's fee. I told him no. He acted mildly irritated and hung up. 

Now, he's texting me asking for money for his expertise, research, and a finder's fee. He called me a bunch of names, and said he should ""go down there and smash that machine"". Then he emailed me and said ""This will come back to you scumbag"" and some more about what I ""owe"" him. 

I got spooked and told him I could PayPal or Venmo him $20 for the recommendation. He said $50 in cash delivered or I can fuck off. 

I tried to explain to him why I didn't ask for or need any of that other stuff, but he keeps insisting I meet him in person and deliver the cash. 

The threats were barely that, but should I be worried? He has my address and apartment number. The last email he sent was asking me how I'm going to get him his cash, basically should I go there or should he come here.

20,"Sooooo. Where do I even begin with this one. Well, it all started a year ago with a horrible break up. Was dating a woman for almost 5 years and she leaves me a month before I was going to propose. Found out later that she had been cheating on me with a co-worker. Few months down the line I start dating someone new, 8 months into it the relationship ends to you guessed it, her cheating (I have horrible luck with dating I guess). 

A few months after that it's the summer of 2018 where I'm killing time at work by passing through tinder. A swipe left here, a few swipes right there. Then I come across a woman I had talked to a year prior but nothing came about. Remember I still had her number. Still works and we begin texting ect. She had been in a sub/Dom relationship with some dude back then and still was. Didn't expect anything more then brief convo. Well, it continued and continued to the point where we eventually met and immediately hit it off. Not dating, more of a fwb thing. She still had her sub/Dom thing with the other guy while I was kept hidden. He's an older guy with essentially a life going nowhere (unstable job, back to back DUIs). Well, over the course of the last few months, the fwb thing has spawned some feelings between myself and her. However she is afraid to say anything to dom friend due to thinking it'll kill her friendship with her. I'm 24 and know hey, life can go on and I'll find someone else if worst comes to worse.

He has never directly said it to her, but she has overhead it multiple times and has also been approached by people who tell her they heard she was the store work mule. This is something that particularly has been bothering her and that she can not get over since it is a reoccurring statement that is said. What I would like to know is if there is anything she can do about it (other then quitting) and how she would go about it. 

She is a hard worker and they give her shit about everything (she had a major surgery where she wasn’t allowed to work for a certain amount of day) she works full time (6 days a week) so she only has off 1 day and on multiply times a month on her day off they require her to show up for a “work meeting” so she basically never had a day off. Also they make her work every single holiday, while they don’t work any holiday because everyone else that works their is literally related (hence family business) I honestly just feel she is being mistreated and would like to get any advise that would help and would be much appreciated.

25,"I own a gaming/workstation PC with a DVD drive in it, and a TV with two Nintendo consoles and my PC connected to it. I used to have a dedicated Blu-Ray player connected to it (Luckily, I didn't get rid of it) in place of one of the Nintendo consoles because my TV only has 3 HDMI ports and 1 Composite video output.

When I tried playing back a 4:3 DVD movie on my Blu-Ray player, it just stretched to fill my 16:9 TV screen (I can actually tolerate the pillar-boxes; they are far more tolerable than image stretching), but if I play the same DVD on my PC using Kodi, it maintains the proper aspect ratio! Now, you may be saying ""Well, you could just change the image settings on your player,"" but the problem is that I don't know how.

That is when I decided that I want to simplify things and get myself a Blu-Ray drive so I can watch Blu-Ray movies on the same device where I watch my DVDs and Digitally stored video files instead of a separate player just for the sake of convenience and so that I don't have to constantly switch inputs on an HDMI switcher only because my TV doesn't have 4 HDMI ports. But one problem, I cannot play commercial Blu-Ray discs on this thing because of DRM. So, I decided to purchase a copy of PowerDVD (also because I'm intrigued by their unique features other than just Blu-Ray playback which made me ditch Kodi).

And it all worked fine, until my drive started opening all by itself a few times every time my computer booted up or woke up from sleep mode. Then, when I tested the drive again, I found out that it couldn't read anything anymore! This is my punishment for buying USED!

Now, I'm back to square one. What do I do now?! Do I need to buy another NEW internal Blu-Ray drive, stick with my dedicated player with less convenience and purchase myself an HDMI switcher (which is cheaper than a drive), or stick with Digital Downloads?! I DON'T want to resort to STREAMING, because I don't want to constantly contribute to my internet's data cap (I recently upgraded my wireless internet to an 802.11ac wireless card, so speed wouldn't be as big of an issue here), and also because I don't want to be boxed into the download provider's ecosystem and sacrifice even MORE convenience (No wonder people are still pirating movies!)!",27Dec2018,1

34,"This is something that i’ve been thinking about for a long time, but never bringing it up since that would make me feel like an ungrateful brat. There are many things that makes me feel this way though they do have good qualities and I still love my dad since he’s a far better parent than my mom, yet I don’t live with him anymore.

Mom:
- I feel restrained from leaving my room when she’s at home and avoids her unless my sisters are with me
- she only gives me one meal a day on weekends and doesn’t even make dinner everyday during the week. When she does, most of the food is something that I’m allergic to or doesn’t like.
- I go to bed hungry almost everyday
- I’ve kept basically everything in my life a secret from her since a period a few years ago when she would force me to tell her everything about my social and love life. 
- she buys me stuff and later brings it up to make me feel guilty and ungrateful
- I don’t get any kind of allowance
- I’m constantly in fear of her lashing out in anger and screaming at me
- I didn’t get any choice as to which parent I would get to live with since she told dad ”I’m he only one who can take care of her”
- she gets passive-agressively mad when I decide to spend time at my dad’s place
- she keeps the kitchen extremely Messy so I always have to clean it and then comes with the ”I do everything around here”
- when I used to get bullied in school, she would tell me that she felt sorry for the bully
- I overheard her telling my sister that something is wrong with me and that’s why I get the extra attention
- she’s never said anything about it, but sometimes it feels like she’s embarassed and ashamed of me in front of others
- she told me it was my faulth that I was abused by my 8th grade crush
- she tells me that I’m not a kind person
- in 8th grade, she took a day off work just to watch over me constantly during a day in school, I wasn’t always allowed to be at school and missed the majority of that year. She later forced me to leave my friends for the one that she used to go to.

Dad:
- when I lived with him, he would always threaten me to sell/kill my pets or to give my Favorite stuff to my sisters. (He actually sold my previous pets but haven’t Done anything like that since)
- I would always leave my old phone on my desk in case If he would get mad at me and take the old one instead of my actual phone (I don’t need to do that anymore)
- We used to have a lot of fights when I was around 12, but it stopped
- when he used to be the one who woke me up in the morning, he would touch me when I didn’t want to and would grab my feet to drag me out of bed when I wasn’t feeling well
- he used to tell me that I had No chance for a good future (not anymore though) 
- he took my younger sisters and moved away
- after the recent divorce, he is often talking behind my mom’s back and about their failed relationship which is making me uncomfortable
- yet, he is still not someone like mom whom I avoid at all costs and I talk to him a lot more about everything except my mental health (he wouldn’t take it seriously) and my love life (he used to force information on him like mom did, but not anymore). He does in fact, get me a lot of food and allowance in my mom’s place.

39,"Hi everyone,

TL;DR at the bottom. Thank you for any guidance given. Firstly, this is not a traditional finance question. It has some thing to do with mental health and psychology. I don't know where to ask this specific question, figured I would ask it here. Also, I'm ESL so I apologize for any English mistakes beforehand.

Many years ago, a very good friend of mine inherited a million dollars. At the time, she was very young. As you can imagine, giving a million dollars to a very young woman might not be a good idea as due to the fact young people aren't mature, lack experience, and lack resources to make smart decisions. Chances are they won't invest it, won't buy property, or anything relevant to maintaining that wealth. 

Long story short, my friend unfortunately spent all of her wealth within a couple of years. They would buy the latest model car, buy the latest clothes, phone, etc.

Many years go by after the wealth diminished, I've seen her grow to become more and more depressed about the situation. It's very sad seeing this person transition from something you think won't get any worse to something that is much worse.

The context of this situation is that they are living from paycheck to paycheck with a minimum wage part time job, and often times that isn't enough so they borrow (beg) for money just to survive. They also don't have any post-secondary education.

Their depression is getting a lot worse recently and with that their alcoholism is getting worse as well. Is there anything I can do to help rebuild my friend's financial situation? What would I even say?

Important to note: I don't think they would self harm themselves in anyway whatsoever. They are just very depressed over their own decision making they did when they were younger and now they are unfortunately paying for it. I'm just very worried and want to help.

**TL;DR My friend spent all of her inheritance. She is very depressed over the matter. How can I help?**",27Dec2018,1

42,"No idea where I could vent/get advice -- I hope this is an alright place.


Basically, my mum cheated? On my dad when I was 14-15, and my dad's been really bitter ever since.

And I understand why (ofc) he would feel like he has the right to play victim, but every time I hear them argue, I just wish that they would just split up. And not in a angry/whatever way either -- I genuinely think that it would be for the best / would happen sooner or later anyway.

Mum's been the only one working in our family for five-ten years now (dad's been a stay-at-home), and I had never felt that my mum wasn't there, or whatever. I have no hard feelings towards my mum, and as I understand it, we moved cities since, and she's basically just been either at work or home from then.

Frankly, what is most frustrating to me is how well I can hear them argue the same way over and over again through our thin af walls, lol.

On one hand, I want to tell them how I feel about it, but maybe it's not the place for me to do so, it being mostly about their relationship and all. But also, I feel like this affects me too, right?


I guess my question is do you think I'm allowed to speak up, or should I be minding my own business? Or even just what do you think I should be doing?

43,"I have been the HR manager for this company for 3.5 years now. The owner/CEO is very controlling, rude, and harasses employees. It is difficult to keep the company staffed with his actions. Over the years, I have slowly begun to stand my ground and he has not taken a liking to my so called “defiance” as he likes to call it. The only way for me to do my job correctly is to stand my ground on policies and procedures. 

About two months ago, a division within the company began to split off into its own entity. I was asked by this division to transition over with them to become their FT HR manager. This would entail me working from home 4 days a week and going into the other division’s office that 5th day. This was discussed between the COO of the new division and the owner/CEO, and an email was written with the plan and no disagreements were made. 

Last Friday, the owner/CEO decided he was going to make changes to my work from home plan without discussing with the COO. I explained to him that I thought it would be best for them to discuss and inform me of the plan moving forward. This is when he decided that I’m being defiant and he could fire me whenever he wanted. I informed the COO of the discussion and she stated we would discuss on Wednesday(today). I stuck with my transition schedule, which was work from home 4 days. The owner/CEO called me late this afternoon to discuss some payroll items and asked if I was working from home, in which I replied “Yes.” He then turned irate and yelled obscenities at me for defying his orders, in which I explained that the COO and I were planning to discuss the plan today. His last words to me were, “well then, I appreciate your services.” I took this as, you are terminated. 

After about 10 minutes, he realized what a dumb mistake he made and had the COO call me to state I wasn’t fired, but I will be written up for insubordination. Now, I have to go into the office tomorrow and confront him face to face. 

Do I bring up the fact that a handful of other employees work from home on a daily basis? Do I ask why I’m being harassed about this change when others aren’t?

Last week we went on our annual Xmas works night out, there was 12 of us 7 guys and 5 girls. I will call the gay friend John for this posts sake.

The night started normal, John was spending a lot of time talking to one of the girls (who I had previously had a one night stand with, everybody knows it's no big deal). Out of nowhere he comes and sits by me and starts asking really weird questions like ""Do you ever get horny at work?"", ""Jessica said you have a pretty cock, is it?"" (Jessica is not her name, and yes that is the actual question he asked me). I felt really uncomfortable and laughed it off and pretended I had to go the bathroom. He followed me there and used the urinal next to me, he was glancing downwards so I quickly finished and told one of my co workers how he is acting. Fast forward a few hours and we are all dancing, and it seems to have blown over until he walks past me and brushes his hand on the crotch area of my jeans. I get a little annoyed this time as I'm not here for this, i have a girlfriend and he knows I am not gay. I pull him aside and tell him he needs to stop Because it's making me pissed and uncomfortable, he agrees and says it was just a joke.

We go into another club and he does it again, this time actuslly grabbing the crotch area and squeezing, it was crowded and dark so it was hard to see for the others. I flipped and pushed him away from me pretty hard, he fell over and hurt his elbow and ankle and apparently his ankle is in a cast.

I explained why i done this and one of the other female workers confirmed she had   him in the previous club brushing his hand on me.

I am in my last semester of law school. My apartment has poor insulation. I have been aware of this since I moved in and have been complaining ever since. We recently had some snow in the area (the South). The snow melted and balmy weather returned. With the increased temperatures, the snow melted, and the roaches needed to crawl up from wherever the F they were hiding so as not to down. I saw about five per day (American roaches) for a few days then decided to bomb with a Raid Fogger. I left for 24 hours and returned to find over forty roaches (both American and German of all ages) dead on the floor, with some still crawling, frantically, because they were upset I had poisoned them.

I only have one more semester of school. Moving during the year would be a pain in the ass. I'm not going to get another place because there are basically no affordable places for 6-month leases. I'd have to move in with my mom, which would save money. Her place is 30 min away from the school and my externship.  I have a good relationship with my mom, but I'm 26 and enjoy being independent. Plus, I'm not really emotionally prepared to leave behind life in the college town my university is at. (I've traveled extensively and lived abroad, I'm not like trying to hold onto my youth, it's just I have certain relationships going down in that town I want to sort out before bouncing.)

I put out another fogger and left for Christmas. I think when I go back I'll find more dead roaches. Foggers only kill those out that day. Since the place has such poor insulation, they come and go as they please. I'm disgusted by it, but I'm hesitant to go through the lawsuit and break the lease, and move back in with the mom.

There is a group I've been playing online games with, fairly frequently but only for the last week or so. The last couple of days have been rough, mental health-wise (I'm diagnosed autistic, depression and generalised anxiety disorder) and I couldn't do it today, although I tried. I was unable to speak to them at all and, in panic, bailed without explaining why I was going which I know did inconvenience them (co-op game). I don't know them all too well and don't want to disclose personal info with them about me but need to apologise as I would like to continue gaming with them.

78,"I apologize for the length, there's a lot to the story.

TL;DR: 20 year old brother is a bum who still lives at home, won't get license. Dad leaves work to drive him and two younger siblings to work and school. Mom won't put pressure on brother to pull his own weight. Dad broke foot, can't drive. I will have to help out with driving if brother won't step up. How should I approach subject with mom?

I am the oldest of 5 children, ages ranging from 16 to 24. My 20 year old brother (we'll call him Peter) graduated from high school almost two years ago. Since then he has become incredibly lazy. It took almost a year after high school to convince him to get a job, now that he has a job he only works maybe 3 days a week,15-20 hours, plays video games whenever he's not working, doesn't get out of bed on his days off until 1pm or later, has no plans for furthering his education or career, refuses to learn how to drive despite living in a suburb where it's a necessity, and all around just doesn't contribute to my parents finances or household in any way.

I have been trying for about six months now to convince my mom that she needs to start putting more pressure on Peter to start working toward something, and especially toward at least getting his driver's licence. Currently, my dad  
(and sometimes my 22 year old brother, who we'll call John, or I) will leave his job to take Peter to his job about a mile away from the house. Neither of my other two siblings who are still in high school can drive either and my dad takes them to and from school every day (this will be important in a minute). My mother refuses to make Peter walk, take an Uber, or ride a bike and continues to allow him to take advantage of everyone else. She argues that she remembers having to drive John and I around to our first jobs. The way I see it, the situation is different in that we had been 18 at the time and were working on getting our license or saving for a car of our own. Peter is doing none of those things and doesn't seem to have a problem relying on everyone else to chauffeur him around. 

This hasn't really affected me so much so far, other than having to drive from my house to take him to work once or twice when my mom was desperate (just for reference I live a half an hour away from my parents). A few days ago my dad broke his right foot, didn't go to the doctor right away, and continued walking on it. My mother forced him to see a doctor today and it's looking like he is going to need surgery to fix it. That means that for the next month at least, maybe even two months, my dad is not going to be able to drive. 

So this leaves a problem of who is going to take my dad and Peter to work, and my two youngest siblings to school. My mother will probably do some driving, but since my dad will need to take the time off work to have the surgery she won't be able to take a lot of time off to take people places. Both John and I are in college full time and he has a job as well so we cannot always be available to drive people where they need to be. The best solution would be for Peter to get his license and at the very least drive the youngest siblings to school and drive himself to and from work. He has his permit so if he just scheduled his test he could do it, but I doubt that my mom is going to force him to do that. Which means that the burden of trying to coordinate 5 different schedules is going to fall on John and I. Including my own commute time, that will mean that I will have to drive an average of 3 hours on days that I need to help out.

I don't have a problem helping out sometimes but I do have a problem with them relying heavily on me while not expecting Peter to step up and help at all. I have a feeling that if I say I cannot help my mom will take it upon herself to get everyone where they need to go and will end up stressed out and resentful toward me for not helping. How do I approach the situation without seeming like I am trying to parent for her or just coming off rude and unhelpful? I have no problem helping family, I just don't want to be taken advantage of.

TL;DR: 20 year old brother is a bum who still lives at home, won't get license. Dad leaves work to drive him and two younger siblings to work and school. Mom won't put pressure on brother to pull his own weight. Dad broke foot, can't drive. I will have to help out with driving if brother won't step up.

82,"Hello,

Excuse the lengthiness of the post - but I am looking for some advice, specifically on whether or not I should seek a professional or for any advice on coping mechanisms or strategies to set boundaries. 

I am a mid-twenties college student (male) living with family. I come from an impoverished family, my mother was incarcerated and my father was absent from my life , both from an early age. Since then, always feeling like I’ve had to hide my private life from my public life, which has really impacted who I am today. My grandparents raised me and I was fortunate enough to do well in school and attend college.

Coming from a traumatic childhood, it can be stressful living with my family, especially as a mid-twenties male with his mom and grandma. Before you say move out, I’ve lived on my own for a year or two in the past, but my grandma implored me to live at home as a way to save money on room and board, which I am extremely grateful for. My family has always been supportive of me, which I have made clear I am thankful for as well.

However, my family dynamic at home has always been peculiar. My mother is like a bipolar “adult-child,” and my grandmother enables her - my mom has no rent, has no job, goes to beauty school, and always has an excuse not do anything. I feel more mature than her and have even read literature on how to cope with adult-children parents. I feel like my grandmother can be a narcissist who is controlling/manipulative. For example, my gma told my family I’m gay (unbeknownst to me, until my mom and brother started talking with lisps around me jokingly). She expects me to be extremely outgoing all the time, eat dinner at the table every night like during childhood, and anytime I stand up for myself or voice my opinion - all hell breaks loose. Seriously, it’s like a bomb goes off, I see a very twisted anger in my grandmas eyes. A couple weeks ago I said I need to set boundaries because all my gma and mom do is poke at me with questions and pry into my business - to which she said I am not a part of the family and that I can move out - even though she implored me to move in and complete my masters degree. They tend to sweep everything under the rug and expect me to do the same.  I’ve stated to them both multiple times, sometimes I just need my space, to which they think I am just a bipolar depressive person, and treat me like I am crazy. 

I’m becoming much more aware of my emotions, and there is an underlying anger, especially towards my mom who I think takes advantage of my grandma and is ignorant towards how she affected my life and unaccountable for any responsibility even today, and my grandma when she expects me to be a certain way. I do my best to just bite my tongue and laugh it off, because I know in a couple years I will be done with my degree. If anything I just don’t feel like I can be myself, or that I am really misunderstood. Also, my dad is trying to be apart of my life for the past year or so, but he’s been absent, and even when we visited him, he “roughed me up” at a young age - aka he was somewhat physically abusive and mentally isolated.

The last thing I want to sound like is like I am victim blaming or something like that - I understand that my grandma is a provider and what that means, she is doing her best to care for my mom and I. I respect my elders and I’ve had to work hard to overcome adversity. I truly do appreciate the support my family does show - which I do reciprocate. Don’t get me wrong. I am happy that I am being supported and can see how my grandma is trying to help out. But a lot of the time, the prying and question poking, the games and negativity, the expectations and routines like kids eating at a table, can be stressful. I am down to earth and recognize how fortunate I am, I just don’t feel like myself at home. I’ve never felt like I could be myself, especially at home, like a black sheep. School is/was always my outlet. I guess I am just looking for tips/advice on setting boundaries, or if I should seek a professional. 

Edit: I am also concerned if whether or not I may exhibit symptoms of mild Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD). I live a functional, healthy, professional life, but some of the symptoms are like spot on, perhaps stemming from childhood trauma. ",27Dec2018,1

89,"So as I type this post, I am currently a sophomore in high school. I’ve known my best friend, we’ll call him C, for 10 years now. We met when we were 6, and we’re 15 now. He’ll be 16 very soon.

Around 6th or 7th grade, C’s parents were divorced. It was a nasty process too. Both of his parents were all over Facebook trying to insult the other in any way. 

But now that I’m a bit more mature, I’m starting to worry about C’s mom in particular, and looking back, she has kind of worsened since that divorce. So I’d like to ask Reddit if I should be worried about her. From what I’ve met of him, C’s dad is fine. He’s a little weird on political Facebook, but whatever. I think he loves C and his brother, and that’s enough for me.

I’ll start from the first sign I know of that worries me:

Back in 5th grade, we had a little friend group of four people, including me and C. We played games like Minecraft and stuff while Skyping each other. It was very rare for all four of us to skype at once though, due to schedules and stuff. But C in particular was usually absent. And there were two reasons why. Firstly, C didn’t do well in school at the time, so they cut his screen time hours to focus on school. Sad for us, but understandable. Secondly though, was his brother. He has a younger brother who, at the time, was probably... 4? So the thing was, C’s parents didn’t care at all what his brother did, so his *little brother* would kick him off the computer when ever he wanted, even if it was C’s turn to play on it and we were in the middle of a game. If C didn’t oblige, his **little brother** would HIT him. And if C tried to even thought about hitting him back, his parents would flip out on him, but they did nothing if his brother did! Yeah, blatant favoritism. For the first couple of times our group let it slide, but after awhile we agreed “yeah, this is a problem” and just convinced C to defend himself. He actually did, and thus his brother stopped eventually. 

I mentioned that back in 5th grade they restricted C’s screen time, but fun fact, they still haven’t lifted that restriction, and he’s almost 16.  **C is 16 and they literally still don’t let him play video games during the weekdays**, and even on the weekends his time is really restrictive. Gaming is me and C’s *main* hobby (it’s my *only* hobby atm. We love smash bros).
Actually, only his mother still has this restriction. Now that they’re divorced, his dad is fine with playing games during the week, like a fucking normal teenage guy. I’m honestly starting to get pissed off at this rule, because C is my only friend, and I’m pretty sure it’s true vice versa as well. I’m fucking lonely and can’t make new friends, and being told I can’t hang out with C is fucking irritating after 10 years.

Anyways, next worry:

According to my dad, he thinks C’s mom really doesn’t like him. Now, if this was years ago, I could understand. My dad looks pretty intimidating tbh. But seriously? It’s been 10 god damn long years. They need to get over whatever it is. 

Here’s another story: I walked into my second hour class one day, where C was also in. Sat down at a computer, and noticed C was a bit down. I asked him what’s up, and he just straight up said “My mom is trying to take me away from my dad.”
I was really taken aback by this. I couldn’t really give much advice either, my parents divorced when I was 6 but they were really peaceful about it. All I could tell him was “it gets better” and “that probably won’t happen” 
I get that divorces are nasty, but trying to forcefully separate your kids and their parent when they don’t want that to happen is pretty disgusting if you ask me.

Me and my own mom noticed troubling things on Facebook. After the divorce, C’s mom got remarried. The four of them (mom, stepdad, C, and brother) have a lot of posts on there doing “family things” like boat rides and trips (things I know C doesn’t care for...) But what’s weird about it is... C’s mom just sort of pretends the stepdad IS their dad. As an example, the stepdad was in a parade, and they took a video. As he came into view, C’s mom says “here comes Daddy!”. There are a ton of examples of this all over her Facebook, and it really troubles my mom in particular. She’s told me before: “How do you think that makes them feel? They have a dad...” And she’s right! It’s kind of fucked up and it’s like she’s in denial or something.

This particular story troubles me the most:

Last year, C invited me to his house for New Years Eve. His parents were having a party. I figured “Oh ok, nice excuse to play games.”

I got there and they literally told us that we weren’t playing games tonight. We were to sit and... just twiddle our thumbs I guess.

The reason? They didn’t want to “deal with the little kids wanting to play too”

Lamest fucking excuse ever if you ask me.

I remember after awhile, C’s stepdad actually tried reasoning with C’s mom to let us play a game (although briefly, like r/therewasanattempt material) and I actually saw her hesitate! She said no.

Yeah, I was ready to just call my dad and leave. I’m not twiddling my thumbs for 4 fucking hours and then go to sleep.

Thankfully, all of the kids left and they were cool with it. But it didn’t end there!

Both his mom and stepdad got REALLY drunk... as did literally everyone there. I really wasn’t happy about it

Maybe this is a normal thing, but I have NEVER seen my own parents get that drunk in front of me. I’ve seen them have a few beers or some wine, but they’ve never gotten drunk like that in front of me. They at least try to be responsible parents. 

So those are my worries... am I just overlooking everything or should I be more concerned?

From my point of view... it honestly seems like she just doesn’t like males at all for some reason. Doesn’t like my dad, for one. Pretends their dad doesn’t exist, disregards the stepdad... idk. Just help me please. 

TLDR: friend’s mom has questionable behavior, like being overly restrictive and in denial of their divorce.",27Dec2018,1

It doesn't help that everyday my abusive father likes to come over and treat us like shit. He is so out of his mind that even if the police were involved there would absolutely be a shooting between them and him.

When I moved away for uni, it was just my little sister and my mum left in the house as all the older siblings had left already.

Makes me so sad she only told me that now.

Do I just hold everything in tomorrow and saviour the memories with her as I don’t know how many more I’m going to have with her or has anyone been in a similar situation and could please give some advice on making her come round? I feel like all my solutions are so childish and I feel naive writing this but I really don’t want to believe there’s nothing I can do.",27Dec2018,1

102,"So basically I’ve been friends with this girl who I called my best friend for more than 6 years. Long story short we’ve been having an ongoing problem in our friendship. It’s usually us getting distant between each other because we’re both busy or me getting hurt (not that often) but she feels bad about it and just stops talking to me. Most recently I got hurt because we were supposed to hang out and then she canceled on me (which happened often) and she went ghost on me and wouldn’t talk to me. I saw her at school but it was just small talk. I still felt hurt which was probably immature of me but idk. So about a week or two ago I messaged her basically saying haven’t heard from your or anything in awhile so what’s going on? I saw her at work since we both worked the same day and she asked if we would talk later. I agreed but still remained a bit distant. We didn’t really talk at work but messaged a bit throughout our shift. She suggested that we stop being friends because she thought we were just hurting each other. When I first saw that I thought it was ridiculous. I messaged back and didn’t get a response. Then later on I said “If you’re really thinking long and hard of why we shouldn’t be friends just say it. Better to rip it off like a band aid instead of keeping me in the dark.” Keep in mind that she gets very distant and doesn’t really tell me much. Also I’m not the type of person that judges when you tell me something. I try to give the best advice that I can. But anyways she basically said we shouldn’t be friends anymore and we shouldn’t keep holding onto something that wasn’t there. Personally I didn’t feel the same way she did, but I agreed nonetheless because I felt like there was nothing I could say or do to fix it. I felt sad but also very upset. So the goodbye wasn’t very mature on my part but there was no bad wishing or name calling and I told her not to contact me anymore. Which a part of me regrets saying that. The next morning I messaged her to hopefully reconcile but I found out that she blocked me. I had a friend who had her number send that to her in attempts to hopefully reconcile. But I got no message in return from her. I felt distraught by the whole situation and wondered how could she easily let go of our friendship just like that? The next couple of days I cried at just the thought of her. I was talking to my friends about the situation and what I should do and they told me what she said about me behind my back. One of them being that I just used her for rides. Which I got pretty mad at that she said that because that wasn’t true and she offered. The rides were from hanging out. (Btw she doesn’t reach out to me saying she ever wants to hang out, I usually have to ask if she wants to but I stopped because she was busy or would usually cancel so I stopped asking eventually). I don’t just freeload off of people like that. Second she felt like she was being replaced by a close friend of mine. I also got upset at that too. If she really felt that I personally feel like she should’ve reached out to me and called me out on it. She could’ve also asked me to hang out but she never did. I know I should’ve gotten a hint which was probably my fault but I didn’t see her as often and she never asked to see me. Thirdly she said that I was different. I do admit that I did change but in all honesty I feel much happier than I was a year ago. Sure I changed my friends but I got closer to people who I feel like will be there for years to come. After hearing all of this I felt betrayed because how can she call me her best friend if she talked about me behind my back? This is the only the stuff I’ve heard, I’m not sure what else she said about me. I can say now and honestly that I don’t talk bad about my close friends to my other friends. I really thought if she had a problem with me she’d reach out to me. It hurt finding out all of this from other people. I really don’t think I’d want to reconcile our friendship. If she was truly my friend she would come and talk to me instead talking to other people about me. My mom even said to me “friends come and go” and I thought long and hard about that and she was right.  Anyways the point of the story is before this whole situation I ordered online a Christmas gift for her and am still contemplating on whether or not I should give it to her? Please give me advice.

103,"As basic and generic as the title sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

Prelude: I'm in my first year of college and have had 2 girlfriends in the past but I don't consider them ""real"" relationships because I was young and never even had an official ""date"" with either of them.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple months ago I went to a club meeting with 2 of my friends to check it out and immediately upon walking in I saw this one girl who caught my eye. Later in the meeting,  we started playing a jeopardy style game and when we had to split into teams she came over with one of her friends to sit by us. She introduced herself and asked what our names were and when I introduced myself I got the usual ""no way that's your name!!!!"" (my first name is Stone which is very uncommon so by now I'm used to the responses). We hit it off a little bit but I didn't really think anything of it. I continued to go to the club meetings when I could (depending on school work and timings) and each time I talked to her a little and it was good conversation and she seemed like a really cool person. My 2 friends who I always went to the meetings with told me that she would only come over and talk to ""us"" if I was there, which caught me off guard. They also said that apparently she was talking about me a lot to her friends, but all I really got from it was that she was talking about my name and how cool it is. I can't 100% confirm these claims my friends made, but I trust them. This all happened during the rough time frame of September to November.

&amp;#x200B;

In December now, I started to think more about her and started to become interested. I had tried looking her up on social media before, but had no luck because all I know is her first name, what college she's going to, and that she's a senior. Low and behold though, I got way too into my head and couldn't stop thinking about her. I'm ashamed to admit this but I went through an ""extensive"" search of the internet to find her and after about 3 days, (not constantly looking, but I was constantly thinking) I actually found her profiles. Her Instagram is private, but her Twitter wasn't so I started to read through some of her tweets and they honestly reminded me so much of myself and what I tweet (dumb type humor that shouldn't get liked and never does, at least for me). This made me happy and I think this is where the crush really developed. I haven't seen or talked to her since before all this happened so all I could do is think, and that was my downfall. I kept making scenarios in my head and planning my life out with her which I know is extreme and unhealthy but I can't help it. I keep telling myself that I have a version of her in my head because I don't actually know her but that doesn't stop my brain from coming up with situations that'll likely never happen.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I met this girl a couple months ago and I can't get her out of my head now. I developed way too deep of a crush and am now stuck in my own head.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I need to talk to her and get to know her. I know that I have a version of who she really is in my head. I tell myself these things all the time but my head just won't stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice? Anything related to helping me get out of my head or to stop hyping this situation up or to calm myself down over a crush on a girl I barely know. Thanks in advance, it's much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: I wanted to add this in because it's relevant. I'm not good at relationships in general and talking to people. I'm more introverted and always seem calm and collected on the outside, but more than likely I'm freaking out on the inside. My past has destroyed relationships to a certain extent, but one thing I know is that I want to find love and someone to trust and someone that I can just tell everything to. ",27Dec2018,1

106,"I really wouldn't consider myself a bad person in any way really. But I know I can be unpleasant to be around. I don't really laugh at jokes, or just in general, I'm kind of stonefaced honestly. I listen to other people but I never really know what to say, and half the time I end up somehow just telling a similar story myself which is fine sometimes, but I know it means I unintentionally talk about myself a lot. I get irritated easily with stupidity and I know I sound annoyed when I try to help. 

I could probably keep going, but the truth is I don't want to be like this. It makes it hard to make friends and meet new people. I'm a pretty anti-social person and kind of a loaner. I just sorta float around not really making any meaningful connections, and when I leave a place to the friends I have made I just drop off the face of the Earth.

I didn't really notice how alone I was till yesterday when I spent the day alone. I didn't even bother buying a tree or decorating this year. I thought I'd still at least maybe hear from one or two people saying Merry Christmas or something but the day came and went without a word from anyone. I can honestly say I haven't cried in over 12 years, but I will admit I cried myself to sleep last when it really hit just how alone I am.

I've tried the online dating thing to maybe find at least someone to be alone with, maybe bring me out of this pit, but on the rare occasion I get a match I rarely get a response when I message them, and when I do they usually loose interest before we can get to the actual date, or on the extremely rare chance I actually get a date it's usually a one and done.

I'm his younger brother and live/work in VA and also stay at my parents house in NJ almost every other weekend and for long holidays. We try not to leave him at my parents house in NJ or anywhere by himself although sometimes we do for convenience sake.

The real answer I need is a foolproof cure for Schizophrenia (w/ pronounced deficit symptoms, he's not hearing voices or seeing hallucinations). He hasn't worked in over 10 years (he's 30) and is depressed about living with my parents, not having a girlfriend, and just having nothing to do.

Note: He takes a really small dose of abilify and has gone to counseling but they never think anythings wrong with him. He seems really normal when you meet him, just quiet and withdrawn.

109,"We live in quite a big house, myself, my two younger brothers and my mother. Our dad left when I was about 13 in 2006. I found myself supporting my mother through the divorce, despite being largely incapable of understanding the emotional turmoil a divorce puts on a family. She and her friends often tell me (to paraphrase) 'I was her rock' and I helped her maintain some semblance of stability through the divorce.

In spite of this we have a relatively well functioning family, my mother and father only communicate if they have to, they are far from friendly. But my brothers and I maintain an admittedly inconsistent but still healthy relationship with each of our parents.  However, after I moved out of my mothers house to go to university in 2011, all of my subsequent visits I have noticed a build up of clutter and general disorganisation in the house. Every time I have come back to the house between semesters I have made some effort to clear things up. It seems year after year i'm doing more and more to try and get the house into an acceptable state.

Skip ahead to present day, now that my brothers and I have all flown the nest, and it has pretty much become an in-joke between us that 'Mum needs an intervention for her hoarding'

This year in particular I've found it particularly difficult. It's at the point where I'm embarrassed to bring my partner home for Christmas or even have friends over because we're having to tip-toe around shit she has bought from QVC. I'm sure that my brothers feel the same.

 Hence me reaching out.

I have tried to speak to my mother about her shopping habits but she always gets defensive and makes me feel as though I'm attacking her. I've approached my brothers about actually having an intervention, or at the very least a serious conversion with her. Our 'intervention' will be happening within the next week (while were all home) and I just wanted to seek advice for how to handle this situation. Or if this is even the right approach!

110,"As is known to occur over the holidays, I am informed as of two days ago that I will be divorced. I am taking this news reasonably well because the marriage was never considered super-viable. She is highly unstable and ours was the kind of relationship that lurched from one crisis to the next. The marriage was predicated on the idea of ""if not you, then who?"" Plus she needed a constant companion for her traveling-- we moved from New England to British Columbia so she could pursue her education. I was just happy to be out of the U.S.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, now it's over, and the trouble is that I've been caught flat-footed. My social life back home has deteriorated as my old friends have scattered across the world themselves. There's not much for me to return to, other than my parents, but in any event I can't stay here. I've been making a modest living in sales (which, in this case, is not a euphemism for ""cashier"", thank God) but I don't have a highly developed or instantly marketable skill-set. Long story short, the rug is being pulled from my rather tenuous existence, and I don't have a recognizable career that can dictate my next move. It is a crisis, in the true sense of the word.

&amp;#x200B;

So my thoughts turn to this: what jobs exist out there that are always hiring, that are unappealing to most people, that impose structure on your life? Better still if paying rent becomes a non-consideration. The most obvious and timeless answer is ""the army"", but there are several things that make me balk from that, not least of which is the fact that I'm in my early thirties, and a little too old for a new recruit. My curse and blessing is my particular flavor of depression, which makes me act slowly but also renders me effectively immune from boredom. If I thought there was still such a job as ""lighthouse keeper"" I would pursue that, for example. 

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts have turned to American universities abroad, since they  can be found in most developed countries, and there's presumably a lower barrier of entry than the state department. I would like to see more of the world, since I've had a near-exclusively North American experience thus far. Thoughts?

I’ve always considered myself to be relatively intelligent and rational when it comes to making decisions, but I’ve been feeling completely worthless lately. It’s not nihilism, it’s just that I fail to see what I contribute to society. Though I have previously considered it, suicide seems like it might be a good way to rid my friends and family of my unwanted presence. My older brother committed suicide back in May, and I was thinking of doing the same for my own independent reasons. Any emotional pain I would normally feel, I am numb to. I am the butt of my friends jokes and an almost endless source of hate. The only reason I socialize with said friends is because of my twin brother’s connections to them.

So let's get started.

In 6th grade I went to a regular school like most people and I wasn't exactly proud of what I was. I was just a stupid fat kid in the sense of I was trying my best to be accepted and liked by people by doing stupid shit and being an overall dumbass. After 6th grade wrapped up, I left that school and was homeschooled for a year (7th grade) and it was a nightmare. I'm not really going to go into a lot of detail but there was just so much shit happening in my life at that time that I really didn't focus on trying to learn. Over the course of that year I realized I don't want to continue being this shitty person anymore. So for the entirety of summer I tried changing myself. I lost about 60 pounds (I was 230 and now I'm about 170) and tried to be more mellow and nicer to the people around me. Then I was sent back to the school that i was originally at and I fell back into my old ways of trying too hard to be accepted.

I do admit, yes, I've said some mean things to her, but her side is exaggerated to the point of making me out to be some harrasser who attacks people who talk to them. I try to iterate that she's lying to my dad but he frequently shuts me down (I am a bit afraid of my dad so I can't really do anything about it). She also yells at my dad, making him miserable, and he in turn takes it out on me.


My mother also has a habit of turning every time I walk into a door or make a loud noise into me ""lashing out"" on physical object, and rants on about how I'm ""never going to find work since I can't control my anger"". She berates me incessantly on being negative but is almost hell-bent on turning anything I do into some show of aggression.

117,"This just happened so excuse my bad phrasing in advance. Let me start off by saying that I have never really experienced my parents getting along so I am not the best judge for saying what is tipping the edge and what isn’t. We have been in situations like this before but I think never to this extent. 

My dad occasionally threatens to kill himself whenever he feels we gang up on him or that he has been treated wrongly. My sister, my mom and I worried at first but we’ve come to learn that this is just his way of expressing how unfair he feels he’s being treated, however weird it may sound. He has never really physically attacked my sis or my mom and even though he sometimes gets angry to the point that he starts throwing stuff around the house, threatening to set the place on fire, he has never really done anything with that impact.

Today, my grandfather’s funeral took place which forced my mother’s family to see my dad (whom they all dislike but that’s another story). All went fairly smooth and I go home at the end of the night. My mom called me around 2AM, crying and of course I immediately knew what it was about. This has happened a few times in the same manner. Now I jump in my car and head over to mom’s, once again with my dad missing and probably off on some mission to make everyone worried again. Apparently he was not pleased with the way the family had treated him tonight as they did not do much effort to make up or talk to him. On the way back home, he told my mom they should kill themselves together and starting speeding on the wrong side of the lane, not stopping for anyone or anything. Mom told me she screamed and cried but he would not stop. I am honestly so scared that anything would happen to her while I couldn’t care less about him. 

We have tried so many times to help him improve or get better but whatever we do, he keeps relapsing to his old, true self and I feel it is getting worse. On top of all that, he works with the Police and we have actually once called them after he jumped my girlfriend’s car in an attempt to not make us leave after an argument but they say there wasn’t much to be done. Same thing happened when he threatened to set the house on fire when we were out with the family. It feels like there is not much we can do without evidence as it has just been words, until now. 

My mom is afraid to leave or divorce him as my dad keeps telling us that the house, money etc. is all his and I actually have no idea how to check all this, my mom doesn’t either. I would really appreciate if someone from the outside could take a look at this as I don’t know what is right or wrong anymore. 

Advice on the financials and if we should report him, how we should report him or what other steps to take is very appreciated.

118,"I'm a college student currently in my 5th year. I started to develop anxiety towards my academics starting around my 2nd year, but I didn't seek help for it until recently due to this idea that no one would take it seriously. It started out with me experiencing panic attacks during exams, which led me to fail them and it later developed into experiencing panic just trying to start assignments. It really began to take a toll on my academic performance and caused me to fail a number of classes (hence why I'm still here for a 5th year). I started getting help for myself this past January through my school's counseling center. It was helpful for the problems I was experiencing at the time and it definitely helped me get through the semester. That semester was the first semester where I passed all of my classes in maybe two years (in previous years, there was always one or two classes where I received a failing or near-failing grade). It made me so happy and so hopeful for the future. 

 I am fortunate enough to come from a family that is willing to pay for my education (I try to help them by working during the summers to get money to help pay for my tuition, I did not work during the school year in the past). I also attend a school that is quite expensive and telling my parents that I needed a 5th year to graduate was terrifying to me because I felt guilty of the fact they would need to spend thousands of dollars extra on me for this extra year. However, when I told them this, my parents were originally very supportive of me. I just needed to graduate after that 5th year and get a job afterwards, which I was on board with. Ever since then, I've been planning my future with the assumption that I graduate after that 5th year.

During this past fall semester though, my anxiety seemed to get worse. I started seeing a therapist off campus because I felt like my schools counseling didn't offer me long-term solutions to my problems. I really struggled this semester because of my anxiety and I didn't feel like I was performing well. Grades just came out for the semester and I failed an important class for my major. THis class is a fall-only class, so I can't even retake it in the spring. I'll have to stay for another semester in order to graduate. I feel terrible about myself. I told my parents that after the semester before, things would get better for me and I would do better and they wouldn't have to worry about me anymore, but I just failed an important class. I can't graduate now. I have to tell them about this, but I'm so afraid to. I feel like a disappointment to them, they believed in me and I failed them. I'm so afraid to tell them about this, but I know there's no way around it. 

While I don't think they would do anything drastic like kick me out of the house or anything, I feel like I would just be a disappointment to them in their eyes and I would be that failed daughter. I've messed up all the plans that they helped my lay out for the future. THey also said before that they wouldn't pay for anymore schooling for me, which is understandable, I;m trying to find ways to make money to pay off the last class, but I feel so overwhelmed right now, it's hard to think straight. I don't know what I'll do about jobs after I graduate or what I'll do about housing until then. Everything is up in the air right now and I don;t know what to do next.

2 weeks later we were at the pool and she sent a snap to her female friends (selfie and bikini top showing) and accidentally misclicked him. She told him it was an accident and said it's fine but that she looked good.

1 day later he texts her telling her he has feelings for her. My friend told him he doesn't know what he's saying, but he started saying stuff like ""why do you think I stay up til 6am talking to you on the phone"" etc. 

She kept trying to tell him that he's confused, that he only decided to say that after seeing a revealing photo of her, that he's mixing up feelings of sexual attraction with actually liking her. He eventually told her to just forget about it and he didn't wanna talk about it anymore (it was clear she was rejecting him).

Thing is, she has feelings for him. And she had feelings for him even before he said that. But she didn't want to act interested because she's not sure if he feels the same way or if he's just interested in having sex with her.

She tried bringing it up a few days later (so that he had time to think about it) and he told her he was just being stupid and shouldn't have said that. She got hurt and told him he can't mess with her feelings like that. She asked me for advice and I told her that imo, he's still interested in her (whether sexually or romantically) but he only said that because he was already rejected and thinking she's not interested, he didn't want to be rejected again.

And then a few days later he tells her that he's had a lot of time to think about it, and he's pretty sure he likes her but he doesn't want to ruin their friendship because of it.

They're meeting up on Friday to talk about it in person but idk how I feel about all this, and neither does she. I told her that if they do end up dating, she should go really slow and not get sexual with him until at least a few months later, just to make sure he's not in it just for the sex.

Anyone have any advice about this? Thank you

120,"Im 17 and very mature for my age as im told my a lot of my lectures and it was a quality highlighted in my academic reference for university so im not just making it up!:’) 

I recently posted in r/relationships and even after saying i was 18 instead of 17 people still replied in the sense that i was a child. I was looking for mature adult advice because i am extremely mature for my age and in a very mature and great relationship but all the advice was either condescending or written like it was for a 15 year old whose relationship they did not take seriously. 

In my day to day life i get this a lot, the people who know me and understand im capable of acting mature and beyond my age have no problem and i am treated great! My one friend who is in my law lectures is 27 and its so refreshing that she treats me as totally equal and I don’t feel at all like shes friends with me for pity etc. She asks to meet up and we enjoy doing stuff together! 

My problem is just that a lot of people presume that because im 17, any troubles i have are just “teenager issues” or that my relationship is just one of the teenage phases. It really wares me down as i feel like i am never taken seriously when it matters most. 

I know I can’t get people to treat me the way id like, but im asking for advice on how i can better deal with it when people are condescending/discriminating against my age. ",27Dec2018,1

122,"My boyfriend and I have been together for roughly 2 months now. It was a fast start, we met and hit it off super quickly and got together within a week. I'm the type of person that generally avoids politics when meeting new people because with the area I live in, there really isnt that much room for anything other than maybe slight variations of the norm. My boyfriend has always been the type of person to occasionally make some anti semitic jokes, and I figured out quickly hes a WWII buff but that really didn't alarm me much at first.

The problem started when we inevitably started discussing politics. I am very openly nonbinary, and very openly bisexual, and I have been incredibly upfront with him about both of those since the moment we met as I find pride in my identities. So like it or not, as a bisexual, nonbinary woman of color I have to live a pretty political life. He makes comments that I dont know whether to take as jokes or not, and the more he talks the more concerned I'm becoming that I might have gotten into a relationship with an actual Nazi, so much so that he actually called himself one. 

I'm in deep, he took Christmas photos with my family this year, we work together, and our lives have become very intertwined very quickly so ""just break up with him"" isnt really an option.

123,"This may seem petty compared to all of the other posts here, but it's been tearing me up for a good bit.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, to put things into context, we've known each other for 4 years now, we live far apart so we meet up every now and then in the city. As bad as it sounds we did try dating 2 years ago, but we both agreed it was going nowhere. 

Anyways, we were walking towards a restaurant we wanted to try and we were using her phone to use Maps for navigation. About halfway through, a notification pops up on her screen of a guy saying ""We should just have sex"".

First thing that comes to mind is that some dude is harassing her at work, so I bring it up by asking if there's anything she wants to talk about or something she wants to get off her chest, but she says there isn't anything. So I told her that I saw the notification and she just brushes it off as nothing without any other information other than saying ""He's just straightforward"", adding that ""Nothing will ever happen between me and him"".

Where I fucked up bad was that I stayed quiet for a few minutes, and she asked if I was alright, because I seemed ""Salty"", or at least, that's what I thought she said, but she actually said sulky. But that still means jealousy in some form, right?

Anyway, I get annoyed because something like that isn't just ""nothing"" and that ""He's just straightforward"" doesn't tell me anything, and I guess I tried not to think of it too much, but my dumb ass obviously still has feelings for her, because I completely ignored that last statement and drilled the fact that some guy is asking for sex into my head instead.

But regardless, we just go about our day as usual, eat somewhere and have drinks, which is probably where this all went to shit. Because at the place where we had drinks, I took around 10-14 shots of soju, before checking out a few places she wanted to go to before heading home.

On my way home, the soju hit me hard and I felt incredibly down, thinking that she doesn't really think of me as important enough as a friend since she didn't bother to explain who that guy was, and if it was some dude she was seeing then you do you. But I called her later that night to see if she'd explain it this time around, but she just says ""That's just how we always talk to each other"".

This had me PISSED, and I felt the call after a long pause, because she doesn't seem to care at all about how I might feel, because I had originally assumed she got caught up in some trouble, but instead I felt like a complete dumbass by what I had heard.

\-

The following day, I message her if I was able to call her that night just to get her side and actually understand who this dude was, but instead she just messages me.

Basically, she says that they met at a course she was doing a few years ago, they had a crush on each other but knew nothing would come out of it, so since then they've just been flirting and teasing each other, and because of that they \*we're\* friends. 

And yes, I also brought up what she mean't by ""Salty"" and sent a trembling rabbit sticker. Real fuckin' embarrassing.

Then I told her that I was more annoyed with the fact that everything she had said on messenger, she should have just told me the day before, and she replies with ""You should have asked"", and that details and things are what should be asked of her (?), and right after, she says ""Sorry I fucked up"".

I also told her she should've put herself in my shoes, how terrible I must've felt when I thought she was getting harassed, only to get vague as hell answers.

And she replies that she has, but she trusted the person to know what they were doing.

Then I apologise for misunderstanding, and adding on to it, I said that how could I trust her completely, when I don't REALLY know her to that extent and what she's thinking half the time. The fact that it was a vague message that pops up that definitely makes it seem like something was going on. Isn't it okay to care about the wellbeing of a friend? 

And the last message she's sent since then is that I shouldn't be sorry and that it's her fault for not clearing things up properly.

\-

And here's the thing, I know having even a little bit of leftover feelings for her is bad, and is probably the main reason this all happened. But this is because she's the one that broke the silence after the breakup, TWICE, and has been the one mainly asking to hang out and have gaming sesh's at night.

At one point she got drunk with a friend of hers and continuously asked me to go get her, because ""she couldn't walk"", and I was genuinely concerned so I went to see what was happening, and she was fine enough to get home.

I assumed there was something between us, but buried that a while ago, especially now with what's happened. What's more important is that I'd rather not lose a friend like this. She might not be used to confrontation? I mean, she's a self-proclaimed introvert who loves playing video games, reading and plays a bunch of instruments.

\-

It's been 5 days since then, I sent one christmas tree and party popper emojis on christmas eve, and I think I fucked up there as well. 

I've spoken to all of my close friends and family, and family have all said to just cut her out of my life, but I'd rather not, at least after I find out how she really feels.

We played along but when things started getting really weird ( talking about coming over to my friends house, showing us a ""good time"" in the woods, teaching us to make out, telling us to get naked etc. He was within walking distance of her house ) we backed out and stopped responding. We panicked, but luckily that very week she had also begun homeschooling, and therefore she never had to see him again, on the bus or otherwise. Luckily that year he went into highschool and I didn't have to see him. Thing was he was in band/marching band. I am also in band and want to be in marching band, but the thought of seeing him almost every day fills me with dread. As it is I already get panic attacks whenever the HS band comes over to perform, because I am always worried he will recognize me. None of my friends understand what it is like, not even the friend who went through the conversation with me. She doesn't have to see him anymore but I do. My friends at school don't see him the way I do. Everyone in my school is always talking about how awesome he is, how cool and ""trendy"" he is.

127,"I'm 18 years old and I've been doing relatively good the last few days, but I stumbled upon a video yesterday and I can't get it out of my head (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVNUT9valTg). He talks about when he tried to get out of his depressive state by making friends in high school and doing well in school. Now he's out of school and failed at making friends and works at a minimum wage job.

I relate to him in many ways. I also spend a lot of time surfing the internet, watching YouTube videos and playing video games. Which is pretty much similar to ALL the things he mentioned. I've also dealt with depression and anxiety, but been doing a lot better lately but afraid that this video will put me under the ground again. Will I really end up like him in the future? I relate to him way too much, it's almost scary (besides the suicide attempts, hope I never get there.. but he did as he got older). I ended up agreeing with a lot of the points he made in the video, which is pretty scary. 

He also mentioned that in his opinion people should NOT do what they want and love if it doesn't provide a stable income at the end of the day.. and my dream is becoming a musical producer. I spend a lot of time producing music.

Me and this friend have been on and off for the past two years romantically, and he can never make up his mind on what he wants. As we were talking, he brought up about how the girl had apparently been talking about how sweet his dick tastes. His friends overhearing that asked her if they had ever done anything sexually, to which she replied that she had sucked his dick a few times. I didn’t need to hear this information. I made me sick to my stomach,  especially since I still really care about him and we are still on and off in sort of a ‘friends with benefits’ situation. The other day I got upset with him over text because he said that he wasn’t sure if he wanted to continue with me because he and her had done something or talked about something, but he refused to tell me. Distraught, I slipped up and somehow brought in the topic of how she claimed she sucked his dick before and how it was sweet, because I genuinely thought it was true and was upset that they went even further. My attachment to this person is very strong. He told me that she actually never has before, and he ended up taking screenshots of the conversation. He talked to her about it this morning, and she claims that she never spoke of any of that. After that, the guy proceeded in messaging my cousin to ask if it was true and what she had said, and he told him the exact same thing he told me. Then the girl went off on my cousin, saying how she never said that, to which he replied ‘yes you did. I heard you talking to -insert name here- about how good his dick tastes’ and she fired back with, ‘wow, you really believe everything you hear? That’s really low of you’. She then messaged me, claiming it was me and my cousins fault that my friend (her boyfriend) was now mad at her and not talking. She also decided to say how I’m so low and pathetic for trying to ‘ruin their relationship’, to which it wasn’t worth my time because time itself would destroy their relationship. I’ve been keeping in touch with my friend, but he thinks I’m lying about the whole thing and that I made it up to ruin their relationship, and I’ve done nothing of the sort.

137,"So for the last few months since I've moved in with my boyfriend, tensions have gotten higher and higher between me and his best friend. Both of us have made efforts to be respectful to each other, but we come from polar opposite backgrounds. I am a white, upper middle-class girl and my bf's roommate and best friend is a black guy who grew up in South Central LA. He's had friends and family die in his arms, was in the foster system, is financially supporting a family that isn't even his, along with a host of other things that I couldn't begin to fathom the difficulty of. I've been working to understand and get rid of my entitlement and privileged mindset, but there are some things I don't know I do that I guess really bug him.  But...he's also an inconsistent, trolling hypocrite who is an asshole to me. He'll go for weeks without speaking to either of us, makes snide remarks as if I'm nothing more than a weak, entitled white girl, and he blew up at me a few weeks ago accusing me of drinking all his whiskey, (I had a little with my bf after he said we could have a little, and that's it.)  I haven't spoken to him since, and honestly refuse to if that's all he views me as and nothing more. He's made the vibe at home extremely awkward and stressful, and I don't come home unless I absolutely have to, and it's putting a strain on my work, and my relationship with my bf.  I also feel like the two of us are definitely competing for his attention.

I'd love to try and understand where he's coming from, but he would never let me in. He clearly doesn't respect me or hold me in any regard, when I've only respected his requests as a roommate. It's fine if he doesn't like me, but that doesn't mean I have to talk to him either.  Luckily, my bf who has always been in the middle, in both class and race, has been educating me despite struggle on my part.

Things came to a head this morning, and we're going to lay all our cards on the table tonight. I'll admit he's right to consider me weak to not stand up for myself, but I am afraid since my mom violently verbally abused me in the same way growing up and it's really hard for me to face again. Again, I know it's piddling compared to what he's been through, but it's like asking me to lift 250 when I've been training with 10. Also, he threatened to kill himself in front of my boyfriend and has a gun in the house.

144,"Hello,
I am a 20 something who doesn't have a huge social life, and the very big gatherings I get invited to (external to my one to one meet ups with friends) intimidate me because of a certain person being invited.
I am a female, and all of my life I have found that some females have been a bit mean to me, for (what I believe to be) no reason at all. The reason that I say this, is because, recently a situation occurred again, someone at work had a go at me for sitting on a chair during my break and telling me to move out the way because they wanted to sit down behind me...and I had no idea who she was and she had no idea who I was, and I had my back to her and didn't see her coming in...so I don't think my personality is responsible as she didn't know me. The thing is, despite things being like this, I have learned to be nice, and have actually patched things up with many who have been like this to me at work, by continuing to throw niceties and be polite, etc. But the specific gathering that I am talking about concerns me.
The gathering is a university group, where I was sort of involved in a love triangle with this girl (the certain person) and a boy. She was alright but badmouthed her friends behind their back. I felt I had to step away from the love triangle as I was being flirted with and next minute I knew she was coming round to his room- (he was my flatmate, and I will never date a flatmate again) but she didn't seem attached to him and she was overly flirty with everyone- on the same night she would be hugging him then hugging another man under his nose, so I think she liked to mess around. I stayed away for 2 weeks...I had never been in a relationship and didn't know what to do, but felt that if I stayed away I would be able to gage what was going on without upsetting her if it was her intention. Basically, the texts from her stopped (he used to show me his phone videos and texts from her would come reeling in at the same time). He stopped talking about her, and she stopped visiting, so 2 weeks later roughly I knew that it would not be wrong to move forward. She stayed away around 8 months, which I suspect was because she found a boyfriend- until my flatmate decided to invite her on my boyfriends birthday...I explained that I felt it was a bit awkward to do that seeing as something happened there ( even I don't fully know what) but it was kind of all dismissed because she is an on and off friend/partner to his best friend, who he didn't want to upset by not inviting her. So I got to the bottom of what was going on and found out that she actually didn't like my boyfriend those many months ago and told him that she was interested in her on/off partner- so she wasn't interested in him- which I did suspect.
What I didn't understand from this, is why she was being awkward with me when she didn't care about him. The tension was very much there from my part too- it made me nervous and I didn't talk to her- but she did the typical girls stuff- attempting to invite everyone but me out under my nose- attempting to invite my boyfriend to hers to do 'research'- glaring at me, even once when I bumped into her up the stairs in tears, and the worst of all. This girl was badmouthing her partner who I suspect that she got bored of and that was why she started seeing us again- she then started to flirt with our other flatmate- playing footsie under the table and sending him selfies while we were talking- ultimately kind of cheating on her partner. No one noticed this apart from me and my boyfriend, and my other flatmates started to complain when the encouraged flatmate got closer to her on a night out, as though she didn't encourage it. She visited more often and me and my boyfriend would stay away due to tension (which ultimately isolated us), and one time she came round to drop someone's stuff off. All the flatmates were here, and she chose to go to my boyfriends room and shut the door. I don't know what happened there, but he said that she was complaining about the other flatmate getting too close to her- failing to mention she had encouraged it, I suspect more happened over this, and I felt it was all to stir the drama pot, meaning, in my eyes, a huge lack of respect to me as well.
This year didn't end on a good note with her, and seeing as she wasn't my friend I cant tell you what she thinks of me now a couple years down the line. I see some of my flatmates a couple times a year and a while ago a huge group meeting was arranged which I really wanted to go to but noticed she was invited and out of fear I avoided it. I am a quiet person who doesn't like drama and most definitely doesn't like being a target of it. My flatmate knows that something happened but he doesn't know about the drama, and even if he found out, he would feel stuck in the middle as he needs to please his friend and invite her. I think he knows a bit more as I spoke about  my boyfriend (now ex who cheated and has completely left the group) had somebody (this girl) as his most spoken to friend on snap and he tried to steer the conversation away as I suspect he knew who I was on about. I know that the next time I see an old friend, they are going to ask me why I didn't go- if I could go to the next one  etc.(which probably would be in a while but nonetheless), and I don't know whether to diplomatically tell the truth or avoid it or what. I know I cant tell someone to not invite someone, but maybe I can at least tell them that if I was being targeted I would at least appreciate someone sticking up for me. I don't drink tons so unfortunately I cant really get completely drunk and not care about the situation, and I am sort of at the point where even though I will never be friends with her, I can patch up if I know that she will do with me, but I fear staying up country for a few days with someone who may be picking on me and nobody even helping to ease the situation or choosing to ignore it...I sort of just don't tolerate anymore as it isn't good for my self esteem! What should I do? I wouldn't even potentially get some moments away as, without going into it, it looks as though it would have been expected of me to share a room with her! The last one was a few months ago and I saw all the pictures and everything, and I just sort of felt really frustrated with this situation as I know I am stopping myself form going because of a person, but I just don't know how to make it easier for myself.

149,"Sooo... something pretty crazy happened last night. I had a dream of a blurry (yet still identifiable) individual that I had never met or seen before, at all. His name was in my dream, and I remember waking up thinking it was such an odd name. That morning, I looked up the name on FB just for the fun of it and turns out it’s the same guy from my dream. Anddd he lives in the same city I just moved to for school. Keep in mind, I don’t know anyone else in that city apart from the people at my school. He doesn’t seem familiar at all, apart from my dream. 

Thing is, curiosity and marvel at the weirdness of it all is getting the best of me. How the heck do I go about contacting the guy without saying “hey I dreamed about you last night lol”? Do I even contact him? I know I shouldn’t, and that it’s weird, but curiosity and interest are getting the best of me. ",27Dec2018,1

It's sort of.. a online relationship (but we are not actually dating or anything) she sees me as a friend, and I have come to accept that.

When we first started talking, she said she feels really comfortable around me, and trusts me with anything (and so she did, she told me what happend to her as a kid etc (it's really bad stuff) and I understood and tried to comfort her, telling her how strong she is etc). Now the weird part is, when I asked her about where she lives she told me the country and approx region, but there's a 3hour timedifference from where she said she lives and actually is (we often screenshare on discord). She doesn't trust me with this information, for some reason. I had asked her once, and she said ""I'd rather not say that"" which was fine by me, but she reacted weirdly. Removing me of every social media possible and application, even blocking me. We would talk 24/7, literally. In the first 2months we known each other we had about 70k messages together (about evenly split). We would write before we go to bed, and when we wake up, and during the day. Just as ""friends"".

156,"College has been pretty much the worst four years of my life. I'm not sure if it's a bad school match or I would've been miserable anywhere, but yeah.

Hopefully not cutting too much of the story out for brevity...

After being very successful in a competitive high school, started as pre-med Biology major at a major public university. I struggled significantly with Gen Chem first semester Freshman year. My whole life basically consisted of doing labs and studying, but even then it just wouldn't click, I was always below average in labs and exams. By the end of the semester, I'd stressed myself so much I'd dropped to 90 pounds. Even then, I still just barely scraped by with a C- and my hopes in that area were crushed. 

I switched majors to Psychology (I took a class I loved that got me interested, but the change was kind of forced by the university to bring up my GPA and keep my scholarship and Honors status), and put heart and soul over the next few years into working toward a future in that field. The results haven't been all perfect, but it's been continuously upward and the lowest grades I've gotten in any classes since that first semester were a couple Bs. I did a ton of research as well. But I recently applied to graduate programs in this, and so far it seems I've been rejected from everywhere. The feeling is like that first semester, multiplied by 1000.

 I have no idea what to do with my life anymore. I know I'm not stupid, but somehow I can't translate it like other people can, especially with math. I feel like I'll never be good enough for anything I love. It's felt like 4 straight years of rejection and lowering expectations;  as I said I'm miserable and my self-esteem is nonexistent.

Should I keep pushing at this Psych thing, even if it goes nowhere? I don't know what the next steps even could be. Should I take this as a sign and try something else, even though I'm graduating in the Spring with a pretty much useless Psych degree? I don't know what I would even do. And how do I stop hating myself so much?",27Dec2018,1

He then made her stay up till the wee hours of the morning just to argue with him even though she was really tired after a day out. Because of this, she was crying the whole time while she was out with us and didn't even sleep the whole night.

170,"Backstory: I am a 23 year old guy. I was in the car with both of my parents and one of my brothers (who is 21), making an 8 hour car trip to another city to visit family for the holidays. My brother was driving, my mom was in the passenger seat, and I was in the back seat with my dad. I had done the first 4 hour leg of the drive which has really only one route you can take, but the second half of the drive has 3 or 4 different possible routes of varying distances and travel times. Long story short my brother and I thought we should go one way that was in our experience faster, and he vehemently disagreed and an argument ensued.

It escalated to the point where he lost his temper and grabbed me by the front of my sweatshirt and cocked his fist and said he was going to clock me in the face if I didn’t shut up and show him respect. He proceeded to hold onto my sweatshirt and shook me while screaming at me, keeping his fist cocked the whole time. When my mom started yelling at him to let go of me, he threatened to hit her too. My brother quickly pulled over at a gas station and I got out of the car and ran inside to the bathroom. I was shaking all over from the adrenaline I guess. My mom came inside too and we hugged it out, but we were both pretty shaken up.

My dad has kind of a bad temper and can get angry and defensive easily when in an argument, but he has never, ever threatened me with violence before or used violence against me in any way. After about 10 minutes inside the gas station we came back outside and my dad insisted that I come with him away from the car so we could talk one on one. I was still really in shock and didn’t want to go with him and when my mom told him no he started getting angry again so I just went with him to avoid more physical confrontation.

His “apology” basically consisted of him saying that he lost his temper and admitting that there was no excuse for his behavior, but also basically saying that if I don’t agree with him ever I should just shut up and keep it to myself. I don’t think I was terribly out of line at all and my mom and brother both agree. The worst part of the whole thing was that after all of this I had to get back into the confined space of the car with him and sit next to him for the remaining 3 hours of the drive. 

I’ve never seen this side of my dad before and I’m unsure how to feel or behave towards him going forward. At least for now I feel like I can’t look him in the eye or really speak to him at all. I’m mostly just pissed off at him at this point for being so immature that he allowed himself to lose his temper so badly over such a dumb argument. We have always had a really good relationship and I love him and respect the hell out of him, so this really came out of nowhere. It also really, really bothers me that he threatened to hit my mom too. I have two other siblings that I haven’t told about the whole incident yet. I just don’t really know how to process or handle any of this given I have never experienced anything like it before. Also, just to make this clear again, no, he has never done anything like this to any of my family members before and no, I do not feel unsafe around him currently. Also, I know that there is no excuse for behavior like that, but I would never consider reporting this to someone or anything like that, it was honestly just a really bizarre and out of character moment for him that I don’t know how to handle emotionally.",27Dec2018,1

174,"I am firm in my decision, however I feel that it's causing tension between family.

Long story short: I Milly (mixed race- black/white)have been poor my whole life and I currently live with my bf Tom(white) and his sister Duke. She is moving out on short notice. Tom and I can afford to live here on our own but its TIGHHHTTTTTT. VERY TIGHT. So, his rich but very very cheap borderline autistic dad came out and said he would buy a house or condo and we would could live there and pay reduced rent on it.

I immediately refused. The reason being because his dad has never been particularly kind to me or Tom. He kicked Tom out at 18 for no reason, and now he always wants to see him. However he lives with kids from a new marriage and also Tom's  teenage blood brothers. He has an insane amount of privilege that doesn't he acknowledge, but actually chooses to believe that he's poor (he lives in a $650,000 house in a wealthy Boston suburb.) 

He was going to let us be homeless a year and a half ago, only because he refused to co-sign a month to month lease for fear that we would destroy his immaculate credit. (We lived in Tom's bipolar mom's house for 7 months after that, but thats another story).

 He will only let Tom borrow money in dire situations and only if he leaves ""collateral"" at his house. He claims that he always wants us to visit, and asks Tom why I never come around. Well, the last time I did I was tricked into what I thought was going to be a normal visit turning into him asking me about how much money I make, asking for my pay stubs and trying to make Tom and I come up with a Budget. We have a budget. We are living in poverty. And to me, this was condescending, rude and invasive.

Anyway, I've come to the conclusion that I do NOT want to live in any house he owns for obvious reasons. But my mom (who is extremely co dependent on her loser cheating boyfriend) doesn't see how I don't want the security etc. And Tom is worried about money, but even though it's tight and we live in the ghetto, we are ok for now. And I don't have anyone else in,my life,that I can talk to,about it really. HOWEVER...I know that I am making a good decision!!!

175,"TLDR: Want to move and have no idea if I’m making a terrible financial decision.

Super long story but short version is I need a change. I’ve been living in small town Alabama for years working towards being financially stable for the past 4 years. Bring a gay, liberal, atheist in Alabama is like being a hated unicorn or something. It sucks and I’ve been patient with starting my life as gay life in Alabama is, well, barely existent. But I told myself at one point that I’d move in three years when I had saved enough money to be independent, and two years in I decided to move to Atlanta earlier than I wanted cause honestly, I’m tired of waiting.

I told my family I’d move in June and I have to give my work management agency three months notice, meaning like a month or two from now. I work as a private practice mental health therapist (yes go figure on managing stress and being a therapist) and want to do the same in Atlanta. I have all the credentials and licenses so it’s not like I’m ill-equipped to get a job or have what’s required on job advertisements. Ive applied to some places and looking into more but most wanted to hire someone in a month or so and not 6 months from now. 

At this point my plan was to move to Atlanta anyways regardless of whether I had a job, continue to apply for jobs,  and find a job as I go. By the time I’d move, I’d have about 45k in my bank account to hold me over and estimate 3k a month in bills technically, and since I’ve never had that kind of money, I haven’t a clue of what that means financially in regards to a decision like this. My family is not big on making big, irresponsible, and impulsive decisions without a plan or at least constant income. “You don’t jump ship unless you have a life jacket” as the family saying goes. However, it doesn’t seem as easy as that and I feel like once I’m there, I’ll be able to apply for more jobs and get more connected to the community, while using my savings to hold me over, hopefully for at least 6 months or longer.

What I’m worried about is, am I making an impulsive and financially irresponsible decision to move somewhere with potentially no job instead of waiting to secure some kind of job and then moving. I’m tired of waiting and I’m always gonna have to tell people I can’t work until 4ish months from now thanks to my current job. There are jobs listed that would help pay bills and get me started but it’s hard when it’s 6 months from now. I could also Uber or work at Starbucks or something just to hold me over. 

I’m getting this gut feeling that I’m being super irresponsible and feeling guilty for what feels like ignoring red flags and just going. I know the therapist answer but being a therapist gives me few chances to talk to a therapist. I know that most people would say that shit is messy and that life isn’t always clean when we make big changes, but I don’t want to miss big red flags that could prevent me from losing my money and being fucked. I don’t want my bias towards wanting to be out of this town to be a reason I make a big mistake that means I have to start all over financially and otherwise.

Obviously, any advice would be helpful cause family is the last place I’d wanna go to.",27Dec2018,1

177,"my whole life i’ve lived in nice houses with friendly neighbors and my own bathroom. after my parents divorced, i stayed with my mom and we downsized since we were 1 less person, but we still stayed in a very nice house that was not terribly expensive. after the divorce about 7 years ago, my mom completely stopped working and lived off of her savings. she went from making $250,000 a year to now nothing. 

her savings have run out, and getting her old job back is not an option. she has no highschool or college education and its hard to get a job without those in this day and age. she spent thousands on trying to become a real estate agent and decided it was too hard and gave up. so now, we must sell our house and move. (warning this is going to make me sound like a brat but please read) she found a house that is 2 bedroom one bathroom, both bedrooms are extremely tiny and would not even fit my size full bed. the house is on a hill that makes the whole house crooked, and it is so ugly and downright embarrassing. the house is dark inside, cramped, and disgusting. there is no driveway or garage and in the middle of the woods with no neighbors. to top it off it is DIRECTLY across from a noisy electrical plant. it is seriously the worst house i have ever seen. the house is in a bad part of our town and in the most sketchy place possible. there is no other humans around for at least a mile, and the house looks so so SO easy to break into. you can also hear the buzzing of the plant from inside the home which would drive anyone insane. im more than willing to downsize again and live in an apartment or townhome and would help her pay rent. but not this. im sorry if you think im a spoiled brat for all of this, but i dont want to be put into this situation because my mom refuses to work. girls have been raped in this part of town and i have been through that before and the fact that the only vibes i get from this house are “murder” and “rape” is worrying. so bottomline, i will not be moving to that house. 

so i can try and do a few things:

1.i can try and convince my overly stubborn mother that the house is a piece of shit and we need to look for something better and let her know i’ll help pay rent (not realistic, doubt she’ll listen to me) 

2.i turn 18 in 6 days, so i can rent an $800 apartment with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and rent the second room to someone and see if my boyfriend would like to live with me 

3.i can move 40 minutes away to live with my wealthy dad who will make me attend cult meetings twice a week and not let me keep my dogs (im still in high school and i have an OK paying job in my current town, not sure about this)

178,"I just don't know what I can do for him. I am 25 and have my own life.

My brother [29M] and I were always my father's main priority. Him and our mother are divorced. He tells my brother and I how lonely he is, how he wishes he had people to do things with. He's very young at heart and wants to do things like travel and meet women. He's not very good at being alone and gets depressed.
But the thing is, he's too shy to put himself out there and meet new people.

He tends to lean on me and my brother for friendship and gets upset when I don't invite him along to to do things with my friends and I - which isn't fair. I need a father not a friend.

I feel guilty all the time because of it but I also think he just needs to be more positive and put more effort into meeting people but I know it must be hard at his age.

Does anyone have any similar experiences or advice?

I just want him to be happy.

We had multiple mutual friends, and I all but secluded myself from them because it hurt too much to be around her for a while. My friends tried to set me up with other women, and I tried meeting people on my own. Some of the women I met were awesome. But it never felt the same as with her.

186,"Through some therapy sessions in the last year and especially in the last session last week I realized I have two friends that constantly make me feel like crap. We are a group of friends who's been hanging out on and off for over ten years. Several times I've been feeling badly treated but haven't left, because I was afraid I couldn't find other friends. But I have now found a lot of other friends now and for the first time don't feel afraid when I think about phasing these two friends out.

I'm a very sensistive person and I've been working in therapy be with my anxiety and low levels of confidence. I always jump to the conclusion that something is wrong with me even though I've gotten a lot better. When I'm with these two friends they very often criticize me for very little things and they NEVER support me or compliment me. And I take this very close to heart as I take criticism very personal and obsess about it for years. Added to that I have a tendency to pine after the acceptance of those who'll never accept me because I grew up with this pattern(i think that's the reason, but there are still a lot of things I don't understand in this behaviour). It's also something I struggle with in relationships. So my therapist advised me to phase the people out that always give me that bad feeling. These two friends also struggle a lot with finding more friends on their own.

Only problem is we're going to Yellowstone on a hiking trip in May. We haven't bought flight tickets or booked anything yet, but I love hiking and we already went on a trip two years ago too, where I was the primary planner. This time we're spreading out the planning responsibility more though. There are also 3 other girls joining with whom I have a good relationship with. 

I would love to just see them less and not cause any ""break up"" drama. There are other friends in the group i'd like to stay in contact with. 

I've thought about just going along. After all I've been seeing these two guys for so long, how hard can it be? On the other hand why pay all that money to be with people I've finally mustered up the courage to leave? I also thought about coming out with some excuse about a new job opportunity (I work as a freelancer, so this excuse would be easy) but if I do that already now they might talk me into rescheduling.

I also thought about saying I bought the flight tickets when I haven't and when we're close to the trip fake illness or something... but elaborate lies are also risky business. I live with one of the girls who's also going - but I actually think she'd understand me if I was honest to her. But I don't wanna incorporate her in my potential lies...

TL;DR: Planned a trip with a group of friends now realizing through therapy two of them are super toxic for me, and finally now I have the courage to leave them. But I don't wanna cause drama by ""breaking up"" with them. I just want a good excuse to get out of the trip, and then phase out the friendship. I live with one of the good friends who's also coming.",27Dec2018,1

My family decided to get another dog the same age as Miley, our 6 yr old pupper. He was a dream dog! Regal, housetrained, great with cats, never barks, 5 years old...
Except when they got him, and went to the vet they said he was 6 MONTHS old. He pees everywhere, terrorizes my poor Amelia (un gato), and barks all the time. Guess who gets hit the hardest?
Lil old me.
He pees in my room if I leave the door open for 10 seconds (i had to clean ALL MY SHEETS 5 days in a row until i learned to keep it shut, to which i left it open for less than a minute and he runs out) and I am the one to clean up all the hallway messes. I just spent an hour cleaning cat piss, 2 dog piss spots, and a fat stack of cat shit. My mom told me she had to clean up 2 piles of dog crap right after.
I have suggested everything. Kennels, 4 ft leashes, ect ect ect ect ect. I have tried everything to get them to train him, but they wont. Now they have this stupid diaper on him, which he still manages to get out of and pee on shit. 
Its such a damper on me that I cry when I smell dog pee or clean shit, i am constantly afraid of smelling sheets, in constant anxiety that i smell like piss, im crying even typing this out. I hate it, its not his fault he isnt being trained, but I am 16  I have stuff to do, I have grades to maintain and Im constantly physically tired (i am as tired as I was when I was diganosed with depression amd anxiety, which makes me think all of this is triggering it somehow? i dont know thats a different advice post). I cant train my family's impulse purchase. He is so good for Miley, and everyone loves him, so Im the asshole if I convince my family to get rid of them. They think that every practical decison is difficult, and that they tried everything. They havent even tried. Not only that, but my other cat Mincy is peeing everywhere and not using her litter box. Shes always had this problem, but its getting worse.
What do I do? Shut up and deal with it for 2 more years then move out promptly? Ive already told them how i feel, theyve seen me break down twice because of this. Im desperate for any ideas. I cant drive yet, otherwise Id straight up drive him back to his OG owner (who lives across the state, which is another reason my family wont give him up).

194,"Posted original story to AskReddit but it was deleted because it wasn’t properly formatted. So, trying a much shorter version here in hopes of getting some solid advice. 

Have worked for a large, progressive company for the last 8 years. About 2 months ago, someone I went to high school with started at the company in a department on my same floor. Saw him on the floor, chatted for a few minutes about nothing of any importance and moved on. I barely recognized him, but as soon as I did, I was surprised he was able to get hired. Then I thought I guess people can change. We are both 32 now. 

Back in high school he was a jackass. I guess now he would be called a bully. Really an ass to all the athletes, especially those who were black or Asian. He was even suspended/expelled once for writing the N word on someone’s locker. 

Fast forward, company Holiday party. Forgot something in my car, was walking back in, saw him on his cell phone standing behind some bushes. I listened to his conversation and it was riddled with the words: nigger, kike, towel head, and chink. All in one conversation. He hasn’t changed at all; he’s worsened. 

That night I Googled him. His Facebook and Instagram are public. He is a member of a white nationalist organization. He regularly attends meeting, protests and rallies. His Instagram feed is filled with pics of him and his friends showing the white power sign. 

What do I do? Do I do anything with this information? Is what he does privately off limits? I am not someone who would normally even be concerned about someone else and what they do. But I feel very uneasy about him and with what I know.

197,"Hello,

So I have been living in a shared house for 2.5 years now in Vancouver. We have the top suite, and the landlord lives in a separate suite on the main floor.  I got a new roommate last September. She is very grumpy, and I know she struggles with her mental health- depression and anxiety which she takes medication for (although I can see her having another mental illness). We have always been up and down, depending on her mood, and I am nothing but nice to her. She ignores me when I come in and I say hi, and many times I have tried to ask her if I have done anything, as she is very rude to me. She just says I like to talk more than she does. I show her nothing but kindness, even though she has none in return, and I still invite her out and try to be friendly. 

A few weeks ago I got a new water filter. I had a wire drawer in the kitchen, which she had put her cat food on. I took the drawer because I wanted to put my filter on there, as there is no where else to really put it. I moved her things, and then sent her a text saying I did so, and if she has a problem with it to let me know and we can figure something out. Today she moved her cat things onto the kitchen table, and I moved it back, as I eat at the table (the only one). The table is already cluttered with her appliances, so I asked her if we can put it somewhere else because I like to eat there and it is very cluttered. She replied with anger that there is plenty of room to eat, and then proceeded to say that I have no common sense, and how dare I move her things. She was very angry and verbally abusive to me, calling my stupid. I kept reminding her about the text, and how I am trying to keep communication open and come to an agreement. 

She then got an ihome for Christmas, and has it set up in the kitchen. I turned it off, as they make me extremely uncomfortable with their constant recording. She said if I ever touch it again, she will start throwing everything I leave downstairs into the garbage. I told her it makes me uncomfortable and that it invades my privacy and that that technology makes me uncomfortable. She said deal with it and then walked away.

A few months ago she also made a comment that if I get on her bad side she is going to start messing with my things.

I am very concerned about my belongings. That she is going to start contaminating my water or food, or just start doing things to my belongings. I don't want to move out, as I really like living here, pay really good rent, and also just don't feel that I should move out because of her. 

I want to talk to the landlord and tell him the situation. He really likes me, and I hope he can hear me out and understand how hard this is, and how I am actually concerned for my safety and also mental health- I feel like I am going to start tasting things in my food, and always be stressing that she did something to it, or my tooth brush, etc. It has already happened, and I have a hard time redirecting my thoughts. I am already having a soapy taste in my mouth from my water, which I feel like I have been having before I went away for a few days for Christmas.

My question to everyone is do you know of any grounds that he can tell her she has to move out on? Even if they aren't true on his part? Like he is selling or something?

She only sees him a couple times a year, so their relationship is all through text and phone calls. She’s known of him since they were very young, but never kept in touch and only reconnected about six years ago on social media. He’s very unkempt to put it lightly and just has habits that I find displeasing. Knowing my mom, she would find them displeasing as well, but for whatever reason she either doesn’t seem to pay attention or just overlooks it— I’m not really sure. While he’s been in town this time there’s been some things he’s said that I found odd or didn’t understand, so I just brought it up to her and in response she yelled at me and told me I was being very critical and basically had nothing nice to say, which isn’t true at all. I don’t know him that well, since I’ve only seen him like twice a year in the I think 4 or 5 years they’ve been together, so why is it wrong for me to bring something up? After all she is my only parent and I’m protective and want to make sure she’s with someone who is good for her you know?

She doesn’t like me to say anything even remotely negative, which is impossible because no one is perfect. Why is it wrong for me to have an opinion? It was the same way with her ex-husband. She never let me have any input or say anything. Because of that it emotionally stunted me for several years and it didn’t allow me to get to know her ex at all. Am I wrong for having opinions? I understand that she’s the one that has to be with him, but I’m just looking out for her since she doesn’t hardly see him.

In around 5 days I will be leaving for London. My roommate is currently staying in my apartment while I am gone. 

This apartment costs me 1900$ a month my roommate pitches in 450 for their room.

My lease is up in Feburary and I have considered giving my 60 days notice and moving out most of my stuff before I go. Then I will move out the rest by hiring some movers and putting it into a storage unit that costs 120$ a month. 

I will be on my exchange from January to May 2018. I will then travel to around Europe and to California returning on July 15th. 

I'll save 7,980$ while I am gone. 

Now I need advice because I am worried about how to resettle when I return. I dont want to give up my apartment because I am scared I wont be able to get another one. I have had some credit issues in the past. Also I may not be able to find an apartment this inexpensive in the city with the bedroom amount I need (I do work from home).

The apartment that might be available when I return would be around 2600$ a month. It has more space and is in a nice community. 

After 10 months I'll have offset what I saved unless I can find somewhere cheaper to move. 

Sorry if incoherent have bronchitis and laying up late.

200,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

 I've never posted here but I really need advice and an opinion on this.

&amp;#x200B;

 So a little background information; I'm 20, almost 21. I lived over seas until I was 17 so I didn't get my permit until I was 18. When I went to college I didn't really need to drive since my campus is small and most things are within walking distance. The summer after my freshman year I got a full time job in the summer, and needed to a way to get there. I asked my mom if she could take me driving so I could practice and get my license but she refused. My grandma( who lives 5 minutes away) or my dad (parents are divorced, he lives about 30 mins away) would have to drive me in the morning and my mom would pick me up after work. This kind of worked for the summer, but I felt bad having to ask people to drive me all the time. My dad took me driving and I learned how to drive pretty well with him. Sophomore year comes, back to college, don't really need a car. I start dating my boyfriend and he teaches me how to drive. Sophomore year summer I run into the same problem; I'm working full time and I don't have my license. At this point I'm sick of having to rely on other people to drive me( my Grandma is 74 and has other things she could be doing, and my dad lives half an hour away) so I go behind my mom's back and get my license at age 20. I pass the test, but I realized I don't have a car. Now, my mom has a subaru she drives that's almost brand new, but that's hers, and we have an old van that literally no one uses. My dad has a jeep and also has Buddy( I don't know what type of car it is, it's old and we all call it Buddy). I'm not the best driver in the world but I'm slow and careful. 

When I told my mom I got my license she was really upset that I had went behind her back; she wanted me to take driving license with a professional until he thought I was ready. I took a few lessons but he was often booked and I work 9 to 10 hours a day which doesn't give me a lot of free time. Summer ended, and I went back to college for my junior year. 

&amp;#x200B;

  It's now winter break, and I work as a substitute, so I get called into work spur of the moment; sometimes they ask me the day before, sometimes they call me at 7 am and ask me to come in. It's nearly impossible to have someone drive me to work, and I feel shitty for always having to ask. I told my mom I would pay to be on her insurance but she won't let me drive the van. She keeps wanting me to take lessons with this driving guy but he's booked for the rest of break, and it doesn't fit into my schedule. I've asked her to drive with me to prove I'm a safe driver but she won't. 

Today my dad gave me the spare keys to Buddy and I drove with him for a while. He said I can keep Buddy and my house( mom's house, I live with her during break) but he only wants me to drive it to work and around my town( which is totally fine, I don't really feel comfortable driving any where else and all my friends, work, family, and anywhere else I need to go are within a ten mile radius and I know the place well enough). I want to drive to work tomorrow but I'm afraid my mom will get mad at me. I currently don't have insurance but my dad said he will put me on his. 

  I know I'm an adult, but I live with my mom and she pays for most of my college. What do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Additional information: My job as a preschool teacher is 6 miles away, I can't walk there because it's on a highway. I have another job babysitting and it's 3 miles away, which I could walk to but it would be a huge pain.

201,"I recently became manager of a small office team.
My employees positions are in a medium volume customer service call center with a few light duty clerical tasks. Calls being the primary focus. 

There is a woman in the office who in my opinion not up to par. 
She poorly manages incoming calls if she is working on anything else. She struggles to pause what she is working on to compose herself to answer a call. 
She often guesses answers instead of looking them up and gives people incorrect information. 
She also regularly tells customers “I don’t know” and shows no effort to find an answer. 

We have received multiple complaints about her personally but the previous manager chose to just give the customer what they wanted and never address any of this with her. 

The other employees also voice complaints about having to pick up her slack. The length of time it takes her to answer an incoming call has caused others to start ignoring calls because they feel it is her turn. 

I have tried to speak to her a few times about how I can help her improve and she insists she is fine and doesn’t need any help. 

I remind her often of how to find specific information instead of guessing. She always says she understands but an hour later, fails to look for that info. 

I challenged her to replace “I don’t know” with “let me find out” which was met with a blank stare and zero effort. 

I have tried to simplify the other tasks she works on so she can focus better on incoming calls, but this can be hard to predict. Sometimes we can have 5-6 calls at once. Other times it can be 10-15 minutes between calls. During slow periods with no calls, I often catch her just playing on her phone. 

I am struggling to resolve this because she has been working there about a year and has been doing things this same way the whole time under old management. I don’t want to have to let her go without attempting to solve the issues first. But I do not feel my team can move forward and reach its highest potential with a weak link. 

Any advice is appreciated.

He went missing during a big storm about 1.5 years ago and turned up at a random mans house (who kindly took him in when he found him at a refuge shelter) and told the man he had no family to contact. We made the decision to move him into a nursing home about 4 months ago because he was incapable of living by himself now (diabetic, vision impaired and early signs of dementia).

We moved him into this really nice home thinking it would be good for him. Better diet, medical assistance, more social interaction etc. But he became very depressed and refused to eat or even drink water. Because of this his kidneys shut down and he almost died. It was horrible but after 2 weeks in hospital he eventually got better. 

Flash forward to Christmas Day and we visited him in the home. I could tell he had declined because he was shaking and couldn’t even open his Christmas presents. Gave him a big hug and told him I’d see him in a few days, then we left.

We received a call the next morning that he died that night.

 It’s horrible and I feel like it’s my fault for putting him in the nursing home. I know my dad feels guilty as well. They were never close but he was in charge of moving him into the nursing home and now he has to plan the funeral, and he’s not taking it well. On top of that, I have hurt my back and am stuck in bed and couldn’t come with him to help with funeral plans.

How can I help my dad through this? He is emotionally repressed so talking through it is almost impossible. ",27Dec2018,1
205,"So for context, last year I had an amazing English teacher who is funny and kind and probably the most well liked teacher at my school. This year, I would say I talk to him on a weekly basis. 

Last night, I had a weird dream (which was actually in another dream, inception) that he had invited me over for Christmas dinner with his family (wife and two kids). At one point, we were the only ones in the room and he started kissing me and then he pushed me onto the couch. At that point it gets a little fuzzy, but I know he raped me. For context , I have never been raped or molested in any way. Then the dream ended. 

Today, whenever I thought about it I felt all gross. Then I saw a photo of him on instagram, and I just couldn’t stop thinking about it. What should I do? Should I tell anyone?",27Dec2018,1
206,"(Repost from r/relationship_advice)

We have only been dating for a month but have known each other for a long time. We go to the same school and she usually drives me home after school. Just recently, I began to take her over to my apartment to hang out. We were keeping it a secret and none of our parents knew about it. My mom (45F) is very strict about me not having a girlfriend or bringing anyone over while my dad (46M) is not as strict. I hinted towards it to my dad and he said that I shouldn't have one until I'm 18.

My dad found out by looking at my home screen and seeing a picture of us together. He did not care at the time and I told him to not tell my mom which he agreed to. He just asked if we were dating and I said yes. That was the end of it and he didn't bring it up again. While driving home on a different day, he decided to tell my mom for whatever reason over the phone and she went off on me.

My neighbors had just told her the day before that they saw someone (my girlfriend) parking in her parking spot. My mom would come home at 5, so my girlfriend would leave around 4:30 to avoid any confrontation. She was planning to ask me in a joking manner when I got back from vacation but my dad telling her confirmed her suspicions. She was hysterical over the phone and started yelling at me, threatening to kick me out of the house. She also told me to cancel my gym membership.

I told them that she was coming over to do homework and study because we have the same classes. It is true that we studied for a bit, but we mostly just talked and hung around. The 3 main problems are that I have a girlfriend and brought her over, which my mom disapproves of, and that I have been keeping secrets behind my parents back.

I was supposed to go home by myself on the bus, but my dad is driving me home instead. Both my parents want to talk to her, but they didn't tell me why. They also want to meet her parents which would not help as they disapprove of her having a boyfriend as well.

I have tried to be open about it with my parents but they always shut me down and just say no for whatever reason. My dad said that I was too young to be having a girlfriend when he and my mother dated in high school around the same age as me. I don't understand why he won't stand up for me or support me. My grades have remained the same --fairly decent-- and I earned a good score on my SAT. I am not abandoning any of my extracurriculars and I still spend time working on myself by going to the gym. I hang out with my girlfriend only after school as our relationship is secret in school as well. We usually go out together once every two weeks.

My mom is not easy to calm down and she goes apeshit really easily. My dad, who rarely gets mad, said that I disappointed him today. I do not know what to do now. Please help and give me advice on mending this situation because I want to stay with my girlfriend and not break up with her.",27Dec2018,1
207,"Halloween of 2017, I had put my first dip in ever. I’m sad that I was late to catch up to everyone but it is what it is. My first lip was Grizzly Wintergreen, gave me one fuck of a buzz. I ended up swallowing some of the leaves that night and I real fast found out what happens when you do swallow them. I dipped a few more times after that and moved on to vaping and nothing ever came of it. I recently put down vaping and decided to switch back over to dipping. I bought myself the same can, grizzly wintergreen. I packed a lip in and about 10-15 minutes in I’ve noticed all of the leaves start to fall apart and get all over the place. I’ve tried multiple different parts of my mouth to place the dip and nothing. I even tried swallowing all saliva and making my mouth as dry as possible before putting my dip into position. Does anyone know anyway to keep it in position without it falling apart?",27Dec2018,1
208,"Hello, 

I got a 8 week old puppy at the start of Decemeber - This is my first puppy I've owned so im not 100% sure what behaviour is normal and what isn't. Anyways my puppy has this bad behaviour of biting feet with or without socks on and trousers/pants (but she won't bite your leg).

&amp;#x200B;

What we are doing at the moment is when she starts with the biting we and stand still - grab a toy and put it by her face and say ""OFF"" (We use this when she is chewing things she is not allowed too and she seems to stop pretty quickly) but she ignores us and carries on. 

&amp;#x200B;

She will do it if we have treats though but I don't want to give her treats everytime she stops biting our feet/pants because it would be a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

My question's are:

1) Is this a normal amount of bitarinos

2) Any other tips from people about what to do next.

Thank you in advance!",27Dec2018,1
209,"So it was a pretty normal day today I’d say. It was somewhat nice out although the weather was a bit on the chilly side. Everything was going okay until my step mom and her eight year old son start yelling for their dog 3 year old French Bulldog; Rolo, in which I assumed had gotten out from the fence and into the front yard. I go out there saying “Don’t worry he’s probably in the front yard.” I hear her eight year old son start hollering. I assumed he was flipping out because shoot, I’ve done that when my dog had ran away before. 

This is not what happened.

I go inside, a grown woman, and her son are screaming, crying, they’re on the living room floor nearly holding each-other. I thought my step mom had even got scared he might’ve ran off, but no, the look in her eyes still haunts me. She was crying, which I’ve never seen before, choking on her own words I couldn’t tell what she was saying at all. Eventually from what I made of it, there had been an accident and Rolo had died. I go running outside and there he was, face first floating lifelessly in our pond. The first thing I do is run and grab him from the pond and start doing CPR, first from the chest, then side, then from up top. His eyes were open. He had to of been dead the second I pulled him out. I eventually wrapped him up in towels and kept him in the spot I did CPR on him for about an hour until my dad came home. 

I’m sorry. I really didn’t know where to put this. I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest because I know venting about something like this is not something I should do with my step family, the ones who actually lost their dog. ",27Dec2018,1

213,"I’ve always wanted to believe in the ideology of “do what you want and forget about the money,” but there’s too much uncertainty to it. I’ve also heard the saying, “If your favorite hobby is your job, it becomes work” and you won’t enjoy jt.

I’m still in high school (junior, so I’m running out of time), and I’ve narrowed down two paths.

1.) Computer sciences/programming. The “smart” and “realistic” path. I’ve always had a knack for technology and I’ve already had a good amount of coding learned. Not to mention, it’s one of the most likely job industries to experience growth in the future.

2.) A psychology career, perhaps a therapist or full on psychiatrist. I absolutely love human interaction and communicating with others; it makes me feel fulfilled and energized. Also, getting to understand how everyone’s thought process works and how we can work together with others to improve amazes me.

I’ve heard advice to do one or the other from multiple parties. My family of course is encouraging me and at times sternly suggesting I go into computer sciences. However, you always hear these expressions from your friends or figures you look up to that you should follow your dreams and do what your heart desires... I don’t know how much credibility I want to give to them though.

My academics and life experiences are sufficient for me to go into either field. I feel like everything is going right currently; I just don’t know how to approach life so I stay on the right track.

The school system currently puts so much pressure on us as young students. We have to decide so quickly what our career for life is going to be, and there’s really only one shot at a 4 year degree unless you want to drown in debts and never pay them off. I want to live a good, comfortable life for my future family, but I also want self-fulfillment and to potentially do something that would make me happier. There’s so much conflict and so little time to make a decision about it.

So... what should I do? Roll the dice and try for something that will elevate my happiness, or ensure a stable future for my family and myself?",27Dec2018,1

216,"I'm not exactly the type to ask for advice online but here goes nothing. I have been friends with with 3 extraordinary people since mid 2014 and recently I have been taking a long hard look at the person I was and the person I am now and what kind of effect I have on these people. When I was younger I lied to them... a lot. Not just about big things but I would also go as far as to lie about smaller things that wouldn't even matter. Plus I was very selfish and loud. Obviously they were not dumb and talked to me about lying soo much to them which resulted in them having less trust in me. Fast forward to today, I would say that I lie less and they trust me more but I am unintentionally inconsiderate around them. I also tend to say things that are a little harsh towards myself because of a self hatred thing I developed and it seems to bum them out. Plus I have a really stupid tendency to say things without thinking which has led to me causing problems amongst their other friends. In short I believe that my behavior is a little destructive to my friendship. Plus these problems are hard to get over since they have been problems I have struggled with for a long time. Currently I am kinda stuck at a crossroad. When I think about cutting all ties with my friends, a part of me says that I should since it's the right thing to do so I could prevent any future problems or to free them from any future guilt that could come from my bad behavior. A smaller part of me says that I should stay with them since they are my friends even though I'm destructive and stupid. I've never really made a decision like this in the past and it's driving me mad. Some input is desperately needed.",27Dec2018,1
217,"My pop was the grandparent I was closest to growing up and I have so many happy memories of him. For years I’ve been dreading losing him because I knew it would hit me really hard, more so than my other grandparents (all have passed away).

4 years ago he started suffering from dementia. When I found out I was devastated and couldn’t stop crying, I knew the pop I loved would never be the same. He was put in a nursing home.

For those 4 years I thought of him and worried about him almost every day, and dreamed about it all the time.

I flew interstate to visit him a week before he passed away, seeing him looking so old and frail, I struggled to hold back tears. I knew it would be the last time I saw him as he now had advanced dementia and we were told he was close to the end.

In the few days before he passed I was bracing myself, I knew it was going to be so hard. I looked through my old photos of him and cried.

Mum visited him the day before he passed and told me his breathing was laboured. I knew he was very close. Then the next morning I had a missed call from my mum and I knew straight away what she was calling me about. I called her back and it sounded like she was crying, she said “I have some sad news” and I said “I know”.

Then... nothing. No tears. No sadness. I thought maybe at the funeral it would hit me. But I felt nothing. Even looking at his coffin, trying to make it sink in that he was gone. Somehow it doesn’t feel like he is.

It’s been weeks now. I still dream about him a lot. In my dreams he’s well again. But I don’t feel anything and I don’t know why. I keep telling myself he’s gone because I want to feel something, but it still just doesn’t feel real.

221,"Hello! I am a 19 year old female university student in Alberta, Canada and I would like to ask my parents get me a car, as well as pay for insurance and gas, in order for me to commute to and from school every day. I am very anxious to ask them. Let me explain my situation.

Firstly, I currently share a car with my mother, which she uses to drive to work, get groceries, etc. I drive to and from school 2 times a week, and take the car most evenings. She pays for the insurance and I chip in for gas as much as I can. I am not employed and am not interested in being employed. I have a finite amount of cash from previous retail work but I don't work in order to focus on school. This situation is becoming increasingly annoying, as there is starting to be quite a bit of conflict as to when her or I could use the car. We both try to be accommodating but it's becoming difficult, as there are times when one of us is stranded at home while the other is using the car. This arrangement used to work, but both of us have busy lives with school, friends, work, and life things that it makes it hard to schedule the car usage between the two of us.

Secondly, the car we drive is quite old and many things are wrong with it. We live in a very cold province, and the heating in the car is awful. It could definitely do with a new radiator/heating system. In the summer it also has a problem with overheating severely. Not only that, but the gas indicator doesn't work and the electric door locks don't work on one side. It starts and drives okay, and it isn't an awful car by any means, but it is aging pretty quickly and becoming more and more frustrating to drive. My parents do not want to spend any money getting the car fixed, as my mother would like to purchase a new vehicle in the coming new year. Which brings me to...

My mother would like to purchase a new car anyways. She has her eye on a newer vehicle and seems to just be waiting for it to go on sale. However it is a 2018 model and likely will not go down in price for quite a while. She has been wanting an upgrade for a while and has finally found something that she likes, but is for some reason waiting for it to go down maybe $1000-$2000 before she purchases it, which seems negligible to me as she spends that much maybe per month on miscellaneous things. But it is her money and I obviously don't get to decide what she does with it.

I would like to approach my parents about possibly giving me the old car and paying for the gas, insurance, and a parking pass in order for me to get to and from school every day easily. Public transit in my city is awful, and having a car would shorten my commute by about 45 minutes each way. This would be assuming she decides to purchase the new vehicle that she wants, and I could ""inherit"" the old one. To me it makes a lot of sense, and it would be a good time for me to get a vehicle of my own and my mother to have the car she really wants. 

My parents are fairly frugal people and we are very middle class. I am aware that what I would be asking for would be quite a lot. I do have some money put away for university that is intended for class expenses, but they have told me that the money is mine to do what I want with (it's about $8000, just for reference), and anything else after it's run out would need to be loans or scholarship money. I could use that in order to purchase a vehicle, pay for the insurance, or gas even, but that's still their money so that would also take some convincing. I wouldn't be against purchasing a vehicle for myself, but it does seem silly to me to purchase something used for a cheap price when my parents are planning on buying a new car some time this year anyways.

I am asking you, Reddit, how to broach the subject with my parents of finding out a situation for me to have my own vehicle in order to commute to and from school every day with ease. They would be paying the insurance on it, and for the gas. I may or may not have to purchase a vehicle, or, I could inherit my mother's older car and she could purchase one that she really wants. 

I hope I am not coming off as entitled or bratty. I am a good student, and I try to be a good daughter as well. I know I am asking for a lot and I don't want to be a nuisance to my parents. My parents and I have a great relationship and I love them dearly.  I just believe that this is a great opportunity for me to do well in school and it comes at a good time. I am just nervous about asking my parents to spend some money on me, even though I know it is the right thing to do. If I didn't have a car, I truly believe it would be detrimental to my education and my grades. How do I bite the bullet and ask? Thank you if you made it to the end! :)

**TLDR:** I would like to ask my parents to pay for me to have a vehicle to use to commute to and from school. I would be asking them to pay for the insurance, gas, and a parking pass. I could inherit our older model car for my mother to purchase a new vehicle that she is planning to purchase in the new year anyways, or I could purchase something myself and ask my parents to pay for the insurance and gas in order for my mom to keep her car. How do I ask them?

TLDR at the bottom, it's a rather long story

&amp;#x200B;

We met 5 months ago through a mutual friend, friend in question moved schools and I befriended her and met Amy (not real name, girl in question) through her. We became extremely close, had both just come off of abusive relationships and kind of built each other back up from the ground up. And when I say extremely close, I mean that we were like family. It killed me to see her unhappy or hurt and it killed her when I was down or sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

On November 2nd, I was asking her for advice with another girl that I was talking to when she had basically a mental breakdown and confessed that she had liked me for a couple of months. I hadn't really thought about it but when I started to, the future of dating Amy was incredibly appealing. I knew her better than I knew most of my family, I could tell what was on her mind through just a few texts, I woke up and the first thing that came to my mind was texting or talking to her. We started dating but didn't last long. One of her friends broke up with her longtime boyfriend and it really affected Amy, she started to think that it was platonic between us and that we were just friends. It was almost as if she didn't believe that I liked her as more than a friend, and she broke up with me. There was another issue but I'm not going to bring it up here as it's no longer important and extremely embarassing. A week after, we got back together - although we had still maintained our friendship after we had broken up - and decided to give it another go romantically. But then on December 12th, we broke up again. We had both admitted to each other that we loved one another and she was afraid that we would change or get estranged down the road in a relationship and she didn't want to risk our bond as friends. It's both extremely important to us. We tried taking time apart to fix our own lives and figure out some things that we just needed to do ourselves, but it only lasted a day before we were right back to texting like madlads. It's been 5 months and we've sent just over 70,000 texts to each other and call whenever possible. As of right now, we are still broken up and she is **not** in a good place mentally. She thinks that she doesn't know how to love, that when she does she just ends up breaking herself or getting hurt, that it's impossible for her to feel emotion, that I'm better off without her because she's such a mess. It got the point where she self harmed for the first time in... well uh, 5 months. I'm incredibly worried about her and don't know how much longer I can see her like this and not be able to help or do anything. I feel so helpless, knowing that I caused this (although inadvertantly) and can't do anything about it. I don't know what to say, what to do. Should we take time apart, and actually not fail at it this time? Should we just cut off contact indefinitaly? We both want a relationship but she's too afraid of breaking up down the road and risking our friendship, even though I know that our friendship can survive a breakup, it has twice at this point. Is it even worth purseuing a relationship at this point or just a lost cause that would only end up with both of us hurting?? I'm incredibly confused and have no clue what the right path of action is here, any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks for listening to my TED Talk.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Became amazing friends with a girl, tried out dating and it hasn't worked out twice but we both want a relationship, she is too worried that it will risk our bond as friends. She has also started self harming again and is in a very bad place mentally, thinks that she is incapable of loving or being loved and that she just ends up hurting people when she does/thinks that I'm better off without her.

The whole year I was living there starting in October last year to July I started smoking weed and it became a daily thing and if I wasn't high it was time for some more,when I would go to school I would be on my phone and not try to talk to anyone .since I was 11 in fith grade my crush one time laughed at me and told me I had man boobs and since that point I've had a severe complex and wore a jacket for years even in the heat and would have my hands In my jacket pockets to stretch it a lil so at all times people would never see my chest and after doing alll that biking last year and stopping for a while because I was so fucking despressed and was just tryna hang on thinking's it's gonna be better soon and I have to not let my challenges go to waist by me killing myself,anyways my lower body got considerably wider than my chest,I don't have man boobs no more but I have girl legs as I would describe it and a fat ass and to get even more fucked( never been in a real relationship because I always knew I didn't have time since I was always moving around so much and so I never tried to be with anyone,I'm 6'4 attractive ig and girls would usually ask me out of have their friends do so since as long as I can remember but me being a fucking loser would say yeah and try to go along with it but would be shy and they would leave me shortly after,after years of that I decided I'll just avoid any kind of anything,)I've had a sex addiction since I was 14 and over time I would do more and more sickening things slowly degrading myself over the years and making it a lifestyle in the dark,I used to be sensitive but over time I despised that feeling but along with those feelings I was more feminine,caring,loving, and wanting to please and help but the life I lived ive learned to be strong but im bipolar and I want to be strong,a leader, and I want to destroy any obstacle in my life and I turn my deep hatred towards those who deserve it in my mind so I can force myself to feel a way compared to either not caring about what happened before and being so quick to forgive and be ok with the situation but over the course of like a week and a half sometimes more I go through an emotional cycle where I feel like I shift between personalities or at least some layers ,and some other times ill just have a desire to punish or torture or kill and I've had this for as long as I started playing with bugs also tearing them apart with tacs or other small stuff and when I feel this part I am very irritable but when I get mad I immediately have dark thoughts and if I'm getting mad from a person all of those thoughts are directed at them  and I feel like my emotions are diverting aprt and converging at the same time it's hard to explain not only that I can feel this certain feeling in my whole head and it takes out any rationable part of me .growing up my middle brother bullied me alot I never really had a dad,after 4th either went to 2 or more schools a year ,my mom was always in bed I have an ok relationship with her now but she used to be the biggest piece of shit on the planet and was a fucking horrible mother,and about the sex addiction it was at first google images and and I got off pretty easy to that ,soon it was putting stuff up my butt and trying to be girlish and after I would be done I would be sickened with myself ,soon I was into scat porn and coudnt get off to anything else at 15 my mom later found out and my mom and my brother made fun of me and I remember the whole day before I went to school after she saw my phone I was in over time I ended up developing so many fetishes and I was into animal porn,blood and Gore sex, ,when I was 13 I touched my step sister she was like a real sister to me so even more shamefull and it was a fucking few times I did it.i never apologized to her, our families moved away, I can't apologize over text that's just  so idk but I have to say it to her face and I want her to see me cry and see my humiliation even if I'm not the same person part as I was I scarred her and I can't undo it and it pains me to think about it , I used to want to kill myself thinking I didn't deserve living at 13 then I thought what good would that do for her,if anything I need to try and help her and be there for her as much as I can,",27Dec2018,1

I’m 20 and I’ve been single for 2 years. I’ve never lasted in a relationship in a whole year and I only count 2 relationships. They just both never worked out. And I’ve never cheated or been cheated on.

I’ve only matched with two or three girls in the past year and idk they never went good. It’s always “tell me a good pickup line and maybe I’ll talk to you”, or “ you have to be 6ft”. In high school I was always complimented cute but that’s it. I don’t even know if girls find me unattractive now or boring. I always try to make the convos last but they end up leaving me on read. It feels like i will be single forever.. or for a good while. I’m really short too so I’m sure most girls are not into that. All I wanted this Christmas was a girlfriend 😔

231,"I've been an emotional wreck for awhile now but last week it amplified so much. My girlfriend of five years broke up with me. My depression drove her away and I don't blame her for it. It's my fault for not getting help when I needed it. I'm going to therapy now for my depression. But I miss her so much and I don't think I can let her go so easily. 

I plan on doing something big in a couple of months to try and get her back. I'm writing a small 5 song EP about our relationship. This would be a solo album but I'm going to ask my band to play one of the songs live at a live show around late April (I want to give her the space she needs first). I'm going to ask her friends beforehand if they think it would work but after the song is performed I'm going to ask for her forgiveness and ask her if she'll take me back. 

My brain right now is thinking this is between this is a good idea and this is just wishful thinking. Should I go through with this?",27Dec2018,1

233,"My ex boyfriend of 3 years, committed suicide. People have asked about me going to the service. Some people have told me not to, some people have said it’s my decision, some have told me I have to. Honestly, I think funerals/wakes are fucking archaic and disgusting. Oh let’s all obtain closure from looking at our loved one looked all sucked and dry, wearing something they’d never wear, with fucking makeup, and all sloshed and drained with creepy ass music playing in the background. What the hell is wrong with me going to a lake, looking off into the sunset and talking to him by my lone self? He is dead, he is now the wind and the sun, he isn’t that body that lies at the front of the parlor. People say it will help with closure, but I’m sorry, how is someone’s lifeless body that can not answer my questions going to give me closure? I get maybe talking with other loved ones will help, but not with the goddamn elephant in the room. I actually believe that it will make the grieving process worse, to see him like that. I’ve seen him sleep plenty of times, and what I would see at the funeral will be all wrong and it will fuck with me. it will be the only thing I see when I close my eyes, when I’m alone at night, etc. On one end, I don’t give a shit what people think, this is MY grieving process and for anyone to dictate how I should go about it is fucking bullshit, but I also don’t want my absence to be misinterpreted as not caring.

In store and I asked 'What is the actual refresh rate?' Given my very limited knowledge of tv's I currently understand that the reshresh rate is what determines how smooth a picture seems given how many times the image is refreshed a second. The staff member said 'It's in the middle'


Gaming is the sole focus of why I chose that tv so it's concerning when I see a different spec online to what is in store.

Now she wants to go out with us for new years and I'm not looking forward to it, but going with the flow. Not going to get upset, just be calm until she flies out hopefully and he realizes how crazy she is. Here's some crap I've taken from her and like I said NO other female friend of his has done this bs. I'm not jealous of her, or anyone. I'm comfortable in my skin. This is about boundaries to me!!!! 
She said to me my boyfriend said she can do whatever she wants to him on Halloween. She said this publicly to me to make a scene. I ignored her. Told him later and he was upset w her. 
 
Has shown my text about boundaries to her to the whole bar. Called me crazy and is a social worker????!!!!!

Asked overwhelming questions about my relationship without knowing me then apologized.

Called my boyfriend on new years to say her boyfriend cheated. Then I talked to her bc she was crying. She never called me to say thanks for listening!!!

Brings up having dates while over at the house then chuckles. 

Has not said hi to me for minutes while looking right at me. Expects me to. 

Has played with my boyfriend's hair and arm in front of me. When confronted, she didn't like me setting boundaries. By the way, I'm not allowed to have male friends do that! No double standards!

Boyfriend has mentioned how he thinks she likes him and how he's upset if she's trying to ruin their friendship with it. 

Rolls around on the floor in weird positions that are sexual. It's weird, attention seeking behavior.

Has commented on my stuff being in the boyfriend's house w a negative tone, negative expression, but positive words. 

Has been called out by strangers for being too flirty w my boyfriend in front of me. They said, hey that's not right. 

Seems to want to crash every holiday. So I have to be firm and plan wayyyyy ahead. 

Wants my boyfriend's attention too much and has no long term boyfriend ever around. Doesn't bring even a girlfriend if we go out? Kinda weird. 

How does anyone suggest I handle this?! Thought of recording her secretly if she starts talking crap to me when we go out? I don't know how to deal with this. Boyfriend's a people pleaser, keep the peace guy. He's hoping she'll just be cool with us being together eventually. But she's calm then gets drunk usually and it all comes out. Lol.

239,"So i am the youngest and my middle brother and my mother had trouble getting along and i guess she was getting advice from a therapist and just following what they said for her to do.
She did and he has never forgiven her i still think all this time he still has a grudge. When i was born i am my moms favorite and i think my dad and brother planned to make me the bad child to get back at my mother, they are constantly on me and it feels like i am being attacked and dont know why for example i hate who i am right now i dont do anything i play stupid games all day and i just try to get myself the strength to end my life i am also afraid to even attempt changing, i never met so much resistance from my brother and father than when i tried getting cleaned up and changing my lacking mental attitude, my dad threatend me with violence and was always yelling at me, but when i give him what he wants he leaves me alone, when im doing nothing to improve myself and am the black sheep they are most happiest. Its deeply troubling to me and im constantly trying to figure out whats going on all i want is acceptance and to not haft to worry about them getting so upset at me for trying to be a better person, i think they just want to get back at my mother for treating my middle brother badly and are using me to do it.
Im so upset im caught in the middle of this, i have made mistakes but do not deserve it to cost me my life they berely talk to me and only when me and my dad fight does he call me he brings me down and brags about how successfull and how he has so much money he doesent know what to do with it all, and brags about the vacations he is going to take and how happy he is. 
Not having a cent to my name the money situation does not even bother me, its when they attack me personally that i get really beaten down. This emotional abuse happened to me my whole childhood and continues now that im an adult. From teachers beating me down saying i will never be anything to my father drinking and yelling at me, im just trying to figure out a reason why all of this is happening, now its different because i have made mistakes that give my family a justifiable reason to treat me bad, but when i was a kid i dont understand why i felt hated right from the start.

An example of the latter would be: one time I put on a new lipstick and my top lip swelled up. It was really scary. Another time I had hives on my legs that spread up to my throat and the right side of my face. I was in math class when it happened. My mom wouldn’t come get me from school, but luckily my sister threw a fit for me and our grandpa brought me home. I had terrible hives for about a month after, even on medication. (I also had to wait a while go to the doctors. My mom scheduled my appointment and I’m unsure if the office was busy or my mom just waited). 

Another time I had socks on that were too tight. I wore them all day and when I took them off I had hives all up my legs, starting at my feet. My mom isn’t great about giving me my medicine (I have to remind her to put it out for me otherwise she won’t do it) and I’m not in charge of my own medicine, (since I had a brief history of abusing sleeping pills a few years ago). Because of this my mom gets suspicious if I ask for my medicine or remind her “too often”, so I get nervous reminding her. I’ve had random hives on my arms and legs for the past month for unknown reasons, and I’ve only taken Claritin (prescribed by a doctor during my last breakout) once during this period.

My husband, who is American and I, German, are currently considering moving back to the US. At the moment we are in Germany where I work for a multi-national financial data and fin-tech company after I graduated from university with my Msc. in Finance.

My husband is a clinical social worker and has been living and working in Germany for the last 10 years.

After being in Germany for so long we are now thinking about moving back to the States but cannot really decide where to go as I have never lived in the US and my husband left when he was 19.

Points that would be important to us:

\- a strong Financial Industry (Banks, Asset Managers, Insurance companies etc.)

\- generally good health care services

\- open-minded/liberal people

\- possibility for outdoor activities

We currently do not have kids and don't plan on having any in the next 5 years, so schools etc. are not really a big factor for us.

258,"I am 26 years old. I have struggled with the absolute worst when it comes to sleep trouble. I genuinely hate sleeping because it is next to impossible for me to sleep, and the little sleep I do get is riddled with nightmares and/or night terrors (often back to back or even in the same night). For years I've looked into medical help. I've tried years of therapy (to the point of being kicked out of therapy and being told I don't need it and it will not help me find what I am looking for). Journaling. Practicing setting up lucid dreaming. Dream interpretation. I've even gone to Jefferson Hospital for a few sleep studies with stellar sleep medicine experts. I've tried the nightmare medications to no avail. I've tried various sleeping aids and nasal strips. Some things flat out made them worse. 

I write this because I've hit rock bottom. I need help... I am not okay. And the kind of help I need either hasn't revealed itself to me or flat out doesn't exist. I write this after I just had the single worst nightmare of my entire life. I woke up in shock feeling an emotion I cannot describe words other than: I have never experienced this feeling before. And It. Is. Not. Okay. I am not okay... 

I am at my wit's end for something that can help me find the peace to sleep. I need help... I am not okay. Something is wrong with me. Sleep itself is now a traumatic experience for me, because of the things my brain comes up with and this genuinely terrifies me. I don't even have the energy or the will to repeat them anymore. It doesn't do me any good, and I just relive the dream in retelling it. All I know is I need help and I am not okay... ",27Dec2018,1
259,"I am gay and:
1.My country is very homophobic 
2. The public oppinion on gay people is extremely negative by the vast majority of people (88% according to a survey)
3. As a result of the negative public oppinion the laws are not going to change. Another survey done by a major media says the best case scenario is 30-50 years AT BEST
4. Gay people here have no rights to marry or to have children by any possible means.
5. Moving is not an option in my case. I want to move but I can't because I am still in University, also doing the work I study for in another country is absolutely unachievable. It would mean working here for years to gather money, then learning a language to a C1 level in both spoken language and medical terms, getting numerous approbations and certificates depending on where I want to go to, applying for all of which requires money, somehow managing to find a job before even going to the country or finding a landlord willing to give you a place to rent when you don't have a job and are basically unreliable because of that. And even after all these things it is still not certain if I get an approbation or end up wasting a ton of money and going back home. Also, moving means leaving the only person to ever fully support me( my mom) by herself here with no family and friends.

260,"I started watching porn when from the age of 13. I am now 31 and as of October this year I am porn free and have gotten masturbation under control too, of which I am proud of.

I'm now left with the devastation that has been left behind by being addicted to porn. My life is a mess. My last girlfriend was when I was 16! Since then no relationship at all, only forgettable one night stands. I was too drunk and desensitized to do anything. Used prostitutes for sex as well and that was terrible. My only view of sex and woman has been from porn. 

I want to move on and maybe try for a relationship with someone and I'm terrified! 15 years of no real intimacy with a girl. No real sexual experience, I'm clueless. I'm so worried that this will be an issue and will be a turn off to whoever I try with.

262,"I found gay image search history on my brother's internet history while I was using his computer for a school assignment and trying to find a research link.  Now, one image would have been whatever, but this was like, 10-15 images having been searched of guys jerking off.

The thing is, I never thought he was gay or bi.  In fact, my mom used his computer (he has a nice computer) a few years ago and stumbled upon images of naked chicks, which he got lightly scolded for.  He was maybe 14 at the time.  I've caught him looking at straight porn once or twice as well (small house, shared rooms, etc.).

So it's like, this just kind of came out of nowhere.  He's 19, so I figured he was just straight.  I doubt he had much left to do in figuring out his sexuality.  Always talked about girls, had crushes (though he is overweight and has always been uncomfortable pursuing them, and I'm pretry sure he's never had sex).  I'm just a little shocked.

I feel like he is confirmed gay or bi at this point in my mind.  Straight people don't look at that or enjoy looking at that: I went into our room to grab the laptop, and he was sleeping with a bottle of lotion on his bed, with the images having been searched right before I grabbed the computer (lol, sorry about the graphic details...this just does NOT seem like him having searched to make scientific observations of some sort).

I'm looking at the writing on the wall here, and I'm fine with him being gay or bi.  But what should I do here?  My thinking is to just forget about it and not bring it up.  If he wants to talk about it, I'll let him bring it up.

The only thing is, is that he has seemed a little depressed lately.  I'm concerned he may be harboring some negative feelings about this toward himself.  Additionally, he would probably not come out to any of out family (very conservative) whereas I don't give a shit (moderate here), but act conservative to fit in (they're paying for me while I finish grad school so....politics are a big deal in my family).  So I don't feel like he would feel comfortable talking to me, and we aren't super super close to begin with.  I don't want him doing something crazy down the road.

Crazy post I know but what should I do?  Nothing, or tell him the old ""you know you can tell me anything"" a few weeks down the line?  I don't think straight up telling him what I saw would be productive and may drive him further inward.",27Dec2018,1

264,"Posting this from a throwaway so I can’t be identified as I’m somewhat a public figure.. I know someone out there has it way worse off than I do, but I just can’t handle this anymore. Just want to get this off my chest before I explode. It’ll be a long story, so you as a reader can grasp the emotions I’ve been feeling. 

Started skating before I could walk, and at the age of 4, I was hooked on hockey. It was like a drug. My entire life was revolved around it, and was turning it into a career. Anyways, fast forward through many years and I’m about to play my first junior hockey game. Decided to hop in early to get a year under my belt before heading into major junior. I was projected to play in the world juniors as a 16 year old. Anyways, first game, 5 minutes left in the third, I already had 3 goals and two assists, in a 5-4 game. Couldn’t have asked for a better game, and all of a sudden comes to an early end for me. The biggest goon in the league who was a 7th round pick for the Red Wings comes in and blows my knee out completely. “Fucking sick” I thought as I tried to get up and make my way to the bench, only to collapse again as the result of having majority of the ligaments in my knee shredded to shit.. 

This was the turning point of my entire life. I was not invincible anymore, I realized that I could get hurt. Mentally it had a huge toll, but I missed the ice so much I decided against surgery as it was a year recovery and I wasn’t willing to miss that much of a time, which caught up to me later. Instead, I restrengthened it and played in the same league for the next two seasons, not being able to move up because I wasn’t anywhere near the same speed I was previous to the injury. Could hardly keep up in the leagues I played in. 

Fast forward two years. I finally got a chance to play major junior league, but because I didn’t get the surgery, I was living on borrowed time. Ended up fucking more shit up in my knee while training a week before I was leaving to go to the team to the point I couldn’t walk, so surgery wasn’t a choice, and in I went. 

I have a girlfriend, but not one friend. I’m sitting here all alone during the holidays depressed as fuck since I lost my passion, and my career. I’m just so fucking lost and don’t know what to do. I’ve been drinking in the evenings to the point of blackout for a month straight. Smoking a pack and a half a day. I was never like this, I was an athlete before this. I’m literally not the same person, and there is something wrong with me. 

I hoped writing this would help me, but it didn’t. I’ve never felt so alone, useless, and frustrated. I have the same 5 physio workouts to do everyday, and not a single other thing to do. I’m a ticking time bomb. ",27Dec2018,1

275,"Hello all,

Thank you for taking your time to read this. Before you continue, I’d like to acknowledge the fact that I was very stupid to trust someone with such a sum of money. I’ve definitely learned from this experience and I’m now trying to figure out how to solve this. I am not looking for any criticism toward my actions as I already know that I was also at fault. I am just looking to see what my options are now. Please bear with my poor formatting and word choice at some points.

I’ll start off by introducing the person who is in debt to me as James. James, who is under 18, was loaned about 500 foolishly by me back in July. 

Backstory:
Back in July, James ran a online store that was successful (came off successful at the very least). I had tried to do this exact same business back in March, but I was not successful. After seeing how James was able to make lots of sales, I wanted to see how he was doing this and basically learn from him. Anyways, James and I have a mutual friend, who we will call John. I’ve always known about James but officially met him through John. John was always a trustworthy person for me. He has never done and still has never done anything to make me not trust him. So, John contacts me saying that James needed some cash. I was quite confused since I saw all this success by James but John has explained that James does not have his own bank account to withdraw all the money he has made from his sales to, which was true and I completely understood. I naively gave James a loan of $500 after John assured me of James’s trustworthiness. They are very close friends. Again, I have no reason to not trust John and I felt like this loan would get me on James’s good side and would allow me to get some advice and stuff from him for the online business I wanted to do. There is no official contract or anything signed by James. The only proof I have is an obtainable statement from John as well as saved text messages. As a few days go by after I loan him, I begin asking for some money back. He says that he is unable to pay me at first which freaks me out but a few days later he does give me $30 and then another 250. This made me trust him since he was paying me back. Though not the full amount, he did pay me back. Again, I didn’t feel as though there was anything to not trust him. As I start talking to him more, he explains he was working with a “partner”, Steve. He was working with Steve since Steve has a bank account and paypal account, which is what James needed for his store. Other than that Steve did not have any other value. Since money from sales would be in the hands of Steve, Steve would take a part of the cash. James couldn’t do anything since this was his only way to run the payments. One night, I offered to let him use one of my bank accounts to run his store.  So we get everything sorted out. I would still be asking for the money, but he’d say he can’t pay much since he had to run ads for his store, which I knew were very important for the business model. So fast forward to a few weeks later. He is going to California. I am fortunate to be able to make enough money from selling shoes to not really worry about the money so I let everything just slide since although it was $220 at that point, it didn’t matter much to me. Anyways, when he is going to Cali, he asks to borrow another 200 something dollars. Of course I was like no problem (I’m very stupid I know) and handed him the money. 

RECENT:

So ever since then he paid me a few 10s here and there, not as much as the 250 like he asked me the first time. At this moment he owes me $460. My friend, who was also friends with James, would crack jokes in class about how James owes me money and would say how James needs to pay me back. Somehow James took offense to these jokes and a few weeks ago, texts me that he “has had enough” and that he is refusing to pay me back because of the jokes. He was upset that we “made a fool of him” by simply asking for my money back and sometimes laughing about it. I understand this is very childish but again, I’m not looking for criticism just advice. We come to James’s house two times to talk to him about the whole situation and he refuses to pay. I am planning to go back within the rest of the week to confront his parents. He went to California with his friend so only his parents are home. I want to take this time as an opportunity to talk to them about what has happened and see if I can get my money back.

This is where I need my advice. Legal or just general advice relating to this situation and what I can do. I’m not really sure on what I can do at the moment. Honestly, I just want to say something to scare them into getting him to pay me / paying me themselves but I’m not sure where I could go there. Again sorry for any stupid ideas and the immaturity. And as stated before, I have the text messages and a obtainable statement as my only proof. I’d like to resolve this in the most simple and calm manner as possible so there aren’t any conflicts on both sides. I would just like to get my money back. 

If there are any questions that may help, please ask! I typed this all out through my head and it’s pretty late so I may have left out necessary information. Everyone in the situation is under 18 beside his parents. I have not made an attempt to talk to his parents yet since all the times I’ve gone, they weren’t home. I’m looking forward to any advice. Thank you.",27Dec2018,1
276,"Morning you wonderful bunch.. please don't shotgun me to pieces for asking this..

So I've finished my shift and finally feel like I'm in a position to ask this from people I don't know, and hopefully can give me an objective/unbiased(ish) assessment of the complete fuckery I think I'm in..

&amp;#x200B;

So, friend of 15+ years, I have a SIGNIFICANT amount of emotional investment (red flag, I know). I've realised over the last 5+ years, it's been a very one sided arrangement, I will drive a 60+ mile round trip to support them or pick them up. I get groceries when they need it, I will speak to them when no-one else will. any issues are always my fault and have never had a proper answer. I've been assaulted twice by them, never received an apology. I've never received an equivalent return from them etc etc etc etc blah blah blah. 

I could go on but I won't, you probably get the picture. It's very one sided. The only time i ever get contact is when it suits them and when they need it because I'm the only one left.

It's a toxic relationship. I need an end point. 

The problem is, I don't know how to find that end point, and I want to help them to realise the damage they are doing.. For all my abilities (and not), I have no idea how to do this...

277,"ere's the story. I had a pretty toxic relationship with my ex that ended about 2 months ago. Getting over it has been hard, since we're roommates but I think I'm there. The issue is, my ex seems to have inserted himself into a friendship group that I developed after we broke up. He doesn't know them that well and literally would not have even spoken to any of them, had they not been friends with me first (we're all on the same university course).  A while back, I offhandedly mentioned that one of the people in the group was looking for a housemate next year, and my ex jumped on the opportunity (since he has no one to live with now that we're not together).

Now, I realise I have feelings for the guy who needed a housemate, and it's not something I can just let go. He makes me feel valued and good about myself, something I never felt in my ex relationship. It's not like he and my ex are friends- the only reason they even talk is because my ex has barely any friends of his own and essentially leeched off my friendship group even after we broke up. Obviously if we did date, I would not hide it from my ex, but I just don't know whether it's worth stressing about this.

278,"So the main issue is my epilepsy and the meds i take. Both take a massive toll on my mental health and my ability to learn.

Since my epilepsy started 4.5 years ago, my memory has been terrible. Seizures have a habit to delete the last 2 weeks of memories and the meds i take slowly delete things without constant revision.

I started uni in 2015, but didn't like the course. I'd already made friends, moved out and was enjoying the lifestyle, so i stayed. I swapped course for 2016, but had to do a foundation year, because i didn't have the needed qualifications.

So I completed the foundation year, it was difficult. I started the actual first year of the course in 2017 and again managed to pass with even greater difficulty and added charity from uni. (They allowed me to resit exams at home over week long periods)

I'm now early in my 2nd year and it is even more difficult. I can't remember any of the last 2 years and I need to in order to understand the new things I'm learning.

So now things are growing exponentially harder and failure seems certain. I've stayed at uni in hopes that i find meds that control my seizures, while also having minimal side effects. That is not going to happen before I leave university.

So now all my friends have graduated, I live alone, I'm falling further and further behind at uni, and this failure is only exacerbating the problem.

Family seem to think I've done my best, I've tried, I've had fun and there's nothing wrong in either having a break or leaving.

Uni is continuing to give me unfair advantages in the way I take my exams and I'll still struggle. I live relatively far away from home and have a tenancy agreement that lasts until July, so if I do leave I'll have to find a job that I'm both able and allowed to do

My best friends (calling them X and Y) have been dating for about a year and a half, but they were on and off for a while, so maybe just about a year.  X has been confiding in me more often this semester, and since we have had class every day, we have grown a lot closer. Y is someone I would see if I have time, but when they were together, it was hard to see Y without X.

Before the breakup, X had been telling me about Y and complaining about them. They would get into lots of fights and X would just tell me how much they wanted to break up with Y. A week ago, X finally broke up with Y, Y was devastated and came to me for advice and for comfort. I tried my best, and comforted Y as much as possible, and when Y asked me if X ever said anything, I would tell Y mostly the truth, but soften it. I told X everything I told Y after wards.

After a while, things got bad between them, and I talked to X and asked X to talk stuff out with Y. They agreed and talked, but I found out later from X that Y had tried to blame me for causing them to start fighting, and for ""stoking the fires"" of their relationship drama, and told X everything I had told Y about X. 

Other than this, Y has been a pretty good friend, but this hurt. I stayed up all night, while Y cried over X, and comforted Y, and they just turned around and tried to blindside me. My problem is that I cannot address this with Y because Y would know X told me, but it's caused me to try and distance myself from Y. 

Is there any advice you guys can offer? Is there a way to salvage this?",27Dec2018,1

282,"Hello! So from last 6months I have been preparing for an entrance exam for a damn good college for that particular degree. And I have been doing.... I guess okay. I am really good at maths and reasoning part of the exam. I have always been good with things which require logic and critical thinking. But GK and Current affairs are also a major part for the exam. 
I think I am good with most of the basic science related General Knowledge but I really do lack GK about other things. Also i am not good with current affairs. I have been trying to read as much information as possibly regarding these 2 subjects. Mugging up important dates and stuff. Keeping up with political news and etc.... But I am just too bad at memorizing stuff. Like it's so difficult for me to mug up so many different dates. I don't remember any of what i read after maybe few days. 
This is really making me scared as ofc the competition would be high and Gk-CA would really drag me down big time. 
What if the exam this time is heavy GK based (pattern varies every year a bit)  and i get thrashed. I can't afford to just get like 70%, i need to be in the top if I need an admission. 
If I dont get the admission, i dunno how to face my parents. As after school I took this year off to prepare for the exam. Should i take another gap if i don't succeed?  People having high expectations from me even tho i don't think i deserve it, is making me so nervous. I don't want this nervousness to reck the reasoning part of the exam which i am good at. 
Should i just get in any college i can?

My partners eating habits are atrocious. I am seriously at a loss and at my wits end because I can not continue a relationship with this man and have a future with him when he simply doesn’t care about how it’s affecting his body. 

I am a petite female who recently lost a lot of weight due to an illness, I wasn’t able to eat more than a few mouthfuls a day and lost around 2 stone within 3 months. I am a lot better now and I am making sure I eat 3 square meals a day with snacking and milkshakes in between that help boost up my calorie intake. 

My partners however is down the potty! When we first met I knew he had some troubles with his food, we suspect he has some stomach issues due to long term illnesses going undiagnosed as he has a lot of stomach pains, constipation, cramps, bloating, continuous vomiting etc (which is something he isn’t bothered about fixing either, he has just decided to live with this for a long time, he hasn’t been registered with a doctor for almost 7 years now).  

His typical day is, waking up around 10am. (he works in his restaurant and is a chef and doesn’t open until 12pm). He doesn’t drink caffeine and doesn’t drink tea or energy drinks. 
His first meal of the day will be dinner - this is IF he isn’t working the evening shift. Dinner will be what we both decide to make, I try to suggest filling meals as I know he doesn’t eat at work. (His sole choice). So this is around 5pm by the time we start cooking. He doesn’t eat breakfast, brunch or lunch and he doesn’t even snack. He *sometimes* tells me he snacks at work, has something small to eat (to which I praise him for *not in a patronising way*) and then he says he feels better and isn’t feeling so dizzy and so I tell him to drink a glass of water too and he does *sometimes*. 
So now the day is over and he’s back at home (typically around 9pm) I normally fall asleep around 10pm because I am up early for work. 

Now this is where I am loosing my patience with him. 
After I fall asleep, he will open a *party size* bag of sweets, normally Skittles or something the equivalent of, but it is always **packed** with sugar, he will then either drink 2 pint glasses of whole milk or a whole 1L bottle of Coca Cola, then he will open a pack of biscuits and eat the *whole pack*, then he will open a family bag of crisps and eat them all. He eats everything that is bad for you from 10pm - 4am. He smokes weed and while I know that attributes to his appetite, which I am happy for, I wish he could eat something healthy. While I know eating late at night is terrible for your stomach, I would rather him go downstairs and eat a meal at the *table* to help actually fill him up with goodness and to aid in his digestion. 

Last night he went downstairs and opened my new bottle of milk (I buy my own full fat milk to help myself put on weight). I came downstairs this morning to find the whole 6L bottle on the side which is now warm and smells funky. I get upset because this is expensive and he decided to just open a *fresh* bottle so he could have his glass of milk. I say to him that this isn’t fair and now my milk is spoiled to which he denies was even him.  We live with my family whilst trying to save for our own place, however, I know this was him because he made this glass of milk at 1am while everyone was asleep and woke me up savagely gulping it down like a fish - he knows I have to wake up early but drinking and eating is such a **loud** task to him that he wakes me up continuously all throughout the night and it’s gotten to the point now where I could cry because my sleep is so broken. I tell him to please not do this but then he tries to be quite while opening his chocolate, gulping down his drinks, eating his crisps and sweets, he makes even more noise!! 

He has lost a drastic amount of weight to the point he is starting to look seriously unwell and actually, really old for his age. He doesn’t care for his hygiene either and will go days without changing his clothes or even brushing his teeth, he doesn’t even *own* a toothbrush anymore, he just thinks it’s okay to use mine. I found out the other day he has been using mine for about 3 weeks and I explained how that it’s not healthy and he needs his own toothbrush. Honestly...!

I am aware he is depressed and I try my best to help him because he is my partner and I want us to be happy and healthy together but I don’t know what to do anymore. 

I wake him up with breakfast at a normal time to which he says no thanks and carries on sleeping, I prepack him lunch when he asks for it but he comes home with it anyway, I make him snacks when I have them, sometimes he has them and he always says how much he feels better after eating normally for a day and I try to keep this up with him but he eventually complains of a sore tummy and acid and then he eventually turns food down because of the troubles normal eating causes but then has no problem chowing down on family/party packs of  sweets and biscuits. He buys these himself. I have now refused him eating food like that in bed when I am trying to sleep. 

He doesn’t do anything for himself and he certainly doesn’t help himself and I don’t know what more I can do. I am seriously thinking of breaking up with him because he is so unhealthy and doesn’t do anything to change this, even when I am doing it all for him. Maybe that’s the problem? 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated Reddit. How do I get him out of this funk? I even registered him to a doctors, twice. All he had to do was sign both papers when they came in the mail but he didn’t and then after 2 weeks of no response they close your application form down and you can’t reapply for a further 6 weeks. 
His teeth are becoming a horrible yellow, they’re wobbly and almost falling out, his hair is falling out, his eyesight is blurry, he is always weak and constantly getting unwell. I feel he relies on weed to help him eat but when he does eat, it’s terribly unhealthy foods. 

I don’t know what more I can do. 

Thanks for reading. 

tl;dr - bf turns down healthy foods to eat unhealthy foods in bed from 10pm all the way up until 4am which continuously wakes me up at night, is inconsiderate and leaves his sweet wrappers in bed and on the floors, wastes my stuff and is always complaining of being seriously unwell. He takes multiple days off work because of this but refuses to change his diet and ways. ",27Dec2018,1
284,"Long story short I dated a girl for two (ish) years who was extreamly mentally unstable, and after attacking me several times, and repeated death threats from her and her family I finally left. After we broke up she told people I beat her and all sorts of other horrible things. Luckily most people immediately believed me that I was innocent, but it's affecting the way I go about relationships. Immediately after I would get attached to people who showed me positive affection, although over time I've become sort of distanced when it comes to dating, and have build up a local reputation of being a ""womanizer"".

289,"So. To set the scene. I got out of a relationship about a year ago, however I was led on into believing that we’d get back together for a long time after that. I’ve really only been out of a relationship for about 4 months. 

This last relationship was very hard on me. It made me question what I want in a girl/wife (eventually) and what a healthy relationship looks like. It damaged me a lot psychologically and emotionally, however, I feel like I’m finally at a pretty fully healed place

I’m trying to learn to just be okay by myself. Doing things by myself, emotionally supporting myself and not relying on other people for validation. I realize that most everyone needs a couple people in their life to keep them grounded and I’ve recognized those people and plan to put more importance on them, as well as a healthy amount of self care. I think I’m doing a good job so far, but don’t feel like I’m 100% there

Then there’s this girl. I barely know this girl. We’ve talked a few times back in high school, but not a lot. She has a certain flare to her that I really like. You know when a person just gives off a vibe? Yeah, she does that for me. From our conversations, I can tell she’s really down to earth, go with the flow, just the right amount of goofy and intelligent for me. Not to mention very gorgeous. She seems like she would be a good match. But I’m not 100% sure

We met again at a party a couple days ago. I realized as soon as I walked in the door, we made eye contact and she waved at me. I figured she could be waving at either of the 2 dudes I walked in with, or just us as a group to be honest, so I didn’t think much of it. Then as the night went on, my two friends and I went over to a gazebo, in the backyard. It was a little ways away from the bonfire, where most of the people, and she, were mingling. As we were talking, I casually looked up over at the bonfire and made eye contact with her again. Almost instantly, which kind of implied (to me, at least) that she was already looking over here or repeatedly looking, and she smiled and waved. This time, I pointed at my friends to clarify who she was waving to and she gestured that she was waving to me. Feeling a little validated, I enjoyed it, and decided to ask my 2 friends if we wanted to go talk with her and her friend. So we did. The five of us by the fire, talking and catching up. As we were talking though, I would notice that sometimes, as  someone would start talking, and we would shift eye focus to them, we would lock eyes, me and this girl. But it wouldn’t be for like a split second, on the way to whoever was talking. We would just look in each other’s eyes for what seemed like an eternity. It was probably like a solid 3-5 seconds each time. This happened a few times. We only had a little of “alone time” which was really just us on the outskirts of the group, talking small talk. But she just has this flare to her that I dig. 

She too just got out of a relationship about 4 or 5 months ago as well. And it was pretty serious, just like mine. There’s not a lot of information on how bad of a breakup it was and I don’t know anyone close enough to them to know what happened

I realize that I’m easily attracted to people who validate me, so I don’t want to overthink this. But I do genuinely think she might be a good match, and I’ve asked my friends and they think so too. I’d like to test the waters. Maybe get her number, or go to coffee. Just to inspect more. But I don’t want to rush anything.

I think I’m all healed but I’m not sure if I’m ready for a serious relationship yet. And I have no idea where she’s at with her healing process. That being said, i don’t want to let her slip through my fingers. I’m not sure what the appropriate action is and when to act it out. I’d like to set a basis for relationship without rushing into it and risking a good relationship, if she’s even interested at all.

So what do you think I should do?

TL;DR
This girl I barely know, but I’m crushing on and I both recently got out of serious relationships but I’d like to pursue her without rushing things.

He laid in my lap through the entire process, from the drive to the vet, through the waiting, through the goodbyes, and through the entire putting down process. 

My grandmother couldn't stay until the end understandably and he is family, I would never leave him to pass on his own. So I stayed and never stopped holding him. But with that meant that it was my responsibility to tell the vet when it was time to put him to sleep, time to end his suffering. 

I'm normally very composed with my emotions, but having to tell the vet that it was time, that it was okay to do it is not sitting well with me at all. Part of me just feels like I took him away from our family because I gave the permission. Has anyone else felt like this?

i wrote up a contract stating my specifics such as price and time window to be paid in full and what I would provide. He verbally agreed but never signed it as most of our communication was by phone from our initial meet.

I asked to be paid $400 up front and the rest within 10 days of delivery which he agreed to an I commended the service.

I delivered him the 100 photos in April of 2017 and sent him them VIA Google drive to download as well as another link to a site just for a grid-style view of the compilation.

over the period of 10-60 days after the delivery I continued to contact him about the other half of the payment in which he said he’ll get to it when he has time ( about 3 times )

after 90 days I no longer had the energy to persist so I just took the L and carried on with life even leaving the links available this whole time and up until 6 months later in which i deleted them and the photos.

312,"Please, I need help in my current situation. My younger brother is five years old. I am 18. I am separated from my mother in a lovely household with my dad, my brother is with my mom and his dad. Here is where I need advice. 

I feel like I need to call child protective services. 

Reasons why:
* I was removed from my mother for physical and verbal abuse. I have yet to see that with him, but it is a thing that happened to me.

* The house is a mess. Not like a ""Clean your room"" mess. Like a hoarders style mess. There is no room on the floor, period. I have pictures to send to CPS that will easily get them a warrant. The kitchen is covered in mold, same as the bathroom. There is no counter space. The fridge doesn't function anymore. The sink hasn't been used to clean dishes, ever. The dishwasher has been broken for years. There are sharp objects everywhere. 

* The house is a safety hazard. I witnessed a fire today due to their faulty outlets. There are sharp objects everywhere. There are dead rats in the walls which are creating a horrid smell and giving him endless respiratory infections. She just told me she isn't going to his doctor's appointment tomorrow because ""It's just a follow up, nothing important"".

* He is getting sick due to the conditions. Multiple emergency clinic visits, all for respiratory issues of some kind. 

* She refuses to make it better. I told her I'd help, she agrees to that, but this is not to be done by two people. I ask her to let me bring a full team of people to which she says ""I'm not comfortable with that"". Personally I'd think you wouldn't be comfortable living in this. 

* My mother takes drugs. She's addicted to Xanax and smokes pot. She also drinks. 

Why I'm asking for advice:

* I don't know what CPS will do. I don't want them to take my brother away. 

* I hate my mother for what she did to me, but she is doing better with him. I'm not going to rip her son away. She teaches him well and cares for him. He isn't neglected. 

* I want to remain anonymous. I don't want her to know it was me.

315,"I don't often use Reddit and I know I will sound crazy but please understand where I am coming from and help me deal with this. 

My sister is pregnant and all the family are really happy and excited. The only weird part of it is that she claims it was from a one night stand. Normally she tells me everything about whatever relations she has but this time she has been weird about it. 

She made a joke during Christmas dinner, she said ; ""honestly it could even be *bfs name*"" he looked really guilty after she said this but everyone just laughed it off 

This is when it clicked in my head, I have been thinking about it since. Around the time she will have had sex to become pregnant will of been when my boyfriend (of 6 years) got super drunk with her at a family party that I ended up having to work through. Ever since then they have been extra close with each other. I assumed they had just made good friends that night.

But that's not all, now I think about it he has been very happy to drive her to all the doctors appointments. I have also seen his bank statements and can see he often sent her small amounts of money. I asked him about the first few but he just said she needed it and brushed it off. But I have checked and he has sent over £500 in total!

I believe he wouldn't of done anything but I just don't know. Now it's all I can think about. Is there any way I can ask him without literally seeming insane.",27Dec2018,1
317,"So this is gonna be a long post, but I need advice because I have done all I can and the situation keeps getting worse. 

So I work midnights at a gas station and have been there for about 6 months. I have heard nothing but praise about my work ethic. For those 6 months, we have only had 2 managers. And about a month and a half ago, we hired this new guy for the 3rd manager spot (even though there was no need for the hire). Before I met the guy, I heard from other employees that he was a weird guy but I didn't think much of it. I finally had a shift where I met him and I introduced myself and told him if he needs anything just let me know. The first thing that came out of his mouth was ""Hi op, who did you vote for in 2016?"". Now this question kind of shocked me, who opens a WORK CONVERSATION with that? So I tell him ""I dont mean disrespect but its none of your business"", he gave me a very shocked looked, then proceeded to tell me how he voted for Trump, then asked me how I feel about the president. Again I responded with none of your buisness. Thats when he gave me a nasty look and walked away. As I was leaving, I asked him if he needed anything before I clock out and he said ""No, why would we need YOUR help?"" I knew then and there he was gonna be an issue. 

Fast foward a month and this man has threatened my job several times, even though he has no authority to fire me. It takes managers several months to gain that ability. So I worked this Christmas and I had to work with him for 2 hours that night. He kept questioning why I was doing things in certain ways, and telling me how I was wrong. There's a sheet of paper on the wall that describes each shifts responsibility, and how things should be done and at what time. I show him this sheet and he tells me ""well that just doesnt make any sense"". He is blatantly disregarding company rules just to bitch at me. That night, two of the regulars, who is a mom and her 16 daughter come in, as they always do. Im ringing them out and he is standing over me staring dead pan right at the 16 year old girl. When they leave the store, I turn around and he says ""wow that girl is hot"". So I thought he was talking about the mom, because she is actually attractive. I asked him if thats who he meant and he said ""No I mean the girl with glasses"". I said well she is 16 so thats kinda weird. His response was ""well shes still pretty hot, god I would love to marry her"" that is verbatim what he said. Keep in mind, he his married with multiple young children. I was just in shock. I just walked away and had nothing to say. 

This morning at work I was talking to another employee who is one of the cooler and nicer people there, and he told me that this manager told him that if he the authority right now, I would be unemployed and that ""its coming soon though"". I have gone to my head manager, corporate HR, and the situation keeps getting worse. At this rate I am going to be fired soon for no reason. What can I do to prevent that? Im so lost on what to do now. ",27Dec2018,1

322,"So i have this mate, who I was sleeping with on and off  for about 6 months this. For many reasons - mostly numerous red flags from mate and my existing heartbreak we did not become a couple.

My mate wanted to though. I liked mate a lot but couldn't deal with some of the bs red flag behaviour and was very vocal about it. I could have been nicer but Its been a rough year for the both of us and led to monthly fights. Usually over text or phone calls.

Mate had some behaviours that i found suspicious. One of these behaviours set me off massively and after that fight we only caught up 3 more times. (I Can't go into too many details) but mate was amazing in bed. Really really good. Also when we were together it was fun, I always felt safe and we had a genuine connection.

Last 3 times i saw mate, my mate had changed, subtle but an anger was growing inside. I mentioned it and mate said the anger gets bad sometimes - was aware it was there. Also mate had court cases, increasingly more.

Last time I saw my mate was a few months ago. Last month I received a call from homicide detective. Went in for chat. It was pretty scary anyway long story short mate is murder suspect in an open case where I live. Idk what happened - i have had anxiety since. The dates of homicide occurred a few days before I saw him last. (We had a fight shortly after that and have not talked since)

I don't know what to do. I am scared, i have had odd things happen since chat to detective. Subtle signs letting me know mate is aware detectives have been in contact. There is talk of court, statement, being subpoenaed. However I have no evidence and detectives know this as we have chatted and I have given them my DNA. They have not been able to tell me too much, which is understandable. Although they did say I could still speak to him etc. They also said mate knows that they being investigated and is pretty much one of main suspects. For the record it was not a major violent death  - more like something went wrong from what media said. 

I don't know who to turn to, what to do. I am just freaking out as homicide is scary. I also miss him - crazy as it sounds. Am also worried due to proximity of this person it does not look good for me. 

So reddit what do I do? How do i make this better, who do i talk to?  And should i reach out to mate?

332,"Hi guys,

Here we go; at the beginning of this month, my girlfriend and I came to visit my previous home, where my mother lives now. My grandpa (her father) is also there during this winter period, so that he isn't alone back in his hometown and that he has someone to help with. 

We've all been together here over the past month. In my hometown, I have friends I've known for 10+ years. Or, should I say, two of them. They both have girlfriends, so another arrangement idea was that they celebrate with me and my girlfriend. So basically, six of us together back at the place where my girlfriend and I live.

Here's the problem; I've been waiting for a reply from one of the two friends for the past 10 days to see whether his place would be empty and available for all of us to crash and spend the New Year's Eve together. In the end, nothing came out of that, his family will be there, so that's off the table. Then the idea of them spending the New Year's Eve at me and my girlfriend's place popped up. I needed to hear back from all four of them, but in the end, they accepted, although it was a bit shaky. Keep in mind, they will work both on the 31st and the 1st, and it takes an hour by car from my hometown to where I live now, so they would come around 10 PM, only to leave at 7 AM. And now, of course, my friends are (like me) unhappy that we couldn't close the deal, since I mentioned that I don't know whether it would be worth it and that I needed to talk with my family about it and see what they think.

Obviously, my mom was angry and tried to 'manipulate' me by saying that this may be the last year I spend with my grandpa, that he might not be alive next year, bla bla. I'm saying that because I know what kind of person she can be. She knows that I'm emotional and empathic, so I think this wasn't really genuine, but more for me to feel sorry. Like I already don't feel torn apart who to celebrate with, hence why I'm asking for advice in this sub. The girlfriend wasn't too happy either, because I talked with my friend last night for half an hour (this was the same friend whose reply I waited for 10 days), and that he still didn't know what to do, but told me that they would all be willing to come.

In the end, they all want to come and say that it won't be a problem, but at the same time, it would be bothersome to pack again and go back so that we could celebrate with our friends. On the other hand, we'd spend the New Year's Eve at home, with my mom and grandpa, but I would have to tell my friends that the deal is off. What should I do? What is the best choice here?

TL;DR: Torn apart whether to celebrate New Year's Eve with my girlfriend, mom, and grandpa, or with my girlfriend, two friends and their girlfriends.",27Dec2018,1

334,"Yes, big milestone. Turned 21 a month ago. Sometimes I get this random pangs of feeling worthless and useless. I picked up guitar and has been doing so for 1 year 10 months now? I can do decently well, am in a music society of sorts in university (the university is amongst the top ranks in my country). I also usually work out, often, 3x a week or so. My results are not too bad. 

But I’ll always get these sort of bouts where I doubt myself. I’ll see fellow musicians being good at their own instruments, and outdo my guitar abilities. I get that they have been dabbling in music for years, whereas I’ve just begun my journey.

I’ll also see other dudes lifting and easily lifting way more than me. Sure, I left my ego at the door, but I can’t help but to wonder what could I be doing better?

In the music society, do I even have value? If even the keyboardist and bassist can replicate what I do, and do so better than me, what purpose do I serve? As for working out, I’m not particularly big, nor am I especially strong (barely getting back to 225 for deadlifts).

We had the same interests in music, very similar type of humor, etc. he’s also has so many life experiences and been to so many places for as young as he is. He is just very interesting. Problem is, he is from another country and only in the United States for another 8 or so months. 
Once I found this out, I was weary about talking to him. What good can come from meeting someone I really like only for them to leave 8 or so months later? 
Stupid me, I decided to meet him for a nice date night. He was such a gentleman and we actually had quite the romantic evening. We have now had 6 dates.
My main issue is the fact that I am actually falling for him. It probably didn’t help that I recently lost my virginity to him. I was always taught to stay true to God and hold onto my virginity for ‘the one’ but I honestly do not follow my religion, as sad as that sounds. That’s a whole other story, though. I was too curious to wait, but I’m a little disappointed that I was not officially in a relationship with this guy. Fast forward a few weeks and he shows me a video on his phone. He clicks out and I see that he still has tinder downloaded. I shouldn’t be upset, right? We agreed that since he is only here for a little while longer, a relationship is out of question. But a few weeks prior, I asked him if he was seeing or talking to other people and he answered ‘no’. So I’m not sure what to do or how to feel about this entire situation? Does he sound like a total player and I’m stupid enough to fall for him?

340,"Hey, I guess I need a bit of advice since lately I've been feeling worse than terrible and I have nowhere else to turn to. Been putting this off for weeks, and hope this doesn't turn out too much into venting, but any help would go a long way.

  


Basically, I think I've been very slowly going down into depression over the past few years, and now I'm feeling like it's getting to a really bad place. Like, a few weeks ago I had a quick and hopefully a painless way to end my life, and I was seriously considering it. Not the first time I've thought of it, but I couldn't do it to my parents, but still would be nice just to end it.

  


Haven't felt happy in years, last time I was truly okay and happy was in highschool with my first girlfriend. No amount of drugs and alcohol I've had can compare to having a girlfriend like she was to me. It's been nearly 8 years and I still haven't had another, which makes me feel terrible since it's the only thing I truly want to experience again. But since I'm like this, I can't get one. Doesn't help I don't find myself attractive and that I have no friends messed me up.

The only times I've had sex was with escorts, I'm 23 now and it's the only times I feel something anymore. (Apart from weed of course.) Must have spent nearly $2000 on them on the past few years, managed to stop myself after last month I went to one, but who knows next month.

  


I hate my job, it's a shitty supermarket one that I can't stand anymore. I don't do a good job, my peers and managers have scolded me for it but I don't really care anymore. Mostly since I moved stores about 6 months ago after working for the company for just over 4 years now, so all new staff and people which I know barely any of them even now. Just hate that place, can't find another job unless it's another shitty retail job.

  


Have some IT experience and learning, but no career aspirations at all. No idea what to do as a career, was supposed to just join the army but I don't think I could handle it at this point in my life. My family has been harassing me to do something buy I have no idea what to do, at all. I just keep doing the same thing every year: nothing.

  


Just starting to feel like I'm losing my humanity or something, I don't feel anything anymore, just feels like static or nothingness inside me. No friends to hang out with, no hobby's, no interests, no idea what to do. Went to a psychiatrist a year ago, told me I had high-functioning Autism, but I don't know. Didn't have enough sessions to come to the conclusion so quickly, couldn't come back until I was ready and willing to do what he said.

  


Starting to feel kind of bad now, think I've written enough, have plenty more to add but I think I've said way too much. I guess if you have any advice to give, I'll hear it out. Pretty sure Psychiatrist is going to be the first thing haha

342,"Thank you for reading this. I’m on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues. I tried to post this in r/cars and r/whatcarshouldibuy but no luck...

Like the title says, this is for my Wife’s family who lives in Mexico and desperately need new car. I have never owned or bought a car myself, so I’m not really sure what I’m doing.

My wife and I aren’t incredibly well off, but we both live in New York and make decent money. We have quiet a bit of student loan debt and some credit card debt. Her parents recently picked us up from the airport when we visited them during holiday break and the family car is is extremely poor condition, to the point where I consider it unsafe to drive. Actually, I know for a fact it’s unsafe to drive.

Her father knows this, and takes public transportation everyday to go to work, which adds on 4 hours (2 hours there and 2 hours back) for travel to his work day. Owning a car would cut that down to 30 minutes each way. He is old, works incredibly hard for little, so a new car would be life changing. My mother in law walks to work, as her office isn’t far.

Her parents cannot afford another car. So we are looking to get them something that is certified pre-owned and super dependable and reliable while not sucking down gas. Cue, used Honda Civic.

Now, I’m from New York, and have never owned a car or bought one. My wife is from Mexico and also has never owned or bought a car. My wife’s parents would immediately reject the idea of us buying them a car, so the only way we can do this is to literally surprise them with it and say too bad here is your new car...

I look at car listings for fun sometimes because I always wanted one, but I never actually bought one. I’m having some difficulty finding certified pre-owner Honda’s in Mexico City and Guadalajara. Most seem to be from dealerships that do not have certified pre-owned or have been too modified with too many bells and whistles. Here is what we are looking for.

2013-2016 Honda Civic:

$6000-10,000 USD range and below 70,000 miles
Or in pesos and kilometers...
MX$150.000 -$200.000 and below 100.000km


Now my questions are:
• what do we have to look out for with buying a car?
• is buying a car in Mexico different from buying a car in the states?
• is buying from the dealership the best way?
• it’s probably not cheaper to buy in the US and drive it to Mexico right?
• is a used Honda Civic the right car to be buying?

343,"This isn’t a romantic relationship advice thread just wanted to clarify. So about three months ago I cut things off with a friend of mine who I had been friends with for four years. Something happened revolving around them owing a mutual friend a large sum of money and then neglecting to bring it up etc. Not going to get into it. We had a fallout from there. Nothing mean was said about each other, I think we both always had that level of respect. But we stopped talking and they recently messaged me saying happy holidays and they missed me.
 The truth is I’ve missed them too and life has been feeling empty but I’m still going! The thing is this friend isn’t really going anywhere. They’re really lazy and don’t have any plans for the future nonetheless a job and just smokes weed all the time. To make things worse they’re in a toxic relationship and I got very drained listening to this during our friendship because I didn’t understand why they wouldn’t just end it. It got very hard for me mentally to listen to this and it made me hate myself because friends should come to you about this stuff right? Maybe I’m the one who’s the asshole.

Anyway, I wake up this morning to find, that this girl had blocked me on Instagram. I was shocked &amp; confused, only a few hours ago we were saying good night, and sending lots of kisses etc.

She unblocked me a few hours later, and told me she got hurt over the video of my 'famous crush', in which I apologised but told her it meant nothing, it's just a bit of fun. In which she replied, that she never wants to talk to me again and I should stick my feelings up my ass.

She seems to have calmed down a little bit now, but she's certainly still very mad at me. I feel angry that she'd happily throw away 8 months of our relationship/friendship, just because of a famous crush!? Come on, it's pathetic really.

But I do like this girl, I even got flowers delivered to her work on Christmas eve, even from long distance!

I'm still talking to her now, trying to talk sense in to her. Weather it'll work or not I don't know. 

Anyone have any advice on what to do here? I know some of you might tell me to walk away and forget about her, but it's not that simple, I've spoken to this girl everyday for 8 months. It would be very difficult to walk away. I am actually also very lonely in life, which probably arouses my feelings more for her, than it would be normally

Advice would be very helpful, thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm 16 years old. I don't want to go into great detail about my past, but some key points are: Dad died last year and my asshole friends left me. Glad we got that cleared up. Ever since my dad died, I haven't cared about anything. I don't care about school anymore, I don't care about drawing anymore (I used to draw all the time), I don't care about humanity anymore. You could say that his death... changed me, DUN DUN DUN. Shocker, I know. Ever notice how people tend to stay exactly the same after a loved one dies? Me neither. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm not doing well in school anymore. I would drop out, but then my mom would be tremendously disappointed in me. Which I guess she already sort of is. She always says things like,""I just want the best for you"", and ""You should listen to me, I really do know what I'm talking about"", etc.. Like I said, my friends left me. That was right after my dad died. They're insane if they think that I need them, I don't need them. I'm in a vicious cycle of waking up, skipping school to walk around town until I find something to do, find something to do, spend an hour trying to convince someone to buy me a beer, drink said beer, go home and go to bed. I mean, I go to school sometimes. Not all the time. Deep down I know that I should. But everyone always says that college isn't worth it, so I just feel like I'm wasting my time. Also, people there are assholes. I don't get bullied per-say, everyone seems to bully each other. Everyone seems to think they're above me there. They probably are, lol.

I'm rambling, I know. Fuck me, right? I don't really know what to do. I feel completely stuck, and I don't even know what I'm stuck in. It's like, I want friends, but at the same time, I want everyone to fuck off and leave me alone.

I basically just asked about her Sister and wished her happy birthday and since then she’s not even read it. Safe to assume she doesn’t want to talk to me? 

I texted her sister as well and her sister was definitely more approachable and very much more active than her so I’m not sure what’s the reason for the sudden ghost. I tend to overthink these things and my only assumption is that she doesn’t one to do anything with me.

351,"I have noticed that my boyfriend keeps liking other girls’ photos on Instagram. They aren’t regular, innocent photos, they’re very sexy pictures of breasts, lots of cleavage, swimsuits, and butts. What bothers me most is that I know these photos don’t just appear on his feed, he must be searching for them. I wouldn’t mind as much if he liked the photos because he follows the person and it appears on his feed, but there are times when he likes 5 pictures in a row of a girl with the dates of the pictures scattered. One photos date of being posted will be in October, the other April, July, even from a year ago. He doesn’t even give my own photos attention sometimes.
I have mentioned this to him before and he has said that he would TRY to stop liking. How difficult is it to not double tap and search? I feel extremely insecure when he does this because I am nowhere near as gorgeous as these girls with their perfect bodies. Am I being over dramatic about this? Is he just being a typical guy?

353,"So worked for more than 8 months as a backpacker in Australia and through Christmas, a family member decided to visit me. He always wanted to drive a 4x4 car, a Toyota Hilux in the desert and since where I come from everyone is poor AF i decided to go and buy one.. buying and selling in AU is easy right? I thought that even if i sell it for 1000 less I'm happy, thats still cheaper than renting it.

So i went to see 3 hilluxes, prices from 6500 to 9000AUD. The 6500 one looked good but weak engine, 2.4, many k's. the 8500 one was all bumped everywhere. The 9000 one had 'only' 120.000km on it, which raises a bunch of red flags for a year 2002.

Anyway, i had 5 days time to get one, so i went for the 9000 one. Tested it myself, made the history Report online, went to the mechanic that made the last service - company that employs 9 people and they assured me it's roadworthy. They didn't put the odometer on the receipt thought.

The salesman was shady AF too, basic sob story, need cash because money problems, not wanna sell. Had a baby seat at the back of the car, and tools at the back of the ute. Door seemed dirty from a child but might just been thrown there. Thinking back it was probably just a setup.. good one though, even child lock was on.

Took the car to my company mechanics (they have a bunch of utes and employ 2 mechanics full time). They checked it for a while, said it's a bit rusty but good. I had a big hunch and i expressed my worries to the mechanics and they all reasured me i have nothing to worry about. 

Few days later i go buy a bicycle and the salesman was an experienced mechanic, so I asked him to have a quick look. In 5 minutes he saw a bunch of problems and said the odo was rewinded or chnaged for sure. If I'm lucky 'only' for 100.000, but could be more.

Today the most reliable car of the year broke down on me. 300km towing charges + whatever fixing it will be if engine isn't bust. I already sent 10.000AUD for this piece of shit...

Ended up spending my country's 8 months salary (would take 2-3 years to save that much), middle of holiday and i have no money and no car to go anywhere, can't even go home now because gotta stay and earn what I lost so I'm not freaking homeless when i go home.


Advice i ask is, how and where do i report an odo rewind and if it's really worth my time. I probably can't prove it anyway. Since it's a private sale i have no legal options anyway. Or do I?

354,"I'm 17, with six months of high school left and have absolutely no plans for the future.

I mean I have a few vague ideas of careers that might interest me (film, network administration, psychiatry) but none of them seem feasible. Film doesn't seem reliable and I don't have a portfolio. I'm not a mathematician or super knowledgeable in network administration or computers, and I'm worried it might bore me. Lastly, I don't meet the general requirements to join a medical program (undertook the economics stream ES in my school, instead of the science option). I'm good at economics and was offered a scholarship but the idea of pursuing some boring ass job in finance or accounting makes me feel physically sick. 

So university deadlines are rushing up on me, and I'm not prepared and haven't chosen a major, that's the first thing. Given my age, this probably doesn't sound like much of a problem to most people. Here's where my family comes into play. I live in an abusive household and I absolutely must move out once I graduate high school, they've been grating away at my mental health for years and I really can't take it anymore. A gap year is out of the question, I can't stay at my parents' house for a year doing jack and I can't afford to travel.

The third thing is my mental health itself. I'm severely depressed and feel close to suicide a lot of the time, and I honestly don't know how I would cope if I did stay in my country, even if I did move. I have no real friends here who'd want to spend time with me. I have bad social anxiety which makes the prospect of meeting new friends/employers or whatever fucking terrifying and unfeasible, even if I hope I can eventually get over that. I have nice family in the US I could live with but I don't see what I would do if I wasn't in university. The thought of living there without knowing anyone or them all that well also scares the shit out of me.

360,"Hello, I’m(24) a very quirky introverted girl. My roommate (29) is the type of person that I would help in the library in college, because he was barely there (harsh, just kidding, he’s a smart budding accountant) . He’s the manliest man-guy ever. He’s 6’5, played D-1 sports in college, watches sports the majority his free time, owns lots of camo for hunting and lounging (he has camo uggs!) also, he knows how to fix almost everything and always tells me random useful facts us yankees were never taught, about Mother Nature and stuff. He has a southern accent. It’s so cute. 

He’s also very conservative and I’m liberal. Naturally, he’s dominating and I’m submissive (I’m 5’1).

We have a very interesting dynamic going on. I live next door to him, and we’re of course fucking. Living together has been pretty fun (we cook together, grocery shop together, shower together, watch movies) but Im wondering what will come of this. 

I’m familiar with the whole “don’t shit where you eat” thing, but it’s too late. I’m posting this from his bed as we speak, there is no about facing from that. 

He told me he’s only dated blondes. 


This didn’t worry me at first, but now it does.  I have very dark skin. Ironically, people tell me I’m the “whitest black girl they’ve ever met” which is probably true, and even he’s made a comment about my lack of stereotypical blackness. He’s never met someone like me, a black girl that doesn’t speak in Ebonics. That went to boarding school. He has shocked when he visited my parents house outside the city, he couldn’t believe it was bigger than his. His parents are well off but I guess girls like me are mostly in the north because there’s no one like me where he’s from. 

He’s the sweetest kindest guy, and I really want to be with him. We’re getting a cat and I’m so excited. Im probably over stressing, but if you’ve only dated blondes, what are the chances you’ll date someone else? I’m used to dating outside of my race, and he’s not. Is there something I can do to make the transition a little easier?

So much of this might make my mom sound like a shitty person, but she isn't, she just doesn't always make the right choices. 

My mom is 55, working as a custodian and it's been really hard on her body. She can't continue doing it for much longer and it doesn't really pay that well anyway. 

My step dad is almost 76, has COPD, the beginning stages of heart failure, had a stroke about 5 years ago that left him unable to work, and has little pension/military/retirement for when he passes. 

My mom needs a better job, but she has few marketable skills and isn't really able to do strenuous physical labor anymore. She's had cancer and surgery to remove it 4 times and an additional hernia repair. She knows she needs to get her shit together but I think the idea of having to really go back into the workforce scares her since she's been a custodian for the same guy for 6+ years now. She's always been looked down on and questioned by her family, all her decisions are challenged, my dad and her mother were (and still are) psychologically and emotionally abusive and honestly I'm shocked she's as well-adjusted as she is. She has almost no self-worth but she is generous, kind, caring, helpful, and an amazing mom and grandma to my boys.

I don't know how to get her to get in gear and do something. If my step dad died today, she would lose the house, barely be able to afford a funeral and probably have to declare bankruptcy. She would probably come live with us and be an in home nanny so I can go back to work until she could find something and get an apartment and get back on her feet. However, I would like to avoid that by her just being able to start working and saving now.

Her skill set: very detail oriented, personable but not outgoing, *very* basic computer skills. 
No college degree, last work experience before cleaning was in a factory around 2006, honorably discharged from the military (pregnancy), and the wife of a retired airman. 

The advice I need is 1. How do I get her to stop saying ""I know"" and get out of her hole of fear and actually get her life together and 2. What kinds of jobs can she do? All I can think of is a Walmart employee or similar but there has to be other options out there.

372,"I’m a 17 yo dude who lives in Asia. 

I need some advice from parents and other people because I’m not sure if my thoughts are right with how I feel about my family. 

I’ve always had issues with my mom as we always constantly argue because I’m academically weak. I got low grades from a major exam when I was 12 and went into a good high school under a bad stream. I got passable grades after my high school major exam but couldn’t progress to getting tertiary education from a public school since I failed to achieve the mark. 

Public schools are more repeatable than private schools in the sense where if I get a diploma or degree in a public school, I have a higher chance of getting a job. 

I’m in a private college and I’m doing fairly ok here. I’ve been getting B’s for my modules. 

My parents have spoilt me in some sense as I’m an only child. Always got games and consoles despite me getting bad/passes in terms of grades. I never had other problems apart from studies. I was really bad at math and taking another other language because I failed writing in my native language when I was 6 years old and had to take another language, I’m still not good with this language despite learning it for 10 years. 

However, I’m really good at literature and English as I’ve always gotten A’s without having to struggle. 

My parents always compare me to the neighbours kid who used bully me when we used to play at the playgrounds in middle school. He’s always had good grades but always gets in troubles with the authorities because he did stuff against the law. 

I’m the youngest in my family, being 17 and the oldest 31. My entire family is literate and they all earn $15K-$20K a month because they’re either Doctors, Lawyers or Engineers. 

My mum wanted me to be a doctor or lawyer and I couldn’t fulfil her dream. 
My dream is to be a Musician, I always was interested in Literature and Poetry but because I live in Asia, my parents think I should be normal and have a normal job or be what they hoped for me.

They also don’t seem to understand anything about depression and anxiety and look down on it when they know I had it because of the extreme bullying in high school. 

I had no support from either them or friends because I never had friends from either middle or high school. 

For the past few weeks, I failed 1 module because it was really difficult and my mum and dad was like “You’ll never be anything in life. You’re a zero. Look at your cousins, they make so much money etc. Look at C (neighbours Son) who is now getting good education from a public school) 

I also have a back disability and my mum knows about it but she always tells me to stand straight when she knows I can’t do very well because it causes me chronic pain, and says why can’t you have a straighten up when she knows it is difficult for me to do so. 

I made a vow in front of them a few weeks ago and even today. I just repeated it. 
I said to them that I’ll abandon them after I complete my studies because after my studies, I go for mandatory army service and after that, I can start work. 

I just want to leave them and my entire family all behind. They all know I have dreams, I struggle with mental health, I struggled with bullying in high school and it just seems like no one gives a F about how I feel. 

When I said that, they wanted to come to me and hug me but I refused. I’m just full of anger and hatred towards everyone. I can’t stand anybody in my family, neither their faces. 
They all seem fake. It seems like my parents are afraid to lose me because the only reason I was born is because they want me to take care of them in their old age, not because they love me. 

I have a full plan of what I want to do within the next 10 years of my life. I’m doing a diploma in Mass Communications which I enjoy doing but my passion lies in music. 

I honestly don’t want to see anyone’s faces after I complete my 2 year army service. 
I want to abandon my entire family. 

The vow I made to them was me saying “One day, I’ll make so much of money. More money than my cousins and everyone you mention. I’ll leave you both alone and you’ll regret everything you have said to me.” 

They have always bought me stuff and they tell me that they love me but I never felt that. I feel their feelings are fake and they are fake people. 

Please tell me parents of R/Parenting 
Is my anger and hatred towards my family justified ? Or am in the wrong ? 

If there’s any advice for me, please mention it. 
I appreciate everyone’s input

To which he was saying that he had kept looking at her to try to nonvocally get her to stop, and that's when my ride had finally came (I was basically begging for like thirty minutes for my dad to pick me up) and I basically ran away. He texted me I suppose after she left hours later saying he was sorry, they shouldn't have been acting like that with me there, he was trying to get her to stop, told her after I left that she needs to leave that for after I leave. He actually seemed pretty upset about it. The thing is, I know he's not the problem, she is. She's the clingy one, and while I'm all awkward at seeing any form of affection with them, when all three of us are alone, she's taking it to a level where I often just want to run. I'm not sure if she'll listen to him, or even if she does dial it back, I'm sure she's going to just bring it down to the level where I want to run but just grin and bear it like before. I'm not nearly as close with her as I am him, and while he seems to understand how awkward it makes me feel to be such a third wheel, I'm not sure she does, but I don't feel quite comfortable bringing up the subject with her. 

This isn't just in private either, I just generally always feel like a third wheel when it's the three of us. It makes me not want to hang out with them together at all whatsoever. What do I do?",27Dec2018,1
376,"All my life I've been physically awkward and almost incapable, and everyone always told me it's because I don't work out regularly.

So last year, I finally somehow managed to get myself in a workout routine. Because of my insecurity about my physical abilities, I hate gyms and sport clubs so I used to work out at home using an app on my phone that had a training plan for every individual day which helped me a great deal. I managed to keep my schedule so well that in the last month (which was in July I believe) I worked out almost everyday.

Fast forward to now, I've moved out of my parents' place to a dorm, started at the university and it has been more than 5 months since I last had a proper physical training.

They said hey we're in town.. come join us for dinner. We were returning home after a Christmas vacay so told them that we're on the way home and that we are really tired so we will just go home and crash. 

They said ""oh in that case we'll just stop by and say hi"". They brought another couple along with them. We thought theyll leave but the couple said their friend is extremely sleepy. So we said ""oh may be you can start early in the morning let's just sleep we are all very tired"". Worst. Decision. Ever. 

We woke up, my husband got ready to leave for work and they're still asleep. I played some music, woke them up and they were asking if we can all go out for breakfast. We said we have work and they said ""oh okay will you be late"". We said yes. They said ""ok we'll probably go have lunch outside and leave by evening. If you come back early, we can have dinner together.""

381,"Beware: text wall

To preface this statement. For the past 2 years I've been in a relationship. I do struggle with depression (you're shocked, I know) but I generally have it controlled. I supported us for the first 8 months of our relationship but my job was shitty even though it paid well. Slowly but surely everything fell apart. I moved in with family and so did she. She convinced me to leave my job to live with her in a cabin running off a generator with her alcoholic mother and her dad. Eventually she decided it enough is enough and wanted to leave. So we did and are now living apart with family.

Now where I currently am, I fell into a pretty deep depression. Havent been showering or taking care of myself. Eat once or sometimes twice per day. It was a factor of me coming here, knowing my mind isn't sound at the moment.
 Because of said depression my girlfriend had considered leaving, asking for me to pay attention to her from my stasis in my bed. I failed, she failed. Blah, blah. She broke up with and has been begging for a second chance. 
Note: through out our relationship I did everything for her, she wanted to break up once before and I had to beg. So this time I told her just leave.

Now I'm sitting here writing this considering what I want to do with my life. I need a new goal in life I think. Doing the day by day thing for a job I hate isnt gonna cut it. Been considering moving back to my home state and starting over. 
My family here at one point, has relied on me to do things for them and it was tedious beyond belief to me. Even though I'm down and out they all want me to do things for them and I feel like I need to get away from them. I had supported my mom from 16 to 22 when she finally was granted disability and I resent her and my other family for taking my childhood, but also my teen years. 
So I'm thinking should I go or stay? Itll be hard. Very hard. No plan, little money but away from everything that makes me unhappy.
Any advice is welcome.",27Dec2018,1
382,"So, just a couple of weeks ago, I had many so called friends, or people to hang out with. Many of them were using me in any way possible. They usually used me for money and favours. My life was not mine at all, It was theirs, they controlled it. Everyone blackmailed me like if I don't do something for them, they would cut all conections with me. I wanted to avoid every conflict at that time because for most of my life I had many conflicts, and I don't remember a thing from that time after I got into puberty... Those were some nasty memories... Now, I showed them I am not a slave, and that I won't do everything they say unless it's an emergency, but I did it in the nicest way possible-the discreet and polite way. No one calls me to hang out now... no one... I was not too happy when I had them as ""friends"", but now, I am lonelier than ever, and a bit sad too... Is there any way out?

I recently got dumped out of an 8 month relationship which has been my first real one, and I quickly learned afterwards that she was my main source of happiness. We’d been friends since freshman year of highschool (I’m a junior now), and once we started dating we were crazy in love for 5-6ish months. She brought the best out of be, as she was extremely smart and had a wonderful moral compass (4.5 GPA, varsity debate, etc), as well as great social skills and what not. So when she left, it felt like a part of me did too because I valued her values so much, if that makes any sense. It’s been a couple weeks and I’ve made a lot of progress on getting over her, but before I date again I want to be consistently happy and love myself.

389,"Hi, [18M] I’m a freshman college student pursuing music. 

I have been bullied most of my life, since 3rd grade and I’ve struggled with depression beginning around 5th grade. I struggled with suicidal thoughts for a year and a half in middle school. I finally got out of it (depression) around 10th grade for a few months. 

The bullying really left scars for a long time on how I viewed joking around, sarcasm, and making friends. I can say I’ve definitely overcome that part of my life but it more or less set the stage for other things to happen (I’ll get into that) 

During this time too, after fourth grade my dad stopped having an active role in my life. He went back to college and his life now revolves around money and his career. I remember begging him to please spend time with me over the course of my 4th grade summer. I think we spent time together around twice. 

This continued for years. Even worse, my dad started to actively grow a relationship with my brother in law (my sister is 11 years older than me) right in front of me. I found what little time we spent together being taken up by him hanging out with my BIL instead. 

The moment it really hit me was when I went to the one last thing me and my dad did together on a regular basis. Once a year, since I can remember, my dad would take me to a toy tractor show. I don’t care about you tractors any more, but I latched in to it immediately. However this time my BIL came along. I was stuck in the backseat. And my dad spoke less than ten words to me the entire trip. 

So I haven’t had a real father figure in my life. I struggle with feeling like a man and knowing that he sees me that way too. 

My mom has also constantly berated me my entire life. No matter how good I do in school, it’s just not enough. I was granted a $40,000 scholarship for my achievements, along with a $6,000 a year music scholarship for my talents, and my moms only reply was why I did t get a full ride. So that’s still a thing and is a theme to my life.

Later, at the end of 10th grade, during a family fight not involving me, my brother told me he was going to kill himself over the phone. When he hung up suddenly it felt like part of my soul was ripped out of me. I remember crumpling to the ground and sobbing uncontrollably. My brother was gone. And there was nothing I could do. He lived all the way in Virginia (I was in Michigan), and I didn’t know his address. 

I ran upstairs and begged my mom and dad to forgive him. They frantically searched for a way to contact him, and we eventually found the number to his girlfriend. 

He was next to her the entire time. Smiling, and not at all considering suicide. She found out that he only used me to get sympathy from my parents. 

Upon learning that I was crushed. My brother is 12 years older than me and he was always a huge role model for me. Some of my favorite memories are running to the terminal to see him walk our way and be with us for a week during Christmas. Or jumping endlessly on the trampoline with him when he was back from the military.

So when I learned this, it seemed like all my childhood memories meant nothing. 

It has left huge emotional scar for me. 

I’ve also been cheated on and emotionally abused in a relationship. So I struggle with trusting girls and letting things happen naturally. 



All of this has formed me into who I am today, and I’m sick of it being able to trust other people. Since I’m a musician, I wrote a song that completely describes how I feel with what stage these events have left me in. The lyrics are as follows 

“I made my city,
Strong and tall,
Took my brick and mortar made sure it
Would never fall,
And I had splendor,
Peace of mind,
I sat on my throne,
Behind my walls,
Pretended I was fine,
But I am blind,
I can not see,
All the open graves,
The broken hearts,
Standing in front of me,
My heart is cold,
Consuming,
[chorus]
Let my walls fall down like Jericho,
Help me to now down before,
the trumpet sounding salvation,
Let my walls fall down like Jericho,
Help me to trust in who you are,
[end chorus]
But you still love me,
You’re knocking,
Day by day,
On my gate,
Never forsaking me,
Your heart is open,
It’s open wide,
If only it could remind me,
That you were always by my side,
[chorus]

It’s exactly what I feel like. I’ve isolated myself from others and built up huge walls. Only to imprison myself

And I want out. I want to be able to trust other people. But I don’t know how. I don’t know where to start.

So ever since I could remember I wanted to be an architect, so naturally I went to school for it, I went to community college I learned a lot and struggled here and there and took a long while to make progress, all in all roughly 5 years to get my associates with a combination of semesters missed entirely and a lot of dropped/failed classes. But this past year I finally did it and got my associates  in architectural drafting, a mere stepping stone in the long path to becoming an architect. So since I had spent so much time in community college I ran out of student aid and the last few years had to be out of pocket, I decided to take a break and use the small degree I earned to get a job relatively in my field and make some money with this new degree. So I applied to a bunch of firms and had no luck whatsoever, most places that accepted people at my level wanted them currently enrolled in a 4 year, so I got help from a  hiring agency I got hired by a construction company to do virtual construction using my skills in the architectural software. I started to love it here, I was assigned to a small coordination team and things are incredibly laid back and I like everyone I work with, but one of the supervisors warned me that it won't be nearly as laid back once we move out of the coordination room at the end of this massive project. Is the comfort I have here worth sacrificing for my life-long dream of becoming an architect? What if I do it and end up hating where I work later on? What if I stay and things are just like I was told and I slowly start to hate it here? Is it worth it to try when I have to tackle the cost and left over debts from school to continue pursuing a higher education?

401,"TL;Dr im not sure how to read people, I’m not sure how to tell exactly what is wrong mentally with someone, but there is definitely something wrong with this girl and it’s really effecting our entire class AND our new teacher. 

There is this girl, she’s in her 20’s and in the beginning she acted fine, communicated with others but then she slowly started to change. She now has a problem with EVERYTHING. we can no longer talk in class we all have to sit at our assigned seats and are no longer allowed to socialize because she took it to the principal that everyone in the class “distracts” her. She constantly laughs and smirks at anyone who says something dumb or asks a stupid question. she always makes nasty comments to ME never to my face. For example we all went to Walmart to buy for a Christmas kid (a random kid who is in need of gifts) and I said “aw I wish we all could’ve gotten a kid so we could buy for more children instead of just one kid.” And she said “it’s not hard to find a tree and pick a kid yourself” in a bitchy way. I didn’t hear this but everyone else did. On another occasion I was in class socializing and said “man this work book is hard because the definitions in this book aren’t the same as in our chapter books” and she said (again not to me but by herself while in a group she was assigned to work in) “you have to read the fucking chapters” (then laughed) then one time we were trying to find out what date we could assign our “make up days” as (which are days we make up if we have a snow day) and I had a doctors appointment on one of the days assigned so I said that and she said really loud “again, we all have disagreements” and I said “I’m pretty sure disagreements and restrictions aren’t the same thing” and she told me to shut the fuck up.... I didn’t hear her say it cause she was facing the opposite direction but everyone else did. then she turned around and said “YOU be quiet”. everyone started defending me because they are all sick of her saying this stuff towards me when I have never done anything wrong to her! I should’ve stated in the beginning that my teacher made us sit together because she wanted to force us to be friends (which she denies doing but it was obviously bc when I asked her if I could get different seats she told me No). I tried in the beginning to be civil with her by offering her my lotion I told her she can use it whenever she wants and she said ok it smells good so I thought everything was cool but after that she just started verbally attacking me mostly behind my back. At this point she wears head phones someone even says a small word. she still chuckles at people and shakes her head if they say something she doesn’t like. —- we had a 2 day Christmas party and she was going to try to get my teacher in trouble for having it 2 days. She wouldn’t get in our Christmas picture with us she flat out said “No I’m not getting in a picture with you guys.” Then went to the restroom while we took it. We wore normal clothes instead of scrubs on those 2 days of the party and she didn’t she just wore her scrubs. she is now victimizing herself and is saying she’s being bullied !!! she has turned everyone against her because she’s so rude and now she’s acting like she’s bullied. At this point my teacher doesn’t even know what to do with her. My teacher has to separately ask her EVERYTHING because if she asks us to vote for something or our opinions of stuff as a class, the girl doesn’t talk or vote!! So our teacher babies her and asks her separately. A girl in our class decided to talk to her because there’s only 1 girl that she actually can “stand”. Our friend that talked to her told us later on what all she said and she said things like she has depression and anger issues and something about throwing a chair. She said she specifically hates ME for the reason of when I said “disagreements and restrictions aren’t the same thing” she said apologizing won’t work, that she’s “fucking done with everyone in the class”. She also refers to me as “that girl” and told my friend my desk is “always a fucking mess”

This all came out of no where. She truly has done this to herself and I’m not sugarcoating when I say we have ALL tried to include her and be nice. It’s almost as if she won’t quit until she completely victimizes herself to the point where she convinced herself mentally that she is being bullied or something. part of me thinks she continues this because no one has confronted her. There is just always a lot of tension. we bite our tongue so much. but after the Christmas party she left early because we aren’t doing anything and that’s the day we found out all the stuff she said. We go back to school soon and I’m really not sure how much longer I can bite my tongue here. Even our teacher is clueless and has gone to the principal multiple times on advice. It’s no surprise she hasn’t gotten any, the principal and everyone in there are god awful they just tell you to be civil and act friendly and all the shit we have already tried.
So what I’m asking is what the hell do I say to this girl when we go back?? Also is there a term for a mental illness she might have??? because I know there’s something going on there. ",27Dec2018,1

406,"Last year I was deemed disabled because I randomly pass out due to a heart problem and it’s not safe for me to live alone, drive, etc. I had to quit my job and sell my house. 

My mom has been taking care of me but it’s becoming clear that she is having cognitive problems. She’s been seeing a neurologist and psychiatrist for a couple of years because of her cognitive decline and they’ve told her it was due to stress and have dismissed it. 

There is no way this is stress induced impairment. She can’t remember how to make her favorite recipes, she gets in trouble at work constantly for messing up and comes home crying, can’t remember how to feed the pets, etc. 

She also refuses to listen to me when I tell her she’s not doing something correctly and gets upset when it ends up wrong. 

Besides my passing out, I have other limitations, but I feel as though I’m caring for her more than she’s caring for me. I don’t mind it, but I’m physically and mentally exhausted and it’s very frustrating. Especially since her doctors won’t do testing. 

She did have a neuropsychologist test her a few years ago and it came back that she probably has ADHD but she didn’t want to take “speed.” 

She smokes a lot so I wonder if she’s having mini strokes like her dad has. Does anyone have any advice? Get on the “speed,” get checked for dementia, something else? Please?",27Dec2018,1
407,"I’m a 20 year old female in college. I work in film and have a passion for photography. I don’t use social media because in highschool I was bullied badly. Because of that I’m a little awkward and shy. When we’re out in public like on a hike. I Like to take photos of my friends cooking or laughing. Like unplanned.

This makes older girls in my group say I’m creepy. They like posed photos. I usually don’t like selfies or group photos. I like photos of landscapes of candids. I’ve never posted any of these. They are never during private moments. They always kinda of act like I’m socially retarted. 

They say the photo thing makes me a creep. I sometimes look at people’s public Twitter or Instagram page but I don’t have an account. My friends say that I stalk people because I look at people’s page from highschool because I’m curious what they’re doing. 


My friends say that’s super creepy and weird. I’m very curious, I usually ask people a lot of questions when I first meet them or when I see my friends after a long day asking them stuff. They say I ask to many questions when I feel like I’m just trying to ask about people and not talk about myself.

It's a continuous cycle of creating life and then breaking that person's heart when you die. Everyone is just going to break someone's heart when they die, unless they have no one. There are lots of wonderful things in the world, like puppies and kittens, but those will also grow old and sick and be in pain and die. Everything comes to an end.

412,"So, I have this friend with which I had a fight a couple of weeks ago.

I was looking for another friend when he walked up the stairs with some other guys. He was talking about something. He walked up to me and told me to ""break his legs"", he meant me to kick him in the legs. At first I was hesitating, I responded with ""uhmmm"" but then he said ""ah yeah I forgot you are weak and dont have any strength"". I think he meant that as a joke. He turned around and I kicked him a bit hard. After that he went to talk with the guys he was talking to, seemingly not being hurt. He seemed perfectly fine and didnt say anything so I thought it didnt hurt after all.

I turn around to try to keep looking for the friend I came for in the first place. A second passes and he comes kicking me in the legs and swearing at me. I didnt want to fight him for real so I headed for the stairs, not saying anything. As I was leaving he screamed ""YOU CANT TAKE A JOKE"" and ""DONT TALK TO ME EVER AGAIN"".

You may ask why I thought this wasnt a joke and I have an answer for it. There is this thing here where we punch people in the arm and then the other guy is supposed to punch us back and the first one to say he cant take anymore loses.

I thought this was another thing like that, I didnt mean this to happen. Although he has made jokes that I dont really find funny because they are always targetted against me and kind of hurt me sometimes.

I wouldnt really think much of it but the thing is that he is friends with the guys im friends with and we usually play video games (We used to all play together) and now it seems like when Im playing with one of them he always comes and plays with them. They always follow him, leaving me alone. I never get a response so I dont even try to play with them after he comes.

I'm in my mid teens and am what you'd call a femcel. I don't hate guys or anything like that, I just realize I'm ugly and try not to lie to myself. Because of this I don't approach guys and am usually a little bit cold because my male friends in the past bullied me because of my looks.

I've known about this guy for three months and he's known about me for three months. He's approached me a few times but ended up leaving because I replied in mostly 'yes' or 'no', he offered to make me a bracelet twice. One time I was laughing in the same room as him and he kept looking up at me.

When family Christmas came, my sister gave out all her gifts to the kids, and my cousin gave my nephew nothing. Acted like nothing happened. My aunt said ‘oh we decided not to do the gift thing this year.’

421,"My boyfriend is the youngest of several siblings. Two are married and in their 30s. They have both shared their lack of interest in ever having children. His other sibling is engaged and they also don’t want to have kids. If anything, they will adopt but even that isn’t likely. 

My boyfriend’s parents constantly bug his older siblings about making them grandparents, but to no avail. Now, it’s falling onto me. Ever since I was 7, I’ve told my parents I didn’t want kids. At first it was a joke to them, and they laughed it off saying I would outgrow it. But now I’m in my 20s and in my last year of college and the idea of having kids is as unappealing as ever. 

My boyfriends grandmother and mother approached me the other day, asking my boyfriend and I if we would ever consider having kids. My boyfriend is slightly more open to it than I am, but as I have firmly drawn the line with not ever wanting to be pregnant due to health issues I have and the risks it could cause, he is keen on adopting. When we told his parents that we didn’t foresee having kids, and that if we did it would be through adoption, his mom and grandmother looked crestfallen. 

I hate that I feel guilty for deciding this in my own life, but I know it’s mostly my fault because if I ever said I would want to have my own child I know my boyfriend would probably get on board. So I was their parents’ last hope of continuing their family’s heritage and I stepped on it. 

They’ve made a few jokes about how their bloodline is discontinued after their kids and how they’ll have a “hodgepodge” of adopted grandchildren, which makes me feel like I’m in a kind of racist medieval drama tv show. But I still feel terrible. 

am I being selfish? is this something I’m unrightfully depriving of not only my boyfriend’s parents, but my boyfriend too? I hate that I even feel pressure to have kids.

I constantly ask about when things are going to take place and I hear some BS excuse as to why it hasn’t yet such as “Oh, I forgot to send the quote to our corporate guy.” So after two months of this I emailed our corporate guy myself and have yet to hear a response (this happened less than a week ago, so I’m waiting for the holidays to pass before bringing it up again since I’m on break from school before I go back and work again). I had a plan to go to my property manager and day something along the lines of “This has been going on for too long, if I don’t have an answer on what’s going to happen by the end of the month then I will have to take further independent action.” AKA sue them.

We can't even talk about a game without him making up lies about how he's the best in some way, and he's elitist about it. People make fun of him because he fought a 5th grader and won by biting him and kneeing him in the crotch.

I have an appointment today with the Podiatrist.

 My Dad (Chiropractor) read my results yesterday and thinks it's a hairline fx in the bottom of my heel.

 I said, I would like to avoid getting a cortisone shot, reasons:

1. Shots in the foot hurt like hell (I've had 9 before)
2. All is does is help with pain from the inflammation (I'm not in pain, so that rules that out)  

Secondly, I would like to refrain from having a cast cuz that forces me to be on crutches, reasons:

1. I have 3 flights of stairs to concur every morning for work.

2.I have to be mobile for work (front desk Neurosurgery office) 

3.Showers would suck. 

When i looked up, ""Can hairline fx's heal on their own?"" they said, ""Yes if you refrain from activities using the affected area."" I've been walking on my tip toes for two weeks, and yet to put my heal down and use it, so wouldn't that be what they referring to?

442,"Long post incoming. Background info necessary.

I’ve [F25] been with my boyfriend [M26] over a year and a half now. He’s awesome. We have a really great relationship and he goes out of his way every day to show me he loves me. We laugh, we play, we are super comfortable with each other and always have a good time. I don’t doubt that he loves me a lot.

When we first started dating, about two months in, I saw a girl (we’ll call her Lizzie) text his phone at 11pm when I was staying at his house, and it was strange to me because he barely texted *me* at night. I decided not to say anything because maybe it was his cousin or something, and all she said was “what’s up?”

About five months ago I saw he was texting a girl we’ll call Maggie he knew from high school. I looked at their conversation and they were catching up, but it seemed very slightly flirty. This conversation lasted days. One day she tried to started a conversation at 10:30pm although he didn’t answer. She has moved across the country and as she was telling him about the beautiful landscapes there he told her “I wish I could join you!” He mentioned that he had a girlfriend later in the conversation. But it was evident from their conversation that this girl wanted to pursue him regardless.

I’m okay with him having friends who are girls, but I am extremely cautious of these things with boyfriends. He also was liking selfies of women he knew from high school on Instagram. Lizzie is one of these women. Half of them were photos of just their bodies. And then I saw he was looking up those same girls’ instagrams on a regular basis.

I confronted him soon after I found out he was texting Maggie. I told him seeing him liking other women’s half-naked selfies, combined with him texting women I’m unaware of, and looking up these same women’s profiles to check in on them is not okay. Other women texting him at night is not okay and that I would never think of doing that to him. I told him it’s his job to shut down situations where he knows a woman is trying to hit on him. I told him it makes it seem like he is interested in other women still. He said he absolutely isn’t. He apologized and said someone has made him feel that way before and that he won’t ever do it again. He said I was the best thing to ever happen to him and he will do whatever it takes to not mess our relationship up. 

He said he would get rid of his social media if I wanted him to. I said no, it’s not social media that’s the problem, it’s your actions. It may sound like a dumb millennial thing, but these things you’re doing mean something. He said he’d unfollow all of the women I felt he was checking in on and I told him he didn’t need to do that. He unfollowed them all anyways. He told me he blocked Maggie’s number. He was not defensive at all and was listening intently, asking how he can make things better. I felt better after our conversation.

Fast forward to this week. He goes to search something on Instagram while we’re lying in bed, and who is in his recently searched? Lizzie. He looked her up recently even though we had had this conversation about how uncomfortable his “checking in” on her and other women made me feel. I was going to let it go because I don’t want to deal with it. Now I’m starting to have dreams of him talking to other women behind my back, so I know this is bothering me more than I’m willing to admit to myself.

I don’t know if I am justified in being upset about him looking up Lizzie again. It seems like he maybe had a thing with this woman in the past, but I haven’t asked him directly. I’m going back and forth between “all he did was look her up” and “he did something that he knew made me feel uncomfortable, we had a conversation about this and it seems like he is interested in her still”. Am I justified in bringing this up to him?",27Dec2018,1
443,"Hello, I hope you’re all doing well for the holiday season. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Just to be clear, this situation started unfolding this morning—just a few hours ago, really. My good friend, C, called me and told me her mother, S, was missing; last night, she drove to a city a few hours from where they currently live to visit someone. That person contacted C this morning and told her that S had not texted them to let them know that she had arrived home safely. Sure enough, C went home and found everything untouched and her mother’s car still gone. Called and texted S, but nothing—her phone seems to be dead. Called her work and other family members, still nothing. They just filed a missing-person report and apparently a search for her is underway.

My friend is understandably very upset, but she also suffers from anxiety issues in the first place and we’ve had some scares with her family before—it’s hard not to jump to the worst-case scenario. I’m usually the friend that everyone seems to feel compelled to go to when they’re feeling down or upset or have some sort of problem, and I’ve gotten pretty good at helping people I would say. In this case, however, I’m completely in over my head. I’m just as scared and concerned as C is, I’ve known her and her family for nearly 15 years (vast majority of my life), so they’ve become like an extended family of sorts to me. 

I’ve wracked my brain on how else to help beyond what I’ve done already, but it’s difficult to do much because the situation is so very out of our hands and we currently live about three hours apart. I also am aware that the only thing that can truly reassure my friend is her mother being found, safe and sound. However, I really want to do my best to be there and comfort C, even in the worst-case scenario. If you all have any advice, I would really appreciate the help. Thank you so much for your time!",27Dec2018,1

445,"I have on many occasions heard my downstairs neighbor beating his dogs for various reasons that do not warrant his reaction. At times, my stove has vibrated because the abuse was so intense. I have a video I recorded of him verbally and physically abusing the dog (unfortunately I started recording AFTER the worse part of it), but the audio makes it clear there is abuse happening. It obviously doesn't show anything, but you can hear him throwing things at the dog and threatening to break it's leg. 

I have also woken up in the middle of the night to him, what I think was him, throwing his daughter, and further screaming at the top of his lungs at her. She's very young, and a sweetheart, I feel awful not doing or saying anything. 

He almost daily blasts his music at odd hours. Today he started at 5:30am. I'm an engineer and need decent sleep to perform well at work so being woken up at 5:30 is frustrating. 

Is there anything I can do in this situation? Who should I contact to ensure the situation and lives involved are taken care of?

447,"TL;DR: I hate shoes in the house but some people don’t take this seriously. Without coming across crazy, how can I get my point across?

FULL POST: I’m very, very, very adamant that shoes are not worn in my house, at any time, for any reason. If I leave my phone in the house, for example, I will take my shoes off inside the front door to go get my phone. If someone comes over, I will reminder them that shoes come off at the door. 

A few reasons I’m this way/a couple things to add:

1) Shoes are disgusting. A massive majority of people take no time in cleaning them, especially the bottom, and are in gross places (public bathrooms) on a regular basis.  Studies have shoes are literally (I hate that word but it applies here) thousands of times dirtier than a toilet seat. 

2) When I bought my home three years ago, I spent about $3,500 on new carpet and flooring. It’s in year four and my carpet and floors are in pristine shape.

3) People will often unintentionally break (or try to break) this “rule” of mine and don’t find it to be a big deal if it’s only “once or twice”, but to me, it defeats the entire purpose. Once the germs are there, they’re there. 

4) “But do you have pets?” -Yes, two dogs, but their paws are a) a fraction the size of shoes, b) cleaned regularly by me, c) cleaned regularly by the dogs themselves, d) aren’t going everywhere that I go (stores, restaurants, arenas, etc), and e) paws and rubber souls are not collecting germs in the same fashion.

I know a lot of people who have rules about shoes in the house, and a lot who don’t care and even put their dirty shoes on beds/furniture. 

Where do you stand on this, and how do you justify/reason your stance? People sometimes think I’m going overboard if they start walking into my house without any intention of removing their shoes and I say “hey, shoes off for me please.”",27Dec2018,1

How can I repair our relationship?",27Dec2018,1
457,"There’s a lot to explain about her, which I’ll try to keep brief. She’s mid-50s and has always been this way, but has gotten so much worse lately. Here’s a rundown: highly neurotic, extremely anxious, pretty consistently depressed, overly sensitive, easily overwhelmed, vocal about not liking herself / poor self-esteem, major mood swings (happy/neutral one day, absolutely miserable/angry the next and will easily lash out), very introverted + social anxiety, hates people, reclusive outside of her job. I don’t mean to sound like I’m diagnosing her, but they’re very obviously observable traits through 27 years of life with her. She otherwise cares very much about her “normal” image. She’s had the same office job for almost 20 years, keeps her house meticulously clean, is financially stable, quite religious, very traditional values, etc.   
 

She’s been married to my dad for over 30 years, who is her polar opposite. Very light-hearted, upbeat, social guy. He only recently has been calling me to vent about how much of a toll this is taking on him and their marriage. We (my dad, two brothers, and I) have always traipsed very carefully around her and her mental state. She will either act very, very stressed or very, very depressed and she’s very testy and hateful during these episodes. So our approach has been to be quiet and careful around her, and to eventually gently interact with her in a positive/neutral way or *very casually* ask if she needs help with something. No matter our approach, it ends badly. Usually met with a very emotional response (angry or depressed, depending on the day) that it doesn’t matter, she does everything and nobody cares, etc. Sometimes it escalates from there and there’s no reasoning with her that (1) everything is fine and nothing bad happened, and (2) we’re here to help her. I truly believe my dad goes above and beyond to accommodate her moods and be as helpful as possible, but she has extremely hateful outbursts directed at him, at times when he deserves it least. The most recent is that Christmas was horrible (we had no idea, as we all perceived it to be a happy day) and everybody hates her and she never wants to do it again, and dad only got her a gift so that she would feel like even more shit than usual.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes these outbursts seem delusional. Months ago, he made a  (positive) comment to me in private about how not many couples stay married, but they have and he wouldn’t have it any other way (ironically). He updated me that she turned on him that night about how she “heard us talking about her and knows how awful she is and just can’t do anything right” and would not even let him reason with her that her reality was exactly the opposite of what had actually happened. She expressed suicidal ideation to me a few years ago, over a very minor issue. If I remember right, I had casually offered to help her with yard work and it turned into her being very hurtful and honest about her wishes. Expressing any kind of criticism about her behavior seems out of the question. She creates entire narratives about all of us hating her all on her own, with evidence to the contrary, and I can only imagine what a real, spoken concern would do to her.  

&amp;#x200B;

I think we’ve all normalized her behavior throughout the years and my dad (until now) has accepted it as his duty to traipse carefully and then be the recipient of hateful outbursts due to her issues. We’re all coming to terms with how unhealthy the whole thing really is, and how much worse it will be in the future if it continues at this rate. I believe she has some real problems and needs some real help, but because of how antisocial she is, I feel very discouraged about getting her to that point. I also feel discouraged about even expressing concern to her in the first place, but I believe that it can technically be done if I choose my words very carefully. She would 110% hate the idea of speaking to an actual person, but I wonder if there are alternative solutions. Maybe she could even just see a primary doctor about a possible hormone imbalance and go from there? It’s my only idea at this point. My ears are open to guidance in any form.",27Dec2018,1

465,"So for backstory :

I’ve always had an active imagination. As a kid my head was always stuck in a book, and I was constantly writing stories and making up tales, and telling anyone who’d listen. I loved the attention, and I loved making people laugh and smile. Basically I just loved to make shit up. It’s a talent what can I say.

I still love telling stories and writing - it’s a huge passion of mine, and one day I’d love to write a book for real. But anyway.

So here’s my problem. Since I was a child and into my early teens (but not anymore!) - I lied to my friends. Constantly. About almost every detail of my life.  Little tidbits, anecdotes, inconsequential stuff, or so I thought.

I made up fake friends, fake family members, fake adventures and fake memories. I even made up Facebook accounts for them (that are still up even though I’ve deleted my own Facebook!), and fake text threads, and had my “friends” comment on my posts and like my photos. Sometimes I’d lie just to make a story more interesting, or to make friends laugh. To make boring things interesting. I just loved lying about my life, and at the time I never knew why.

(Hint: it’s because I was super unhappy with myself, felt the need to constantly please others, and wanted to seem more interesting  to boot- it’s not that deep.)

Here’s the real kicker though, not only do I love to spin tales: I also have truly terrible memory. 

So basically I’ve dug my self into a shit show of a hole. I have told so many lies to my friends- I EVEN LIED ABOUT MY NAME (don’t ask, I KNOW.) - that I can’t keep up with it all. You wouldn’t believe the amount of times my friends have brought up some lie or fake memory I’d told them years ago about myself, and had no idea what the fuck they were talking about, 

This really wouldn’t be such a problem if I didn’t still have the same friends from childhood, and if they all didn’t have such great fucking memory. (Why was I cursed with actual good friends who listen!!!! )

ANYWAY

I want to come clean.
I don’t lie about my life anymore, why would I, little me did enough of it for the both of us, and I see no reason to. 

I’m so embarrassed about all the lies I told as a kid. And the hole I’ve dug myself into. It just seems so stupid (because it is) But telling people who love me, and care about me, and who I love in return - that I was lying about so many parts of my life, stuff that doesn’t even really matter; would be so humiliating. I went to such an effort to make my stories seem real (the Facebook accounts and texts) and it’s really, REALLY pathetic.

But I can’t have his hanging over my head anymore. I may only be 19, but the friends I have now are people I see myself staying friends with for the rest of my life. 
What if in the future I say something contradictory to what I’ve told them in the past and they call me out for it? What if I forget WHOLE PEOPLE I’ve made up, and end up making a bigger tit out of myself then I already have. The longer I go without saying anything, the more pathetic and truly sad it becomes.

Believe me I know how childish this seems. And I’m rightly embarrassed to even be admitting to this. I know the conversations with my friends are going to be awkward and uncomfortable, and leave me feeling totally ashamed of myself. So finally -

How do I go about this Reddit? What do I say? How do I come out of this with even a smidgeon of my (little) remaining dignity still in tact?

Help me please!

466,"I originally posted this on TIFU and I’m just here for some advice on what to do. (Yes I copy pasted from my TIFU post)

There is a Female Italian exchange student at the school I go to, and I took interest in her. We talked a few times, I got her Snapchat and I even asked her to the movies (she said she would see if she was available and turned out she wasn’t).
I talked to my friend who is generally good at social interaction (I’m really not) about this and he said I should try 1 more time to ask her out. I was joking around and said “what if I sent her a meme?” (Buckle up doods this is where the shit show starts). He tells me that it’s a good idea, and convinced me for a solid 45 mins to do it. I give in because I am not good with people and thought “hey, what if it works?” I ended up sending a stupid meme that with a caption that my friend helped me create implied “Hey wanna be my GF/go out some time?” I waited for about 10 mins and I got a response, but waited 4 hours or something to open it cause I was afraid (rightfully so). All I got back was “I’m sorry, no.” 

Now I’m wondering if I should apologize because this was out of character for me, if my friend didn’t convince me for 45 mins straight I wouldn’t have done this. Also I wasn’t in a great state of mind.

467,"I know this is a really touchy subject, but I feel like it's something that needs to be talked about in our relationship. My girlfriend and I have been dating for several years now, we're getting married in several months, and I love her more than I could possibly describe on here. Although her weight gain does not affect my love for her, it does affect my physical and sexual attraction towards her, as much as that hurts me to say. She's probably gained about 60-70 pounds since we've been together. She'll try dieting every once in a while, but it usually doesn't last long and she'll just gain it back by going back to her unhealthy ways. I think it's been having a real toll on our sexual relationship over the last few years, which is basically non-existent, even though it's not something that either of us want to admit to being the reason. But with the marriage coming up, I feel like this is something that needs to be addressed because although these aren't things that will cause me to stop loving her, they are still things that are important to me in a relationship and when it comes to committing my life to someone.

I know that throughout our lives, our bodies change. We age, we have kids, we get sick, and have all sorts of ups and downs. I'm more than willing to stick with her through all of that.

I was dismissed from my program for failing a course. I'm gonna appeal the dismissal and I want to be as honest as possible in my appeal. I don't have any extenuating circumstances because the reason I failed is because I miscalculated my average on my midterm before the final exam. The whole class got a 12% curve and 5 questions removed. The email we received didn't specify if the mark we got already included the 5 removed questions and the 12% curve. The email said ""5 questions were given and 12% added to the mark you see there""  


For example, if the exam was out of 100 and I got 60% (40/100), after seeing the email, I would add 12 (72%) and make the test out of 95(75%) instead of a 100.

The person that’s training me (30F) worked in this role for a few years and moved to another position in the company. She’s nice and has helped me as I learn, but when it comes to casual conversation she totally shuts me out. Mind you, I’m not interrupting work for said conversation. Also, I constantly hear her chatting with other employees during work time about the same sort of things.

As lame as it may sound, it’s sort of discouraging me. When you spend a lot of time at work, you want to enjoy who you work with, right? I feel like it’d be weird to say something.

Am I doing something wrong? Or is she just naturally a colder person? Am I expecting too much? Thoughts? TIA",27Dec2018,1
474,"I try so hard to be on time to things, I really do. But for some reason, maybe due to poor time management, I am always running 1-5 minutes late to things and I can't seem to break the habit. I am a really deep sleeper (which really doesn't help) and I have to set upwards of 50 alarms to wake up on time. Generally, I can sleep through about half of them without meaning to. This is probably my biggest problem, but I have taken steps to fix it by downloading an alarm app called AMdroid that has a lot of customizable alarm features that really help. For some reason, though, I still have a problem with tardiness. I'm not massively late, just always 1-5 minutes late. If you've ever had or do have this problem, what were steps that you took to fix it? What were things that you think I could do that might help me curve this problem? 

I would really like to be early to things rather than late, I just can't seem to break myself of this and it's driving me crazy.

477,"I have really bad anxiety(according to my therapist I have social anxiety and another kind that's unspecified) and I'm constantly afraid of some kind of emergency happening in my home, specifically an intruder. It's one of my worst fears.

I need help to convince myself that I'm safe at home and that nobody will intrude at any time. We have security cameras which I check often, and as I write this post I'm sitting by the screen.

At this point I know full well that it's all in my head due to my anxiety, but I just can't help it. I don't want to be scared, and I don't want to feel compelled to check the cameras as much as I do. It's worse when I'm completely alone, as one can assume. 

It's been hard to fall asleep and I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night. During those times I'm already worried about the sounds I'm hearing in the house, so I always instinctively cover my ears with my blanket.

I've tried exercises in which I tell myself that nobody is there or imagine my negative thoughts floating past me, but they don't help at all. The sounds I hear the most often are near the doors, which are the worst since I keep thinking that someone is at the door trying to come in. 

One night, I was washing dishes and heard someone knocking hard on the back door. I ran away, shaking as I woke my dad up. Nobody was at the door when I looked at the cameras. It wasn't even fear of an intruder since I'm sure none would knock before breaking in, but this is how ridiculous it's gotten. When I hear a noise at the door I immediately check the cameras to make sure it's just my parents. I just hope there's never a day when someone random is there.

This was too long but if anyone has any way to help me, I'd appreciate it.

I do have my permit and answered every question correctly on the permit test but it only really acts as an ID card.

My mom's reasoning for not teaching me is that giving me a car is the same as giving me a weapon. She insists that I will inevitably crash and injure myself due to my mental health issues.

I have been in therapy since I was fourteen. I have anxiety issues and have been suicidal in the past. I don't wish to share my entire list of diagnoses but there is nothing that would truly prevent me from driving. 

My mom insists that my past therapists (not the current one) told her I should never be allowed to drive. However, I have been doing better lately, and my current therapist  believes driving would lead me to being more independent.

My mom is all for independence. Except for the driving. I take $15 Lyfts to work when I can't get rides and I would have gotten promoted to a higher paying position (right now I make min wage) if I had a car. I have been told that to my face by my manager.

500,"I am a 14 year old male. I though yesterday would be a good time to buy Payday 2 (A M-Rated FPS about robbing banks) on Steam with my shiny new gift card I got for Christmas. So I installed it and played it for an hour without my mom knowing. Deciding I wanted to keep the game, I told my mom about the game I had installed, and knowing my mother's insane hatred of M-Rated games, I gave her reasons why I wanted to keep it. I told her it was not that bad a game despite its rating, offered her to watch it while I played to prove it to her, and gave her websites (CommonSense) in which she could view hundred of parents agreeing that it was really more of a 14+ game.

&amp;#x200B;

She then proceeded to throw all of my statements out the window, watch the trailer for the game, and immediately called me crazy for now having not one. not two, but T H R E E M-Rated games on my Steam library (TF2, CSGO, and the to be soon deleted Payday.) out of the 8 games I had. She also called the parents on the review crazy, for allowing their kids to play such a violent, offensive game. But the largest offense was that I had installed it without her permission, just as I had done with TF2. This lying and cheating was apparently an intolerable offense, and forced me to immediately delete the game which I did. Which sucks, since I really wanted the game.

&amp;#x200B;

But that's not the bad part. After deleting the game after much protest, she then immediately demanded my electronics, so she could 'check' them. I told her I had nothing to hide, but she had no right to comb through my personal property like they were nothing. But she combed through every text, email, and a bunch of other things on there, much to my dismay.

501,"So my dad started a business well over four decades ago. He needed a partner so his younger brother became a minor partner. About 25 years ago my father decided to purchase the property that housed one of the two business locations. My uncle agreed to be a minor partner in that purchase. When it came time for the closing my uncle didn't have his share of the down payment money so my father scrambled around for the money and the deal went through. My dad let my uncle stay a shareholder in the property purchase.

That location was very busy. My dad and my uncle really don't get along. We think my uncle might have a slight touch of asbergers. My uncle is very disorganized, forgetful, doesn't think  ahead, very impulsive etc. He's had drug, alcohol, and money problems his whole life. He's frankly an embarrassment to our family. My dad has constantly bailed him out. My uncle just doesn't seem to understand personal responsibilty and cause and effect. My dad let him run that location and live in an attached apartment nearly free rent. That location made money but it was a fucking shitshow and embarrassment.

Ten years ago my parents found out my uncle was hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. They were afraid the bank was going to seize the property to pay the debt. They were forced to sell the property and close that location. My dad got a check for a couple million dollars and my uncle got a check for half a million dollars. Before the sale my parents loaned my uncle the money to pay off the debt.

My uncle acts like that sale was the best thing that happened. He tells people he got the entire sale price like he was the sole owner of that property. Yes it was a valuable piece of property but we had to close a great location. Our remaining location does good business but it's small and we rent it. Even if we didn't keep the business open we could have made a ton of money from rent if we didn't sell the property. There are also a lot of positives to owning the location that houses your business. Every time the lease comes up we are worried about renewal and rent increase.

Now we are down to one location and we do pretty well cause a lot of the traffic from the closed shop came to the one that stayed open.

In the past ten years my uncle really hasn't amended his lifestyle. He's still buying tons of random stuff and going on month long vacations. He's single but he owns two cars. I don't think he has much saved up. 

From all the stories I've heard he literally spent all his years getting high or drunk doing stupid shit with his stupid friends and spending all his money on stupid shit. He made really good money in this business. 

Now he wants out of the business cause he's nearly seventy. I'm in my early thirties and I want to be an owner. He wants to sell his shares and asked for an inflated price. He thought my dad was purchasing them and kind of insinuated my dad can pay more than market value cause ""he has it."" Then when he found out I was buying them I think he felt bad asking for the inflated price. Since I'm an only child he started saying my dad was going to give me his shares for free and I'd be making too much and it's not fair and I'm greedy. I think he was using that argument to try and guilt us into paying his inflated value.

Not only does he want us to buy his shares but he also wants to keep working. I really don't like him and don't want him to continue working. He keeps saying stuff like ""if I don't work I'll be homeless"" or ""I'll have to work at Walmart."" Apparently he gave my parents this same guilt trip ten years ago when they found out he was in massive debt.

To add insult to injury I've been working my ass off in the business for ten years since I graduated university. If it wasn't for me they wouldn't be able to maintain the scale of the operation they do now. I'm also working for practically slave wages. If I wasn't in the picture they have to curtail the scale of the operation and or hire more staff. I'm saving them literally thousands of dollars a year on wages and generating tens of thousands (probably hundreds of thousands) of dollars in revenue. Every year my uncle is doing less and less and still making the same.

My father has money saved up for his retirement. He purchased multiple homes and sent me to college. My uncle literally just purchased a home. My uncle has this mentality like his financial problems aren't his fault. I swear he thinks my dad just got lucky and that's why he has money saved up. He's almost kind of resentful of my dad.

She let me know it was happening and said she only wants me, but I've had experience with this type of thing in the past and the odds are never in my favor. She seems to be invested in me quite heavily and we spend a lot of time together. I really want to believe her considering that she hasn't been trying to hide it. I just need advice as to what I should do.


Aside from these recent events she had never brought him up in conversation. But when I asked questions to figure things out about their past she got very emotional and cried. Am I bound to be left in the dust? I'd appreciate any insight.",27Dec2018,1
511,"This guy and I have been friends for 35 years; our families are very close. Six years ago my friend had an encounter with a woman and it resulted in a son – who recently turned six. This friend of mine has been married for 32 years and has nine children with his wife. After his wife found out about the little boy, she left and they were separated for two years. Five weeks ago my friend had a breakdown – gun to head committed to the psych ward breakdown, it was really bad. For the past eight weeks he and his wife began to talk and she is willing to work on the marriage for the sake of their children.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend and the mother of the six-year-old have no relationship. Once his wife left my friend slowly slipped into a nasty depression and wanted nothing to do with the six-year-old; he never built a relationship with him and my friend is very detached from the child. My friend financially supported the two of them (mother and six-year-old) and my friend’s sister does spend time here and there with the six-year-old. They (mother and six-year-old) are from another state and moved to my state with the hope of my friend wanting to start a relationship with her – begin a new family per se. Again, my friend wanted nothing to do with either of them. For the past 1.5 years they have lived in my state I have visited the six-year-old 2-3 times a week to make sure he had everything he needed and was being taken care of.

&amp;#x200B;

There was serious altercation recently and the mother of the six-year-old is no longer around and I was able to get emergency temporary custody of him. Thing is, I want to keep (adopt) him. He is an excellent sweet child and my wife is willing to adopt him as well. The real problem is with our families and friends; the six-year-old brings up heartache for my friend and his wife. If I keep the six-year-old my friend, his wife and their families will see him regularly and I’m worried about that. The six-year-old’s maternal family isn’t the best bunch so I’d rather not see him go with them. There is no need for the six-year-old to go into foster care when he is surrounded by people who are more than able to provide and care for him.

&amp;#x200B;

I really need advice. I am torn. I love my friend, his wife and children dearly - I don't want to lose my relationship with them. I also love this little boy and the thought of letting him go makes me physically ill. Any advice?

tl;dr I want to adopt my best friend's son who he wants nothing to do with. I don't want to ruin my relationship with friend but I love the child.",27Dec2018,1
512,"So for some background first of all; my girlfriend of over 2 years and I split up recently. I'm 22 and she is 20, and while it was admittedly gut wrenching to let someone so close to me go, we had a reasonably amicable breakup and her reasons for it are understandable.

Obviously breakups are always difficult, and she was my first proper long term relationship so I am understandably feeling a little lost at the moment. And while I'm very sad that I won't have her in the context of companionship and emotional support, one of the things that playing on my mind a lot is sex.

I'm having a tough time dealing with the thought that she will one day - presumably after a mourning period of some length - end up having a sexual relationship with somebody else. While this is inevitable and I can't do anything about it (and nor should I be able to), I'm struggling to work past this and the thought is constantly circling around in my head.

Moreover, I'm concerned about the priority that sex seems to has taken in my life. I would consider myself quite a sexual person, and while I obviously need time to move on before getting back on the dating scene and jumping into bed with someone, I'm very much dreading the dry spell that it inevitably coming (I realize the slight hypocrisy here).

So my question is really, how can I move past the lack of intimate contact that I'm going to be experiencing for the next few months at least? And do I have a poor attitude to sex? Do I treat it as too much of a priority in my life? How do I learn to be happy in my life without that sexual intimacy?",27Dec2018,1
513,"My mom has a history psychologically abusing me. For the past ten years I have felt hopeless, wanting my mom out of my life to stay away from me. She continues to invade to invade my privacy therefore the only contact I have with her is letting her know I’m alive every few months, saying happy birthday to birthdays and wishing happy holidays for the past 3.5 years. She has been blocked also for 3.5 years where she cannot respond on the other end because I didn’t want to hear manipulate the situation and not listen to me tell her that I do not want to talk to her other than letting her know I’m ok out of courtesy. After moving four times in two years I finally settled down and bought a house. My mom found my address somehow, I never gave it to her. I received a Christmas card in the mail, didn’t know who it was from so I opened it. My jaw dropped when I saw the inside from her. My mom got my address and I was terrified at the moment, my psychologically abusive Mother was back to torment me some more. I am almost 40 and I feel I have never been able to live my live because my mother keeps controlling it. I don’t want her to know where I live, she finds my address somehow after not knowing what state I lived in. I moved 3k miles away and didn’t tell her. I didn’t tell her who I was dating she went and found out from my Facebook and looked him up to. This woman is sick and doesn’t respect any boundary I set with her and as soon as she found me, I felt that control she had was back. I’m now afraid she will show up.

Around the same time, we had started to open up to the idea of having kids. Lo and behold, we got pregnant about 3 months ago.

While we won’t do anything while pregnant, I was curious to how do people engage in this activity after having kids? This behavior can have possible negative effects on the relationship so once kids are involved, it could also effect them if mommy and daddy are having troubles.

In other words, how does having children change the game in participating in group sex because you could be putting them at emotional risk too? Looking for real world experiences.",27Dec2018,1

The bedroom is all tile, and today I’ve flushed the track to the best of my ability with hot water and a shop vac until the water from under the track came out clear. (Took quite some time). The screws holding the track down are stripped and rusted, was unable to remove the track.

519,"Hello reddit. I didn't ever think I was going to have to post something like this, but here I am having to type this out. This happened last Wednesday night and involves my best friend (ex bf??), me, my boyfriend, and my bfs wife. I will title bf as B and his wife as BW. 

WARNING: This is gonna be long, and I'm on mobile.

So last Wednesday all four of us were hanging out and decided we wanted to drink together since none of us had really gotten to in a few months and missed each other. Something important to the story is that both my boyfriend and B are FTM trans preop, but B has been on T for a year. Well, we all sit down and B pours BW, my boyfriend and I all double shots and we begin to drink. Neither my boyfriend or I had eaten that day and didn't realize it until it was too late. B cannot drink hard liquor or he has seizures so he only had 3 beers and half a glass of spiked eggnog. We did not know this.

About an hour in, B keeps feeding all 3 of us more double shots. We were getting too drunk too quickly and ended up taking roughly 5 double shots in an hour. The last thing we really remembered is stepping outside for a smoke. My boyfriend only remembers smoking and then crying, BW only remembers crying and leaving, and I have a few very vague but terrifying memories of what occured. 

I remember laying on a blanket with all of us naked and doing sexual acts with each other. Then next thing I know I am in the shower having a PTSD triggered episode and hysterically crying and not breathing right. I am in a poly relationship and also have a fiance, and he was the one trying to take care of me in the shower. Then I am in bed so dizzy I cannot see while my boyfriend layed beside me crying about not being able to remember what was happening. Then I woke up. 

Apparently, from what my roomate and fiance have told me, as well as what B has told BW, after we came back from smoking, B made me go get a blanket for the floor. I have messages of him telling me that ""this might really happen this time"" but i did not respond when i was apparently getting us all the blanket. Then B proceeded to tell my boyfriend and BW that my fiance was okay with us all having a foursome and that I was the one who told him this. We all proceeded to begin having the foursome, but when the 3 of us began to sober up, B kept giving us more shots. When I woke up I had vaginal damge and was bleeding, and my boyfriend had anal bleeding. Our bodies had bruises around our necks, thighs, and buttocks. We were so sore we could barely move for 3 days. The pain was awful. I reached out to BW to see how she was feeling and to try to figure out what had happened.

BW informed me that B admitted to her that he had given us 6 more double shots within another hour period so that, ""the fun wouldn't end"". He also admitted to lying about me telling everyone and him that my fiance was okay with this. BW wouldn't give me any more info past this. 

I then found out from my fiance and roomate of what happened next. My fiance finally gets upset because he heard us and comes into the room and asks me to come speak with him. I apologized and then began arguing with him. Then I told him I didn't want to have sex with them and was scared and didn't know where I was. I then began crying and convulsing strangely and was in and out of consciousness and crawled into the shower for some reason. I remember none of this. I believe B gave all 3 of us alchohol poisoning. My fiance finally told them to leave and helped get our boyfriend into bed ( we are in a triad) after he got me to calm down. My fiance was just as terrified and had no idea what was happening as he had headphones on before things went south as well as my roommate, they thought we were just having a party and could not hear us at first.

A lot more happened but I dont want to give more details, this is already a train wreck of a post. We were aparently penetrated with dilods and one of my vibrators was used during this all happening. (Hence the importance of the Trans stuff, no actual penises were used, so I dont kmow if this is actually rape or not.)

My boyfriend and I are in terrible states. I feel violated. I know I cheated on my fiance. I got way too fucked up, and I just dont have words. My roomate said he heard my boyfriend and I crying and saying no and then he came outside to check on us. Thats when B sat us down and was pouring us more shots. My roomate has terrible regret and apologized for not stopping it. I do not blame him. It was not anyone's fault but my own. He wasn't sure what was going on. My fiance is amazing and the fact that he didn't flip his lid and leave me that night I just....I appreciate him more than words can describe. I have a feeling if he had not stayed by both our sides we would have died from choking on our own vomit. 

But now. The issue. We decided the next day to cut them both out of our lives because BW was defending B and was saying she didn't remember anything but wasn't in pain. B told her about how much ""fun we had"" but wont tell my boyfriend or I. BW is a good friend and B has abused her in the past, but she keeps enabling B and will not leave him and I know she is just as toxic as B at this point.

B is the only one with a memory of what happened that night and he refused to tell us what happened besides 3 senteces. He said it was ""hot"" and that I ""missed a good show"". He only drank a small amount but purposely kept us drunk for his amusement.

My boyfriend only knew them for a month and we had never had sex yet, so now we dont even remember our first time together either.

I've known B and BW for over 3 years and I know the right course of action is to cut them out of my life. But I'm so scared, im so so fucking scared. I know how they both are, and if someone cuts them off or tries to accuse them of wrong doing they will retaliate and try to ruin that persons life in any way they can. They call themselves ""#teampetty"" because of this. They have done horrible things in the past that I thought were okay because they explained the person ""deserved it"" but it was never something like sexual assault.

I dont know what to do reddit. Today is the day I am supposed to cut them out because I was just waiting for them to return some of my clothes and BW just left. Im shaking. Im crying. What do I fucking do. I dont know what to do. Please help.",27Dec2018,1

525,"Now before I advance with this, no this isn't as bad as it can be. There are worse people out there in the world, people who wanna kill, rape, steal, etc. So there is a disclaimer.

My brother is slowly turning into a real dick in life, especially towards me and my parents and it's slowly crawling into the real world. And to be frank, my parents don't do much as much as they should about it. 

Like yeah, when I was 12-13 I was a angry and dumb teenager, but my parents took care of it when I acted wrong. I would get my punishment, my weeks worth of doing nothing fun, and then afterwards we repeat. It's being a teenager. I don't wanna talk like im above God's earth or whatever, I am 20 and tbh I'm still pretty dumb.

I think my misbehaving stopped when I was around 16-17 years-ish. I started learning to give respect, act respectful, appreciate what you got, I never cussed my parents out anymore, etc., all the good stuff (sometimes). I am still angry and get upset, but that's basic human emotion and I never use it to be vulger at others.

My brother is 18 years old and he is one of the biggest dicks I know in my life. Yeah yeah, brotherly love. It's not, I can't stand him because he treats me and my parents with little to no respect and tbh I am nervous about what he might do towards other that won't be so nice to him. 

He needs to get a good kick in the ass honestly, and maybe that might teach him (I am not doing it), but if he came home saying he got beat up in school, I won't be so upset about it. 

First off, here is an example. So my mom has this office party thing at her work, and she got theses cookies that one of her co-workers made for her. They are cookies, nothing special but her co-worker put time into making them **FOR HER.** She probably did them for everyone, but it doesn't matter, it even had my mom's name on it. If there were cookies laying around, I would be the first one to get into them. However, I know that they weren't for me and my mom never gave me permission to eat them (she probably would have though if I asked). What does my brother do? Takes them in his room and eats them. Then when confronted, he said that he didn't know they were for her and that I ate most of them. Lmao.

Another scenerio. For christmas I gotta switch, which I am in love with btw. My parents spent a good amount of money for it. I have to pay for everything else (online, games, etc.) However, the first few hours of having it (I was waiting for the tablet to charge and figure it out how to use it). My brother creates an account, and download Fortnite on the switch and a few other free games (and my switch can't hold much more). Like what? He immediately had to play fortnite (a game I don't really care for) on my new switch that I never even had the moment to play. 

There are ton's of more stories, but this is long enough. What do I do? I do care about him, but he is very disrespectful and just a rude individual to everyone in his life. My parents even tell me I was never this bad (especially at 18). What should happen here? Is it my parents fault or just his?

Btw, no I am not gonna move out or anything. This is a dysfunctional situation or anything that I need to seperate myself from. I am fine at home. Also, my brother just turned 18 so it's not like ""he is too old to be parented,"" ffs I am still parented lmao. ",27Dec2018,1

529,"So, last night my friend (L) had asked our ""friend group"" if they had wanted to hang out via a group chat we have. ""J"" had said that him and 2 other friends (D and C) in that same group were going hiking, and L said she'd love to go hiking, I said I'd like to go too. However, J and C did not say anything. So a few hours later I asked if this was still the plan, again no response. I knew something was off but I decided to not say anything.  


At the time D and I were talking and he had told me C and J were discussing if they wanted me to go. It had turned out J only wanted L to go and not me, and D and C were under the impression it was only going to be D,C and J going. J had also said that the only reason why he mentioned it in our group chat was because he thought I wasn't in that chat. After some discussion I guess they decided I could go (D thought it was everyone could go or no one, C was neutral and J didn't want me to go because he thinks I'm annoying and arrogant), but I had told D I was apprehensive about going if I wasn't actually welcomed to come, but he said come if I want to come so I agreed to it.  


This had occurred last night and the plan was to hike today. I had messaged D but the message did not go through (this usually means he is out somewhere), and I had the immediate feeling that they went without me, so I had messaged L, again no response. C and J have treated me this way before, especially J as he has said ""he doesn't like me"".  


If they had gone without me, should I cut ties with this group of friends, as well as D, or is this something I should let go (maybe I'm being over dramatic?), but what if they didn't go without me, I've been thinking about how my speculation/assumption is also a reflection of how I see them as people. I'm really upset about it especially since this isn't the first time. Sometimes, I feel like they think I'm annoying and so my feelings aren't really valid to them. I'm also a pretty overly-sensitive person lately as I have had rough past couple of months (school, family in the hospital, losing a job, etc.) but I had shared this stuff with D and L.  


I'm not sure if this is relevant information but D and I also have just come out of a 3 year relationship a couple months ago, but we still hang out 1-2 times a week, so we're still friends.

I'm a quiet, reserved college student who only started drinking coffee over the summer. I loved it because I was more social and talkative and got a great mood boost from it.

It doesn't help that my sister is completely uncooperative most of the time and hasn't completed some of the testing requested by the doctors.  The only thing that has seemed to help her is taking her to expensive massage appointment multiple times per week. They started off around 45 minutes in length over a year ago and are now up to 2 hours in length. If they are not this long she claims they ""don't work"" and throws and absolute fit. She has gotten violent and at times almost hurt my mother and has damaged some of our property. This has lead to financial strain. She will have screaming/crying fits when she is at her worst and is loud enough that we have had neighbors come over and ask us what was going on. We don't have a clue on how to move forward on this. I see the relationship between my mom and dad deteriorating and that really upsets me because of how happy they were before this started. It has made the home a miserable living environment. How do we move forward?",27Dec2018,1
537,"I'm a first year student in mass comm and I'm very happy with it.  I didn't know what i wanted to do for a very long time but as I'm doing this I found though it may have helped me to communicate better, this is something I dont have a demeanour for. So i was thinking if i could maybe try to get my masters in psycology, if it at all possible. 
About me- I'm a student fron india. I'm a introvert  and a good listener. I took pcb(physics, chemistry and biology)  in 11/12th. I took a year drop last year to think about my future.

539,"TDLR; Got a money pak reloadable debit card for Xmas. Went to activate, they want my SSN &amp; DOB. Privacy notice says they’ll use it to get more info &amp; share all info with pretty much whomever, to my understanding. I’m scared they will access my fairly bad credit score and share it with potential employers, as I’m out of work &amp; looking. Would usually just trash it &amp; not bother, but being out of work, I might end up really needing $30. All of their phone numbers to talk to rep are down. Probably fine? Or not worth the risk?


So, got a money pac reloadable debit card by Green Dot Bank for Xmas for $30. 

Go to activate it online. Normal at first, name, address, phone, email. 

But then they want my social security number and date of birth? To activate what’s basically a gift card? Ummm, I’m not sure about that...

Look at the paper inserts that came with card. One is handily titled “WHAT DOES GREEN DOT BANK DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?” Same info is also on their site [here.](https://m2.greendot.com/legal/privacy)

Idgaf really about email &amp; phone number getting out. I’m in the age group that has never known a world where it was usually safe to answer an unknown number, so whatever. I’m not at risk to fall for any email or phone scams. 

However, extremely iffy about the SSN &amp; DOB; coupled with statement they use my info to gather more info from “credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies.” 

Basically afraid that they could use it to access my credit score, then share it with whomever. 

I also don’t really like how they say they’ll share what you buy, but that’s more creepy than damaging, I think.

Anyway, so, my credit score is fairly bad. Was worse, improving, but not something I want floating around the Internet. Especially since I lost my job last week &amp; am now looking. 

The jobs I’m applying for shouldn’t matter if I have bad credit score, but I don’t know if employer would check anyway. I was a middle manager &amp; trying for same level or higher, so maybe they would. But position doesn’t have any financial-management aspects, so don’t see why it would matter. I really don’t know though.

So, should I risk it? I need a job yesterday, so that’s what I’m iffy on. My gut feeling is trash the card and walk away.

Conversely, I’m unemployed now so even just $30 may be the difference between eating for a couple days or having enough gas to get to interview, depending how long I’m gonna be out of work...

So, should I use it or not? Do you think it’s *probably* fine? 

Or not worth the risk?

P.S. I already tried to call Green Dot to speak with rep &amp; either try to activate card without information, or cancel &amp; refund the card. 

Every phone number I can find: “we’re sorry, this number is unavailable right now...” 

Which heightens my suspicion of the company.

They have an A from BBB; but 1/5 stars from consumers and like 685 complaints in the past 12 months. 

I don’t think they’re a scam, but I kinda think they’re maybe a shitty company &amp; don’t know what they’ll do with my information... 

Thanks for any advice. 🤙

His (2nd) marriage is in shambles and he is unemployed, with no money saved or prospects for the future. Lately he has said a few times that he is “not ready to check out,” and that he has thought about killing himself (hanging myself in the barn, blowing my brains out in the woods etc.) but he wouldn’t do that because he still thinks he can beat alcoholism. As far as I know no history of attempts. Just him thinking and verbalizing it makes me extremely scared tho, even if he is bringing it up in the context of saying he wouldn’t do it.

543,"So I have a ""friend"" whos son is in his mid 20s. When I first met the mom I helped fix her computer because she couldn't get it to work right (shes a disabled veteran). Turns out her son was talking and sending/asking for nudes of underage girls in chats. I told the mom about it but she ignored it. Well not long after he was arrested at a library (using wifi) asking a girl to meet him so they could have sex. The girl was 12. Turns out it was a sting operation and they had been tracking him for awhile because of his online activity. 

Well he went to prison for a year and was labeled a pedophile. As such hes also not allowed near places with kids such as schools. Now that he is out of prison what he does is go to a homeless shelter for a few hours then goes to his moms house (across from a school) and stays there. 

His mom is very much an enabler and makes excuses for him. She claims the prison sentence was wrong because he was being lied to and didn't know the girl was a undercover person (*duh thats the point). He also dated a 45 year old women and would have sex with her in front of the womans 8 year old child. Creepy beyond belief. He also claims to be a marine because he signed up for the army, and then was denied because he said they referred to him as ""out of shape"". But he still calls himself a marine. Irritating to all my marine friends. 

So my question is who do I contact to turn him in for breaking the rules he has? Not sure if he has a parole officer or not. Though I think he does since he has to report to the officer every so often. ",27Dec2018,1
544,"So. To set the scene. I got out of a relationship about a year ago, however I was led on into believing that we’d get back together for a long time after that. I’ve really only been out of a relationship for about 4 months. 

This last relationship was very hard on me. It made me question what I want in a girl/wife (eventually) and what a healthy relationship looks like. It damaged me a lot psychologically and emotionally, however, I feel like I’m finally at a pretty fully healed place

I’m trying to learn to just be okay by myself. Doing things by myself, emotionally supporting myself and not relying on other people for validation. I realize that most everyone needs a couple people in their life to keep them grounded and I’ve recognized those people and plan to put more importance on them, as well as a healthy amount of self care. I think I’m doing a good job so far, but don’t feel like I’m 100% there

Then there’s this girl. I barely know this girl. We’ve talked a few times back in high school, but not a lot. She has a certain flare to her that I really like. You know when a person just gives off a vibe? Yeah, she does that for me. From our conversations, I can tell she’s really down to earth, go with the flow, just the right amount of goofy and intelligent for me. Not to mention very gorgeous. She seems like she would be a good match. But I’m not 100% sure

We met again at a party a couple days ago. I realized as soon as I walked in the door, we made eye contact and she waved at me. I figured she could be waving at either of the 2 dudes I walked in with, or just us as a group to be honest, so I didn’t think much of it. Then as the night went on, my two friends and I went over to a gazebo, in the backyard. It was a little ways away from the bonfire, where most of the people, and she, were mingling. As we were talking, I casually looked up over at the bonfire and made eye contact with her again. Almost instantly, which kind of implied (to me, at least) that she was already looking over here or repeatedly looking, and she smiled and waved. This time, I pointed at my friends to clarify who she was waving to and she gestured that she was waving to me. Feeling a little validated, I enjoyed it, and decided to ask my 2 friends if we wanted to go talk with her and her friend. So we did. The five of us by the fire, talking and catching up. As we were talking though, I would notice that sometimes, as  someone would start talking, and we would shift eye focus to them, we would lock eyes, me and this girl. But it wouldn’t be for like a split second, on the way to whoever was talking. We would just look in each other’s eyes for what seemed like an eternity. It was probably like a solid 3-5 seconds each time. This happened a few times. We only had a little of “alone time” which was really just us on the outskirts of the group, talking small talk. But she just has this flare to her that I dig. 

She too just got out of a relationship about 4 or 5 months ago as well. And it was pretty serious, just like mine. There’s not a lot of information on how bad of a breakup it was and I don’t know anyone close enough to them to know what happened

I realize that I’m easily attracted to people who validate me, so I don’t want to overthink this. But I do genuinely think she might be a good match, and I’ve asked my friends and they think so too. I’d like to test the waters. Maybe get her number, or go to coffee. Just to inspect more. But I don’t want to rush anything.

I think I’m all healed but I’m not sure if I’m ready for a serious relationship yet. And I have no idea where she’s at with her healing process. That being said, i don’t want to let her slip through my fingers. I’m not sure what the appropriate action is and when to act it out. I’d like to set a basis for relationship without rushing into it and risking a good relationship, if she’s even interested at all.

So what do you think I should do?

TL;DR
This girl I barely know, but I’m crushing on and I both recently got out of serious relationships but I’d like to pursue her without rushing things.

545,"So I live in an apartment with 3 other roommates. 1 roommate I’ve lived with for 2 years now so I know he is trustworthy and wouldn’t do it, I’ll call him Jack. The other 2 roommates were random. One of the random roommates is a social drug dealer and always has people over constantly as a result, I’ll call him Bill. I came back one day to find many things some
for example being my wallet, MacBook charger and AirPods have been stolen. When asking my roommates about if they know anything, Bill answers really suspiciously and claims he also had stuff stolen. When asked about what got stolen he told me complete different things compared to when he told Jack. Checking security footage at my leasing office, I saw that Bill had a friend over the same night things went missing. My apartment door could have been left open so maybe somebody walked in but I truly believe that it was either Bill or his friend. My leasing office told me they can’t help unless I file a police report. I’m hesitant to do that because my roommate is a drug dealer and I’m not 100% certain it is him so I don’t want to be wrong and make matters worse however I can’t afford to get replacements for what got stolen and I feel very paranoid living at my apartment now.  I’m not even sure if the police will be able to even help me out. What should I do? 

TL;DR: I believe my roommate or his friend stole my stuff and only possible way to get my stuff back is to file a police report but he is a drug dealer and I’m not 100% sure if it was him. Lost on what to do. ",27Dec2018,1

547,"My friend ""L"" had invited a group of friends including me, to hang out today. ""J"" had said that him, ""C"" and ""D"", were already planning to go hiking, so L said she'd like to go and I said I would too. J and C did not respond to that, so after a couple hours I asked if all of hiking was happening tomorrow (today). Again there was no response, so I just left it alone.  


I was talking to D at the time and he said J and C were talking about whether or not I could come. I was pretty hurt by this but I wasn't surprised either, as J and C have done stuff like this before. D and C had been under the impression it was only the three of them hiking, but J had wanted L to go and he had only said it in a group chat that has all of us in it because J thought I wasn't in the chat. Eventually they decided I could go (D said all or none could go, C was neutral and J still didn't want me to go because I was annoying and arrogant). I had told D I didn't know if I was comfortable with going since I didn't feel welcomed and didn't want to intrude, but he said come if I want to come so I finally agreed.  


Today, I had messaged D this morning but the message did not go through (this usually means he is out), so I began to think they went without me, so I messaged L, but again no response. Eventually D had messaged me and said ""sorry my wifi wasn't working at home"" so I asked if they went hiking already and he said they already went all I replied with was ""I see"", which was a dumb reply, but I was so shocked I didn't know what to say, D had read the message but didn't respond, so I messaged again and asked ""why would you invite me then go without me?"" D replied ""I couldn't message you even if I wanted to I had no wifi"". I don't know if this is a fair excuse, because he could have asked someone else to message me, or maybe I'm being fair. I'm so upset that they would do that and that he'd invite me and say ""see you tomorrow"" then go without me.   


I don't know what I really expect from this post maybe advice or maybe reassurance that this isn't my fault? They have done similar stuff, and I'm beginning to think its my fault if this stuff keeps happening, maybe there is just something about me that makes them not want to include me.

549,"So, I’m thinking about quitting my job. I haven’t been happy here for a long time. It feels as though I’ve been making so many personal sacrifices that are not appreciated or even acknowledged. I’ve clocked ~41.85 hours of work per week this year in addition to taking on the course load of a full-time student. I thought I could handle the heft of work and school, but I was wrong. 

I went from a 3.7 almost 3.8 GPA to a 3.458 GPA and I’ll only be able to pick it up to slightly more than a 3.5 when I earn my AA this spring. I’ve been horribly depressed about it which has manifested in crying fits, suicidal ideation, and the thought of resuming methods of self-harm. My GPA will barely qualify me for an transfer scholarship I’d absolutely need to get complete my undergrad. Bc the scholarship is so competitive I feel the need to get some of my writing published and participate in research in the coming year, along with taking transferable science and math courses but I don’t know how to pick myself back up. I’m almost certain that it would be best not to stray from the academic path I’ve chosen, but who knows? Maybe I’m overlooking the potential value of switching programs or even stopping with my associate’s. 

Going back to my job, when I felt myself slipping under, I requested time off, but there was no follow up from me nor my manager who happens to be my uncle. He has an often volatile temperament where even the littlest thing (such as sidelong glance from me will set him off). I asked for time off once more a week ago, hoping I’d get this week off, but with the impending holiday, I’m understanding if not resentful of that decision. My manager also happens to be hypocritical, a workaholic (works literally every day unless sick, took a 2 or 3 day vacation in the past year) and can be very manipulative. I have had three of my closest coworkers come to me on separate occasions to express concern that I am being emotionally, mentally and verbally abused and have had yet another coworker tell me that I need to plan my “escape route” so to speak because this job sucks you in and devours you. 

I feel extremely embarrassed by my current situation. It shouldn’t be so hard for me to decide to quit a job like this (food service), but my manager/uncle makes it seem as though there’s nothing better, that I’ll find out that things are the same elsewhere and I’ll come crawling back bc this place is so accommodating as far as “flexibility” with school and transportation (he drives me, I won’t be able to afford a car before I get my tax returns). And if I should leave and things do fall through, he makes it seem as though he won’t be welcoming. FOMO, and possible disparaging comments along with falling into the same trap are my greatest fears, but I’m afraid of what will happen to me mentally if I stay.

But put me in a situation where it’ll be and 10-15 people where I’ll only know one of those people? I cannot do. I can, but I feel so awkward.

And that he's tried to commit suicide because he feels he has no one and im the only good thing in his life. I'm looking for advice on how to make it clear to this guy I don't want to date him but whenever I've tried he threatens that he'll hurt himself or take an overdose because he has no one else. It's just constant comments that he knows we'll end up together and that he'll never leave me again.,27Dec2018,1
565," I can’t bring myself to respect him. He used to beat my mom and my grandmother all the time. He’s cut open my mom’s hand with a knife, busted my grandmother’s eardrum, and he once dragged my grandmother around by her hair in front of me. He used to be a very shitty, abusive person when he lived in India as well. He was rich so he’d beat and abuse the servants who lived there. Half of his grandkids have light skin and half of them have darker skin. He tells me the light skinned children are attractive and the dark skinned aren’t. 

Now he’s around 70 (can’t remember his age), and he lives in my mom’s house. He refuses to leave her any inheritance because she’s a woman, and instead is leaving it to his only son who kicked him out of the house. He said the wealth of the family is supposed to go to the men only. My mom works full-time, and yet takes care of this guy when she can. I truly cannot stand him, but I take care of him because I feel sorry for her and my dad. Did I mention he owes my dad $70,000 but my parents refuse to say or do anything? It’s this blind elderly obedience rooted in our Indian culture. 

Nobody cares that this man was a horrible person, because he’s weak and elderly now so his past sins are non-existent. It kills me, because my parents are upset when we snap at him or voice our annoyance with him. I caught him stealing cash from my parents’ bedroom three times. My parents barely get by and he steals from them. He’s an evil excuse of a human being. ",27Dec2018,1

What can I do?
Are there any other solutions besides phonetically isolating my apartment or using earplugs?

570,"I am 27, my boyfriend is 34. We have a semi-LDR. My boyfriend,  let's call him Lex, was married when we met 8 years ago. We soon became friends and after some years we fell in love. For me, that was the very first time I fell in love. Things naturally progressed towards a secret affair. We would have sneaky dates where we could talk and cuddle and kiss. It was certainly not based on lust. We were hungry for a deep connection like this. 

After a long period of doubt and feelings that ""this is unethical and wrong"", we decided to call it quits in January 2018. We agreed on not talking for a while. He tried to send subtle messages, but I ignored him completely. I was heartbroken and was convinced i needed to protect myself from getting hurt again. 

In late February after weeks of no contact whatsoever, he found out I was staying in an hotel for work. That morning, he declared his love for me and told me he left his wife for me. He wanted to share his life with me. I was cold and distant towards him, he spoke from the heart. I had to think about this and asked for some time, which he gave me. Eventually I told him I wanted to try a real relationship with him.

The first months were great. Lots of cuddling, sweet messages, kissing, sex, deep conversation and that feeling of being connected. We met friends, family, coworkers... Then everything changed. No more ""I love you"", no more city trips, he didn't want any pictures taken of us two, no more holding hands.

For the last couple of weeks I have tried to talk to him about what was going on, but he shut me out. Then tonight, he asked if we were going in the right direction, relationshipwise. We had a very emotional hourlong  talk.  Long story short: every new memory created with me is overshadowed by a memory with his ex-wife. He feels he is not 100% invested in us because their divorce is hard to overcome. 

Instead of seeking professional help to process this, he rather tries to find it out on his own and he needed time for that. And space. He doesn't even know if he wants help. In my opinion, he got depressed after the divorce.

I was the mistress waiting for his love for years when we had an affair. We broke up. Then months later he chose me and now wants to let me go again. I am not waiting for his love again. I am not here waiting for the moment romance suits him better. So I made that clear and packed my things and left. I cried. He was clearly uncomfortable, but no tears. 

I drove home, crying, speeding, not caring about traffic lights or speed limits, which is nothing like me. Now I am in bed, overthinking. In need of some perspective.

What do I do now? I only had him, I don't have any friends of my own. I feel lost and alone and unable to see this should not be the end of my life. We were sort of trying for a baby, so I'll have to wait 2 weeks to see what's happening in that department.He 

I turned off my phone and took a sleeping pill to numb the pain and to space out. I am bad at handling emotions.

How do I recover from my first love turning me down without really even trying, convincing myself I never want the cause of all this pain back in my life. Do I still want a life at all?",27Dec2018,1
572,"Hey r/advice, this thread will deal with how I should approach my father. I have never talked about this stuff before to other people bc I never really felt ready opening up but I feel like now that I'm 18 and somewhat more mature I can come forward. I appreciate any thoughts and advice given and the amount of time taken to read this. (I'm usually a lurker and don't post, if I did/said something wrong please tell me, not doing it on purpose,) 

My father and mother divorced when I was at a very young age. My family and I are immigrants, this will be a big role later on. I moved around here when I was around 2ish I think. Even though I was not born in America I did grow up here. Since that age, I would grow up going from my dads to my moms to my dads and so on. Both of them would ask me what the other parent was up to all the time.  My Dad was much more direct while my mother was more discreet but I caught on quick. I really hated this whole split thing because I would constantly see my elementary friend's parents together and it made me really sad. I lived like this, back and forth, until the custody battle which ill talk about later.        
 So background on my father.

My father grew up in the USSR and he would push ""manly"" things on me like how he grew up ex; Cars, Sports, Working out, not crying or showing emotion, nothing girly. When I was in elementary school I was a bit more effeminate, didn't like roughhousing, I would cry a lot if I got hurt, wasn't into boyish stuff. This would result in him me calling me a girl, by calling I mean yelling at me most of the time. I wasn't into cars, ""girl"", I cried, ""girl"" and so on. It really messed me up because all I ever wanted was to live up to him and feel accepted. I wanted him to be proud of me, I tried faking somethings and he was happy but I didn't feel it bc I never liked it. I really enjoyed music and decided to try playing the saxophone. I fell in love with music and playing it, I became really good at it. My father heavily disapproved of this and called me gay and girly bc of it. He did not like the fact I put so much time into that and not what he wanted. He also pushed a lot of sports on me too. I played soccer, baseball, karate, but never really enjoyed any of those. Around 6th grade, I decided to go try some Ballroom Dancing, like music this was a perfect fit. I fell in love with dance and was a natural at it. Like I was super good at it coming from no experience. When I joined the studio and he found out this just led to more insults from him calling me gay and girly. He even went as far to insult my instructor too. Eventually, this made me leave after a year. Not to flex but during that year of dancing, I was beating kids who have danced for years and I can bet if I stayed I would probably be a pro by now which made it even harder for me to leave. I finally found something I loved and was good at but I left bc of my father. He then tried to make me work out, I don't mind working out now that I'm older, but as a younger kid it didn't really work for me. He would then make fun of how I would look and say that girls would never like me bc of how skinny I am. I'm more of a skinny dude and bc of his comments it made me very self-conscious of how I look. Even today when people joke about that I'm skinnier I laugh but it hurts. Even though I've had a fair share of girls like me, I always hear his voice calling me skinny and no girl would ever like you bc of it. 

He would also constantly ""test"" me to choose between him and my mom when I was younger like elementary school. I said that I love both and he would berate me with insults on how I could betray him and the family. (He also pushed on me a lot of family values which I don't mind and think its good but he would take advantage of that aspect). I would cry and cry and he would keep on yelling at me. I remember vividly once where I thought I would never see him again and he would leave, I had this awful feeling of despair and pain. I cried so much it messed with my breathing where I couldn't catch a breath, it was horrible. He once kicked me out of his apartment when I was in 3rd grade, I was legitimately preparing to walk to my moms but he told me to come back inside. Once I didn't get a blanket to sleep when I didn't want to choose. He would also hit me sometimes and to this day I still flinch whenever I see a hand motion similar to that. One of my friends would playful punch me and I always would flinch really badly, I think he noticed bc he hasn't done that in a looong time. Like I never really told my friends this because I don't want them to see that I'm actually super messed up. I will eventually but baby steps. 

Even though he would do this type of stuff I did also have a lot of good memories with him too. I loved fishing and we would go out and do that which was awesome. I drove my first car, which was reckless on his part now that I'm looking back lol. I met his friends which were awesome people that I definitely loved. He would take me everywhere, when I went back to vacation to where I was born I had a blast. So even though he did a lot of crap, he still pushed the aspect that he loves me. I feel that he does but just really messed up on how to do a lot of things correctly and was pushing for me to become better than him. 

This would keep going until the custody battle when I was in 8th grade. Atm, I do not remember who initiated it but it was really messy. Both of them were telling me this was for the better and we are doing it for you. It honestly felt like they were fighting against each other and using me. I HATED this. I did not want this. I played for both sides which was horrible because I still loved my father and my mother. I did a lot of things which I am not proud of. But I had to make a choice between my mom and my dad. I chose my Dad, now I know this sounds crazy but for me, at that time I felt it was best to be with him instead. I had to go to a judge and tell him that I wanted to be with my dad, but my dad convinced me to also say that she was beating me. ( I know this is horrible but I was under a lot of duress not only from this but also school and crap). I do love my mom but she isn't an angel either but this isn't about her. So the judge believed me and put me with my father until another court case would settle it(I would live w/ only my dad for a time and if it turned out ok then I would stay with him). My father was overjoyed and it made me really happy for once that he really loved me. Bc the court case wasn't settled I still felt horrible about what I did and I started to kinda shut down. I mean I still put on a smile on my face and went to school but my grades started dropping. When my dad found out he flipped out. It would result in me going back to my mom's bc I wasn't provided for bc my grades were bad. This is when the physical abuse got really bad, one time I was on the floor and he would kick me in the ribs while screaming at me. It was so bad that he made me hide under the bed when neighbors got suspicious (we were in an apartment). That month I hid in my closet and lock myself in there and cry for hours. I actually tried to commit suicide by hanging myself in there but could never go through with it because I was too weak-willed. That was a very dark time of my life. I was only 13 or 14 at that time when I tried to.  Ultimately it ended up with my mom gaining custody bc of my grades and other things. (don't wanna go to specifics). Since my mom got custody I was not allowed to see my dad at all unless he goes through anger management and sets up visitations to see me. He never did. This whole custody would be lifted once I turn 18 then bc im am ""adult"" he can talk to me and I can talk to him freely. I moved onto high school where he would catch me off guard and approach me. Freshman year I was in P.E running laps where he approached me for the first time since the custody battle, he told me to call him and talk to him. This really messed me up for the day where I went home. He did this about 3-4 times a year until like the junior year the school finally threatened him they will call the police if they see him again. also every encounter I would tell my mom 

Now to what's at hand, all that before is to give a picture of what has happened in my life. Since I am now 18 he approached me again a couple days after my B-Day and told me now that I'm old enough he can explain everything. I didn't say a word to anyone and have kept it to myself. I also didn't mention but my father remarried and then had a kid around the same time when I was living only with him. That kid really helped me get through that time even though she was an infant. I really do love her as my sister even though she's my ""half-sister"" Her B-day is coming up and I earlier got a message from my dad saying I should come down and visit him. I feel really bad for my sis bc she has to grow up with him but after I did some stalking online I found my dad's profile page. Photos of him his wife and kid all around and look genuinely happy. I was very taken back but I don't know anymore. 

I want to go and meet my sister after all these years but idk about my dad. I believe in 2nd chances but not 3rd. I feel like if I go back and talk to him he will start pulling the same crap on me and then when I tell him about what has happened the past couple years he'll be disappointed and I'm gonna be back at square one.

Should I reach out to him after these years or should I leave all this in the past and move on from him?  

Honestly, Thank you if you read through all this it really means a lot for me to finally be able to talk about it. ",27Dec2018,1

575,"Hello,

My three friends 21(f), 21(m), and 23(f) have been renting a house together for four months and our lease ends at the end of April. My one friend 21(f), we’ll just call her Cindy has been applying her own form of cost saving to the entire house via the thermostat. We live in Canada so when it gets cold the thermostat should be at at least 20, she has it set to 18 most of the time.

Because of animals in the house and my guitars which shouldn’t be kept in the cold for too long this has become an issue. Also my other friend 23(f), we’ll just call her Steph, has expressed her discomfort to the cold and often complains that she has trouble waking up in the morning because it’s too cold. She also has depression which doesn’t help her get out of bed and anxiety which doesn’t help her talk about issues.

Steph has repeatedly tried to initiate a conversation with Cindy about the temperature but it has gotten them nowhere. 
We have a pretty sophisticated thermostat that allows you to make a “schedule” depending on the time of day, so Steph has suggested to set it so that the heat is up when we are home and down when we are asleep/away. They’ve tried to talk about it, and both of them have expressed their side to me. Steph has said that she doesn’t mind paying extra on the utilities so that Cindy pays less.

We found out that this holiday when Cindy went back home, she turned up the temp on the fridge so that some of the stuff melted, nothing went bad but it could have. Cindy is away for 2 weeks while Steph was only away for four days before she noticed the fridges temp. Steph still had food in their and was obviously pretty mad because she had to clean up the fridge. 

I guess my question is: after four months of living together how do we (Steph, myself, and other roommate 21(m)) offer to pay more for utilities without offending Cindy? And how do I tell Cindy not to turn up the temp on the fridge so out food doesn’t go bad? 

Also sorry for the format I’m on mobile. Thank you",27Dec2018,1

My roommate and I lived very well together but lately there has been some distance between us because my ex-boyfriend treats me like shit and I call him out on it or complain and she defends him (since no one in our friend group likes him because of how horrible he is to me and to everyone in general- but she thinks we're ganging up on him). Well I had to leave but I thought we left on good terms. I had to leave some of my stuff there but my best friend was going to ship it to me where ever I ended up living. Anyways I asked her if she could talk to some potential subleases and SHE'S NOT TALKING TO THEM. Every day I text her asking her to arrange a time for them to see the apartment and like two weeks later she finally does it. I asked if the apartment was clean and she says she can tidy up. Fast forward to today and my father (who's name is on the lease) get a text from her dad saying I left the place a mess. First of all, I cleaned it all so I could take pictures of the apartment so I know this is not true. Second of all, she's a messy person so I know of a fact that shit is hers. Third of all, he claims I left my stuff everywhere. I left my stuff compiled on the bookcase and in three boxes in my personal closet. Everything else there I told her she can keep or throw out. We had talked about this and both agreed it was fine since I had to move out in like three days. And lastly, if you're overwhelmed by something or have questions why would she not text me?

So, for the past 4-5~ months, my father has been very secretive and agitated towards the rest of the family.


I’ve been doing some investigating for around three weeks and through my investigation I have learned a name of what is presumably a female (let’s call her Kate).


I know very little about this Kate other than her name. But, what really is confusing to me, is that my father has been shying away from me or my mother whenever he’s texting. I got a peek at his screen and sure enough it was Kate at the top. He shut the phone off as soon as possible. He also tends to be very distracted while texting, this behavior has only been with this Kate because that’s the way he was acting when I saw her name on his screen.


Another way I know he’s been texting this Kate is whenever I checked his computer. It’s password locked (which he doesn’t disclose to any of us), but I saw an SMS notification. The notification was from Kate.


I have also seen a picture of a woman’s upper body sent from when I first started getting suspicious. I am unsure if that picture was from Kate or somebody else or if I’m reading too far into this.


Finally, last month, my father turned off his location services so my mother can no longer see where he’s at. He says that it’s messed up but I know for a fact it’s not, it’s just a simple button press and the services are back on.


All in all, I don’t know whether to say something to my father, my mother, or to not say anything at all and get more proof. Any advice is heavily appreciated.


Thank you.


TL;DR: I have reason to believe my father is cheating on my mother. He has been secretive and aggressive towards us, he turned his location services off, and always gets heavily distracted due to the person he’s texting. What should I do?",27Dec2018,1
586,"Hi reddit,

I live with my fiance in an apartment we've been renting for 5 years. Every year the rent goes up without fail, but it was usually $20 or $30. When we started seriously looking for a house to own, the next renewal we did was a 6 month instead of a 1-year lease because we were hoping to be out sooner rather than later, which was a $50 increase per month. It has now been over a year (We started looking in July of 2017 and our rent renews in March with the lease signed by end of January) and we have not purchased a house yet. The market has been crazy with homes going much higher than actual value and we are only looking in select neighborhoods and of course we do have a budget which is around 200k which is respectable in the area we are looking at.  


ANYWAYS. So, we get our renewal notice, and they are asking for $100 per month over last years rent for the 6 month lease, or the option to do $50 over last years 6 month lease for a 12 month lease. We don't want to move (to be fair this apartment was really quite cheap in this area) but it just seems so dumb to pay so much more over the current rent payment for no additional service. (I should mention that we are like perfect tenants, never had any issues, never paid rent late, etc.) The only thing they spent money on for us was our Air Conditioner which died through no fault of ours.

&amp;#x200B;

So our options are to pay the $100 over per month for the 6-month lease and suck it up, or sign the 12-month lease at the more reasonable rate of $50 over per month but then if we find a house, have to find out how or if we can even break the lease, or just pay both rent and the mortgage til its done. Both options sound terrible to me so I wanted to see what other people think of the situation. Thoughts? Opinions? We live in Michigan.",27Dec2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the options I've come up with so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Option A:  My dad says I should advantage of the end of the year incentives and possibly used some extra funds to get a new car, and look for rebates to eat up my negative equity

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Option B: Just sell the car is to a company, no trade-in Wait for my school refund to come in and then use the $3000ish dollars to look for a new car with rebates - the only problem I see with this option and it's gonna take a lot of convincing to get my mom on board on this -  this'll leave me making payments on a car isn't even available, she doesn't want to make payments for no reason

&amp;#x200B;

Option C: Somehow convince my parents to let me keep the broken car in their driveway , save my refund from next semester, save next refund from fall semester, wait until next year's end of the year incentives, maybe rebates or check my other options - this would also require me to take care of my dad's old car - which is also falling apart.",27Dec2018,1

I've had to repeatedly complain about it to him and my parents but my parents don't want to deal with his bullshit and tread eggshells around him to stop him from throwing fits and as they don't use that bathroom they don't have to deal with it. He just doesn't seem to understand that its not acceptable.

Hes started doing this 'system' where he puts a toilet roll on top of the toilet seat if hes blocked it and seems to believe that makes it ok to leave it. Half of the toilet paper there doesn't even looked used. 

How can I make him understand its not ok to keep doing this when he doesn't listen to anything I say and brushes off any time my parents make a half assed attempted to confront him? Aspergers or not hes 22 Years old he should be able to handle this at his age. ",27Dec2018,1

He now JULs regularly and my sister smokes from his JUL when they hang out.

She denied becoming addicted to nicotine and said I’m blowing things out of proportion, she even said “I don’t even have a JUL yet”... YET??

But where I work my boss has team leaders that are power hungry and just want an excuse to shame you. 

I do so much right and never get any praise, but nearly all other employees do get praise, constantly, and usually it’s on our group work page where I can see it and dwell on it.

But as soon as I make any mistake big or small, it’s picked up and shoved in my face for weeks by the management.

I never show up late or call in sick, I’ve asked for more hours to cover my rent but they says there isn’t any but then gives other nearly double my hours.

It’s effecting my health and I’m constantly stressed out at home, I used to work other jobs as a waitor before I lived here and I was a team leader before, I had so much confidence in my abilities before and now I have none.

599,"Sorry, this is going to be a really long post but I will try to be more concise. If not, you can scroll down for the TL;DR. 

&amp;#x200B;

2018 has been a real shit show for me and I have been trying to be really calm about it all despite my current circumstances, which I will get into. 

For background info, I'm go to a university in the U.S.

Last year in the spring I withdrew in the middle of the semester because of being overwhelmed with all the extra shit I was doing (two research projects, president for a volunteer organization, secretary for a cultural organization, putting together a donation drive for a Puerto Rican classroom that my organization was sponsoring, working part-time as a tutor). It was seriously eating up my time and I was getting really behind on my coursework. I decided to take a W (withdraw) for the semester so that it doesn't affect my GPA and I can start fresh in the summer. Seems like a solid plan right? 

Well not exactly...

Mid-May, I applied to be a personal assistant through my university's job portal but the job turned out to be a scam. He essentially sent me a fake check, that was supposed to be funds to spend on whatever he needs me to get while he was at another location. It was a large check and he pretty much asked me to spend the entire amount on gift cards. At first, I didn't question it because it started out in small amounts like ""three $10 iTunes Gift Cards"" and I thought that it might be for gift purposes or something. But then he started to ask for larger amounts of them and he was being very pushy and emphasizing that he needed it NOW and that I immediately go and buy them. I should have stopped and thought about how this is a scam but I was just so caught up in the idea that ""Omg, if I don't do this, I'm going to lose my job"" and so I was being dumb and spent almost $3,000 on gift cards for this guy. I felt so stupid, especially when I got the notice that my balance was in the negatives because the check was returned and all the transactions I made went against my account. Fortunately, I had already paid for my summer classes and the rent for that month ahead of time, however, I wasn't sure how I was going to cover for the next month's. 

I didn't tell my family because they're already in so much debt and worry about money constantly since we're very low income. My mom is the only one who works and she's a custodian for a research facility. 

So while I was taking two 4-credit hours classes (Calculus II and C++) for 10 weeks over the summer, I was job hunting and literally applying everywhere. I began working two part-time jobs and it was just really stressful and I ended up failing both classes from the lack of time to really dedicate to both of them. Fortunately, I got a ""No Grade"" due to my circumstances.

As for the Fall, I had to deal with the outcome of being below the credit hour completion rate threshold for financial aid. Since my hours attempted vs hours passed were completely off, I was on financial aid probation and had to submit an appeal for it and had to wait until late September because that was the earliest available appointment. (Keep in mind that the semester starts in late August for my school) So I had to be on a payment plan for my tuition for a while until I got approved in late September and finally got the rest of my tuition that semester paid for. However, I still had to worry about general expenses like rent, bills, etc. I also had already made a commitment to both my jobs especially since they're understaffed and so I still worked both while taking classes while also serving as president for the volunteer organization because I was the last remaining officer for the board and I didn't want to leave it hanging to an inexperienced board. Regardless, fall semester I ended up a very low GPA due to again, such a small amount of time to really focus on my studies. I even showed my usual week with classes and work blocked off to my academic advisor and she agreed that it's impossible for me to do all of this and do well in my classes.

So now, I am denied financial aid for this semester because of my low GPA and so I'm trying to figure out a way to get some loans to lessen the financial burden and not have to work like 30+ hours each week like I was last semester. I was thinking about applying for private student loans, but I'm not sure how likely I will even be approved for one if I have no credit history and I plan on doing this without a co-signer. 

I don't want to leave school because I really do value my education and before this year, I was doing very well in my classes but this past year was just completely rough and really affected my performance. 

I want to keep going though and not give up because I'm determined to get my degree but I'm scared about how I'm going to even pay for my classes this semester without working a shit ton of hours and being completely drained. Although if I have to, I will and I guess I just need to figure out the most optimal way to do so without fucking myself over again. 

But does anyone have any experiences with getting private student loans? If so, how should I go about this? Are there other options out there that could potentially help? Or am I just SOL? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking time to read all of this, I know its a lot but I'm just not sure what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Not getting any financial aid this semester and unsure how to go about paying for it. Thinking about private student loans that you can pay for after graduation but I'm not sure what my chances are for being accepted for the loan. Would appreciate any advice on this. ",27Dec2018,1
600,"So my whole family (in the US that is) all live in New Jersey. After I finish high school and started college, my parents packed up and moved to Georgia and honestly I'm happy for them. But I'm here visiting them for my winter break and they keep talking about things and making plans based on me moving in with them down here. I very much don't want to. I mean don't get me wrong, I love them and I'm happy they're happy here, but I have absolutely no desire to move. They've had me change my address to theirs for things like billing info for college, but now they've been wanting me to get a Georgia driver's license  and things like that. Should I just amuse them for now and just change my information back over to NJ when I finish school? Or should I not change anything?",27Dec2018,1
601,"Hey there, my partner and I have been looking for a flat for a bit and we viewed one today that was in an ideal location and it looked very nice and well kept. We absolutely loved this flat the only problem is we would not be renting through an estate agent but instead would be renting directly from the landlords.  They are a husband and wife, the husband is the one I had been emailing and he was very friendly and was generally very welcoming, however his wife gave off an unpleasant vibe.  We are both students and we understand that is not always ideal for landlords however through student loans and part time jobs we can pay our rent with no issues and we made that very clear, however it almost felt like the woman was interrogating us, she sort of scoffed when I told her I worked part time in a supermarket alongside university. The way she presented herself and the tone of her voice just made myself and my partner uncomfortable, we are worried she will be too interfering (they live locally) as we have only ever rented through estate agents before and do not really understand how independent landlording works.  

To sum it up, we found a flat we love but we’re not so sure about the landlord, just looking for some advice on whether we should take it or not. ",27Dec2018,1

603,"So basically this past semester I had a professor who was older and pretty weird about his grading policy. We had quizzes and a mid term which I know the grades for because we received them back, but I do not know the grades for my “portfolio” or final exam. He does not post any of these online. I got a B in the class, but like I said he hasn’t posted any grades online so I’m not sure why I got a B. I emailed him to ask about this but I haven’t gotten any response and it’s been a week. Also his whole “portfolio” grading process was really weird, he never gave us any sort of rubric for it and he was very vague about how he was grading it. For example we had to go to events and write about them, if you asked him how many we had to go to he would say “2 would be fine but more would be better!” And in regards to your grade on the portfolio “it depends”. 

Normally I wouldn’t care about a B but I did bad in another class this semester and I also believe I deserved an A in the class. I’m concerned because I can’t even see my grades and haven’t gotten any communication from my professor, both during and after the class ended. Even if it doesn’t get raised to an A, don’t I still deserve to see why I have a B? 

What departments or people should I be contacting about this situation? ",27Dec2018,1

606,"So, my boyfriend is 20 and I’m 25.   We’ve been together for 2 and a half months.  First and foremost I care about him very much.  He’s one of the sweetest guys I’ve ever met.  He’s extremely empathetic and giving in any way he can be.   But there’s also a lot of cons about him.  One thing about him is he’s incapable of doing certain things he should be able to at this point in life.   

He can’t cook, nor does he know how to.  He doesn’t know how to wash his own clothes.  He doesn’t even know how to put his own socks on, cut up his food into pieces, or how to fold clothes.  He’s afraid of using a knife.  He should’ve learned some of these things as a kid but he didn’t.  

It also bothers me how bad his anxiety is.  I know he can’t help it, but it’s frustrating.  His eye contact is poor.  He’s bad at paying for stuff at a cash register and will often ask me to do it.  Same applies for ordering food or sometimes going in a store.  He can’t drive as he gets panic attacks from it.   He worries about pretty much everything and even questions if I genuinely like him. 

He was beat all of his life and emotionally abused.  I don’t know what exactly happened to him but I know some stuff.   His mom was a druggie that abandoned him.  His dad and grandparents beat him etc etc.  I have no idea if this has any correlation to his other issues.  I do know he flinches if I make sudden movements.  He also tenses when we cuddle / hug.  We haven’t had sex yet either but to be fair it hasn’t been THAT long.  I’m just at a loss here.  

I REALLY like him, but I’m not sure what I can do for him.   I don’t want to make him feel inferior, and I don’t want to leave him.  At the same time these things aren’t my responsibility to teach him.  I’ve just...  never met anyone like this I guess.  And I can tell he’s getting more and more attached to me everyday.   I have no idea how he managed to date me in the first place...  but here we are.   What do I do?  I don’t want to be an ass.   I’m his first real relationship.  ",27Dec2018,1
607,"5 months ago I moved 2k miles away from my home town. I’m 20, I left behind all my really good friends,I left my decent car that I payed for myself, and my father and brother. I also left behind a $600 TV that I bought.I only moved because my POS step brother was stealing for me and I was being made the bad guy. So my mom(who I now live with) and our family out here talked me into selling my car. I was very hesitant because I loved that car and it was my first nice car. But I succumbed and sold it for $800. I put $2000 into that car so I lost $1200, but my mom insisted that I was going to be getting a better car so it wouldn’t matter.  Come to find out I can’t afford a car loan because the only jobs out here are minimum wage and my insurance would be $230. Maybe I’m being over dramatic, but I can’t do this anymore. Having a nice car made me feel really good and gave me confidence. So now I’m here in a town where all I have is family, I know no females, no friends. Nothing .",27Dec2018,1
608,"Hello, so basically I just wanted a bit of context as to what my situation is. I’m 15 year old guy and I’ve been living with my uncle for around 5 years now. My house currently consists of my sister, my mother, my aunt, my uncle, and my grandparents. My parents got divorced three years ago which was why I now live with my uncle. 

Now, I wouldn’t say he’s abusive, but I do think he’s a bit over the top. Since 7th grade or so I’ve been responsible for a lot of the chores regarding this house. It’s always me who has to clean, mow the lawn, shovel the driveway, sweep etc. Now this is the part I want to know, is he even allowed to hit me? If I were to miss my chores or do them poorly I’d be scolded or yelled at and then he’d give me a lecture and after like 3-4 mistakes I would just end up getting hit. A mistake in his eyes is classified as: doing a bad job in whatever chore, me not being able to do the chore because of extracurricular or homework (yes he has yelled at me because I was doing homework instead of chores) and other stuff. 

I haven’t been hit in around a year or so but I feel like he’s been getting pretty close to that boiling point. He just constantly feels the need to degrade me and call me stupid just because of some chores. I’ve talked about it with my dad before and he said he would help and try to get a new house but nothing really came out of that. I probably can’t even convince my mom either because she always comes home late from work and enjoys living here.

So I have a couple of questions

1.) What can he make me do?

2.) Am I the one who’s being unreasonable?

3.) How could I change this?

Thank you for reading.",27Dec2018,1
