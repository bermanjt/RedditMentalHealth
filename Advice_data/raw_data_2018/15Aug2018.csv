4,"Hi guys,
I got accepted to both Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and UC Davis for fall of 2018. I applied as a Business Administration - Finance major for Cal Poly and Managerial Economics (don’t know how I feel about that major) at Davis. I accepted both, but was initially leaning more towards Cal Poly; however, the fact that Davis’s rankings are much higher on many different platforms and articles are kind of making me think twice about my decision. I am aware that they are both great schools, but as a first generation college student , I would appreciate hearing a few opinions.

5,"My current job has gotten very toxic, with almost every single team member seeming to be trying to sabotage another so that they can move ahead in their own career. I've recently come under the heat of ""not completing standard work"" due to a coworker reporting me to my manager for making very small, non-frequent misses that other members of the team are also making (ex. attaching a file instead of hyperlinking it). It feels quite a bit like targeting and I'm not happy to go into my job anymore. 

I put in for a transfer to another building in the company and I got the position, however I'm wary about taking it for several reasons. 

The biggest being that it will tack 1.5hrs of commute onto my already 30min commute. Which means less sleep and spending more money.

The second being my roommate and I literally just yesterday put a hold on an apartment that's even further away than my current one that's 100% perfect for us. I fell in love with it as soon as we walked in, it has all the amenities I've wanted, fits perfectly in our budget and I'm allowed to have all of my pets. After months of searching.

And the third being that my shift wouldn't be changing. I'm currently on the most undesirable shift working weekend overnights and haven't been able to see friends much in over a year. 

I feel like the only perk to taking the position would be the security of knowing there aren't people out to get me fired or ruin my career. And admittedly, that would take a huge horrible burden off my shoulders. This situation has been giving me intense anxiety about going to work for months.

I'm extremely undecided. Does anyone have any advice?",15Aug2018,1

8,"This may sound dumb, but I need serious advice on how to live with myself.

I have found a partner that I can only describe as my soulmate. I did not even believe that was a thing until the moment I met her, and I have loved her deeply since that day. However, there has been one thing that has been hanging over my head since that moment, and I do not know what to do about it.  I have been in many serious relationships before, and had many ""casual encounters,"" and because of this I know a good thing when I see it. That is why I know that she is the one so strongly. The issue is, she's never been in a relationship with anyone else but me. As a result, she can't possibly know how much I love her because she has no sample size to compare it to. I've known for a while that the day would come when I have to let her go and just hope she comes back to me, but now that it is here I don't know how to deal with the pain. I dunno if anyone can give me advice on how to numb the pain, but I've tried drugs and they don't help. What else do you think I should do? Any advice on any of it would be welcome.",15Aug2018,2

10,"I’ve been in a relationship for a few months now. It’s been fantastic. We haven’t had any problems. Except maybe now. He’s big into WoW. It’s fine with me because it’s a hobby. Everyone should have hobbies. However, we haven’t had a conversation at all since the new expansion came out.  So I am getting a little anxious about the future of my relationship. He even told me that he’s going to be completely busy this week. We haven’t spent more than two days apart since we started dating. So I’m starting to feel threatened already. It did only come out yesterday so I’m hoping that it’s just because he’s enjoying the excitement of a new release and he’ll come back to me soon. 

He told me his raiding schedule, just two days a week. No big deal. I’m planning on just scheduling my social events, classes and extracurricular activities on those days so I have things to do. Im also viewing WoW as if he has practice for a sport or even “boys night.” But I still feel like he’s choosing a game over me and it kinda sucks. I’m not sure what else to do. I really don’t want to be a clingy girlfriend who makes him give up what he loves. I don’t want him to stop playing. I just worry that he’s going to neglect our relationship. Does anyone else play?

12,"Hi, I'm am a sophomore in college and am basically completed with my general education courses. I am currently a Philosophy and Political Science major as a prospective lawyer in animal rights law. However, I'm not sure if that will make as much as I need it to. My maternal side of the family had a very successful few decades in the car business (Oldsmobile, Infiniti, etc.); now they have a small car lot in a bad neighborhood that is ""bleeding money"". None of them have degrees except for my aunt, but only in Religion/Philosophy (BA). They also have been taking care of my grandmother for seven years now since her stroke, so going back to school is out of the question they think. Paternal side is fine, my father is set for retirement as he is sixty-six. On the other hand, my SO's family is straddling the poverty line I think, but am not sure. His mother is a freelance cleaning lady, his one brother employed at a store and the other a year younger than me and unemployed. My SO is currently trying to get a job at a grocery store, but even then I am concerned about their financial stability in the future.

I may sound like a martyr for wanting to stabilize everybody, but what is a very high-paying job (preferably over 70K a year) that is not in the medical field (I don't like needles or blood) and safe (unlike welding and what not)? Could I be a pharmacist and possibly not have to give flu shots? Would a position such as a statistician at a bank be stable?

My mother told me I could go into corporate or contract law, but I really don't like to get meddled in business as I just don't like the nature of it. I am wondering if I should switch majors not only because of the salary issue, but am also worried that through the kind of animal rights legislation I want to pursue (dismantlement of puppy mills, restrictions on exotic animals, etc.) I would be targeted. What should I do?

My strengths are in analytical work: I like numbers, but I am not a fan of science unless it's perhaps geology. Creative work isn't my strength, such as art and what not. I wanted to be a lawyer because in that field I would be dedicating myself to a good cause, essentially making the world a bit better than before if that isn't cheesy enough to stomach. Other strengths include synthesizing information and arguments, basic robotic work like stocking or what not. Anything very analytical and not overly creative. My many hours of playing Animal Crossing and Rune Scape-type games has fortified this skill.",15Aug2018,1

14,"I'm 20 years old, and after a lot of personal growth and attempts to find myself, may have come to the realization that I may be gay.

First off, I don't want to be gay at all, yet that's what I'm finding myself attracted to. I wanted the normal family... Husband, wife... Two kids, dogs, suburban home.... And really want to know if there's a way I can ""change"". I'm an atheist so telling me I'll go hell honestly won't do anything for me.

Then, if I really am gay..... I have absolutely no idea how my parents would take the news, considering I'm only child.

I have seen a few posts on this subreddit where others who came out to their family were disowned and kicked out of their home, so I'm trying to plan ahead.

At 20, and while a part time community college student, I landed a full time office based job several months ago with a well established agency with a starting salary of $45K a year. This was a combination of working up to it for the past year, as well as A LOT of luck, blood, sweat, and tears. While it isn't much, it's definitely a head start compared to others my age. Especially since this industry is notorious for quite comfortable salaries when it comes to staff with an extensive history of working in the company.

My parents have told me that while I'm in college and working they will never charge me rent.

The only thing I pay for own my own is my inexpensive car payment, insurance, and gas.

Food, etc is all payed for by my parents. They have also stated even in this job they will not charge me anything.

Being that I have next to no expenses and bills, and am not a frivolous spender by any means, this gives me quite a window to start a savings.

My target window is that two years from now, I'll have a reasonable savings set up.

My plan is that by this time, if I've really figured myself out, I will come out. If it's not well accepted, then I have a fall back to a fund I can pull from for temporarily renting an apartment while I look for a home (preferably I would like to be a homeowner). I am quite familiar with the industry and all it entails as it relates quite closely to my profession, and am fully aware of the financial responsibilities that come with owning a home as supposed to renting. I've calculated my average costs of ""everyday expenses"" throughout the past several years and can calculate (give it take finances for any emergency situations) approximately how much I would have in savings (in addition to having my vehicle payed off by that point).

Having this fund to dip into would allow me quite a head start on a mortgage on a modest home.

I've seen far too many cases of people who've gone homeless due to sexuality, and having a close friend who passed away less then a year ago after becoming homeless (for another reason) has shown me that I HAVE to be very careful, and plan this all through.

My problem is that I've been falling into a depression lately. I want to be happy, but don't want to have to do it at the costs of giving up a home. I know it's easy to say, ""Oh just be honest with them. They'll love you anyway"", but I've seen A LOT of situations that turn out to become far darker. And I don't want to take the risk.... Yet I feel like I'm dying inside.",15Aug2018,3

31,"Well first off, from middle school until early this year, I’ve had pretty bad cystic acne. 

So I literally tried everything you could think of to get rid of it. 

For e.g. drinking more water, changing my pillow covers regularly, changing my eating habits, various topical gels/creams, and facial cleansers. 

Everything. None of those worked for me. I came across accutane and it helped with my acne significantly. Now my skin is free from acne and I’m just left with the scaring and some red spots on my cheeks. 

I guess it’s one of the reasons why I don’t like meeting new people because I feel like they’re staring and I just get pretty insecure about that. So the majority of the time I don’t make any eye contact whatsoever. When I still had the acne, I’ve had strangers come up to me saying how bad it was and how “I should just wash my face” and that just lowered my self esteem. There were days where my face had gotten so bad, I wanted to skip school because I didn’t want to go out in public.

35,"Hey guys, I posted this on r/SuicidePrevention a little while ago, but decided it oughta go here too.

Long-time lurker, made an account specifically for this post. I'm at that point where I'm ready to just cut the person off entirely. Be warned, this will be extremely long. Some of it may be rambly, but I am trying to provide as much context as possible.

General background: I'm part of a circle of friends who have known each other online for the better part of a decade. We pretty much all consider each other to be brothers at this point, and a few have met up in person. We get on Skype pretty much every night to do stuff (games, movies, etc.). Long story short, we're all pretty tightly knit.

Part 1 deals with this particular person's... decline is the best word I can think of? This is all detailing when he started acting out. Part 2 will deal with the actual clinginess, and part 3 focuses on his suicidal stuff.

PART 1

A little over a year ago, O, one of our friends (member?) started taking these games a little too seriously. At first it was just when we did something competitive like Overwatch; he'd often get panicked and frustrated and start shouting to the point where nobody else in the call could communicate. Usually after a game or two, while we were taking a break to talk or get a snack or something, he'd still be talking about something or someone that frustrated him (he'd repeatedly label it all as ""cheap"" or ""bullshit"") half an hour later. Any conversation he had, he'd try and bring it back around to talk about the game and fixate on that one thing. Everyone was pretty alarmed by the change in behavior (he always had a bit of a short fuse, but he used to cool off quickly and stay polite about it), so when he had these moments, we would try asking him what was wrong or if something was going on in his life that he wanted to talk about. Every time, he would quickly brush it off and do the whole ""No worries, it won't happen again"" thing. We didn't push too hard because we thought it was just some sort of phase and that there was no way to get the information out of him.

It just kept getting worse. Eventually it got to the point where any game with friendly competition got him riled up. We couldn't even play UNO or Sorry on Steam without him taking it personally when someone inconvenienced him. And he got *angry*--as in, heavy breathing, random frustrated noises, shouting ""FUCK"" over and over and hanging up, outright crying, you name it. After a few weeks, people started calling him out when he got angry--he'd either quit the call or deflect the blame and accuse everyone else of treating him like shit. A few more weeks passed and he started admitting his behavior was unacceptable and told us to call him out from now on when he acted out... so we did, and he'd once again say ""Oh whoops, sorry, my bad I totally get it and it won't happen again!"" Naturally, it would happen again, so when we started pointing out that it's still happening even when we call him out, he'd sit there quietly and let us talk, then once again deflect the issue and refuse to talk about it.

Pretty much every night was just super toxic for everyone. Some people stopped showing up in calls entirely because they were tired of it. Eventually we started doing stuff less and less and even ended up making a separate Skype call just so we could do SOMETHING without drama. This is where the clinginess started setting in. He clearly noticed that we were doing fewer calls and began spam-calling everyone. If nobody picked up, he'd immediately call again. Sometimes people outright said they weren't up for a call and he'd keep doing it. Even if we had set ourselves to appear offline, he'd keep calling, so we sat him down and asked him to stop. He got passive aggressive--don't remember the exact words - something along the lines of ""But people aren't answering!""

After long enough, he stopped spamming the calls... and instead started messaging everyone around the same time, every night, ""Ready when you guys are Freddy"" (or some other variation). Sometimes we'd do a call, and if something happened we'd try to talk to him, but he'd just turtle up and refuse to communicate. Other times, we'd stick to a call without him. Hell, we started coming up with ways to organize calls and figure out how to have him with us without any toxicity--usually the best we could come up with was watching a movie or sticking to games that weren't super competitive (mentioned it earlier, I think, but eventually that got to the point where we couldn't even play a game of UNO or some other non-serious game without him getting upset). Later, over the winter, during one of his outbursts (this time blaming one of the groupmembers for a loss during a game), one of the guys called him on it and... well, I'm not sure what happened. It was like just about everything else we had been saying for months, but somewhow he got through to our friend. He spilled a good deal of stuff going on in his life--most notably that he had been suicidal for the past few years (made several attempts as well, with the most recent attempt being around the time he started acting out). He got a little more receptive to criticism after that night, but it was still hard to communicate with him on the issue overall.

PART 2 - the clinginess

Over the course of the next few months, he started getting more and more clingy. He didn't call us constantly anymore, but he started paying a lot more attention to our general daily schedules. It was, essentially, just him saying he's ready for a call every night around the same time (not inherently harmful, just that he was doing it at the exact time, every single day, that was a bit of a red flag). He'd memorize people's schedules and the times they were normally on, and if they weren't on, start asking what they were doing and just interrogating in general. If he saw anyone start playing a game on Steam, he'd immediately hop on and want to join (normally we ask each other ahead of time or wait until the usual call before any group activities), even if it was a game that everyone, including him, agreed not to play with him. If someone felt like just playing on their own and turned down his invitations, he'd take it personally. 

On an MMO we all used to group up on, O ended up spending a bunch of money on extra stuff and leveled waaaay ahead of everyone else (if you're an MMO gamer, you probably know what I mean. I won't ramble about the details unless you want). I got on with one of the guys to try and catch up a little during a call. He popped onto Skype and requested to join; we told him no, because we didn't want him getting even further ahead of everyone, and he asked again a few minutes later. Every couple of minutes, he'd ask and make... weird, shrill noises mimmicking crying/whimpering, until being outright told to stop. He accused us both of excluding him and hung up, then came back 30 minutes later and asked in a shrill, high pitched voice if we were still angry at him (kind of in this weird, almost playful way, like it was just another joke). We never were to begin with and said as much, and he started going ""YAAAAAAY!"" in an equally shrill and high-pitched tone.

Remember when I said he was paying more attention to everyone's activity? Well, it got to the point where whenever he saw one of us online on Facebook, he'd immediately start messaging them about random things or requesting a call. As in, the very instant someone got online, he'd hyper-focus on them. If you play Overwatch, you know that you can spectate people--he's been doing that now, essentially watching people play now without asking. Maybe you wouldn't find that bothersome, but it felt like there was no privacy at all when someone suddenly started watching everything you did when you were trying to relax. Some of us actually had to start setting ourselves to invisible on everything (Steam, Facebook, Skype, etc.) because he wouldn't give anyone privacy, and no matter how bluntly or politely we told him how much his behavior bothered us, he'd simply ignore the complaint or get defensive.

Part 3 - suicidal

At this point, it's mostly just 3 of us who are active now, excluding O--the others are either full-time employed and can only get on every few days, or just don't actively have access to a computer. I and the other two (F and R, we'll call them) were doing a game of Overwatch when the game started telling us that O was spectating us, even though we were offline, which meant that he got online, looked us up on his friends list, saw that we did not appear to be on, and attempted to spectate us anyways just to make sure. He stopped a few seconds later, then did it again and again, the game telling us each time he stopped or resumed. After almost a year of trying to talk to him, we just decided not to deal with it and ignored the notifications.

After the match, I alt-tabbed as I waited for the next and saw that he was typing in the Facebook chat. We figured at the very least we'd see what he had to say, so I kept a close eye and checked whenever I could, and eventually there was just a multi-paragraph message posted in the chat talking about his previous suicide attempts and proclaiming that ""this time, the knot will hold"", then he logged off.

We pretty much dropped everything and started trying to track him down--see, out of everyone in the group, we kind of know the least about him. He was very secretive about his name and real life ongoings (pretty much everyone else knows each other's full name and talks about stuff going on in their life), and only F knew his first name so we had very little to go off of. Likewise, the Facebook accounts we use for group stuff aren't our actual names. Whatever the case, we put our brains together and stayed up later than usual before we found his face and first name on Facebook. Through that, we found his mother and her phone number and called her, telling her that we were worried that he was planning on killing himself. Her reaction was more... annoyance at him than concern, but she checked on him and said he was laying in bed. Everyone turned in for the night after that--I missed a few hours of sleep helping to track him down and R didn't sleep at all. Some couple of days later, O appeared again and was a bit more passive and receptive than usual.

Pretty much everyone realized that night that O living or dying was totally dependent on whether we hung out with him, which we are *not* qualified for at all. The 3 of us started composing a message about our concern for him (there's no way we can do this verbally in a call--he hangs up as soon as he gets confronted, but supposedly reads our messages enough to respond now). It took a lot of time and proofreading to avoid triggering him, but when he called us out for avoiding him again and ""making him feel like shit"", we sent it in along with our own personal comments. Among these comments, I brought up that he wasn't considering how we felt about the whole thing and he suddenly seemed more... understanding? It was hard to tell; he seemingly accepted that he had been inconsiderate and needed help, but hasn't done much. He said he was talking to his mom and found a professional, but was super mum about it. Not that we were entitled to know anything--he was just very vague and over the next couple months (up to recently), has reverted to monitoring/stalking our activity again. He isn't making claims of suicide anymore or demanding that we play with him, or anything overly overt. In the event that we do something with him, he *always*, at least once a call/session/activity, says something along the lines of ""I'ved missed you guys so much!"" or ""It's never been the same without you guys!"" Sometimes after an argument, he passive aggressively says ""I guess I shouldn't expect another call for another few weeks.""

Now he just watches and tries to corner us in some activity, or tries to push us to buy a bunch of new games in hopes of jumpstarting activity. We'd be more receptive to doing something with him if he wasn't so unstable and (albeit unintentionally) toxic, but we've exhausted just about everything we can think of. At this point it feels like the change in behavior is just him adjusting his ""strategy"" to drag everything back to the status quo instead of trying to do anything about his issues.

TLDR: part of a group of longtime friends online, one of them has been super toxic and unstable/suicidal for the past year. Said friend won't do anything about it and just wants everyone to pretend everything's all good. Stalks everyone all day, everyday, and is super passive aggressive.

Any ideas what to do here? We don't want to cut him off because we've known him for so long and he might kill himself.

37,"I don't really know where to start. I've been thinking about this topic for a long time now and I need second opinions and advice on it. Since I was about 15, I hated the way our society was set up, and it's been on my mind again.

Our society, or at least the United States, it sets you for failure and debt. You spend 14 years of your life (preschool to graduate) in school, teaching you to get job. Then you get a job, but they don't pay you enough for basic needs. You need to go to college to get a better job, but you don't have enough money to educate yourself farther because you don't get paid enough. You have to take out student loans, then you get better educate to get yourself a job that pays 30-70 grand a year, meanwhile, you're neck deep in the student loans you got. After you subtract the cost of living, groceries, bills, insurance, etc; you barely have any money to pay your students loans. You don't get enough towards your retirement, and you're spending years paying off loans. Then you spend another 30-40 years working until you retire. 42% of America is at risk of retiring broke. That's unacceptable.

Working 40 hours a week ruins every aspect of your life. You're spending a third of your life working, being away from the people you care about, your kids, your hobbies. You come home And barley have time to do anything, you have to catch up on everything and go to bed early cause you're so tired from working all day

I wasn't born on this fucking planet to work my entire life. I want to actually do something. I dream of a lifestyle where I don't have to worry about working every single day. I want to do the things that I actually want to do. What do I do?

So my very close female friend who we have had romantic feelings for each other for a while and I got into a bit of an argument last night and we’re gonna spend a bit of time away from each other, that’s not really my issue here.

See I’m the type of person that always needs something to work on, a goal to achieve, or some sort of mark to hit. I always need an objective.  Now I’m a musician and I’m working on an album sure but up until now my main goal was this girl, now that we’re spending a bit of time apart I don’t know what to focus on, I’m already living a healthy lifestyle, I have a job, school is almost over. I have a concert to see in October (gorillaz) I’m trying to improve my mental health, I’m already saving up for a car.

39,"Hey reddit, this is my first time posting on here and I don’t really know what to accomplish with this post. But I feel like I just need help. I’m 23 years old still in college and I am not a good student. I’m held back about one year from graduation and I just found out I failed my summer class. My parents and my brothers hate me right now and called me a disgrace to the family. They compare me to my cousins who are also my age and in professional schools. They think I have a disability cause I’m a bad student, I don’t. I failed this class because I sent a classmate a project and he didn’t change up the answers, he submitted it as it is and I got fucked for it. I really wish I could make my family proud like my cousins have for theirs. But I feel like my parents are right, I am a failure, I’m good for nothing, I don’t even have a job. My life is going nowhere. I just don’t know what to do, I want my life to just stop. I don’t want to cause anymore stress to my family cause they’re already going through a lot. My mom even said I would just be better off dead or away from the family for a very long time because they cannot even stand the sight of me. She even went as far as to say that if she died from stress, it would be all my fault and her death would be on my hands. They think I don’t care about anyone or anything because I always seem “relaxed” but what they don’t see is the nights I stay up until 4 in the morning thinking how much a failure of I am and how I know I’m a disgrace. I do care, I do want a good future, I do want to make my family proud. But I feel as if nothing can be done for me. All hope is lost for me. My family will probably be better off without me around, or maybe if I’m just not around at all. I’m at the bottom with 50 meters of shit on top of me.

I have an anger problem, and I think I could have depression as well, but not sure, and I can be unintentionally rude sometimes. I really don't mean it.

I helped her through a difficult time, I was there for her when she had no one else. It was a very serious situation depending on life and death. Things got better and now things are better, but I don't think it is for me. I try my best to help if she needs help. One time she called me out for being rude, and I was, but I hate myself for it, and I cut myself for the first time that night, and I wanted so much to go to the woods and hang myself. As I am writing this, I am exhausted and my hands are shaking as I am feeling on a bit anxiety as well. I was a bit rude earlier, so I stopped messaging her for a while, and when we texted back, we had a good time together, shared laughing emojis, sent memes, and I felt happy. But as soon as I told her to have a good time, she told me yes and called me rude in a harsh way. I got surprised and anxious and pissed and wondered why she said that. I got pissed and told her she has been rude as well many times, but I didn't say. She just told me to leave her alone, said that she never was rude. After this I hit the wall and cried by the wall and went down and cut my fucking arm to bleed. And now I am writing this. She said herself she is happy when talking to her, and I am too talking to her, because she is the only friend I have. I honestly suspect she only cares for herself, but I feel even more that it is my fault.

42,"Hey guys, going to try and not make this too long -

I'm 19 years old and about to go back up to school for my junior year. My goal this summer was to work enough to finally buy myself a car (used) under my name, no strings attached to my parents. If you go to my profile, you can see I've been posting on vehicle forums the past couple weeks seeking advice and asking all sorts of questions. The private used car market is a daunting task to sift through when it comes to finding a trustworthy seller along with the right car, but it's all been exciting nonetheless. Through this all, I've been using my dad's old car the last couple months to get to and from work as well as do things such as check out cars across Long Island these past couple weeks. It's been sitting for a good 7 years and he was nice enough to pay for a hefty repair to get it running and back on the road again for me when I got home after spring semester. 1997 Mercedes E320. I was paying him monthly usage fees along with insurance but it made sense. You borrow something like a car, you pay for it. I realize other families do things differently but that's the way we run and I agree to an extent.

There were restrictions though. I could only use it for work and could never take it out late. If I wanted to do something otherwise, I had to follow up and get approval. Not too hard. Depending on the time of day and nature of where I wanted to take the car, he'd give me the OK more times than not. For some reason though, I have this habit where I don't consciously think or consider the things I do that may very well be abusing my parent's trust. There are a number of times where I took the car somewhere after work before coming home without notifying my dad for example. I never think to myself that it's wrong in the moment and it's only when I either get caught or have something go wrong where I reevaluate my actions and think to myself why the hell did I do that. I realize this isn't a mind blowing realization that I solely experience, I just hate my lack of thinking and consideration.

So yesterday, I crashed my dad's car as I was on my way to see a car for sale ironically. My afternoon shift at work was cancelled so I decided to take the extra time to catch a good deal on a car I was interested in without giving him the headsup. Hydroplaned on the highway and slammed into a few trees off the right side of the road. Luckily I wasn't hurt nor was anyone else as I managed to avoid hitting anyone. The car in front of me slowed down abruptly and I swerved to my right to avoid contact. I was too close and wasn't at attentive as one should be. Long story short, there's no collision insurance on my vehicle and the pre-estimate for repair came out to almost $8000. The entire driver's side was caved in.

I know accidents happen in life both on and off the road and I'm so thankful I'm alive and didn't kill anyone though I'm so fucking disappointed in myself. I don't know why sometimes I choose not to follow up on things I do, especially when it comes to taking advantage of things my parents do to favor my personal convenience. I don't consciously ponder over the fact that I'm ""hiding things"" from them or ""being sneaky"" in the moment but I was. Most of all, it's unfortunate that something as severe as this is what it takes to finally come to that consensus. My dad had the opportunity to sell this car for $5000 to a friend and I blew that up. I very well know a car is a material thing and I'm aware it's not all about the numbers but I feel extremely shitty for abusing the things they do to ensure my comfortability. 

My dad's extremely disappointed but after reviewing the estimate, he was considerate enough to have me essentially buy the car off him at a pre accident condition price, that being $2000. Purchasing this car was my backup plan after all if my private party car venture didn't work out so thankfully the financial damage done on my part doesn't add up to paying for a repair that's triple the car's worth. I'm going to try and junk it for a few hundred at best and am considering giving my dad what I receive for that. 

Money talk aside, I wanted to reach out and inquire on advice towards how I can be more attentive in my decision making and truly make up for what I did to my dad. I never want to make this grave of a mistake again and most importantly, never want to involve my parents again. He's really tough love but encourages me towards success always even though he's tough to read. 

This all could have been alot worse in many ways. I put a hole in my parent's trust and getting my own car in time for school is out of the water. On a positive note, things only go up from here and eventually yeah I will buy a car when I have money again. I'm physically unharmed and I strive to rebuild a relationship where trust and communication are concrete.

I don't intend to make any or much money on them at all because honestly Youtube isn't the best platform for this and I have almost no following. I just want to tell a story episodically for fun and create something that will beef up my portfolio when I start looking for animation jobs. If it gains a following that'll be cool, but not what I'm shooting for. 

I intend to voice 2-3 of the main cast myself but I really can't do male voices convincingly. An acquaintance on a discord server mentioned that he's aspiring to be a voice actor and would love to help out with my series. From reading the comments on Betsy Lee's posts and watching her Q&amp;A videos, I know that a lot of people would love to be voices in her show for (I'm assuming) free and just for the fun of it (currently she employs close friends and family for her voice acting and while I'm not sure if she pays them or not I don't think she does).

I don't have any means to pay voice actors and while I have a few male friends who could help me with this, I feel like it would be great to expand  the voice cast to other people. I don't wanna take advantage of people but if I go and recruit amateurs am I doing just that? If so I'll just make do.  If I do start making money off of it I'm willing to pay voice actors fairly based on the percent of the video revenue (which given what I know about Youtube monetization that is going to be pennies on the dollar and a long way away.) So I really don't know if that would be worth it for someone seriously looking to get into voice work.

I believe this is why I've had a tendency to take naps so often; if I'm just sleeping, I can't do anything wrong.

At the same time, a part of me hates that I had been sleeping so much; I genuinely want to motivate myself to be productive.

Looking back, it didn't help that my Public Affairs NCO wrote me a negative counseling statement every time I breathed wrong; I believe it would have been better to just do the other Army type punishment of making me do exercises, but that's neither here nor there.

I am 22 in Canada. I work in the oilfield which consists of 2 weeks straight or so of 10-13hr days with the same just one other person constantly. The other person is the team lead and I am the assistant. He is not my boss but does have the authority in daily work.

He is maybe age 50, smokes, single, kind of grumpy. He describes himself as an asshole but weve had many great conversations and I learn a lot at work from him. Every other assistant in my company hates him

He is so incredibly demanding and controlling. He freaks out me for drinking too loud, having my head too far back in the truck seat, walking one way around a tree instead of the other. It is absolutely exhausting to try and keep him happy and i think its impossible.

I have low self esteem and dont want a conflict, especially because i will not win. He always makes these rules and then contradicts them and is very hypocritical. He always setse up in situations where I am expected to read his mind and if guess one thing then he always makes it the other just so i am wrong and then he yells at me

He talks so much shit about all of the other assistants, he probably will about me too. Half of it is exxagerrated amd also mistakes that he makes too. Like for example, he complains that one of his assistants always sleeps in the car, but that assistant told me it was one time. I will never and have never slept in the vehicle but the other day my team lead did while i was driving, so hypocritical. 

Every observation i make has a condescending explanation. Like if I say ""wow the roads are pretty shitty eh"" instead of ""yeah you betcha"", i get "" Well it rain two days ago so of course its rainy right?"" In a very condescending tone, for everything that i say.

Or if i ask any question, i am always cut off angrily. Like if I am about to ask ""Oh is that the jobsite way up north?"" He will cut me off at ""Oh is that the jobsite..."" and answer angrily not even to my question ""NO its not the job site from yesterday!""

Being quiet is helpful, but then I am.kept completely in the dark about our work and then he yells at me later like im stupid but its because he withholds information for that exact purpose. I cant even do my job in peace because he is always nitpicking every little thing because im not doing it his way. Like zipping zippers up in the middle instead of just to one side

The reason I dont have my schedule done is because I am stuck doing this chem prep course online that honestly feels out of my league. Most of the course I was able to fly through because I knew it.. there are around 8 subjects that I have been stuck on for the past month now and I just can not get through them. I have been taking notes through every explanation and trying to work through the problems, I just can not get the concept of what it is trying to teach.

The biggest problem with me having difficulty here is that I'm going to be majoring in chemistry. I've always loved chemistry, I just have a hard time with math here and there and this is one of those ""there"" moments. The subjects are purely math related which is my downfall.

To make matters worst I went to orientation a few weeks ago and the chemistry professor seemed pretty taken back that the course has taken me more then a couple hours. I've probably spent a good 20+ hours trying, ultimately getting frustrated, giving up, taking a break, and then starting over. 

This course was supposed to be done a while ago to have my schedule finalized but I am struggling here.

Cut forward to today, while doing my math homework my mom calls saying that my grandma has passed away. I was very close to my grandma, so I took this kinda hard. That combined with my mom crying as well made for a sad evening. A few hours go by of the whole family mourning, until i notice that my dog has something familiar in it's mouth. Its my chemistry homework. I am freaking out right now as that homework can not be done in one day. I dont know if I should email my teacher about this because this whole story sounds like an excuse from 4th grade. My way of writing doesnt help either, becasue i feel like it does not have much emotion too it.

She is now threatening to sue me for claims are made which have been that she's not a lpn, she didn't have my father ready to go for an appointment, and she's been overpaid. She's made over $2,000 in overpayment in the few months she's worked for my father. 

I have no say in firing her since my mother is the employer. She's been manipulating my elderly/sick mother into believing her and giving into her threats against me.

63,"I mean, I probably should. I’m currently working 3 different jobs and I feel dead inside. I’m so hard to talk to and I know it because I’m over tired most of the time. I just turned 23 and feel so lost

My first job, an office job in real estate development that truthfully I don’t really like.. but could maybe lead to better things? I’m making minimum wage basically but I live in one of their older buildings that will be torn down, but my rent is cheap af. Half of what I could get anywhere else in this city. I have a second spot to movie into so I’m pretty set for living if I stay here. The company culture isn’t my favourite and the job is quite lonely. I like people but here I have little interaction. I’ve been here for about 1.5 years and not sure if I want to do it..

Second job is a nightclub. I worse opposite hours and I make really good money but it kills me waking up Monday morning. The management is very poor and borderline abusive. Customers are hit and miss, sometimes they’re friendly or sometimes they’re the worst people to deal with. I feel like this job has been my ticket to financial freedom yet it’s so inconsistent and makes me feel like a zombie. 

My third job is eyelash extensions. I do it from home so that’s the great part but I need a real salon spot or office type spot so I can actually register as a business. This job is enjoyable but hard on my back a bit. It’s a slow start and I don’t have that many clients yet so I’m trying to get some before I think about moving into a space. I feel passionate about this job but I don’t have enough clients yet and I’m not sure if this is something I want to do long term....

I’m working 60-70 hours per week sometimes and only have a few thousand saved up. I’m currently looking into working at another nightclub that I’ll get more consistent shifts at so it’ll give me the chance to possibly work doing lash extensions more. I don’t know.

What do I do? How do I know what’s going to make me happiest out of these three jobs? Where do I go next? ",15Aug2018,1

Within a short span of time I got a new job and got accepted into college. Things are going great in my life, this I can recognize. However, I just feel so empty and alone. I felt that way while I was in but figured it was due to me being away. I chose not to date while I was in because I didn't feel like I could truly decide if I wanted to marry someone and have them move across the world in that short span of time.

I want to settle down and start a family of my own someday. Its my dream to find someone I can share my life with. I've been trying to date but it feels like everyone I meet isn't compatible or there are other circumstances that just ultimately lead to it not working out.


I've tried dating apps, but I dont get many matches. The ones that I do match with, I'm not attracted to (I know I sound shallow but physical attraction is important to me) or they're bots. There have been a couple of women I have seen that I enjoy spending time with but they dont work for one reason or another, like a recent breakup or they lose interest.


I'm just tired of feeling the way I do. I have been to therapy for depression, and i manage that pretty well, but i feel like I'm lacking companionship in my life.

73,"I hate my mom. I know, I know, I'm supposed to love my mom for everything she's done; especially since she's sacrificed her life and happiness for me and my siblings. But I can't stand her. I hate the way she thinks, I resent the way she makes me feel, I despise the way she is. She is a person that places money over anything, and everything. Family member that never helped out when we were struggling? As far as she's concerned, those aren't family members to her anymore. I know that she's become that way because of us. A single mother raising three kids, what else can you expect? But at the same time I can't fucking stand any of it. I've always has some form of depression/anxiety. I tried killing myself twice when I was in elementary and junior high. But that was it, I thought I got pass that mindset of wanting to kill myself. 

After some recent events, I've found myself at the dark side of the spectrum again. I'm constantly wondering how easy everything would be if I just killed myself- just ended everything. No more going crazy thinking about what if's, no more feeling like shit, nothing. Moving back with my mom for the summer, everything's gotten worst. Everything she does or says gets me annoying and angry. I can see myself already becoming someone I don't want to be. Last night when the neighbors baby was up all night and crying, she told me to blast my ""black music- the one's with all the fuck words and shit"" towards said neighbor. It's things like this that drive me crazy. I just had another argument with her; this time about car tires. She keeps having this mindset of ""I spend money like it's nothing"", ""I have no concept of how hard money is earned"". After a week of research I found tires for $60. ""It's too expensive"" she said. I said installation and miscellaneous fees would add up to about $300. ""That's too much, they shouldn't charge you that much when all they do is put it through a machine"" she said. That escalated to the same old ""you're just like your dad, all you do is spend money like crazy, all you do is sit at home and play games."" 

Fact of the matter is that I've been working with my uncle almost everyday. Now mind you, my uncle is a contractor, so working with him involves hard labor. It's not sitting in an office in front of a computer. It's bending down, putting hardwood floors in, carrying heavy objects. I don't complain though. I know I need the money. I take two days off- one because my fingers were bruised and swelling from putting in hardwood floors, and one to hang out with my friends. Her reaction to the first was ""It's not that hard to put in hardwood floors."" Her reaction to the second was ""You're hanging out with your friends again?"" The last time I hung out with my friends was in early July. I've been working since then. And that's what got me. When she said ""all you do is sit at home and play games"", even though I've been working almost everyday. I just punched the sink so hard that I'm pretty sure I either broke something or it's swelling. That's the person I've become. I get angry, I resort to self harm, and I fucking hate myself. 

And I can't leave either. Due to an agreement, I've told her that I'd live with her for at least five years. In these five years, I have to pay rent as if I'm living outside and give her 20% of my income. If just living with her for three months has turned me into the mess I am now, how will I be able to last five years? That genuinely scares me. It scares me so much that I don't want to live anymore. I don't know what to do anymore. ",15Aug2018,3
74,"Backstory: we’ve only been married for a year. Things have always been absolutely amazing. He works in a town 45 minutes away and most days he stops at Torchys taco for food and drinks after work. We used to live in this town and frequent that torchys, I know all the people who work there. He’s always been really bad at letting me know where he is and we have had problems with that because I want to make sure he’s safe, I’ve always absolutely trusted him. 

Now to today: I hadn’t heard much from him today, but he sent me a really long “I love you so much” message around 3. I thought it was so sweet so I responded with my own and I hadn’t heard anything after which is normal, he can’t be on his phone too much. So fast forward to when he was supposed to be home, I checked snapchat map to see if he stopped by torchys but to my utter surprise it last showed him pinged at a house around 5 minutes from work where he opened my message 3 HOURS before that’s where the map saved him last. He arrived home at 7. I immediately confronted him, I asked when he got off work and he told me 4:30. So I ask where he’s been, I know it takes 45 minutes to get home. he said he went to torchys, and then got his prescription and came home. He swears UP AND DOWN he has no idea who’s house that is or why it would put him there. He said he got on torchys wifi (they don’t have free WiFi I believe) maybe it placed him there. He said “we can drive there if you want and ask them if they know me” I didn’t have anything else to say. All three locations are off the same highway. The house is on the other side of work from torchys, a decent distance away. 

Now to my questions: is it actually possible for snapchat to place you at a house you’ve never been? I would understand if it was a random park or random street even if that was possible. But it was on a specific house. 

Any advice or experience with this would be so helpful, I want to believe him if he’s innocent, I just need to know if it’s actually possible, because it sounds completely made up and unbelievable. 

Tl;dr husbands snapchat showed him at a house, he adamantly claims he’s never been there, blamed trying to use WiFi that might have pinged him there, it sounds utterly unbelievable. ",15Aug2018,0
75,"i feel like there’s a part of my brain that’s missing. it just doesn’t work. i have thoughts, but i can’t make any sense of them anymore. i just feel emotion occasionally, and even then i don’t know why or how or who i am. it’s confusing and isolating in a way i can’t describe. i don’t even feel like i’m typing this, im just carrying out the actions. i’m still ok at responding to the environment around me (people talking, etc) but i feel like i’m just going through the motions half the time. i barely know where i am or that i exist unless i *really* make myself focus on it.  i guess the best way to put it is, while i do act normal and get stuff done, my mind is completely out of it. 

i can’t describe how confused and stupid i feel just typing this. i _know_ how poorly worded it is, but i can’t seem to do any better. the words to say what i’m trying to say just don’t come up in my head, it’s like they don’t exist. i’m in 5 AP classes right now and for the first time ever i’m starting to feel i just can’t keep up. i’m not smart enough, i try but unless it’s math my brain just doesn’t listen. i’ve gotten suicidal over being overwhelmed by classes before so i tried to drop one, but i’m not allowed. so now i’m trapped in classes i simply lack the brain and thoughts to get an a in. there’s no way out and no matter how hard i try and think my brain won’t go back to normal. 

i’d guess that it was the antidepressants that i started recently that’s causing this, but i remember saying i felt this way before. it’s like, i thought i was the worst i could get, being depressed, but no, now i’m not even real. the only time i feel good is when i’m thinking of _them,_ but as much as i feel like i have feelings for them, im too empty headed to ever be ok in a relationship. 

i don’t know what to do, is there any way i can get the rest of my head back? i want to be able to think and feel like a real person again, please if there is any way that i can fix this just tell me, im honestly desperate to do anything to get back into reality. i just want to be normal. to feel and be real, and care for people, and be able to think coherently. please.

81,"So I’m a (33m) who’s about 37 days post-breakup and I’m in such a depressed mindset that it’s almost debilitating. 
I work 3x a week, I hit the gym religiously, quit watching TV and started reading more, started surfing again, I deleted IG, went NC with my ex (33f), I’ve also refrained from checking her social media, I attend yoga at least twice a week, and I’ve been getting maybe 2-3hrs of sleep a night. 
I work 12hr shifts at a hospital, so my lack of sleep is definitely affecting my performance. 
I’m also trying to focus on my dream career as a Firefighter, and all while dealing with this breakup. I know it sounds petty when compared to what a lot of other people are going through, but this has really brought me to such a deep level of depression, one I personally never thought I’d reach. 

I think about her everyday and replay so much of what she said during our relationship and breakup and it’s taking up 99.5%  of my daily thoughts. 
I feel like I might possibly be going insane. 
I keep waiting for her to text me, but I doubt that day will ever come. 

I guess my advice is, should I start trying to date? I mean, let’s be real, if I can meet someone and forget about my ex, I might make it out of this alive. I’m a caring, loving guy and would never do this as a rebound, but I’m not getting any younger. 

My question is: How do I find someone? I hate the idea of online dating. It’s just not for me. I did find my ex on Tinder, but we had mutual friends in HS (we never met in HS but knew of each other) so it wasn’t completely awkward. I’m shy so finding someone organically could be a bit tough... but that’s honestly the way I want to meet someone. There’s a few women at work and the gym that I want to approach, but part of me isn’t ready. Should I listen to that? I also wouldn’t know what to say. 

My heart still aches over my ex. She’s done this 4x in 16m and she always came back. And like I fool, I let her back in :( 
She’s definitely not like other girls, she was actually perfect in every way imo well, accept that she was emotionally unavailable. She watched her mom cheat on her husband with multiple guys, asked for therapy as a child, but was told to “toughen up” and she was Always badgered by her mom to look pretty, date guy and have kids. She resisted all of this. She dressed like a boy in HS, only had sex twice before me because she was incredibly shy and insecure about her body, and she is still the same way now. 
We couldn’t have sex in the light, not even with the tv on! 
She would always cover herself, after/during sex, she was incredibly insecure about her looks e.g. wouldn’t see me if she had a pimple etc and she’s getting fake boobs this winter ( bad idea), fake eyes (colored) and still, despite these things I love her more than anything in the world. I did my best to make this relationship work, but she was so cold and distant at times that it brought out the worst in me (insecurities/neediness). I hate myself for this. She even aborted our kid on Valentine’s Day! Which I was totally against because she knew that was a possibility. Now I’m rambling... any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you ",15Aug2018,1

90,"So this requires a little backstory, but the last little paragraph will some it up.

I have known my now roommate for approxamately 5 years but we grew apart and he became best friends with my now boyfriend and has been apart of our lives now for some of the most important and hardest things. He means a lot to us both so we are afraid to hurt his feelings.

Our friend though who we will call Austin had had a very shit life and hes had a lot of barriers though standing from a friends pov he could have prevented a lot of them. Hes in money issues (but he spends a lot of money on xbox and fast food), hes walked out a lease to move in with parents (so finding a place will be more than hard), he also has passed on countless overtime hours because he rather play video games and continues to be broke. We now charge him 70 a week because we couldn't keep housing him for free. 

Austin also basically refuses to help. Me ans my SO went away on a several day trip and asked him to do 3 simple task (and i mean basic) the hardest of which being to spot clean the bathroom in which other than the trash changed was dirtier than i left it. 

Austin also sits and wines like a child (hes mid 20s) when he can't play on my xbox when he is so toxic and refuses to notice or change. Ive had to tell him that he is only aloud to message xbox friends because he has had so many bands (the last being a lifetime he managed to get out of) that im afraid hes pushing and IP band because hes had so many major offenses ans its my Xbox (and yes he had a fit about it), but his manners are just as bad as his attitude. He doesn't knock (has walked in on me naked) or just knocks and just walks in, never shuts doors to go to bathroom half he time, leaves trash everywhere, and just does as he please all the time.

We can't keep housing him. We are in a 1 bed 1 bath with 3 people and i feel like im raising a kid in the house with his manners and attitudes. Its ridiculous and we are ready to kick him out but he has no where to go. He has a bad relationship with his parents, he really only had us as actual friends, and his last landlord will never in a million years recommend him after how he walked off with that place trashed. Ive told my SO I will take the blame if need be because i know hes closer with him than I am (partially because im so pissed and want him out). I just don't know what to do. We were thinking about giving him a month maybe 2 but he has no motivation to work he wont be able to afford it.


To sum it up: I have a really shit roommate who needs to get out for every reason under the sun, its basically like raising a kid in a 1 bed 1 bathroom apartment. He has been a good friend in past and we are afraid to kick him out because he has no where to go, but me and my SO can't take it. How do we get him out without hurting him? Or losing a friend?

My dad said he wouldn't let me take my car (registered under my name) and said it with a smug smile like i'd have to accept that, my mom offered alternatives to getting there like them taking me or the train, and my sister, who herself drives 7 hrs to visit us, didn't try to help me just pointed out to me that i had been in an accident years ago. I'm 21, it's ridiculous that they want to put so many restrictions on me, don't drink, don't drive out of town, etc...

I can't reason with them, it's never worked in the past and i've tried. Honestly i'm thinking about just sneaking out, i got the days off, i want to go, i can't get in any legal trouble, and my folks would never kick me out of the house, seeing as how i move out in a month for school anyways. They say i don't have experience driving or that i'll get in an accident. They don't trust me, so there's no point to trying to get them to.

I really don't want to stress them or myself out for an entire weekend, but they refuse to accept that i can make decisions on my own. They've done that for years, like when i quit my first job my dad scolded me and called me lazy even though it was for school reasons",15Aug2018,1
95,"i'm the only girl living in a studio complex of 6 people. we have our own rooms, but share a communal kitchen and laundry.

most of us are students but there's a 60\~ish year old grandpa living in the basement who's a bit... off. once i was sitting on the balcony when he came up behind me unannounced and started massaging my shoulders. i was so shocked that i couldn't even respond, i just tensed up and slipped away. 

later he knocks on my door and tells me he accidentally took a pair of my underwear from the washing machine. that seems fair enough, except that he tells me i have to \*come down to his basement\* to get it back. i flat out refuse and tell him to leave it in a basket in the laundry. he never did.

i avoided doing my laundry for as long as possible following that, but eventually i had to. i get it back today and there's a fucking CONDOM in my clothes! specifically, my underwear! it very well could have been an accident from the last guy to use the machine, but then i remembered seeing the grandpa dude weirdly loitering around the laundry when he had no reason to, and i'm paranoid he planted it in there. i'm 98% sure it wasn't there when i put my clothes in.

i have a hunch more of my underwear's gone missing, but i have no proof. this old guy keeps trying to get me to come down and visit him but i try to see the best in people and can't prove he isn't just lonely/needing a friend.

either way, my clothes are infused with some stranger's cum and i feel nauseous.",15Aug2018,3
96,"so a little background, I started working at a retail clothing store a little over a year ago, well during the interview my boss told me multiple things like ''you get a pay increase after a year'' ''we give flexible hours'' ''you get paid time off'' it all sounded good to me so after the interview he offered me the job on the spot and I accepted, well here we are a year in and I have been told that I will not get a pay increase until next spring because thats when they increase pay and when spring hit I was not working a year, he constantly forgets about my availability on sunday's (I work opening to about 3 to 4pm) even though he agreed to it, and I have been told associates don't get paid time off. 

BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE, I met my current girlfriend at this job, we were both new associates and started dating last november, my boss was fully aware of this relationship when it started and we both promised to make sure everything is professional when we are working (a promise mind you that I keep, because I'm not a idiot), in early January of this year he promoted her to MT (management is not allowed to date associates, but he said he would just keep it secret from the corporate heads), fast forward to recent events and we lost all of our employees except for my manager, assistant manager, my MT/GF and me, so hours were pretty decent for a little while until we got this 17 year old in and my manager decided to screw me by giving the new guy 20+ hours a week, while keeping we at a pace of around 8-10 hours a week, I mean I have been working this job well over a year, I have stepped in when people were sick, I stepped in on days off when the help was needed and I get screwed over, and I already know his excuse will be ''well you and the MT can't work together''.....what is your advise to do reddit.",15Aug2018,1
97,"So to keep things short, my best friend and I always hang out (whether in person or through video games) and so we normally schedule times to be on. It’s not uncommon however for one of us to have to reschedule. It’s normally him that has to reschedule and just out of curiosity I ask why. The answer doesn’t matter. It could be an important or nonimportant reason but it’s just a common thin to ask. Whenever I ask however he accuses me of needing to know everything about his life and says I’m too nosy.

So I’m just curious, is it not a normal and valid question to ask why he needs rescheduling?",15Aug2018,0
98,"Okay guys. It’s gonna be a long story. I am 15f and I have three brothers 13, 16, and 18. Up until I was three I had a “perfect” life. My dad was in the marine corps so I never saw him but that didn’t matter because seeing as I was so young I didn’t know. Fast forward to about six that’s when I started to remember things, my dad wasn’t so perfect after all. He did drugs all the time and was an alcoholic. He would get so angry and rage absolutely rage, it’s like we were walking on egg shells, we had to be extra careful, “don’t say the wrong things or daddy will be angry” my mom would say. When he got angry he took it out on us. He would beat us for no reason saying “well it’s your fault if you would’ve done what you were told” but we were just kids we didn’t know any better. Me and him would get in arguments all the time. One time my brother who is 16 now, but at the time was 6, asked my mom if he could go jump out on our trampoline my mom said sure then my dad found outside and went out and beat him because he “didn’t finish his food” but there wasn’t even anything on he’s plate and even if there was he wouldn’t have known because I had already washed the dishes. There are so many stories. My brothers felt bad for me because I got the worst of it. We moved all the time as soon as people got the suspicion of anything out of the ordinary going on. When my “dad” was in a mood my mom would take us and we’d go stay at a hotel because she wanted to should us. Anyways one day my mom told my dad she couldn’t keep doing this. I was 12. He said okay and we went out separate ways. He didn’t give up without a fight he threatened to kill us, he said he would get us from school hang us so he could watch my moms face when she saw her babies dead. We had to move in a safe house, a shelter for abuse victims. My dad got arrested for attempt at murder and grand theft, he stole from his girlfriend, who I should add was a prostitute, then tried to murder her. He was in jail for 2 years. Then he got moved to a rehabilitation home a little while ago. We went and visited him a last Sunday. It was the first time we had seen him in three whole years. All of my family has suddenly forgot what we’ve been through and are just jumping in his lap. I think is because he gets paid because he was medically discharged from the marines (he was in infantry 0311) so he has $45,000 just waiting to be spent. My mom has already told us she’s going back to him, it’s not fair, either we be poor with nothing or go back to him! He’s told us so many times “I’ve changed trust me” but I know damn well he hasn’t changed he’s just playing the “I’ve been through everything and I have learned” but I think that’s fucking horse shit. Why do we have to go back. My mom said she’s just going to online us in a different state. I seriously don’t want to go back to him. My mom’s so dumb, she’s like “well we have to and you shouldn’t be like that he’s your dad,” the fuck not he gave up he’s father privileges a long time ago. She’s under a spell. She claims well “we’ve been together this long there’s no point in divorcing now” I’m just so angry, and sad. Literally all of my siblings and me have depression or anxiety. Can y’all tell me your opinions? I don’t want to leave my mom but I sure as hell don’t want to go back to him.",15Aug2018,1
99,"My girlfriend of 2 months is pregnant. I met her at a strip club (she’s a stripper). She’s preggers for sure. She works at a high end club in the Bay Area and pulls in 25 bucks an hour plus tips. I also make 25 bucks an hour and I’m fresh out of college (graduated in may). I work at a big corporate law firm and will receive decent yearly raises, so finances shouldn’t be too bad although we live in the Bay Area. The problem is her family lives in Colombia and I don’t know how they will react. Also, my mom will be really upset about this, likely kick me out once the kid is born, but she wouldn’t like fuck me over or anything or lock me out of the family. She will probably help me out a lot actually. Idk if I’m ready for this though. I’m still a college party boy at heart. I drink heavily and do coke on the weekends and I’m not ready for the fun to be over. Idk I’m just really anxious about how my life is going to change.

100,"Hello,

My grandmother's boyfriend has had a series of strokes and now has a lot of issues with feeding himself, performing household chores, ect. My grandmother is in a wheelchair and does as much as she can for him, but she cannot fully care for him in his new physical state. They are both 85+ years old. They live near Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. They are also both on social security and have limited income.

Unfortunately I do not live in the same state as them and cannot physically be there to help and they do not want to relocate. Does anybody have any suggestions of in home care for people in the Las Vegas area? Or advise on maybe where to begin looking? Does social security offer programs at low or no cost? They are also religious, so I may reach out to the local churches and see if they offer any programs. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appriciated or if you could point me in a right direction with some advise Id be very greatful.

Thanks!",15Aug2018,1
101,"I know it’s long but please read if you think you can help a struggling youth on her own become an adult. I turned 18 just over a month ago. I’ve never gotten along with my overstrict, super religious, emotionally abusive family, but my parents and I recently got into another catastrophic fight. This time I walked out. I’m now living with my boyfriend, who also recently turned 18, and his more supportive family. However, I’m up a creek and struggling to know everything I now need to do for myself and what I should make sure I have set up for the future. Although they’re nice, I don’t have a relationship with his parents that I can ask them everything about life, so I’m coming here first. 

Here’s everything you should know about me. I’ve graduated high school, and I earned my CNA license during the year that I applied for jobs with. I start tomorrow. I’ve been driving, but was never given the freedom to get my license, so I need to set up an appointment even though I feel underprepared. I don’t have a car, and my rides to work will be half covered by my boyfriend’s family and half by Uber. I’m not sure how to find a car, but that’s pretty important. I also don’t know much about insurance...I was also never allowed a bank account, so I set one up and got a debit card, but the only money I have in it is what I got on the side as a typist for an author. College is not in the cards for this year as I’m going to focus on working full time and sorting out my life, but maybe next year I can go for something like LPN or RN if I’m feeling ambitious. 

I really need mentoring advice about what I should do in my situation. Taxes? Insurance? A doctor? Car maintenance? I have no adults to guide me and anything I should know at this age I don’t, thanks to a family that tried to limit my freedom and knowledge of the outside world as much as they could. I was homeschooled almost my whole life and don’t even have a network of friends to turn to. No family will talk to me, my boyfriend can’t always help me, and I’m just desperate for someone to help me sort my situation out. ",15Aug2018,2
102,"Ever since I was a child, I never felt desired by anyone but family, I never felt like anyone in my school or class would go out of their way to make sure I’m cared for, except this year, I got the affection I finnaly needed, I had a girlfriend who deeply cared about me and I’ve had a couple after that.


But both of those relationships have been ruined due to my love for affection, I would just constantly ask for affection and constantly try to cuddle becuase I wanted to feel desired.


It ruined me


How can I not desire love so much, I keep trying to feel relevant and even tho I’m loved and cared for I never feel like it’s enough, what can I do?",15Aug2018,2
104,"I don’t have friends. Many people say that but I actually don’t. I go straight home after work every night and I sit on the couch alone and no one texts or calls. My only friend is the cat. He’s not even my freaking cat. He’s my roommate’s. People just don’t like me. The same roommate has told me several times that people do like me. I always say they don’t. That’s not a self pity thing. It’s just true and I say it so others won’t. I don’t innately know what to do to make people like me. I accept that and I’m fine with it. I’ve learned to be OK on my own.

But I do have a former co-worker who I see once a week or so. I would say she is a friend. She has certainly been a friend to me anyway. I push people away when I feel like we’re getting too close and a few weeks ago I tried to, I don’t know, friend-break-up with her. Her response was “I love you and I don’t think less of you.” I understand now that God or the universe or whatever put her in my life so I would learn to just accept friendship and love. But I don’t know how to do that. The co-worker said a lot of other really nice things. All it did was make me uncomfortable and angry. She was just saying those things so she would feel like a nice person and get to think that she made my day. I’ve considered that maybe she really did mean them. But she couldn’t have because people just don’t like me. 

How do I stop thinking this way? I can’t just tell myself it’s true when I don’t honestly feel it is. How can someone totally change how they think and what they believe?",15Aug2018,1
105,"So, I’ll do a tldr; Been at a job for 3 years, been on minimum wage despite 2 certificates required for the job position, and forklift license, finally got a raise (seemed strenuous for the boss to give me)  but there’s a new job at a different liquor store that seems better in every way, what do? 

So I’ve been at this Liquorstore for 3 years now and have been a duty manager for the last 2, typically duty managers aren’t on minimum wage (16.50) here in New Zealand. 
I had to push for one and it seemed like my boss wanted to give me one but it was a pain to do so. 
There’s a job at a different store (is a different outfit franchise aswel) where the pay is the same but there’s more room to earn more before I would get another raise at my current one. 
The perks are better and there’s bonus pay for reaching sale goals at the end of the week/mo th, which we dont get here. 
They have way more staff so it won’t just be me and one other guy like it has been for years. 

You’d normally want a team of atleast 5 for a store our size but it’s me and (We’ll call him Bob) since I’ve started, if one of us leave the other has to work the whole week (72 hours) ect, but the place I can go already has 4 workers so there’s much less stress. 

My problem is, my current boss takes forever to find new staff, like he hardly tries. The store will be relocating in a month and it’s getting close to our busy season. 
I don’t want to leave and have poor ol’ Bob here by himself till they find someone to replace me, but I think the new job offers a better career path and room for improvement both in career wise and personally. 

I don’t want Bob to have to have the stress of the whole store on his shoulders (He’s in his 50s. But is an absolute work horse of a man) 

I’m torn between what’s best for me in the long run and not wanting to leave Bob by himself, he’s a great guy and a awesome workmate. 
 
I have a few days to decide, I don’t know why to do, it’s stressing me out :(

So if anyone is willing to help can you help with these questions...

1) How do you apply for and find scholarships?? Like do you look for them on the website of the University I want to go to? 

2) What are majors and minors??

3) What do I do for financial help?? 

4) Once I’m accepted, Am I allowed to go to the University before my first day to get to know the layout of the building so I’m not lost on the first day??

5) Will professors take the time for one-on-one/extra help/tutorials if I am struggling in class??

I have researched and looked up some of these things but I’m stressing and still confused. :(

107,"To keep things brief, I was walking down a busy street in a university district around 10:30 at night.  Some woman and her girl walks by me, and having barely any room, I deviated a bit but I think I brushed the kid a bit (barely touched her arm).  So, yeah, I get this scream from the mother saying ""you hit my kid!"".  And I looked at her, the kid is just there, not knowing what's going on .. obviously not the least bit hurt, and the mother is pulling a shit-fit on me in front of a crowd (I'm a large 45 year old man).  I've raised children myself and I'm the most gentle and soft spoken person you've seen - no joke.

So, this university kid (with his friends), starts to mouth off at me - calling me an asshole and other names, and trying to obviously look cool in front of his friends; the situation was perfect, what looks like a bully (me) and he's being some kind of Robin Hood.  I asked him if he's joking or something, and then I told him to look at the kid - and determine for himself if I ""hurt"" the kid.  So he just continues to say some B.S. - so I evaluated the situation in my head and decided to walk away.  I heard him say ""yeah that's it just keep walking... you f---g loser"".  And before you ask, I didn't apologize to the woman at this point because the whole situation was just chaos.  And if I apologized, it might actually prove to people that I actually hit this little runt.  (taking a kid on St. Catherine street at 10:30pm at night, um... wtf?)

My decision was based on the fact that I don't want to start a fight because - who knows, his friends may jump in.  I'll damage my laptop/cell phone I'm carrying .. and worse I'll get a criminal record for hitting someone.  I cannot - since I am a teacher and cannot teach with a criminal record.

I just feel so angry to let some 20 year old talk to me like that, and so agitated.  Can you offer advice because I can't even think straight at this point.  I feel in hindsight that I should have told the guy ""I will walk away now, but only because I don't want a criminal record or to spend the night in jail"".  But I felt that it would escalate.  I looked weak.

Why do you think he unblocked me but hasn’t said anything?

109,"Hello. I feel like i’ve ranted about this person too many times that i’ve become numb to the situation. Every time I talk about this issue with my mom I get fired up though, so I just needa talk. I just want to reassure myself that i’m not crazy and my friend is actually toxic and delusional. But basically, i’m a 17 yo asian girl, senior. She is a 16 yo asian girl, junior. She lives in the city while I live in the suburbs. Just some background. Both her and my parents are immigrants and so naturally they have different habits and traditions and beliefs, which is normal. My mom seems to have become americanized a bit because she hated her cultures lifestyle and thinking. But holy hell, my friends parents on the other hand are the most close minded, racist, sexist, homophobic, awful people i know. They always try to bring other people down and flaunt their own shit and talk about how great they are and how great their daughter is. They are hateful, judgmental people. My friend seemed to not have been affected by them much.. i thought. Now that she is growing up more, she picks up such habits as her parents. 

The main issue I have with her is that she never sticks up for me. I know it’s her mom, but the things that comes out of her mouth is awful. Let’s call my friend, Lisa.
“why is your face so spotty? Lisa’s face is so clear. Do you use anything for your face?”
“You have so much back acne!! Why don’t you use medication? Lisa’s back is so smooth and clear! She’s never gotten back acne...”
“Why don’t you brush your hair, it’s so messy..”
“You’re gonna wear 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 out in public? people are gonna laugh! you don’t have anything else to wear? Look at what Lisa’s wearing, she never wears anything like you.”
And SO MUCH MORE that i’ve probably forgotten because there is an endless list. And I honestly don’t give a rats ass about what her mom thinks of me. I really don’t. I’m going to live my life the way I want as long as i’m healthy. The thing that bugs me is my friend always just sits and watches. She does nothing. I’m sure it probably isn’t even because it’s her mom. It could be anyone, and she would say nothing or laugh even. Before though, her face was worse than mine is now. Her fashion, makeup, everything was average girl stuff. And her mom never dare tell anyone about it. But finally when Lisa is now doin her thing with her clear skin and cute fashion and shit, her mom praises the hell out of her and calls me ugly and shit. I can always hear the nasty stuff that she says when i’m not there too because her and my mom talk on a regular basis. My mom knows that she’s batshit crazy but just goes with it and ends up telling me everything. Can you imagine her mom asking MY mom “why won’t your daughter clean herself up more? Isn’t she afraid or embarrassed to go out? At least brush her hair..”

Another thing, she’s gotten so used to her parents bringing her ego up that she is now exactly that. She thinks she’s the shit and everyone else is “dumb” or ugly. “Dumb” in quotation marks because that was a nickname she gave me a while back. “Dumbass”, until i stood up for myself and told her to stop. Anyways, she legit is full of herself now. She always hints at how smart! she is because she goes to some well known high school. She called someone dumb for not taking ap world history as a sophomore. She asks me “why are your arms so hairy?” and proceeds to laugh. She flaunts her nonexistent body off and talks about it 24/7, and when I mention my body, she says “what boobs?..” implying that i have no chest, which isn’t a bad thing. But she just always wants to be better than me, and i guess having a chest= better? She also isn’t afraid to make fun of the fact that i have no friends. I’ll make a comment about how i’m excited for college and how i’ll go out with friends to dinner. She replies with “haha good one”. What the fuck??? what the fuck... and that’s all i have to say about that one. Even for college choices, she judges me. I want to go to UMASS Amherst, which in my opinion is a decent school. Her and her mom however (obviously) disagree and think it’s a school for dummies. “Boston University will be so easy, a no brainer.. Harvard might be a little difficult but it’s possible :))” What the fuck?? Yes BU may be possible, but it’s definitely not fucking easy. And i don’t wanna get too much into her grades and shit, but she definitely doesn’t appeal to colleges in terms of grades or extra curriculars. All they see is famous ivy league schools. Her mom literally said that if Lisa made it into Harvard, that she’d make a facebook and post about it and make her famous... An education is a damn education wherever college you go, but they only care about whether they can flaunt to their friends.

Back to the thing about her not ever standing up for me. I slept over at her apartment one night. Her mom and her sleep in one large  together because they have limited space. I slept on the same bed. It was summer and their apartment gets insanely hot, so they blast the ac. The room is now insanely cold. It’s time for bed and her mom throws me a bed sheet. I am confused for a second, thinking that they’ll sleep with no covers and gave me a bed sheet to use just incase i’m chilly. Then they whip out a thick ass comforter. I come to the realization that her mom expects me to sleep in that cold ass room with a thin ass bed sheet, while they snuggle up in a warm ass comforter. My friend didn’t even say anything either. It was like she didn’t even notice. What the actual fuck? That was when i swore to myself that i’d never go to their place ever again. It wasn’t too long ago too. 

Now to my actual question.. that i already kind of deep down know the answer to.. How do i go about this? She’s my only real friend that I talk to and feel 100% comfortable around. We grew up together and we do still have fun times. But without her I have nobody I can share opinions and interests and thoughts with. Whenever I have something serious I need to talk about, I always come to sites like these to vent and never anyone else, especially not her. Should I just wait it out until college. What happens once I get to college? Should I ditch her since I can make new friends? It’s difficult though because her family and mine are close. Even though my family hates them, we still are relatively close.
I’m afraid to spill everything to her and ruin a potentially life long friendship that may have been great. This post was partially to vent, partially for advice, mostly to hear people tell me how awful she and her mom really is and that i’m not crazy for thinking so. Thank u reddit pals

TLDR; my friends mom is awful, judgmental, everything bad. those characteristics have bled into my one and only friend. now she is awful just like her mother. ive been friends with her for my whole life and still have good times with her though which is why i’m stuck. should i ditch her? when? should i keep the friendship going? should i fade out once i get to college?",15Aug2018,1
110,"Hello, 

My son will be starting 2nd grade in a few weeks. His classmates last year went on a lot of playdates. He gets a long great with the kids in his class but he does feel left out because he doesn’t have a playdates. He has expressed numerous times through out the school year that he would love a play date and if I can give his classmates my number so I can talk to their moms. 

Here are a few issues my husband and I are having :

1) My husband and I work opposite shifts. He works early mornings and I work afternoons. I get our son ready for school and stay home with our toddler.(too expensive to pay for daycare here in New England)
Then in the afternoon, he waits for our son to be dropped off by the bus while I head to work. 
My husband does not feel comfortable going on a play date to another family’s home, since he will most likely be alone with another Mom. He is totally open to the idea of a play date at the park, since it’s a public space.  In fact, last year we set up a play dates with a classmate and his nanny at park. Unfortunately, my son was diagnosed with pneumonia the day before the play date and was out of school for a week. Shortly after the classmate moved to a new city due to his parents divorcing, so we never got to reschedule. 
Me not being available after school hours makes it so difficult to schedule with other parents. Every time I have a conversation with another parent during school events/birthday parties they are never available on weekends or they ask if I can go over their house after school. When I tell them I work in the afternoons they extend the invitation to my husband or they offer to pick up our son, and we can pick him up after the play date. (I am not comfortable with this. In my opinion he is too young).

Due to us living in a highly populated downtown area of our city, we get bused into a elementary school in a very upper middle class area of our town. Our town does this to keep the student to teacher ratio low. Which means someone who lives two streets away from me is placed in a different elementary school.  Some of the parents who live in the same area as us have honestly told me they are too tired after a long work day of work to go on play dates. I completely understand.——-&gt;

My family came from the Caribbean, so play dates do not exist. At this age, we hung out with direct family members. Kids hanged out outside of the classroom once they were in high school. My mom would drop me off inside my friends house so she can meet the other parent, and then pick me up within a few hours. My friends parent would do the same thing if a friend wanted to come over my house. And sleep overs? Forget about it!! This makes it even harder for me because it is not something I’m accustomed too. I understand friendships are important but I thought this would be something that came up in a few years. 

I am concerned by not having play dates It will cause him to loose out on a lot of friendships in the future. Teachers always tell me kids love him and I see that as well when we are at the park or during school functions/birthday parties. Unfortunately, he lacks confidence. This is due to him feeling different. His school is 80% white. He is mixed race. He looks like Michael B Jordan :). He excels academically at school.
Apparently he has been told boys are not supposed to do well in school. He also loves both “girl toys” and “boy toys”. (Using his words not mine) he has also told me he is embarrassed of this since he is afraid people will make fun of him, since not a lot of people like both things. (Again, his words not mine). My husband and I are constantly working/doing things that will grow his confidence. 

I would love hear from other parents! Positive or negative.

It’s making me lose my appetite and getting me sick. I set out personal goals everyday, to only fail them after I come back from my job in the afternoon.

112,"First time posting in a sub like this (hence the throwaway.) I moved to NYC immediately following college for an internship at a major show. That internship turned into a temporary job. That temporary job turned into freelance at a different company. And then the freelance turned into (you guessed it) another temporary job at a different company. 

By all accounts, I have had an extremely successful first year in the entertainment industry. I'm really proud of my resume and I've come so far since I first moved here. I started in craft services (essentially) and now get to work on creative. 

That being said, the impermanence is really getting to me. My stress levels have been sky high since I moved here. The instability has me constantly on edge wondering where I'm going to get my next paycheck. (I was unemployed for two months in the spring and it wrecked me). Since then, I've been throwing up regularly and my hair is falling out. Obviously, this set up really isn't working for me. 

I'm on the hunt for a permanent gig. But I'm wondering if this really is just par for the course for my industry and predicting the leapfrogging will continue for the foreseeable future. I refuse to give up on my dreams, so I'm wondering if anyone has had similar experiences they might be willing to share. Specifically, I'd love to hear how you learned to cope. 

TL;DR I'm stuck between needing to feel healthy and wanting to pursue my passions in a hyper competitive industry. Any strategies for managing both?",15Aug2018,3
113,"I have a deep issue... I'm a guy who exclusively falls for lesbians. It's led to some really sticky scrapes in the past, me dating girls and having them break me by revealing they'd been lying to me for months, etc.

I met this new girl online in a forum about ski racing, and we became fast friends. Like it started off with us just talking about ski racing, but she turned out to be a cool person and we talk almost every day. I'm an internet safety nut, so yes, she proved to me she is who she says she is.

She's so cool that I totally have a crush on her. She's smart, funny, interested in all the same stuff as me, and she's honestly the kindest most genuine person I know. Her friends kind of suck, and so do mine sometimes, so we really glommed on to each other. She also lives 2 states away and is gay.

I need a way to lose hope. Like a) LDR's suck and b) SHES GAY. Except then she'll tell me she's going to spend a month where I live, and that SHES ACTUALLY BI but just tells people she's gay because she likes girls more. It's stuff like that that just kills me because I just wanna ask her out but I know thats an AWFUL idea.

117," Just got back from a trip I did with some other kids. Everything was amazing there, and I got through a lot of problems that I didn't even think were possible to fix. For example, I didn't have any friends before due to awkwardness and anxiety, I felt boring as shit, I fucking hated myself before and felt like everyone else hated me too, but all that shit got pretty much completely better on that trip. I finally felt really happy for once and felt like I was actually a cool person with adequate social skills. I had confidence and stopped thinking that everything I did was wrong or that everyone does everything better than me.

Now that I'm back though, all that's gone to shit. I was hoping that I could always have that frame of mind that I had on the trip but I'm forgetting it real quick and going back to the old sad me. I think it's got a lot to do with my twin sister. When I arrived at the airport after a month without seeing her, she acted like the whole process of coming to the airport to meet me was a big headache for her and she even yelled at me on the way back for something small. It's especially sad because I was looking forward to seeing her again for some reason. That's just an example but she's repeatedly called me a bitch and annoying and said that the wishes that I'd go away in the time since I've come back. I've literally been back for a day.

Every time I'm around her, it's like all the stuff I learned is being undone and that frame of mind is slipping away. Every time I get into that nice frame of mind where talking to people isn't like walking on shattered glass and coming out of my room isn't like climbing Everest, I'm determined to keep it, but I never have been able to. I think it's because during those times, I had a lot of friends to hold me up and whenever I lost it it was because \*speaking\* with my sister is like walking on broken glass- I never know what's a bad thing to say and when I say something bad all I can do is apologize profusely rather than forget it- and then that carries over to everyone else until I'm too scared to have a normal conversation because I'm trying to think of every possible way that the other person can interpret what I'm saying so I don't say something wrong. That awkwardness means that I don't have any friends and all I do is sit in the house and the only one I have to keep me company is her.

It should be known that she probably feels the same way about me as I feel about her.

  
I want to keep riding this wave of positivity and never feel like I'm useless and horrible again but she's fucking it up for me.   
I feel like having friends fixed most of my problems, but now that I'm with my sister, the awkwardness is coming back and I feel like I'm going to lose them again. I've tried talking about problems like these with my friends so they can understand me a bit better, but without fail, that's always bred more awkwardness. More than anything though, I just don't want to forget about my self worth.

126,"Hello guys this is a long post.. I thank anyone who can help me shed some light on this situation or offer some advice. I never thought I would be posting something on Reddit for help but here I am. I have been under a lot of stress in my home life lately and today has been the tipping point. I was punched in the face for no reason today by my older brother who we have this long history of getting into fights. His ""reason"" for punching me in the face was because to him me walking behind him and nudging him for me to pass was enough for him to flip out and assault me, spit on me, and call me names. We rarely get along and my parents think we are both always picking fights with one another when out of all the fights we've been in he's always been the instigator and he tells everyone that I'm the one who starts the fight.  I jsut found out today that after all the fights since 2016 he's been calling the police and files a report saying how I started the fight even though he's always the one who instigates first by pushing me and calling me names to get me to fight him then turning it around and saying I was the one who hit him first. Today after he punched me for literally no reason I called the police and they came and talked to us but only gave him a citation. And when the female officer that came to our house was talking to him, he was going on about how he's made multiple reports on me for battery and assault, how I don't pay rent(recently moved back in with my parents) and how I'm always an asshole to him when I'm not! All of the fights he reported started because he was pushing me and calling me names witch led me to get to angry In witch I tried to hit him. It's like that bully that picks and picks on you and you finally snaps except this bully is my brother and he knows how to push my buttons. 

All the police said to me was that we would go to court and my brother can choose(if the judge agrees) to show the judge all the reports he's made against me on the fights we've had in the past and I was told that the judge will probably dismiss the case after seeing the reports. My brother was even threatening to sue me and get me kicked out of my parents house after court with all the reports and was telling me that I'm going to be homeless. Even though he was the one who antagonized all of them. I never just walk up to him and start beating on him like he did with me today. And I've never filed reports because I was just to emotional and even scared to do so because it's my **brother.** I want to ask anyone who might know, if he's made these claims that aren't true in these police reports that I was the one who antagonized the fights when he's the one always pushing me, calling me names, bullying me and I get fed up with it and swing If I am in danger to actually facing charges? Would the tables turn on me and would I be the one facing charges just because of these claims he's made? I have no real evidence supporting this besides my own memory and today report on the assault. It's just so shitty right now because even though I talk to my parents about this no one believes me and they all think we both pick fights and fight blah blah. No wants to back me up because they think I'm the one instigating them too when In reality it's me getting so pissed off at being bullied I snap and that looks like I'm the one starting the fight. I'm sorry if I sound emotional or like I don't have a lot of evidence backing up these claims. I'm just so fed up lately it's like every couple of months we get into an altercation and I'm always seen as an antagonizer. Right now I'm working on moving out once I save up enough money. I live in California so it's going to be expensive for a 21 year old but I want to move to a different state. I'm currently looking up the laws about this but I haven't found anything that would go about dealing with false claims on assault.

128,"Hi guys and I am in a particular situation where I just don't know what to do.

I am seeking advice for what to do with my current Spectrum Internet service. I am disabled, on a fixed income and cannot afford my internet anymore at the price of $45 a month. I know that doesn't seem like much but the fact is that I can no longer afford it.

Spectrum says I do not qualify for Spectrum Internet Assist Program which is offered for $15 a month ($30 cheaper), ONLY because I am a current Spectrum customer. I never upgraded from the old Time Warner Cable service I had so I had told them I am not a customer of Spectrum but they won't have any of it because since TWC was bought out I'm a Spectrum customer by default. My low income qualifies me for the $15 Internet Assist Program however since I am a current customer I cannot get it.

I would have to cancel service for 30 days and then re apply for service. The thing is I cannot go without having high speed internet for 30 days. I wish I could but I simply cannot. My kids use it for homework, streaming and gaming, and I have my own homework, bills and emails to take care of online. I've seen some odd internet services I could maybe sign up for during the 30 days but I am not sure of which would be the best for the limited money I have. Some plans are 1GB or 10GB and our household uses up to 150GB sometimes in a month (3 kids and myself). I just don't know what to do and am not too literate in any of these departments.

Some helpful information: I live in Western New York

EDIT: I CALLED SPECTRUM and they cant do anything on their end, even asking a manager in store. I need help please.

Where do I sign up for 1 month high speed internet for a month only (no contract)?

Please help me, thank you in advance to any kind souls!",15Aug2018,0
129,"Hi everyone. I am here to hopefully gain some insight about how I can improve my relationship with women. I am an almost 22 year old, heterosexual woman, and have always had issues with how I relate to and interact with women. I definitely believe my issues stem from my relationship mother; there has been many times in my life when I had to act as the ""parent"" in our relationship, as she is very emotionally immature as a result of her own childhood, and while I sometimes feel sorry for her, she can still be extremely frustrating at times. Because i had spent a lot of my childhood confused by my mother's behavior, I have developed an anxiety towards having to deal with her, especially because the more I allow her in my life, the clingier she becomes. Although my mom definitely loves me, while growing up (and still today) she really only would give me ""advice"" and ""praise"" on how to groom and make-up myself, and would say things that a mother just shouldn't prioritize caring about if I left the house without looking perfectly put together. She never had a long-term plan for me or my brother, such as informing herself about schools, being any kind of emotional support (she was the total opposite), etc., which is one of the things that just makes me believe that she had children to have someone love her, rather than really, thoroughly care about their long-term wellbeing. Although these issues may all be related to her significant emotional immaturity and not purposefully destructive, it has still had an immense impact on our relationship and who I have become. I definitely believe it has made me feel uncomfortable when it comes to relating to women.
I remember when I was about 13-14 years old, I had a significant depressive stage and would say really rough stuff about other girls, calling them whores/sluts/etc (to my friends privately online about other girls, but still), just generally really disgusted with female nature. Throughout my teenage years, I would see girls interact with each other and wonder how they could possibly be so comfortable around each other. Today, while I have definitely matured *so* much - i'm not consciously bothered by girls/women much at all - I definitely still have very deep, sub/unconscious issues with women. I am rarely/never the first to speak/introduce myself when meeting them if I am with anyone I already know, I just don't feel like I can be totally comfortable around them or form close relationships to them, I feel very self-conscious around them, etc. This wouldn't bother me so much if I didn't want to become a mother in the next 10 years or so. The *last* thing I want is to have some unnecessary, awkward emotional roadblock between me and my future daughter(s), and perpetuate this behavioral pattern. I want to raise my children to be as mentally, emotionally, and physically healthy as I possibly can. I do not want to think this negative mindset into materialization when it comes to my relationship with my daughter. I don't even know how to approach this, though, because at this point it's almost like I would much rather avoid having such an intimate relationship with a female, but I know this is totally unhealthy and I don't want to live my life like this. I feel like I could definitely mature even further if I work on this facet of myself. Any insight, advice, anything would be so appreciated. I realize this may warrant seeking professional advice at some point, but I figured i'd see what anyone had to say here as well.  ",15Aug2018,2

138,"For reference, I am a 17F going to be a senior in high school.
I know that you meet more friends in college, etc etc, that high school isn’t everything, but I just think that in this situation it can end kinda messy so any advice is appreciated greatly. Especially because I’m stressing a bit much about this, more than I should but 
Basically, one of my best friends has been friends with me since middle school. When high school came, she went to a different one, but our friendship strengthened despite that. We texted pretty much everyday and got closer, etc.
In sophomore year, she dealt with drama from friends and more from a really bad relationship. So in junior year, she transferred over to my school to be with me. I was more than excited because we haven’t been to school together for like 3 years, and obviously so many things have changed so I was excited.
But throughout the year, it was little things that caught my attention and made me uncomfortable. One example is how she was transferring in, and she suddenly got a bit egocentric (?? Is that even the right word I’m sorry) but basically started talking about how many people were gonna invite her to parties, how since she was the new girl everyone would be talking about her, and how popular she was gonna be and I honestly thought it was really weird. So, after being really anxious, I confessed to her that I thought her attitude was really narcissistic, etc., and she apologized for it. But a few weeks later, she then brought it up and started being angry that I said that because in her words, “I don’t think I was being an attention seeker but anyways”. I ignored the message, basically left it on read, but the next day the topic changed, etc, and it was fine
Like I said, it was little things and idk if I’m being a big bitch about it but basically it just kind of seemed like she victimized herself a lot. For example, she wouldn’t pay attention at all in class by dozing off or doing other things on her laptop, and then ask about homework or what we did in class, and then if misfortunes came, talked unnecessary shit about the teachers. Other times, it would be the classmates. Other times, she would be extremely narcissistic, and because of this we had a few arguments because she refused to step off her high horse. I tried to ignore these things, and tried to kindly be as honest as I could here and there but it just seemed like it would keep happening. 
In the span of one year as well, she managed to kind of make our entire class grade uneasy towards her. She didn’t make any other friends besides my other best friend, and she is not antisocial or is socially awkward whatsoever, she’s way more outgoing than me. But already, many people in our class grade did not like her. And it just made me kind of overthink with all those times she had drama with her ex friends in sophomore year. I just kind of keep on overthinking that is she victimizing herself more than it really is? And especially because I wasn’t there to witness these events and she’s the only one telling me, something else could’ve happened or maybe she switched the story to appeal to her side, I don’t know. And especially because I could witness these situations myself, there were times that I didn’t like her behavior. But it was basically things like these that made me kind of see things differently.
One of the last straws I guess was that I found out recently that my other best friend didn’t like her. My other best friend is extremely kind, genuinely a good soul, and is friendly with everyone in our class grade. She doesn’t even talk shit about my friend to me or to anyone else, she avoids talking shit in general about people, unlike my friend. So to me this kind of meant a lot? And especially because we ended up talking about it and we agreed on the same points. 
So I guess after this whole shit of an essay, basically, I don’t know if my best friend is toxic for me. And I think the reason why I haven’t left her yet is because I know she’s not a terrible person, I know there’s good in her and I’ve seen it, but also because she tends to be really sad about why people leave her and say that she needs me and I’m the only friend she’s got left, etc. And part of me is like “Hey she’s misunderstood” and the other part is “Maybe people leave her for a reason.” So I’m stuck in between these two and I don’t really know what to do with our friendship.
The thing is she’s transferring back to her old school for the senior year, and I feel like an extreme bitch for saying this but I’m glad? Because in all honesty I do need time to think about this and especially because I get 2 solutions: either be close with her still and just try to do what I can, if it means being more brutally honest with her or something, or I can use this to drift away from her and eventually completely let her go. I’m honestly prepared for both situations but at this point I’m just really overthinking things and I don’t know what to do. ",15Aug2018,1

140,"My first semester in college was a tough one. I took macroeconomics, trigonometry, a rough history class and english.
I would spend a lot of time in the study hall, and the stress was overwhelming... Even though I gave it my absolute best, I nearly had a heart attack (not literally) when finals week came around.
I barely had a 2.5 gpa. And it was literally just 12 credit hours... Somehow, I feel like I could’ve done better, but it was such a heavy load for me at the time, I was scared.

Fast forward to this year.. I had all A’s next semester. I took a lighter load and learned from my mistakes. Became a student ambassador, gotten an easier job that didn’t stress me out too much. Took less hours at my job, etc.

Now I’m on my third semester. It’s literally next week. I have my schedule set up where I take a chemistry class, psychology, sociology, computer science and a gym class.

In the back of my mind I feel like I’m ready for it. I get to finish school on time if I do.

141,"(TL;DR on bottom above question) Context: when I was in elementary school, I was bullied constantly by a kid (let's call him ""Eric"". -not his real name-) Eric mainly bullied me in 3rd-6th grade. -Im Asian american- Eric would find me during recess and ask me how I could walk with my eyes closed, then would proceed to call me ugly, and take off so I couldnt fireback an insult. This wasn't that bad, apart from the mildly racist jokes. I was impressionable at that time.

Then things started to escalate in 6th grade. That was the year I got my first pair of glasses. When I went to school with them for first time. That's when he started to call me ""four eyes"" and other ""fun"" nicknames. It got really bad and started to affect me on how I saw my physical appearance. He called racist names, and even said ""Why do you need glasses? Your eyes are always closed"". After 6th grade it died down. But I already hated myself. I hate how I look and sound. 

I then had low self confidence/self esteem. Whenever people complimented me, I would nervously chuckle and thank them, while inside my head I would think they were lying and just trying to be sincere sounding. 

Nowadays, whenever people insult me, whether jokingly or purposely, I don't get bothered because I already accepted it as a fact even if it was a lie. Whenever my friends see or hear me get insulted they would ask if I'm okay. I would just shrug it off and say ""I'm used to it"" or ""eh, it's true."". They would have wide eyes and be mildly concerned. 

(TL;DR) I got called racist things in school which made me have low self esteem and self confidence, which now whenever I get insulted im fine with it, and whenever im complimented I feel awkward and lied to. 


How do I explain it to people that it doesnt bother me when I get insulted? I know it sounds stupid but honestly, id rather explain it to them instead of them thinking I'm crazy.",15Aug2018,1
142," I could mention that I'm aiming to be a sysadmin for some reason, but  I'm forgoing university and am deciding to teach myself about IT,  especially since my dad works in it and he could give me advice.  However, he advised me to pick either Linux or Windows, since those are  the most commonly used operating systems in the enterprise world. I know  it would be easier to get a job without a degree with Windows because  of the army of certifications that one could get from learning it. (A+,  Office Specialist, the MCSA, etc). Although there seem to be several  Linux certs from companies like Oracle and RedHat but they seem to  mostly be for engineers rather than admins. What would you recommend?  


Also,  I am aware about the privacy atrocities Windows 10 commits (and that it  has even been designed to do this!) and I am very concerned about  privacy, but there seem to be enough ways to lock it down and I could  always run Whonix in it anyway. Also yes, I am aware it's closed source  but the term ""open source"" is often thrown around as a gimmick meant to  make something sound better than it really is, much like the labeling of  foods as ""organic"". If you ask a person why they use Firefox, they will  always mention that it's ""open source"", even though most of them don't  even know what that means, and the ones who do don't take advantage of  it anyway. I only have a cursory knowledge of programming and can only  write basic Java and cannot read most code so I wouldn't be able to  audit any OS I use anyway. Despite the privacy enthusiasts recommending  it, Linux and similar systems are a huge web of trust and a lot of times  your privacy is lost through programs and browsers. Not to mention the  systemd/pulseaudio backdoors.

generally i am a pretty happy, normal person. but occasionally i’ll get these episodes when i’ll gl deep into thought and eventually come out realizing that there is something wrong with me and to be honest it’s pretty terrifying to think that i could be mentally or emotionally unstable. the “episodes” if you will, pass by the next day.

144,"So I'm currently at home and about to go to university in about a month. My living situation has been less than ideal: my parents are unsupportive and often quite manipulative. I want to move out and live on my own (my university is far from home) and after talking to my parents, they seemed to be supportive. 

My father offered to help pay for my rent during the summertime (I am going to take summer classes) and my parents will help pay for my tuition during the school year. As of now, though, I'm on rough rocks with my parents. I had recently been having these nagging issues (tinnitus, sick for 2 weeks, etc., etc.,) and I have only received criticism and have been questioned by my own family. No one believes that I am even sick or does not care. When I ask for help, I only get told to shut up or I am ignored. My own brother even asks if I am sick and when I call for him, I only get silence. I have had a history with my family, and its not a very fun one. My father is alcoholic, my mother is manipulative, and my brother (who I cared for when he was a child) ignores me and often questions me on almost everything (recently, he questioned if I was even sick, and mind you, I practically fed him, helped him shower (yes), and even helped him with growing up problems (like his diaper)). One time, my father, mother, and brother all came and kicked my door down while I was sleeping and I got yelled at for not registering for a national exam (the ACT), which the registration deadline was in 4 weeks. On fourth of July, my father utterly ignored me and when I asked he proceeded to yell at me. Recently, I had a mental breakdown and I began to bawl my eyes out, only to receive criticism, questions of integrity, statements of how I neglected to appreciate my fathers and mothers efforts, and questions about my manhood (you name it, anything they could have thought of to yell at me for, they did). There is a lot more to be said about the past, and quite frankly I do not want to go over more and more details about the past, as it only makes me more frustrated. If it helps, I can update this post, but I really do need some advice on how to proceed.

Right now, I need some advice on how to proceed with this. As I said, I will be going to university in about a month and I need to start saving money to pay for myself while I live near the school during the summertime. I have had thoughts about getting a job during the school year, and I think this is a very possible option, considering the night time is practically open (my classes end at about 4pm). Quite frankly, I am lost. I only received criticism and, really, bullying since I came back from school. I really don't know why my parents want to treat me this way. Sure I might have called them a name or two (in which, I was screamed at by everyone for literally 2 hours for saying one bad word at my mom) or said some bad statements, but it wasn't uncalled for. I was practically provoked by my alcoholic, abrasive, and threatful father or manipulated by my mother. Sure I might come off as ""not seeing the other person's point of view"", but at this point, I don't want to, and hopefully this is clear why. I need advice on my current situation and how to go through with this. I have had really strong anxiety and emotional distress. I really hate my situation right now. Thank you.",15Aug2018,1

At my age, in my opinion, it is impossible to find romantic love in my state: physically unattractive, no career.

157,"A little background: 

I am severely underweight and a picky eater, I have been to countless doctors and dieticians. Their advice was to get myself to normal weight THEN focus on introducing new foods into my diet. 

We are a family of 8, our mother has 7 children in total. Oldest is 28M, youngest is 14M. I am 21F.

Although I am a picky eater, there are a lot of different meals I like to eat, I do like what my mum cooks sometimes but not all the time. So this is why I’ve tried to do my own food shopping, with my own money. 

This hasn’t gone to plan, I buy things, let everyone know what is mine, they eat it. I label it, they still eat it. I buy extras because I know they wants some too, gone before I even get to eat it. This bothers me so much because being underweight has caused a lot of health problems for me, at the moment I only eat one proper meal a day. I also end up spending so much money on takeaway, which I don’t even want to do, just to make sure I eat enough. 

The siblings that usually steal the food are overweight, and if I’ve being honest, have some kind of overeating problem. My mum will go food shopping (enough food to last a week) on a Monday, and the house will be empty again by Wednesday. 3 siblings overeat, but because my other siblings aren’t picky eaters it doesn’t affect them as much. 

It has gotten to the point where my mum will buy things specifically for me, or things she knows I like and will hide it.

I don’t care that they finish the food my mum buys, it’s for everyone. But it bothers me when my doctors are telling me to buy my own food, and *that* gets eaten. I usually keep the cupboard food I buy in my room, but my main meals are usually in the fridge/freezer so it is very hard to hide. 

An light example of this is I put a dozen water bottles in the fridge for everyone on hot days the night before, by 12pm they’re all gone. So I started hiding a few for myself instead, people find them and take them instead of putting bottles in the fridge for themselves. 

Please give me advice! I’m so frustrated

158,"When I was young, maybe between the age of 7-9, I’m not sure my exact age, I was sexually abused by a friend of my parents. (He’s no longer in their life) 
I remember it very clearly. Except my age. I remember who he was, how I got it to stop, the game I was playing on the Nintendo 64 while he did it, what he told me, I remember his smell. I remember everything. 

I found him on Facebook a few months ago after years of searching for him. He had gotten arrested for having weed on him and I saw his mugshot on a website and I had been spelling his name wrong. 

After I found him I added him and we were friends on Facebook for a while before I unfriended him. Two nights ago I messaged him. I asked him why he sexually abused me and that’s all I said. He read the message but never responded. 

He did something to me that has caused a lot of long term problems with me. I just want to know why he did it. I don’t want to keep on dwelling on it. I want to move on. I believe knowing his reasoning will help me with the process of moving on. I’m 20 now. I need to move on so I can live my life. I think about what happened everyday. 

How can I get him to respond ? 
I need to see what he’s been thinking this whole time and then cut him 100% out of my life. 
I almost want to threaten him with taking charges out on him so he will respond. But I don’t have the money or time for that. 

Any idea what I can do? It’s almost like I can’t grow up. I can’t face being an adult. I cry when I think about growing up. Even though I live on my own and hold a job.

163,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 7 months now and to say the least she does not like my best friends wife. This is a long story sorry about the long read but I really need advice on how to deal with this situation... 

When my girlfriend and I started dating my best friends wife (let’s call her Pam) called me while at 1030pm while my best friend was out of town. I was hanging out with my girl and I looked at the phone confused as to why she would be calling me because she has never done this before. (Please know that she is in no way trying to flirt or get with me). Anyways, I look at my phone and I decide not to pick up. Of course, my girlfriend asks me to pick up (in a suspicious wtf is she doing calling you way). So I pick up because if I didn’t it would look even worst. Anyways, I pick up and she just shoots the shit with me... asks me about my day, talks to me about a concert that we are planning on going to and we hang up. My girl was not happy because she doesn’t understand why she doesn’t call her husband to talk instead of me. I get her position, because if I was in her shoes and one of her girlfriends husband calls her at 1030 at night I’d be confused and livid as well. So that put a bad taste in her mouth. We of course argued and we made up and she gave her the benefit of the doubt. 

Then we go to a concert. She is there with her husband (my best friend). As the night is progressing and we are drinking she (Pam) blows me a kiss as she walks to go to the bathroom telling us she will be right back. My gf sees and is annoyed. She again tells me this girl has no boundaries and she finds it weird that her husband allows her to act the way she does. Mind you this she was pretty drunk and was being loud as well. (This is Pam). 

Then about a month later we go to a friends party on a boat and Pam gets drunk again and her and some degenerate piece of shit that I don’t like start disrespecting my gf and me. I didn’t react in the moment because I was in shock and alcohol was involved and didn’t want to make a scene, because god knows what would have happened with alcohol in the mix. The following day I told her (Pam) off and that degenerate fuck. Pam told me that I told her to shut up to which she was unhappy about and that’s why she cussed me out. (She apologized for being loud but not for cussing me out she said that she is sorry if she embarrassed me. ) that degenerate fuck I told him off and don’t care about his apology it means nothing to me. 

Now my girlfriend is having obvious issues with her but Pam is my best friends wife and they won’t be going anywhere... I am posing this question my reddit community... what do I do should Pam do something disrespectful? For instance she blows a kiss at me again or is disrespectful? 

My girl was upset that I didn’t say anything in the moment to her and that degenerate... but I’m not a confrontational person and with alcohol involved I didn’t think it was a good idea. I did however end up standing up for us the following day. She wants to know that I will defend her and myself should it happen again... how do I approach it especially considering it’s my best friends wife. Please note that my buddy has no issue with Pam’s behavior. He thinks it’s normal. So I’m thinking that if I say something to him he may get upset and make me be the bad guy. I don’t know what to do... thanks.

I started with using google image search for models. but that well dried up fast as most of the images where not great visual quality. I don't want to use pornstars. those models, while objectively attractive, are not realistic figures. I even had a few friends let me use them as models for my sketches but that is always a super awkward conversation.  where can i go for cheap (free) models for figure drawing?",15Aug2018,4
172,"This has a long-ass back story, so let me just start..

I was good friends with a girl, Amy, since 2nd grade. We’ve always been close and never had any sort of falling out, but I know that she always has some kind of social drama surrounding her, but I was mostly the friend that she would vent to about this drama. It’s never included me, so it never really crossed my mind that she could actually be kind of a bad person.

Fast forward to our freshman year: She meets her first serious boyfriend, Rainn. Rainn, Amy, and I were all very good friends and hung out in the same group. She was head-over-heels crazy about him...and I mean, crazy. They dated straight though senior year, but not without drama of course. Graduation made things rocky for them. Amy went out of state for college, Rainn stayed in town. Amy wanted the “typical” college experience, meaning she wanted to fuck other dudes (she told me this later). She broke up with Ryan so she could explore other options and live her life for the first time in 4 years without him.

They were broken up for a year. During this time, Rainn expressed an interest in me and we eventually hooked up - but we didn’t have sex! It was just a playful thing and Rainn is (truly) one of the most honest and kind people that I know. I think I would have liked to explore things further with him, but about 2 days after I hooked up with him, I got a text from Amy... She asked if I hooked up with him and I had answered honestly. She asked if I liked him and I said I sort of do, but I was willing to completely shut it down if it meant saving my friendship with Amy. She said she would appreciate that, so that was it. I actually wasn’t mad at Amy because I really appreciated her honesty and I liked that she was straight up with me! She also didn’t let it come between us which was cool.

After I cut things off with Rainn, we remained friends but hung out a lot less. He hooked up with other girls since he was single. In later years, I found out that Amy had HUGE grudges against these girls that Rainn hooked up with. It was a big red flag for me because she would talk shit about these girls to me, but she didn’t hate me for doing the same exact thing? I just thought maybe it didn’t matter because our friendship was that strong!

After a year of being apart, Amy decided that she couldn’t find anything better so she and Rainn got back together. She had hooked up with many guys during her time apart from him, but she still had grudges against the girls that he was associated with.

So! Amy transfers to a school in-state and her and Rainn are strong as ever. Fast forward to 2016: Amy and I both need room mates. We’re both attending the same school. We sign a lease together. During this time, Rainn and I became close again because we were spending a lot more time together through Amy (and he basically lived at our apartment). Rainn even was keeping some of his furniture at our place because he was living at his parents’ for a bit.

2017: Amy starts telling me she is not happy with Rainn. She’s disappointed that he is not ready to propose after so many years of dating, etc. She wanted him to “grow up” and “get a real job” but was struggling so much with being so comfortable with him and basically dating her best friend. But she knew she wasn’t happy. I was 100% on her side for anything. And I made a very conscious effort to understand what she was going through and keep it discreet so that Rainn didn’t suspect that he was possibly going to get his heart broken.

I came home from work early one day and heard Amy having - very loud - sex with.... not Rainn. I did my investigations and found a Starbucks cup in the garbage that said “Isaac”. The same Isaac who had been coming over about once a week to study for the GRE with Amy. I leave the apartment before she knows I was there.

Another night, Amy comes home absolutely wasted and thinks I’m not home. She has VERY loud sex in her room and then I realize that there was also another girl in her room. They move to the bathroom. Yes, people... She’s having a threesome in my apartment.

SO. I text Amy a few days after the threesome and I simply express concern: “Hey girl, I know that things have been super tough on you with all this Rainn stuff, but I just want you to know that I’m here for you and I have your back no matter what. I know that breakups can be scary and you might feel like you don’t know what to do, so please let me know if you need anything.” She responds with a veryyyy surface-y text like, “Aww! Thanks!! Everything’s good though.”

At this point, I’m kind of hurt that she didn’t confide in me.. I know it’s hard to tell someone that you’re cheating on your boyfriend, but come on! She was doing it in our apartment where we both live and pay rent! It’s unfair and rude to conduct this risky behavior where I could very easily find out. And on top of that, I’m expected to keep it from my good friend Rainn. I’m totally down to be “team girl” on this one, but she wasn’t giving me many reasons to.

After a lot of her own personal drama, she finally breaks it off with Rainn but never tells him that she spent the last 6 months cheating. But it was a weight off my chest because it was never my business to tell him, but now I didn’t feel obliged to.

After the breakup, Amy barely spent any time at home and I knew it was because she was staying at Isaac’s most of the time. That’s fine because I was a little salty at her for lying to Rainn and not even opening up to me. One day, she texts me and says “Hey so if you haven’t noticed I’ve been basically living at Isaac’s, so is there any way we could find a sublet for the apartment?”

We had 8 months left on our lease. I was in the middle of a stressful semester at school. The last thing I needed to be doing was looking for a sublet. I also never signed up to live with a stranger. I signed up to live with HER. Just because she has a bf doesn’t mean she can skip out on a lease. She also clearly doesn’t think about others in this situation: Who is interested in moving into an apartment for 8 months? We also live in Minnesota and the winters here are brutal. She was looking for someone to move in January 1st. Not a smart move.

She continued to pay her half of the rent but left me with  all the additional bills and utilities. That’s fine, I guess, since I’m the only one using them... but our Comcast bill is like $120 a month. I was not equipped to be spending that kind of money without splitting it with anyone. She also left all her shit in her room and didn’t once think of maybe offering to let me move into the bigger room.

During this time, Rainn hits me up to hang out and catch up (also, he wanted me to bring him some of his toiletries from the apartment). I go to his house after work one night and I bring my coworker, Mary, who I already had plans to hang out with that night.

Turns out, Mary and Rainn really hit it off, and about 8 months later, they start dating. They are still dating now (9 months strong).

But before I get to that, Amy gets wind that I hung out with Rainn and immediately assumes that we hooked up. Like we were just waiting for the day. I was so offended that she went straight to that conclusion. And she had no right to be mad either way! She was cheating on him. But, if you hadn’t noticed, Amy has a strange hold over Rainn and likes to control him even when they’re not together.

FINALLY WE ARE TO THE PRESENT DAY:

Mary and I now live together (funny how I can’t escape Rainn even if I wanted to haha). And it took me everything I had to get Amy to move her shit out of the apartment. She even asked if me and Mary wanted her old furniture. Bitch, no! Then, she didn’t come by on the last day of our lease to clean the apartment. I scrubbed, dusted, and vacuumed my ass off to ensure we get our security deposit back. Amy wasn’t there for any of it. In fact, she was in Hawaii with Isaac for vacation. I know she can pay for an expensive vacation because she got an amazing job after college. But she can’t afford to pay me for any bills.. hmm...

After all the shit that this girl has put me through, I remained gracious and kind to her because I didn’t want to break any terms of this lease. I am so annoyed and angry at her because all this stress has put me in one of the most depressive years of my life. She has no idea the impact of her actions and she is extremely selfish.

Two weeks after the move-out, and also on Mary’s birthday, I get a text from Amy asking if I wanted to hang out and catch up sometime! I know her game. She just wants to clear her conscience at this point. She knows she did me dirty and she wants to make sure I’m not talking shit about her to anyone. So I simply did not respond because I didn’t feel I needed to. And now she’s deleted and blocked me from every social media outlet. Obviously, I care because I wrote this epic novel. But I really don’t know what is the “mature” way to act about this.

Another thing, Amy won’t stop texting Rainn and his family and telling them how she hopes they’re doing well, blah blah blah. And I really think it’s not a good look to be texting your ex and his family. But I know Amy wants to get into Mary’s head because she wants it to seem like “they have sooo much history”.

Ugh idk what to do about this bitch. And do I give her the security deposit back? If you’re one of the few people who read this through, please give me some advice. :(",15Aug2018,1

178,"I am currently living on my own as a 26 year old male who is also applying to medical school this cycle. I was under a lot of stress lately (app deadlines, high expectations from my Asian tiger parents, got a speeding ticket, etc). The temptation was too strong recently so I decided to smoke with my roommate (2nd time) who is 3 years younger than myself. This happened 2 days ago.

So anyway, I got really high and I felt as though my roommate was recording me via snap chat as a way to mock me or bring me down. He attempted this the first time I smoked with him when I first moved in last year. When I confronted him about it at the time, he told me he was about to but eventually changed his mind. (I took his word for it because he actually showed me his phone) This time around, he kept trolling me by aiming his phone towards me. I told him to stop and to respect my boundaries and simply left the room. Looking back, I regret not asking him if I can check his phone.

I made an executive decision that night to never smoke again with my roommate. I simply do not trust him. He's like a really insecure man child who even talks shit behind his own friends to me, which I am quite sure he's going to do the same to me. I'm such a fucking idiot for smoking with such a person. You guys may think this is a trivial matter, but I care about this a lot because I happen to live in a county in which everyone knows something about one another. It's truly a small world and I don't want my reputation as a doctor ruined by this one mistake down the road. I know I shouldn't care about other people's perception about me but this is a big deal to me because your reputation as a doctor will help you immensely in your career. I don't want to be perceived as the doctor that once smoked with a low-life. I simply don't want to associate myself with him any longer (even though he knows quite a lot about me)

I’ve been on and off again depressed for 4-5 years. The last time I tried to get help ( 3 years ago ) my mother took me to a behavioral analyst. She wasn’t a mental health professional and the topic of mental health never occurred in our sessions! 

 Since then I’ve never brought up my mental health to an adult or my mother because I feel like they  won’t help ( or that their version of help will end in me being more miserable ) 

My mother doesn’t seem to understand depression and my relationship with her has grown very awkward and sterile. She’s not someone I go to for help. 

ALSO, I’ve been self medicating with drugs and while I’m not physically addicted I have grown a dependence and thus I beg my friends for money and have started stealing loose change, essentially I’m a lil piece of shit.

Today while she was out I was cleaning up around the bedroom as i had left alot of shit layin around and i didnt wanna be a slob. So while im pickin up my clothes i find a pair of boxers layin just under her bed. Like... Just peekin out from under, not stuffed away hidden. I just assumed they were girl boxers she wears on her period or some shit. I genuinely thought nothing of it. She got home and we were hangin out watchin tv and i said hey i have all my clothes in the wash basket (she washes my clothes) and i added, oh i found your girl boxers too. She looked confused.. I was like.. Your boxers.. She asked me to show her. I went and got them... And she just laughed and said is this a joke.. Theyre yours.. At this stage i was getting pissed. I calmly told her do not say that again or im gonna flip out. She told me she had never seen them before in her life. I had been staying there for two weeks. We literally had never been apart for more than 5 or six hours and of those times i was at home. So i have no idea how they ended up on the floor. She then said exactly what i was thinking. Which is that they must be her exs who would leave clothes and other items at her house when they were dating (they broke up 3 years ago) and she said she hadnt dated anyone or slept with anyone after that until she met me. But if thats the case.. And they were somewhere in her walkin closet for years how did they end up on the floor under her bed?

I didnt even get mad. I just got real quiet. I think she was frightened. In any case. Even if that explanation is true i had my girls ex bfs boxers in my hand today. Just a bad situation. Felt like shit about it.",15Aug2018,72

I didn’t realize that Ann expected me to house sit until the day she was leaving. I don’t live far from Ann’s house. 

It’s an awkward situation... I’m “living” in this lady’s house the day after I met her...
Ann told me that she had a tv, but she doesn’t... well... she has a tv in her bedroom, but I don’t feel comfortable spending time in there. Also, I don’t know if it’s her dogs or something else in the house, but my allergies act up when I spend an extended amount of time in her house. My skin itches, I feel sick, and I can’t breathe very well.

She has two big dogs that take care of themselves (auto food/water and doggie door), but they have separation anxiety and “can’t be alone for too long”, because they urinate everywhere. The dogs are exhausting. I haven’t been able to get a decent nights sleep. They jump up and down on the bed throughout the night. When I put up a divider to keep them out of the room at night, they freaked out, ran outside, and wouldn’t stop barking.

186,"       I have worked as a full time nursing assistant since I was 18, I am now 23, and have worked here for five years, full time. I have finished my pre reqs for a nursing program but since I have been working full time my GPA has suffered. I learned yesterday if I do well on the TEAS test, which is an entrance exam for nursing school, I have a really good chance of getting into the program. 
        I also am extremely obese, and my health is declining. I have a father that has been 600lb for my whole life, and is slowly killing himself everyday, the whole side of his family of unhealthy and one of my aunts was a nurse for many years until she had to retire due to her weight. I have been 300 lb since I was 18, and I’m almost to 400 lb.  I have had a hard time loosing weight due to school, work, and taking care of my father. My father has finally started going to the doctors and I now don’t have to take care of him except for weekly shopping. He also had threatened to kill himself if I went to nursing school, and I’ve been worried since I was 18 that he would kill himself, but since he’s been going to the doctors he hasn’t been guilting me to care for him, and I’ve finally gotten to the point where I can enjoy my youth a bit. 
      I have enough money saved up to go part time at my work for two months and only work one or two days a week. I was thinking of using those two months to study for my TEAS test, and go on a strict protein shake only diet, (monitored by Kaiser doctors). 
      The longest I’ve taken off of work is a two week vacation, and while I enjoyed it, I felt bored after the third day, because Im one of those people that needs to work to feel like my life has meaning. 
       My daily schedule would be wake up, workout, study for test, house hold chores, maybe pick up a hobby or two, and working out more. I’m also thinking of hiking once a week or just a fun activity. 
      So, what I’m wondering is, Should I take the opportunity to go part time to focus on my test and weight loss, or should I keep working full time? I know that once I return to work, I probably won’t be working out as much, but I feel like a two month “re programming” of my body would be beneficial. What hobbies or activities should I do if I take the time off?

191,"I’m going to do my best not to sound like I’m venting, but I’ll be honest— that’s exactly what this is.  Please skip to the end if you don’t want to read all the banter but have knowledge of Gynecology.

Over the past year I feel I’ve been dealt some troubling dilemmas. I made a few big strides in my career, apparently my test scores and work ethic landed me on the ‘prestigious team’ as a project manager. Unfortunately during the time I’d been promoted into this position the rest of the team was buried in work because corporate America and lean business models, anyhow— without any previous PM experience, I’d been put on a few of the most challenging jobs our team had and all the while our... manager, (I’m using this term loosely) essentially verbally abuses myself and a few other new PM’s in front the rest of the office on multiple occasions. Another coworker and I expressed our concerns to him regarding the lack of professionalism in that kind of behavior and it actually improved over time. Great! Right? Kind of... 

So anyway, our office had a party and a few of us came back to my and my fiancée’s house after a night of excessive drinking.  Two of my coworkers start making out and soon they’re naked in our bathtub.  Fiancée suggests we invite them into our bed for some fun, mind you we’d swung with others before and I just don’t ‘perform’ in that scenario unless I feel welcomed and desired. So I refused about 5 times before I finally gave in because, damn it, I’d been drinking too. Fiancée and I had discussed this on quite a few occasions prior to this slippery incident with my coworkers and every time we both agree that we don’t actually want to be swingers. However, the swinging and other more intentionally hurtful behaviors happened again and again with alcohol consumption.  
That night we all hooked up and my colleague made me feel unequivocally embraced, so I was able to perform.  (Yay.) Meanwhile Fiancée and my other coworker are having sex next to us and then he comes in my soon to be wife and we all high five and go about our lives. I should mention Fiancée and I had been trying to get pregnant, so naturally I was concerned that if she gets pregnant what are we going to do? Do we take the gamble and pray it’s mine? Well time went on and she had a period, so I let out a big sigh of relief that we didn’t have to take that bet. 

About a week after her period she has another night of binge drinking. This time I was verbally and physically attacked by her and at one point she grabbed a knife and threatened stabbing me.  I was able to get the knife out of her hand and restrain her later. (She ended up with a torn MCL, I felt horrible).  The next day I went to work and broke down. I began to cry in front of other coworkers and left early that day.  When I got home I discovered she hadn’t gone to work because she was so hung over.  I burst into tears telling her I can’t be with someone who treats me the way she does.  She promises me she’ll quit drinking, again. But this time she insists she really means it.  I’m hesitant to believe her after being burned so many times in the past.  But we had been together over 5 years at that point and she has an 8yr old daughter who I love dearly. So I stick it out another couple weeks then low and behold Fiancée is pregnant.  At this point I’m feeling a ton of anxiety and also excitement because I had been wanting another child, one of my own blood, (not to discount the special bond her daughter and I have.)  

Some more time goes by and feeling the pressure of parenthood looming over me. I tell my boss I feel I deserve a raise for all the hard work I’ve done, so I ask for a little less than the low end of what PM’s make in my city because I know I’m new and still have a lot to learn. I just felt I should be compensated fairly for the difficult and mostly untrained, (due to lack of employee to work ratio) work I was doing.  Boss comes back to me after talking to my supervisor and declines my request for a raise.  Struggling to pull myself back up, I begin to have intense stomach pain and it goes on for a few weeks before one day I can’t ride to work because the pain is too much. So I go to the ER, get blood work and a CAT scan and nothing shows up. Great news!  It’s nothing life threatening so I’ll be able to meet my son probably. (Btw we found out it’s going to be a boy by this point) So I go to my regular doctor and have a couple more tests done, still nothing found.  Frustrated by the mysterious pain, I did some internet research and decide it’s either a corn allergy, possibly excessive mj usage, or simply stress. So I made some life changes and figured out it was just stress. I started meditating and exercising more to ease my stress. 

I put my best foot forward, and pushed through the ego blow and the stress and come up with a Gantt chart that combines a few different tracking sheets we use which will cut down our work load by approximately 50% and will also help prevent things falling through cracks.  I got a lot of good feedback from my whole team except my supervisor.  Our company works on a profit sharing model so there’s a decent amount of office politics and until that point I was naive to the depth these politics run, and frankly I’m sure it’s worse than what became apparent to me in that moment.

A little more time goes on and I was demoted back to the warehouse. A lot of my other coworkers are shocked and confused, probably somewhat like when the perfect sibling finally acts out. My boss made it sound reassuring that they would still want me onboard and made sure to fluff my ego quite a bit while also pushing me to choose whether or not this is the right career path for me.

Do I stick it out and do what’s responsible while also taking the risk of more emotional abuse? (which I’m sure I can get just about anywhere)

Or do I take his offer of 3 weeks paid severance after I’ve lined up a new job? Keep in mind I wouldn’t get any profit sharing or FMLA time with the baby this way.  

Third less appealing (professionally speaking) option, do I make a timely mistake and get fired and collect unemployment while supplementing Uber income for a while, which could earn more than what I’m making now, when the baby comes?

Boss really laid it all out there and made me feel kind of empowered with these options, however now it’s all catching up to me and I’m having a bit of a meltdown. 


After explaining to my wife what happened she is concerned about my choices and thinks I’m not taking parenthood seriously.  All the while I’ve been secretly freaking out that she’s pregnant with my coworker’s baby. You’re probably thinking her period after the fact would be enough reassurance, however, my wife is somewhat of a medical anomaly, in that she has a double cervix. So could she have had a period while also being pregnant? I vented all this to a few friends and asked for advice. They pointed me here... hoping for some kind guidance. 


TL:DR  Double cervix /double uterus wife had sex with coworker, then had period later. Is it possible she was pregnant before/during her period? ",15Aug2018,0
192,"Hi!
I am absolutely at my wits end with my in-laws!

When my fiance and I lived a few hours away, they were absolutely lovely, but now that we live closer (around a 10 minute walk from them - moved back for work/school), they seem to think our house is theirs. 
For the first few months we lived here, they stopped by unannounced frequently. We asked them, multiple times, to just let us know when they wanted to come over and they were always welcome, but they still would show up out of the blue. We more or less sorted that problem out (we had to resort to not answering the door when they showed up UNLESS they had let us know they were coming), but now we have a different problem:
they wait until they know we aren't home (or think we aren't), then come over. 
I'm not sure how to explain this without sounding awful, because what they do when they come over is all, ostensibly, nice things, but it's still an invasion of privacy. I'll give a few examples:

1. This weekend, when they knew my fiance and I were out of town for work, they went to our house and did a bunch of random yard work. They jimmied their way into our shed and used our tools to trim the trees and bushes, mow the lawns, and for some reason, took the grating off the bottom of our deck (they think it looks better that way). They didn't tell us that they had done any of this until we arrived back home, and they certainly made no hint of wanting to before we left. And for the record, the yard was fine beforehand, it's not like it was left in disrepair. They couldn't figure out how to re-lock the shed after they had jimmied it open, so they took our lawnmower and trimmer home with them.

2. Last week, while we were both at work, they walked over to our house, took OUR car (we bought the car from them a few years ago - it came as a surprise to both of us that they had kept an extra set of keys), and took our bin of leftover reno scraps to the dump. I only found out when I got home from work and our car was gone. I panicked thinking it had been stolen, and was about to call the police when they arrived back with it (and also a freezer that we did not want or need, but that they left in our driveway anyway). 

And this is just what they've done in the last week. I can't even tell you how many times I've looked out my window to find them in my backyard, or arrived home from work to find them sitting on my front porch. I see them just...walk by my house almost every day. We have asked them, directly, MANY times to just PLEASE let us know before they come over, but they seem to have changed to this strategy of waiting until we aren't home to do whatever they want. I need help - I am paranoid every time I leave the house! What can I do to make this stop?  ",15Aug2018,1
193,"I work different odd jobs, doing surveys and bartending. Some months I make five grand a month. My expenses are very low and I like it that way. I never wanted kids, me and my girlfriend live separate and it works really well. The only thing I don’t like about it, is when I think about how I don’t have a normal life compared to other people. My parents really want me to have a kid but I never really wanted the kids, house, and picket fence. I also never wanted to work 12 hours a day for a life I didn’t want. ",15Aug2018,1
195,"I (27F) have been bartending at a local, privately owned bar for 8 months now. The owners used an actual payroll company for the first month I was there, then they began writing personal checks. 

I started to notice pretty early on that my checks were missing hours. My coworkers and I have asked for check stubs for months now and are being given the run around. We can’t get insurance and lots of other pertinent things without these. 

I am fairly certain my bosses are not paying our taxes and are pocketing 7+ hours from every pay period of mine. After 7 months, this comes to about $1000 on the low end. 

They asked me to manage a couple months back and I accepted. They wanted me to fire several people but I refuse to do it, as I know these girls will report the bar for their many illegal doings. I’ve repeatedly informed the owners that they need to prove they are paying our taxes as well as provide each of us with an itemized check stub. 

I’m not sure where to proceed from here. I’m beyond fed up. Checks have bounced, been late, and are short every time. My last check was for 32 hours when I worked over 40. 

I’m frustrated because I trusted these people for months when they insisted they were paying my taxes. After gaining a management position and peeking behind the curtain, I’ve grown aware of an entire host of illegal actions on their part. 

Where do I go from here? Can I even take any action? Will I ever see this money?

TL;DR: bosses have been taking hours off of my check every pay period with no proof of where my money is going. I’m fairly certain they are pocketing my cash and not paying my taxes. Do I have any legal ground here?

199,Hi there and thank you for looking. Im thinking about going back to college to attempt to enhance my quality of life as it is abysmal at this moment in time. I do have a couple of concerns however. One of them being i will be potentially the oldest student at 26 (by the time the course is complete ill be close to 28) and will have to suffer the humiliation of being around techincally kids when im a fully grown adult. The other being i could also be potentially in crisis financially too not because of course fees but because im having to take payday loans to keep afloat currently. Idk if can put up with the humiliation of being around kids plus with being extremely suicidal whats to say i dont kill myself halfway through? Will the kids terrorise me for what am wearing as i havent been able to afford clothes recently due to being jobless? The big question being will the course offer a job at the end of it? Kind of hoping the drive of earning a new skill will alieviate the depression and suicidal thoughts but idk if want to go through it.

201,"I've liked this girl for a while now, mainly because a couple of her friends told me that she liked me, but when I confessed how I feel about her she just said she didn't expect that and when I asked if there was anyone she liked she said she didn't like anybody at the moment.

203,"It seems that I frequently forget things and I figured that if I was actually mindful and aware of what I do, I wouldn't forget them. Even though I constantly tell myself "" be aware of what you do "" I can't seem to apply it in any way, I still tend to be careless and forget things. I've noticed that I constantly do things without thinking, and that is probably why I'm careless and forgetful. 

I've been holding this problem to myself now 'cause I was confident that I'll overcome it myself but now I've decided to not prolong this issue any more longer and just freely ask advice from you guys.

Below are example scenarios that best explains everything above:

1. I was advised by the doctor 2 days ago to drink my medicine at 12 noon today.  I forgot about it and wasn't able to drink my medicine at the proper time.
2. I have to bring a heavy object from a room to another room. I carelessly bring the heavy object causing it to hit things that shouldn't be hit. 
3. I borrowed a USB from a classmate for a project. I only told him I'd borrow it for an hour. I was distracted by my tasks and because of that I forgot to return it and brought the USB home with me. 
4. I have swimming class and my dirty wet clothes are in my bag. When I got home, I forgot to bring my dirty wet clothes out from my bag to the laundry because I was so tired. 

I'm still not quite sure if what I am saying actually connects to the actual issue, but that is what I am here for anyway, to ask guidance from you guys. Thanks in advance!",15Aug2018,1
204,"So some background, I was assaulted early July in a hospital waiting room by an African American male. I thought it was accidental at first that they walked into me with their elbow while I was seated and I was just shocked and didn’t know how to react, but later eyewitness accounts revealed they went out of their way to bump into/hit me on purpose. Unfortunately by the time I got the confirmation they had already left and the hospital couldn’t reveal security footage due to Hipaa laws.

I had my suspicions (given that I was seated in a separate row away from the door and their elbow/arm hit my head which meant they were right next to my chair despite the wide aisle space) before I got the confirmation but I was hesitant to call the police as I didn’t want to look like a racist and end up on some news article if it turned out to be accidental even though the person who assaulted me acted like nothing happened and were smiling when they were talking to the doctor at the door with the patient they are picking up. 

Anyways, I need advice on how to stop it from turning me racist. I know it’s wrong to be racist but I need help convincing my unconscious brain to understand that. I have OCD and Autism spectrum disorder and I obsess and ruminate over anything and everything. This unfortunately has caused me to be unnecessarily fearful as I believe I was targeted based on my ethnicity and due to my facial hair (I am of Egyptian ethnicity and had a beard at the time). I already suffer from PTSD from an assault three years ago.

My OCD after the hospital incident caused me to start having racist intrusive thoughts and I feel awful because I know many great African-American people and I don’t want to be a bad person. If I had had the guts to call the police in time and didn’t second guess myself I wouldn’t have these thoughts but them getting away with it is what caused this.

Any of you who’ve been in such a situation before, how do you get over this? I’m wondering if I should see a counselor for Mindfulness or  DBT stuff. I just want to be normal again and to stop having these intrusive thoughts. I’m also scared of going back there and encountering the same individual some day, and now I have trust issues not seeing what’s behind me.

217,"I'm typing this on my phone so please don't mind the formatting.  

I'm a 29 year old African woman who moved to Germany two years ago to try and start a new life and escape the prosecution of my former society because I've left my religion (Islam) and refused to conform to their way of living and being forced to marry a cousin and live the rest of my life as a slave to my husband and a baby making machine. 

What's kind of relevant to my situation now is that I was raped when I was six years old, beaten by my father (and my brothers too, not just me), we have a variety of mental illnesses in the family along with sleep disturbances. I was  diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was 17 but I didn't take medications for it since my parents didn't know that I went to the psychiatrist and wouldn't pay for the medication because they believe that my problems are caused by my weak belief in God, my lack of prayer, and my bad behaviour. And they would take me to a sheikh and have him read Qur'an for me and try to exorcise my demons instead.  

It was manageable over the years and I had no big problems except for my incredibly irregular sleep because of almost daily episodes of sleep paralysis and exploding head syndrome. but since I was living at home and my mother would take care to wake me up to go to school/work on time, I managed to graduate and work my way out of there and had a somewhat normal life (ignoring the voices and not having too much stress about rent and food and such basics).  

Now that I'm living on my own and have to work everyday to be able to afford rent and food and most importantly staying here. My very low paying job is kind of the most important thing to me. I don't have many friends and I don't have any time to see them. I barely find time to reply to my mother's messages telling her I'm fine and alive. I struggle at the end of each month to be able to pay next month's rent. Work is hard and I have to also go to school and learn everything in German. My living situation isn't very good but it's cheap.  The co-workers aren't very understanding and complain that I am too silent and withdrawan so I always get scolded by my boss that I'm not a team player and that the colleagues don't think I'm friendly enough. I didn't worry about it too much. I don't know why. I don't care what they think of me.  

Ever since I started working here my mental state has been in steady decline. I don't know which caused which but the voices has been getting louder and I can't sleep because of it. Now it's evolved to visual hallucinations and physical health decline. I have lost a lot of weight since I have no energy to cook or go buy food. I feel extremely bad and weird all the time and if I get more than 3 hours of sleep at night that would be the highlight of my day.  

I went to a doctor and told him I can't sleep. Before he asked me what was wrong the first thing he said was ""I'm not going to give you any medications"", which was fine since all I needed was a referral to the sleep lab without which I couldn't get the appointment. I also went to a psychiatrist and she wrote me some medications but I stopped taking them. Since I read about them and how they have horrible side effects to my heart. It gave me tachycardia and I started to panic even more so I was too afraid to take any more or go back to the doctor. Mostly because I don't have time to wait 3 months for another appointment. And after waiting three months for my appointment with the sleep lab they told me they need to rule out sleep apnea so they need me to see an ent doctor and then a month later I will have another appointment.  

In the meantime I am oversleeping everyday and showing up to work late, can't concentrate and make a lot of mistakes, I'm often too tired so I call in sick way more often than they think I should. My boss is getting impatient with me even though I told him that I'm not feeling very well currently and I am trying to get help. He's not the most understanding person in the world and it doesn't help that I can't express myself very well in German or even get emotional so that he would believe me, he thinks I'm just lazy. Which causes me to get even more stressed out and scared.  I don't know how long I can go on like this or what to do now. If I lose this job it's back to Africa for me. I'd rather die than go back there. I'm so lost and my mind is just in chaos. I don't know what I should do now. :(",15Aug2018,58

219,"My husband and I have 6 cats (Wolfpack-5y/0, Jelly Bean-5, Nova-4, Gimli-3, Legolas-3, and Jigsaw-1). They pretty much all got along, never doing much more fighting than some growling and maybe a little swipe at each other. 

My friend was in need of a place at the last minute and we offered her our guest bedroom and bathroom for cheap rent and let her bring her cat (Jasper-5) with her. We introduced them very slowly, over the course of a month or so, before we let them mingle. And we only did that under supervision. Everything seemed fine at first. 

Gimli took a liking to Jasper’s cat tree. We were constantly shooing him out of the room because that’s Jasper’s territory and Gimli has plenty of other places in the house he can hang out. I think that territory issue is what started the fighting. Jasper started going after Gimli constantly and attacking him. Gimli is like 12 pounds and Jasper is over 20 with MASSIVE paws so it’s definitely not a fair fight. 

We got Gimli to stop going in her room and using the cat tree but that hasn’t stopped Jasper from attacking him any chance he gets. Then, because Nova was taken in as a stray and socialized around Gimli and Legolas, she’s very protective of those boys. She started sticking up for Gimli and attacking Jasper back when he would go after him. Now Jasper will attack either one of them, unprovoked, all the time.

We wake up probably 5 nights out of the week to cat fights. We have our roommate sleep with him in the room at night but she leaves extra early in the morning and works 12-14 hour days so he gets out at that time and attacks after she leaves, before we wake up. She’s never home to witness it. 

Jasper has bit Gimli before and the bite wound got infected. It had to be drained and he wore a cone for 2 weeks. When Jasper goes after Nova, her defense mechanism is to pee all over the place. I’ve cleaned pee off our couches, pool table, carpet, tile, walls, you name it. Jasper also started going in the litter box after Gimli and spraying pee ALL over the wall/baseboard/carpet behind it. It happened so many times in the same spot that I can’t get the litter out from between the baseboards and carpet. It’s turned to clay. Part of me is pissed because this house is only a year old and we bought it brand new. But the other part of me is like eh we wanted to rip out all the carpet eventually anyway. We’ve replaced every litter box with covered ones so he can’t spray out of it anymore, one of which our roommate bought as an “I’m sorry.”

We woke up this morning to fighting again. Jasper had cornered Nova AND Gimli in the living room underneath the coffee table. All three of them were covered in Nova’s pee and there was someone’s blood all over the wall, which I’m pretty sure was Jasper’s but it’s hard to tell through all the fur. 

Our first response was to make loud noises to startle them and break up the fight which doesn’t work anymore. Then we started squirting them with the water bottle and ushering Jasper back into our roommate’s room. Now we just pick him up in the middle of fighting and lock Jasper up in the room for an hour or so until he calms down. Sometimes he comes out of there and it’ll be peaceful for hours, maybe even the rest of the night. But a lot of times he comes out of there and immediately runs downstairs to instigate more fights again. 

At this point we just want to lock him in her room at all times unless she’s home to witness the fights and help break them up. My husband also wants her to buy us more cleaning products because I’ve used a whole bottle of mine solely on cleaning up Nova’s pee after their fights. 

Does anyone have any advice on how we can stop these fights? Our roommate isn’t home to help when it happens and she feels terrible about it. She keeps offering to move out but she is broke and I know she wouldn’t be able to find a place to live for as cheap of rent as we charge her. She’s late on rent constantly with us but we let it slide because we’re just trying to help a friend out. And we love her to death and don’t want her to leave. It’s only her cat. We don’t blame her for it and try to make that very clear to her, but she feels so guilty every time we bring up another fight to her. 

tl;dr: My roommate’s cat won’t stop attacking two of my cats (and sometimes the other four if he’s feeling feisty) and nothing we’ve done to stop the fights is working. Any advice on how to stop cat fights? ",15Aug2018,2

It still tried to charge me and luckily the card I used has insufficient funds. I contacted the company and they said they would double check on cancelling it and then said it was for sure cancelled. It tried charging again and I sent another message. It tries to charge every 24 hours and sends me an email about it every time. I will eventually have money on this card again and dont want it to charge it. So the only thing I can think of to stop this is changing the payment option and using some used visa gift card that only has like a few cents left on it so it just charges that forever getting nothing. So is there any place I can find the info for such cards or is anyone willing to offer theirs? Like I said, if there is another way do tell.",15Aug2018,1
222,"I go to appointments fortnightly  with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then turned upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet)  ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she  said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm an ugly loser....or something like that. Need a 2nd opinion...I did need a shave which maybe why :/  she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined.

223,"This happens with most books/films that I need to remember things about for tests.
What happens is that we need to read a book for an essay that we will write. Reading it is fine, which I usually do just before we start working on it, and I will retain a lot of the information for the following periods of English.
However, after a while my memory will began to fade, or rather get bored of the topic. It's like my mind is over it, and the work starts getting more tedious to complete as I begin to care less about it. The mental block that happens a week or so before the exam gets so tough that it takes hours to write a single paragraph. I cannot remember any quotes by this point and re-reading doesn't help either. I cannot seem to revive any interest I had for the topic. Recalling anything is like peering into a dark box; I know something is there but I can't take it out.
Any suggestions?",15Aug2018,1

227,"I'm 21, living at home with my mom and was trying to have the ""I'm going to get a tattoo someday""-talk with her. I thought it was going well... 

I told her how I had thought about everything for a long time and how she could ask me anything about them. She kept saying ""I really hope you won't actually do this"" and ""you're gonna regret them someday, I know that"" but I had already anticipated that response.

Then she asked me what motif I was thinking of getting. And I shouldn't have just told her. I know that ""I want a lamppost on my arm"" sounds stupid without context but her laugh was so incredibly hurtful. It was really over the top with comically slapping the table, wheezing and everything.

After like 3 minutes of her just having the time of her life, she asked me ""Why the fuck would you want something as stupid as a lamppost? Any man is going to lose his shit when you take of your shirt!"" I was kinda silent crying at that point so she feigned interest and asked me why I wanted a lamppost. But I really didn't want to explain it while crying so I just told her she should ask me another time.

Is it really so stupid? I think it's a nice design and it reminds me of ""The Beginner's Guide"", a game that really had an impact on me. But I think no matter how I'll explain it to her, she will just laugh at me and my feelings. I wanted to talk to her about this before getting the tattoo because I find it more respectful, but now I really regret ever bringing it up...",15Aug2018,2
229,"**TL;DR: My team lead is incredibly abbrasive and difficult to work with. Any advice?**

I am 22 in Canada. I work in the oilfield which consists of 2 weeks straight or so of 10-13hr days with the same just one other person constantly. The other person is the team lead and I am the assistant. He is not my boss but does have the authority in daily work.

He is maybe age 50, smokes, single, kind of grumpy. He describes himself as an asshole but weve had many great conversations and I learn a lot at work from him. Every other assistant in my company hates him

He is so incredibly demanding and controlling. He freaks out me for drinking too loud, having my head too far back in the truck seat, walking one way around a tree instead of the other. It is absolutely exhausting to try and keep him happy and i think its impossible.

I have low self esteem and dont want a conflict, especially because i will not win. He always makes these rules and then contradicts them and is very hypocritical. He always setse up in situations where I am expected to read his mind and if guess one thing then he always makes it the other just so i am wrong and then he yells at me

He talks so much shit about all of the other assistants, he probably will about me too. Half of it is exxagerrated amd also mistakes that he makes too. Like for example, he complains that one of his assistants always sleeps in the car, but that assistant told me it was one time. I will never and have never slept in the vehicle but the other day my team lead did while i was driving, so hypocritical. 

Every observation i make has a condescending explanation. Like if I say ""wow the roads are pretty shitty eh"" instead of ""yeah you betcha"", i get "" Well it rain two days ago so of course its rainy right?"" In a very condescending tone, for everything that i say.

Or if i ask any question, i am always cut off angrily. Like if I am about to ask ""Oh is that the jobsite way up north?"" He will cut me off at ""Oh is that the jobsite..."" and answer angrily not even to my question ""NO its not the job site from yesterday!""

Being quiet is helpful, but then I am.kept completely in the dark about our work and then he yells at me later like im stupid but its because he withholds information for that exact purpose. I cant even do my job in peace because he is always nitpicking every little thing because im not doing it his way. Like zipping zippers up in the middle instead of just to one side

He calls himself ""very dominant"", which apparently means he gets to be a dick which is easy with his power over me from our job roles. At the end of a big freakout, he will be all nice randomly and thank me for my hard work. So wth, is it just manipulation? The times that i have pointed things out to him that are rude, maybe 50% of the time he will apologize. I dont hate him

Really don't want a conflict but struggling to handle this. Makes my self esteem MUCH worse. Any advice?",15Aug2018,1

We're a bit tight on money at the time but i found that i could get into a VERY prestigious school with a reasonable price relative to other unis here. The only problem is that this uni is extremely expensive for other fields except for mine. Also no one I've talked to about this actually knows that this uni actually includes this field (I've recenlty discovered this myself). If that doesn't sound like a problem, here every uni has a certain field of study that it's famous for and the university I'm talking about is EXTREMELY famous for medical sciences only. I'm afraid I'll just go into that uni and realize it actually sucks but it'll be too late by then because university prices SKYROCKET every year so I'll be stuck with this uni.

248,"So about 6 months ago my cousin was going through a rough spot and didn’t have transportation to work. He worked with my husband. My husbands job is defiantly a dream job pay wise so we didn’t want him to lose this opportunity. My husband and I offered for him to sleep on our couch until he saved money for a car. He didn’t pay rent or anything. We ended up getting evicted from our apartment because the landlord found out he lived with us and it was against the rules. So we moved. He know has his own room. He now pays a small amount of rent to help us cover food and such. He still doesn’t have a car. We drive him everywhere and pay for everything in the house. I cook and clean and do everything including his laundry and packing his lunch and stuff. 

Well two weeks ago he lost his job because he tried to fake a drug test and had cold pee. He got fired. I wasn’t aware he was on drugs. He has been home since. He isn’t actively looking for a job. He sits around all day being loud and obnoxious. I’m a stay at home mom. My kids just got started going back to school. I am here 24/7 with him and frankly it’s made me uncomfortable in my own home. He isn’t respectful as far as our family dynamic. He doesn’t do anything around the house. He has been very inconsiderate as far as him being home all day. Yesterday I was putting my kids to bed (I lay with them until they fall asleep) he came INTO their room (that he knew I was putting down and had the door shut) on the phone laughing and talking and telling me he checked the mail. Waking my kids up. I had to tell him at 4pm yesterday to get out of his night clothes and feet dressed for the day. He sits outside singing so loudly I can hear him inside. He has headphones in 24/7 that I can hear when he walks around. He stays up super late and at times past midnight I hear him going out and back in multiple times slamming the doors.

The worst part is he isn’t seriously looking for a job. Joking on the applications he has filled out. Lying on them. Let alone I don’t know what I will do when he gets a job because I will now have to take him to work AND pick him up. This also has to work around my kids schedule as I drop and pick them up and we have a pretty solid sleep schedule. I can’t wake them up at any hour to get him. 

The worst part is yesterday he told me he is still pooping pills and smoking weed and has no need to stop. So I’m afraid if he does get a job we are going to be in the same boat as we are right now when they drug test him. 

I am trying to be encouraging to him because I know losing a job is hard. But frankly it’s his own damn fault. I’m now getting to the point that I’m uncomfortable in my own home. I don’t know what to do. If it was any other roommate he would be gone by now but because it’s family it’s tricky.

249,"Title is bad, I know but I can't think of a better one at all. Typing in phone, excuse format.

I've been studying in this school for the majority of my life and for the most part, my grades were pretty good. Top 10 mostly, top 5 when I'm lucky but nowadays, now that I'm in the 10th grade my grades are declining and my parents are mad about it.

It could be laziness, or procrastination, a quick look into my reddit history would show you my likes in roleplaying and the fact that I'm managing a discord server alongside my school life, I don't know. It could be my fault. It's most likely my fault, and I know that, but I don't know why I don't do anything about it.

I wanna say I try but I don't know if my trying was really enough. I know it isn't enough and I still do nothing about it. I keep telling myself that if I don't do good, I'm never going to college, but at the same time I berate myself for being so fucking dumb.

My mother is.. I guess, trying to motivate me? But it's really just making me feel even worse, she even told me to give up trying to go to college with the grades that I'm getting right now. She keeps comparing me with my classmates, or my siblings, or even myself when I used to have better grades. She tells me she doesn't care what grades I get, as long as I'm satisfied, but at the same time I'm pressured to keep this scholarship from her being a teacher in my school. She's offering me tutors even though getting tutors makes me feel like I'm so beyond help that I need someone else to teach me.

Even as I'm typing this, exams are coming up, and I can't focus on studying because I keep thinking about these things and feeling worse and worse. Especially since the next exam is something I *need* to pass, otherwise I fail the subject and I lose this stupid scholarship.

I don't know if my head is just so far up my ass that I believe I'm depressed but I don't want to call myself such, but I just feel like I want to cry all the time and every time I scrape only a passing grade.

He recently ordered multiple parts for a new pc from a website. Later he ordered a monitor from the same website.

Fast forward a few days he’s not at his home as it’s currently undergoing repair work and he has respiratory issues which means it’s best for him to stay elsewhere in the meantime (the rest of his family is still staying there) both deliveries - monitor and parts - are showed as delivered and signed for at the same time. The problem is these packages were signed for by a builder and only one package was delivered - the monitor.

This is where it becomes difficult, the builder doesn’t know he’s expecting two packages so after receiving one it’s by no means surprising he signed for the parcel - I know from personal experience delivery drivers don’t verify what you’re signing for they just hand you a screen and stylus. The delivery company and website he purchased from are claiming it’s been delivered, an investigation is currently being undertaken by the delivery company but it’s taken 4 of a maximum of 5 working days, which to me doesn’t seem promising.

\----------

I had a terrible time during school because I was constantly bullied. Before preparatory I had many cousins living in my own street so they were my only friends. After that, our families cut ties with each other (around the time my parents got divorced) and we moved a few miles away and changed schools. This was when I was around 10. My sister and I tried a new public school for two years but couldn't adapt and around that time my father died. 

We were having many problems so my mother changed us to a private school. There it was a bit better but I started getting bullied again (because of my weight, my hobbies, my grades and basically anything, because bullies don't really need a reason). I was a part of a group of friends but I always thought they didn't like me as much as they liked each other and we never hung out during summers so I was kind of completely alone again even though some claimed to be best friends with me. 

I coped with everything not in the best way, but as I have always done, just turning my attention to solitary hobbies and interests like reading, learning languages, drawing and basically planning to go again from it all. During that time I suffered from depression and eating disorders that nobody knew about and had to take care of all of it on my own. Briefly during that time I started attending a boy band fans club at another city, where I met many girls and we kind of form a new friendship group. My friends at school didn't like that I suddenly wasn't available one weekend a month even though we never hung out outside of school and I didn't like jealousy so we kind of drifted apart. 

After I finished high school I started working right away because I couldn't afford college. Going out with the girls from the fans club I met someone who would turn out to be my first love. I fell madly in love with him and we starting seeing each other four times a week almost immediately. He lived three hours away by public transport and I was working full time and studying courses so I kind of spent all my free time with him. 

That was my fault, I know we all say that you shouldn't stop seeing your friends for a relationship, but I got so in love so quickly and they didn't really like him and were trying to talk me out of seeing him and I thought it was absurd. They sounded really jealous from the first date alone and they didn't really know him. Anyways we lasted five years together, during which we moved to the city and basically I hung up with his friends who all were really nice and I still talk to them sometimes. But we broke up about two years ago and he moved to a different country. 

I changed jobs a lot during those years. On my first jobs around my neighborhood people said they didn't like me because I seemed stuck up and on a high horse (I'm actually shy). Oh and also I looked too posh. Actually one girl wanted to fight me saying that as her excuse (I didn't engage). I don't get it because I don't think I seem too posh and I was as poor as them so what gives.

\----------

I think with the years I've just learned to keep to myself even though people don't bully me anymore. I'm the kind of person who will talk to anyone in a room and probably have a good conversation and people usually tell me I'm really nice and that we should do this or that. But I can't seem to go past that. Maybe we'll meet a few times but won't turn into a meaningful relationship and we'll just drift away. Now I'm working remotely and I'm not studying so I just leave my house basically to go to the hospital to visit my sister (long story) and I feel really alone.

I have an interview for my dream job and it requires me to ride up to the 24th floor on an elevator (daily, if I do get the job). Any suggestions/advise would be greatly appreciated, I do not want to give up this opportunity over a fear. 

Side note; its on the 24th floor.  I am not opposed to walking up daily, but it's a new building NYC so usually they will not allow stairwell access.",15Aug2018,2

258,"I plan on changing my name next year after I graduate high school.

The names together are so sweet and sound so beautiful to me, I would be so happy to have them as my names. 

My problem is that my mother is upset that I don't want to take her Nigerian name. I like the name, it's actually quite an unusual one by Nigerian standards, but tbh Cora and this name just don't click for me, I can't get excited by it. The letters clash and I don't think I'll ever be truly satisfied with the way it looks or sounds. I feel like a horrible daughter because I don't hate it at all. She says that I'm distancing myself from my African roots despite the fact that I embrace my culture in many other ways.

This really bothered me and I went through a bit of resentment towards her.

266,"hey all, first post here.  apologies for the lengthy post... 

i'm 31 years old and have a pretty secure and decent paying job, but i have been a little frustrated with the company over the last year or so due to limited growth opportunities, i'm a big pigeon holed in my current position and don't  feel great about the future of it and have had my eye open for a fresh change. No debt except for house and car payment, wife is currently staying home with the kid and want to keep it that way. 

i'm currently making about 160k a year with bonus in a GM type role, have about 120k in my 401k (plus the 100k in wife's, she is no longer working after newborn)  and i'm paying $70/month out of pocket for insurance for the family (me, wife and newborn). my company was acquired last year by a big online company (take a guess) and we have some potential good employee stock income as well but its not clear yet (but it is likely to continue). 

i've been looking for a change for some excitement and and growth potential and have been actively interviewing with a medical marijuana company (young and small compared to current company) who has offered me a position, very similiar GM role but much smaller operation and different. the salary is comparable (roughly 150k with bonus) but i will be paying about $500/month out of pocket for insurance. they have offered hefty stock options upon start which could be worth a lot of $$ should the price climb, but could also be worth nothing. the other kicker here is that the company currently does not offer a 401k. not the only way to save money, but not really good news. they said they are working on this but are having challenges with big banks at the moment which is a problem with the industry as a whole. 

since interviewing with this new company, there has been an opportunity with my currently company to get out of my GM type role into a lateral position that works remotely (with travel probably 1-2 weeks a month) but is not in charge of a facility/group of people which has its perks. the future and growth related to this position are not totally clear, but the advantages are less stress, maintaining stock and benefits and more secure. it is not guaranteed that i get this job, but likely. 

i'm at a cross roads between the new risky company (fresh company, lots of low hanging fruit for quick improvement, decent initial compensation with pretty big future potential) and dealing with the frustrations i have now (settling for the pretty good compensation and rolling the dice on future growth opportunities, better security for family) and option to work remotely. part of me feels like a wimp if i walk away from the risky opportunity, i feel like i could do really well fast and the pay off could be huge, but its obviously a big risk to leave a company i've been with for 10 years, have a solid income and great benefits.

269,"My partner of 9 years, wife for 4 years, a couple of days ago told me she wants to separate and eventually divorce. I am 28, she is 31. We have a 9 month old baby.

I had noticed over the last 3 - 4 months that she had been getting slowly more and more distant; She would not hug me back, she would move her cheek into a kiss to avoid kissing me, she stopped using the nickname she always had for me, she would sit quietly for hours on her phone not chatting with me, etc. 

I initially thought this was due to her being 'affectioned-out' from spending most days at home with our child. So I focussed on cooking dinner, cleaning the house, taking care of our pets, emptying the trash, feeding and putting our baby to bed every night. All to give her a stress free quiet time once I was home from work. (Actually, I usually did all these things anyway as routine). I told her she could talk to me about anything she wanted.

A couple of days ago, after dinner and a movie, I decided to head off to bed, so I kissed her goodnight, told her I loved her and... Nothing. She just said nothing and continued doing whatever on her phone. This really made me feel a bit rubbish and a little ignored, so I asked if this was just me being too over-sensitive to things, or if it's that I'm being to needy and expecting more affection from her.

... She just shook her head. It wasn't me. After a long chat she said she is no longer 'feeling it' and acknowledged that she had been acting more and more distant, purposefully or not. She wants to separate, wants to co-parent our child 50/50, being as flexible as possible, and to end things peacefully.

Now, I actually have no negative feelings towards her, as she has told me the truth of how she feels, and we genuinely both want things to be peaceful and easy and stress free, so we can focus on our child and ourselves. It's hard to see right now, but I know this is probably the best path forward.

My main heartache comes from the fact that my perfect dream family life has been shattered. I devoted myself to my wife and daughter and nearly everything I have ever done has been for them both. I'm totally lost.

Please, I beg you, I need your advice:

•How do I stop myself from sliding away into a terrible dark place? It feels like I'm barely keeping it together and one bad night away from just collapsing into misery.


•I keep asking myself 'Why does she want this?'. She said I have been a perfect husband and father, but just isn't 'feeling it' anymore. I can't get the 'Why?' out of my head. Was it me? What did I do wrong? What DOES she want? Am I causing myself more anguish by searching for a reason?


•I haven't been single since 19. I'm now 28. I don't consider my marriage a waste by any means, but in a way I feel like I'm reverting back to that point in my life. How will I be alone? It's so terrifying. I don't know how to be alone, how to focus on myself, rather than having someone else to devote myself to. I'm scared.


Thank you for reading. I wanted to keep this really short but everything just poured out. I hope this wall of text is not too much to put people off reading. I really need the advice right now. Thanks.

270,"TL;DR - Family member owes $25,000 to a loan shark in 2 months. Has severe gambling problem but has always been a good person overall. They have no way to pay and this loan shark is dangerous. Is there anyway that they can avoid being hurt bad/killed? 

———————

So I have a family member (and yes, it is a family member, it isn’t me) who is in deep with a loan shark with no way to pay. He has a severe gambling problem, alcohol problem, and depression. He got in a car accident and got surgery on his arm and because of the accident he is going to eventually get some sort of settlement. We just don’t know how much. 

Well he used this future settlement as a way to get money over and over from a loan shark and also from pre settlement places. He lost a ton of money gambling chasing his losses and now he’s in deep 25k to this loan shark with no way to pay. My family member knows the loan shark socially as well and they are semi cool with each other, and when he has borrowed smaller amount like $5000, he has always paid back. 

I don’t know how the loan shark allowed someone currently without a job to borrow so much (I guess knowing about this future settlement, which may take up to 2 years to resolve) but anyway, earlier when my family member was on good terms and not owing much he asked him what he does to people who don’t pay. And the guy showed him pictures of people his goons have hurt very bad. Put in hospitals type bad. Also showed him the conversations he’s had with his goons as far as finding people and where to go to find them etc... 

I understand it could be all for show and this type of thing is more rare these days (people willing to hurt people over money owed) but his willingness to fuck people up seems very real. And most the people he’s Had roughed up only been for 5-10k. My family member owes all the money (25k) in 2 months, and has no way of paying it. He’s afraid that he’s literally going to end up being killed. Is there anything he can do to protect himself? I should add he doesn’t do drugs, he’s kind, and a good person overall . But he’s depressed and has a severe gambling problem that he knows he needs help for.

It's weird. I've had successful relationships, partied a lot, been popular and all that stuff... And just the thought of going to the store alone or, god forbid, a job interview puts me in a state of extreme anxiety. 

\- I'm panicking. I don't know where the fuck to start. Looking for a job is a big no for me because of my social anxiety and severe ADHD.

\- I'm getting back on meds soon next week, but I feel like I'm too far gone at this point.

\- Every day is the same. The fucking same. I wake up, I do my morning routine... and then I literally sit in front of my computer doing nothing for 14 hours. I shit you not, I can sit and stare at a wall for 14 hours only to panic, get anxious... and then do it all over again... for five years.

I know people have suggested therapy and stuff but honestly I'm not in a position where I can really get that. My parents won't let me get it.

I'm a 16 year old student in a family who's currently going through some hard time. 

If you're interested in the backstory here's one below, if you wanna get down to the problem scroll down and you'll see one. 

So This all started way back in the 1960s where my mom was born in a family of 5 and was very poor. The whole family was supported by my gramps and granny, they opened a small diner with the 5 children as employees. Days and night, the whole family worked non stop with 3 of them dropping out of school. The oldest(my uncle) got a chance to go to a medical college and eventually married and moved away leaving 4 of the children and my gramps working tirelessly. Few years later my grandma died. The family was left in shambles, my grandpa started drinking and eventually somehow my aunt and mom convinced him to stop and eventually opened a big restaurant for the first time with real employees. My mom married and eventually had my brother, but still we were poor and she and my aunts still had to work because we didn't have enough revenue to take enough employees yet. Keep in mind they have zero experience with business at this point so they just do what they think is right. Eventually to 2002 where I was born, this time my mom was still pushing herself because there were no chefs. My dad had to buy and sell motor bikes. Needless to say, we bought a house nearby and opened another restaurant but since there were no supervisors my mom still had to push her self to work. Until 2015 where we bought another house and opened a hotel with swimming pools and such. My brother moved away overseas for college leaving no one to help my mom again and so she had to work in the office with paperworks and contract since our hotel were new and no employees were coming in yet

281,Hello I was wondering if anyone could share tips they wish they knew when buying their first car. ,15Aug2018,1
282,"I don't really know if this is the right sub for this, but my parents refuse to let me drive anywhere by myself, despite the fact that I've had my driver's license for half a year with no incident. That's after having waited for several months after my sixteenth birthday to get it, because they thought I wasn't ready even then. Even now, all they want to do is rant on about all my minor mistakes, none of which are serious or should disqualify me from driving.

Quite honestly, it's absolutely dehumanizing that I can't even have this much control over my own life. The fact that they refuse to judge me able to drive despite the fact that I've given them ample proof that I am is immensely distressing. It's not even like I want to be able to go out and stay up as late as I want; all I want is to be able to drive to my friends' houses and come back by myself. From everyone I've talked to, this isn't an unreasonable thing to want, yet my parents treat me like even asking makes me an entitled brat and that they made some kind of huge mistake when raising me. 

I honestly believe that this is more about controlling me than it is about keeping me safe. I can drive as safely as I want with them in the car, I can drive at exactly the speed limit, I can wait as long as I want at any intersection before going, they don't give a fuck.

What's even worse is that every single other person I know who is older than 16 has their license, and their parents have no issues whatsoever letting them drive. I know that many people might be telling me that I'm overestimating my own driving ability, but I've often had to have my friends drive me places (which is humiliating, by the way) and I know for a fact that I am not a worse driver than all of them. Yet my parents will readily accept them driving, and won't let me so much as drive by myself to the store a couple of miles away.

The worst part is that I live nowhere close to any of my friends, or anything to do. Everything interesting is driving distance away, so I'm basically stuck at home with nothing to do. Then my parents complain that I'm depressed all the time or that I spend all my time sitting on my computer and doing nothing, when they're not giving me the option to go anywhere or do anything else.

I guess what I'm looking for is another perspective. Am I acting entitled, or blowing this out of proportion? Are my parents in the wrong here, or do I need to manage my own expectations? If there's something I can do to influence the situation or cope with it, what is it? I'm just immensely distressed by this and need advice.",15Aug2018,0
283,"Ok brief summary of everything. 
I am a recent college grad, 22 y/o who was looking for work a bit ago. This past June I applied to a job, I was interviewed and during that I found out the job they would put me in was not the one I applied for but actually a lower position. Now in the interview when they told me about the job I would work instead, I had a gut feeling I should have said “no this isn’t for me” but being a fresh graduate I wanted a job and to make money, so when I got the call the next day I accepted the job.
Basically I was bait and switched, and the job i’m in now I absolutely hate. It is a call center job at a law office.
Now overall what I’m wondering is, I’ve been here a little over 2 months now, the money is fine, work environment is also fine, my coworkers are cool and my boss is ok. It is just the job that sucks and I want to quit badly, I know myself and know call center is not me. I have no issue talking with people, just this job sucks and I don’t see how the experience will help in the long run. I have more than enough customer experience, I worked at a restaurant for 5 years.

I have a possible other job lined up, but nothing is for sure. I know how most people say, “have another job lined up” but I have enough money saved up so that if I did quit, I would be fine for a good 2-5 months before I would start to really need a job, but I’d still be fine at that time too, I just would have to be real cheap and busting my ass looking for any work. I also have no issue going part-time as well if need be just for a little check while looking for full time. 
What I wanted to do after college was travel a little, hence why I have so much money saved up I could quit my job and be fine. 
My main question is, should I quit? Would it be bad on a resumè? I’ve asked people I know, read articles, all that stuff but i’m here now just looking for more advice, anything helps!",15Aug2018,1
284,"Have to keep this anonymous to be safe. 

Please forgive the essay, but I feel some backstory is required: My girlfriend comes from a fairly troubled family. There's been lots of emotional manipulation from the mother, some neglect from both parents (4-year-old left alone with irresponsible teens who tried to get him drunk/high), plenty of strange choices and fights in the family that has led to an inability to confront anyone about anything that's happened. I know she was sexually abused by an older brother's friend and it's a ""We don't talk about that"" type of deal with the whole family, and chances are there's plenty of stuff that I don't know. 

Whenever these stories come up, she's very casual about them as it's something she's lived with and has normalized, which creates a lot of tension between us as I come from a background that would never allow me to normalize such a history. I try my best to practice subtly with how shocked and sickened I am by some of the things she can now laugh about, but with every insight I can't help but shake the feeling that she and her siblings definitely suffer  from emotional trauma and would likely benefit from therapy. She's not really the type to ever admit that she needs help and that it's okay to seek it out, so I've been walking on eggshells about it for some time. 

Then her younger brother came to visit, and I learned that the siblings insist on sleeping in the same bed. Doesn't matter if other beds or entire rooms are available, they have to share the same bed. She jokes that other people think it's weird, but says it's how they grew up. It's honestly something I've never come across before, and the more I learn about the things they've all endured the more it would seem that they're likely emotionally stunted due to their abuse. The way they all seem so easily manipulated as adults, the way they have a hard time accepting responsibility for things, the way they're intensely slow to acknowledge and fix things as they're happening, how they all seem fairly lost and are obsessed with the ease of when they were teenagers and didn't have responsibilities (despite half of their friends now being drug addicts or dead). It's an incredibly difficult thing to think about, much less ever talk about, but obviously this is a person I'd like to be able to help if I can, even if it's not a relationship that will last forever. 

Likely just calling into the void, but in case anyone's particularly studied in this field I'd love some advice about how to move forward, or maybe even how I can reshape my thinking if I'm reading into all of it the wrong way. ",15Aug2018,7

286,"So hey reddit, I just joined today looking for advice in my situation. 

To summarize this i'm a 16 year old in a family in that works too hard for its own good because we're too optimistic and ambitious. Now we're by no means poor, but started so with working up from 1 house to 3 of them from the 1960s. The first 2 were restaurants and the latest one we decided to open a hotel. 

My uncle not trusting any employee to take the  role became a manager and supervisor. He is a narcissistic person who doesn't understand how hard it is because back in the day my mom lived in a family of 5 where my uncle was the oldest and eventually had a chance to go to college and moved away. So my mom family had to singlehandedly work themself tirelessly with bits of sleep and study.

Before opening the hotel, the whole family is still working themself out with being the chef, manager, advertiser because there are no employees to take that role. I tried convincing them many times just to hire someone already and just relax, but they keep telling me on how many businesses have failed because the owners were lazy People who didn't bother to supervise the employees.

So after opening one, there were more workload for my mom who worked hard the most with the restaurant's manager and being the one who actually supervise the employees. My fucking narcissistic uncle decided to open more facilities and gave EVEN MORE FUCKING WORK FOR MY MOM WHO ALREADY IS AT HER BREAKING POINT WITH LESS THAN 4 HOURS OF SLEEP PER DAY. So at this point right now I tried convincing my mom to just hire a god damn supervisor already but she keeps telling me the same fucking thing again and again and prove her point it worked because "" look at the family, we have made it this far because we did everything ourselves"" and I couldn't deny it because it was true. My mom tried speaking out against my uncle once and he said if we don't work tirelessly now then we won't have an easy future, like the old saying of ""hard work pays off"" .

Now the point I'm trying to make is that, practically at this point my mom sometimes cries herself to sleep and while working too because of how pitiful she felt. I don't know what to do anymore either, I currently can help with being a chef in the hotel and monitoring the receiptionist place but even I am breaking down. I tried sending out work offers online but non of them fit the bill or standards of my mom. I seriously don't know what to help my mom with anymore, I can feel her one day just having  a heart attack because of stress and I am very very afraid of that. So please if anyone out there know how to remedy this situation, please please just give me an advice since I pity my mom so so so much. ",15Aug2018,1

I have been suicidal for months due to absolutey insane nonstop calamity in my life. I have started to self harm which is something I've never done before. 

Numerous times I have wanted to check myself into a hospital. Two weeks ago I had an emotional breakdown and decided to go. I called my parents to let them know (we are close and talk frequently; I have attempted to discuss this issue before and they have dismissed it so I don't really try, I just wanted them to know where I was) and they FLIPPED. They said if I went to the hospital for these issues, I would be put on a cocktail of drugs I could never get off (I already take an antidepressant and medication for a chronic illness), that I would never meet a partner or have children, my chances for a career would be ruined because of the stigma. I was floored. They essentially said if I chose to seek help they would be done with me.

I chose not to go because they scared me so bad. But I'm at that place again today. I want to to but it seems like it would destroy my life.

So i (male 23) hooked up with someone last week. We didn’t do anal because we both prefer to bottom. Just a lot of oral. Now I’m scared because I feel a soreness/slight discomfort in my lower abdomen. There’s no discharge, or any uncomfortable burning while urinating. So in general, I don’t know what to think.

Even dumber, turned down a bio-engineering MOS so I could “use my degree” and became an MP. Got married, started a family, and got out after 5 years. Been in the reserves a year and a half now. I’m a stay at home mom because my oldest is special needs. 


I’d like to go back to school. And I want a degree in something worthwhile. But I’ve never really had an intense passion for anything. Ever. I’ve done numerous career tests and they all pretty much say I’d be good at something in the STEM field. I took AP Calculus and AP Chemistry (and was recommended for AP Physics), so I know I’m decent at the stuff. I just worry about getting bored. 


I’m a hands on person. Doing the same monotonous things at a desk behind a computer screen day in and out doesn’t appeal to me in the slightest. I like using my brain. I like using my hands. I’ve considered engineering of some kind, but I don’t know which and I don’t want to waste my GI bill on a field I end up hating. I hesitate on a field like nursing because I’m not a huge fan of dealing with loads of people on a regular basis.

300,"Hey folx,

I’m 23 and no degree yet. For the last five or so years I’ve been set on being a nurse. It’s good money and I like how many different options there are for career paths/work settings. I wanted to be able to serve the lgbtq+ community and i dreamed of eventually being a nurse practitioner and being able to do things like prescribe hormones to transgender people. 

I’ve been in school part time since 2015, and I’ve done all my general requirements and a couple of the prerequisite sciences (A&amp;P I, psych). Last fall I was taking microbiology, A&amp;P II, And pharmacology and... I failed all of them. I was working part time and my loans were less than I was used to so my finances got out of hands and I was so stressed... I guess I was depressed too. I slept a lot and never went to class and barely made it to work. Everytime my phone rang it filled me with dread bc I knew it was a bill collector. My credit score is still tanked from all that sadly. I was also unmedicated for my adhd. I got thru my general requirements without meds ok because I’m relatively bright, but I realize now that for sciences I actually have to hardcore study. 

I just hit my 90 days at my new job so I’ll have insurance next month and I’m planning on getting back on medication and going back to school in spring 2019. But the thing is, I’m scared now that nursing will be too hard for me since I will have to continue to work full time. Hell, I’m not even sure I can get through the entrance requirements since every program near me (north tx area) is super competitive. 

I’m thinking now that maybe I should go for a different degree, something related but less rigorous. I can always go back for a masters in nursing down the line, I know there’s programs for that. 

My current job is as a risk reduction specialist at a clinic that mostly serves lgbtq people. Basically I collect blood/urine/swabs and test for stds. HIV is a very big part of it, if I get a positive result I’m the one who gets the client into care. I really enjoy the work, I love working in a medical setting, I love being able to serve my community, and I feel like I’m doing something actually important. The money isn’t great but it’s enough to survive for now.  I would be happy to continue in HIV care, I think the science around it is fascinating. 


I know that was a lot of explanation, sorry. 

Tldr: 

is there a degree that doesn’t have difficult entrance requirements, will let me go to school part time, and will let me continue to work with lgbtq+ healthcare? Something where I can get hired with a bachelors degree.

I thought about social work but my roommate is a social worker and he couldn’t get hired anywhere with just a bachelors degree.

301,"My sister (35) is visiting me (33).  She and I got into a minor fight over which movie to watch last night. I refused to apologize after saying, half-jokingly, that she was 'mean' for wanting to change just when I was getting into it. Looking back, I would have fallen on her knees and begged her pardon rather than deal with this, but I don't like apologizing but the hurt person is cold and demanding. However, I HATE confrontation. She kept harping on me, demanding an apology, and when I wanted to leave followed me into my room. Finally I left the house for a while to escape and walk my dog. When I came back she marched into my room twice to give me ten minute lectures on my bad behavior in general and said some pretty awful stuff.

She was formerly extremely controlling and emotionally abusive toward me when I lived with her and I have a lot of anxiety related to her. I could not take it so I left the house and checked into a hotel. It is the next day and I have asked her to leave tomorrow. She says she will not because she does not have money or a phone, though she will have money transferred tomorrow. I do not want to see her again because I have my own business to deal with, I am sick, and I am enrolling in college starting Monday. I have offered to pay for a hotel for her to stay in, though she has sent me so many abusive messages I'm starting to not want to do that.

If she refuses to leave tomorrow what do I do? I have roommates and a landlord, and this is very embarrassing and stressful for me.

I feel like they are always trying to playfully guilt me into hanging out because I never come around due to being busy and it being a 2 hour round trip just to meet up. These also aren't the most versatile of friends, they can be very awkward and in-grown socially where it can feel like an inside joke competition at times.

I stopped being able to feel happy anymore, stopped feeling excited, stopped feeling a connection to other people...the warmth had all game. and from that point on all I get is feeling content for up to 3 days a week then the rest are depression so bad it sometimes crosses over to suicidal, every week, forever, for no reason. I dont have anything to be depressed about really, I live in a nice place, ive got parents that dont hurt me and sort of care about me a bit, I have a sibling, sure I have no friends and no peers, but im provided for it could be a lot worse (and will in a near future). the worst parts are I dont know why im like this, ive been to therapy but nothings working my mind just destroys itself on the regular.

im starting to not be so alone as well, im finally sort of in my first relationship (yay!) something ive wanted since I was that younger age but never had (im 21 for reference). yet even this doesnt fix me.


I cant even tell my parents im like this, that im broken. because they will DESTROY me if I do, just last week I opened up to my mother and she mocked and attacked me, she told me how selfish I was to be this way, how childish and niave I was being and to just get over it like normal people and grow up, she even did that thing where you mimic someone to mock them going ""bohoo I have problems wah wah wah"". and if I tell my father he gets VERY angry at me very fast, it is ugly to say the least, I almost got kicked out that time I told my mother. its hard when your walking the fine line between life and death, how you try so hard to stay in the one life you have but death wont stop whispering honied words in your eye, telling you how it could all be over, telling you how letting him take you will release you from the eternal torment, that you'd finally get to lie down and have it all go away you just have to take that plunge. but you fight it because it'll hurt everyone around you and its the one life you've got, but then when your standing at that cliff deciding whether to jump your OWN PARENTS are pushing you off. they are very lucky to still have me around, I know plenty of people this would have killed years ago, this level of abuse ive suffered all my life from my own family, even my sisters horrible to me on a regular basis. the worst part is im too scared of the unknown and the entire world to move out.

I know I'm going to get people that say this in itself is crazy to ""allow"" but, as I said, not a jealous person and we have all been friends for years. We probably spend 6 hours or so on the phone together most days. We know everything about each other's life, etc.

Well anyway, I'm a big fan of Google cards. My wife is paranoid that I'm cheating on her and has been for pretty much the whole time we have been together. To be fair, there was a night that I lied to her and stayed at a girl's house (we were in a rocky situation at that time and I just wanted space to think). She found out. The girl had a male roommate, nothing happened, I slept on the couch and stayed at her house when she left to go to whatever the next morning, etc. I have also hid texts from girls from her years ago.

You have to understand, my wife has depression and anxiety problems. Even though the texts were all just friendly texts, she is convinced that every girl wants me and she is not good enough. Neither are true.

Anyway, got off subject there, but it's back story. So she is paranoid of me and has all of my account info for everything. Well, apparently when she is logged in to my Google account (which is always, since she has an iPhone and paranoid) her searches show up on my Google history. Last night she searched for Usher - Make me wanna lyrics.

They are lyrics to a song about leaving the person you are with to start a new relationship. There is one other search that piqued my interest but ultimately nothing else. I went kinda far back, too.

Am I just being paranoid? Should I be concerned? I'm thinking when I go to pick her up from the airport to just have that song blaring and see her reaction or what she says. I haven't said anything yet. I have never gone through her phone and ultimately wouldn't have even known this or been suspicious had it not been for my search history changing in Google to include it. 

We have 3 boys together, ages 6, 3 and 2. I don't plan on leaving her or anything like that or if I should even confront her about it. I'm usually not like this but it's just an odd thing to search specifically for a 1998 usher song with those lyrics while on vacation with another man. Any advice appreciated.

I have lived on my own for 7 years in different kinds of student housing and have always moved to a bigger place, this time I will move to a smaller atic room.

Problems I have are: 
Finding a strategy to get rid of what I really dont need, and not get regrets/miss important stuff later and having to re buy.
For example getting rid of a closet because it is impractical in the attic room and finding I did need it and having to re buy.
getting rid of clothes I don't wear as much and later finding I dont have enough sweaters or jackets left for the cold winter.

And a lot of my furniture was inherited, belonged to family or otherwise has a personal story or attachment.
I'll never get it back if I sell it, and the stuff I dont care about personally are things like my clothesrack or bed that I will definately need.

TI:dr I am not like a hoarder or anything and my stuff fits my room right now, I just feel like I need space in my new smaller room and want to let go of the old. Are there good strategies to decluter and not get caught up in personal attachment too much and think practical? Or generic decluttering tips or rules that helped you? How do you fellow redditors declutter?

The problem is that I'm also struggling financially.

It's getting really difficult to support myself with this job especially now that they have reduced my hours. I've gotten two promotions in the past year but I'm still earning the same amount at the end of the month!!

319,"Originally posted in r/offmychest, but maybe this is a better place for it. This is a long and problematic story with a controversial topic. I need help! Because I don’t know how to feel, I’m afraid of coming off as prejudiced, and I genuinely need an outside perspective. If this needs to be in another sub please let me know, I’m desperate for input. 

I’ve always been the peacemaker when anyone is fighting in the family. I have spent many years in therapy and group for my own issues so I like to think I have something to offer. But it’s getting to the point where I’m spending hours on the phone with my mom and my sister working through this issue. I live hours away. It’s causing me such anxiety that I dread talking to either one of them. My sister is dating a trans man and it’s beginning to tear my family apart. 

This is the sequence of events. 

1. The start. 

Sister goes away for college. Her roommate (RM) comes out as trans, with They pronouns at first, and a Wiccan. Shortly after they go to He pronouns. Mom is surprised and confused, which translates into anger. It’s easy to assume why, and you wouldn’t be far off. I talk them both through an initial meltdown. First day of college. 

This happens partially because it seems that she doesn’t understand. From Mom’s perspective this is a new concept for her. She needs time to adjust. Sister is too judgemental too quickly in my opinion. Calls transphobia immediately. From Sister’s perspective she’s just trying to educate her. Mom says that she’s offended Sister would think she’s so bigoted right off the bat. Mom feels that Sister is putting her brand new relationship with RM over the relationship with her. She’s also particularly not thrilled that RM is a Wiccan because it goes against her values. She has close gay friends, alternative-lifestyle friends, and harbors no ill will towards the LGBT community. She has been nothing but supportive of my own journey. However there is clearly some underlying stuff happening here. She had too strong of an emotional reaction. 

I was instantly a little turned off myself. I don’t like that he’s hiding who he is to be in women’s housing. The university is very liberal and has accommodations across the board. Later he continues misgendering himself to get into a house built specifically for cooperative sisterhood. Not a terf situation because trans women are welcome. But he says he’s a man. Apparently it’s cheaper, but that pisses me off a little. It’s like he’s not committing fully. I want to reiterate that at this point he hasn’t told his parents, but he is in a very welcoming environment with a strong LGBT culture. He also didn’t have to be in that house. In the back of my head I wonder if he’s just wearing this. I do some soul searching to figure out if I have issues to work through. At the end of the day, I‘m not there and I’m hearing everything second hand. I can’t judge someone I don’t know so I’m not going to. 

This is the first time I was up until midnight on a work night talking them down. 

2. Growing closer. 

The first summer is here, RM and Sister are now best friends, and surprise, RM lives 20 minutes away. Mom has calmed down and spends time with them both. She’s beginning to warm up to him for Sister’s sake and to keep the peace. Still has feelings but is working on them. She reads books on the subject. Takes them to brunch and welcomes him at the house. Sister’s happiness is the most important thing here. 

3. Surprise number 2. 

One year later, they start dating. Shit hits the fan. Especially because Mom bought a hotel room in the city under false pretenses. Sister breaks the news, simultaneously coming out, in the lobby as Mom is leaving the hotel. She maintains composure, fully loving and supportive, but is deep down really shook. I already knew about this and have been keeping a secret, so we talk afterwards. For an hour on the phone. Mom didn’t bring it up because she didn’t want to out Sister, which I appreciate. In this case I call her. Then Sister calls and we talk. For an hour on the phone, because that’s how it goes. But the more Mom thinks about it, the more upset she gets. Most importantly, she feels bamboozled. She would never get a hotel room for then if she knew they were dating. 

4. Confusion with a dash of transphobia. 

RoommateBoyfriend, RB, outwardly appears and acts like a woman and is very feminine. Pink, makeup, dresses... traditionally girly presenting things. That’s his personality and is 100% confirmed to not be a mask he’s wearing for protection. Gender is fluid, boys can be girly too, so okay, I kind of get it. However it’s obviously radical, but Sister can’t admit that. It’s okay for something to be valid and not normal. Radical isn’t “bad”, so why are we pretending? I’m not pressing her on it at all, or even bringing it up, but she’s pretending it’s completely normal when it’s clearly not. It’s like she’s putting this front up which I find kind of annoying. That may be borderline, I’m afraid of coming off as transphobic, and I don’t want to offend, so more soul searching is in order. But at the end of the day, none of this is hurting anyone so who cares how he dresses. I’ll still refer to him as he because that’s what he wants. It’s really not a big deal. 

This definitely confuses things for Mom. They’re dating now and that changes things. Misgendering constantly. She does refer to RB with his dead name in anger which is not okay. Mom clearly has issues with transphobia but denies it vehemently. More cognitive dissonance. Never says any of this to Sister, only to me. I’m keeping more secrets and holding back the flood to keep the peace. 

5. More minor annoyances. 

Sister’s sexuality is becoming her personality now that she’s out and proud. A little annoying, but this isn’t uncommon so I understand. Mom, less so. Now they’re in love. RB refers to them as a lesbian couple, which really upsets me. I say nothing. He’s otherwise a fine person. Sister starts referring to herself as gay. She’s bi/pansexual. So am I. Sister implies that I’m not as queer as her which is disappointing and a little more than irksome. (I came out first, btw.) But I don’t want to push her away so I swallow my feelings. 

She continues to refuse to acknowledge her relationship as nontypical in any way, and now constantly expects special treatment. She assumes that she should be able to do things that Mom would never allow me to do. (I wasn’t allowed to have a sleepover with my boyfriend until we were together for over a year). Any reasonable pushback from Mom is considered transphobia and met with a lecture on trans issues. But she’s still not too far off base. 

6. Mom continues to swallow her feelings. This builds up over time. She has an emotional reaction whenever his name is mentioned, but swallows it. Calls are coming in constantly from both sides. There’s massive amounts of tension, but they have a good relationship otherwise.

7. The dam breaks. Yesterday, Mom tells her how she feels once and for all, she had to, she can’t hold it in anymore. (Even though she has been sharing this whole time, to the point that Sister is very aware of her feelings. But there’s some cognitive dissonance going on here.) A serious conversation takes place. Mom does not like RB for many reasons. Doesn’t directly say it’s because he’s trans, and makes sure to state that she would be fine with a different trans man, a trans woman, a cis woman, that it doesn’t matter. She doesn’t like RB and thinks he’s shady. Sister says that she doesn’t care how she feels because she hasn’t liked any of the men Mom dates either. I have to agree, her taste isn’t great. She dates men with strong, masculine, sometimes overbearing personalities. But this really upsets Mom and she walks away feeling like their relationships has changed. Sister thinks this isn’t a big deal because her relationship as normal as her previous relationships. More putting up fronts and more cognitive dissonance. 

8. The escalation. 

One day goes by. Phone calls and texts, left and right. Not that I haven’t been playing therapist this entire time, but it’s reached a new level. My throat tightens every time I see a new message. Mom does not support it and will refuse to facilitate any contact. Sister is no longer allowed to use our mom’s car to visit him. Makes very transphobic comments. She says she supports trans people and thinks their struggles are admirable, but does not subscribe to RB’s particular brand. Calls it a mental disorder. Sister is far enough removed emotionally to not have too strong a reaction. Their relationship is still fine on the surface. I’m afraid for the fallout that will inevitably happen. 

9. Moving forward. 

Sister is starting a new semester next week. She is studying abroad and will be away from RB for months. I secretly hope they breakup and I’m not sure if it’s my own issues with him or for the sake of the family. I fear that Mom’s doubling down is going to make my sister hold on tighter. Mom’s agrees but still feels she had to say something. 

And that’s where we are now. 

This has now been 2 years of constant back and forth with me in the middle and I just can’t do it anymore. It’s over my pay grade. I just want everyone to get along and I can’t see how that will happen at this point. I want our mom to deal with her issues. I don’t know if that’s possible. I’m not convinced that this is 100% on her, though my sister hasn’t really done anything wrong. She loves who she loves and that’s okay, but the way she’s handling things is alienating everyone else. I’m imploring them to go to therapy but the damage might be done. I have no one to talk to about this except my boyfriend, but he has a great relationship with both of them and doesn’t want to touch this with a 10-foot pole. 

It’s now affecting my mental health and my relationship with both of them. I need a reality check badly. Has anyone else been through something like this? 

TLDR: Sister is dating a possibly problematic trans person. Conservative but otherwise open minded Mom is not taking it well. I play therapist for 2 years. Please help.

323,"One of my family members is currently in the hospital, only slightly conscious after going through a detox and having a few scary moments where the doctors weren't sure if he'd make it. He has a long history of drinking and kind of always moving from place to place and finding a way to live with different people but this is the worst it's ever been. He was completely unconscious for almost a week and just recently has started talking a little but we're not sure he fully understands where he is or what is going on. 

At the hospital we are trying to help him fill out the form for Medical assistance but they need a form of ID. This is taking place in Pennsylvania, and he only has a drivers license that expired over 6 years ago (2012) and some bills to his mothers house. Is there any way that we can help him to get ID with him being unable to do anything himself? Even if he was able to call/sign paperwork is there any way we can help him to get ID? Would his mother somehow be able to get his birth certificate.

325,"Okay, so my sister was with a guy for a few months and ended up getting pregnant. He cheated, she broke up with him/told him she wanted nothing to do with him and he was not going to be in the child's life.

The baby is due in a couple of months, and the more time that goes on, the more wrapped up in thoughts I get about this whole thing.

326,"Hi everyone !

So i'm 20 years old male and  i never had a real relationship with someone (with real i mean a relationship lasting a significant amount of time)

I always wanted to find a SO but lately that is changing.  
Sometimes i catch myself thinking what being in relationship is like and how my personality (For example :  Not wanting to give justification to anyone ; Not wanting to deal with jealousy , etc...) and time of my life does not fit in a relationship. When in this mindset i do feel good about being single.

But in other hand sometimes i feel socially and self pressured to find a girlfriend because i feel lonely ,unaccomplished romantically and lacking emotion support that comes with a good relationship.  


This mixed feelings sabotage one another. I don´t take action in dating or engaging with girls because i feel i want to be single , but a few days later i'm talking with a girl trying to go on a date and the cycle repeats it self.

So to start, i'm 15, I was always that one kid in the class. The one who stared at all the girls and quite noticeably too. I had a lot of ""girlfriends"" if you even want to call it that because i was only in grade school, but some things throughout my grade school life have really been beating me up lately and that is, if it wasn't obvious already, gay thoughts. 

In preschool there was this girl i ""liked"" again, i say that loose because i was only like 4 and i hung out with her a lot. Never even thought that other boys were good looking. It was just girls. Kindergarden rolls around, i think i went up to some boy and called him cute. I can't remember if i was just trying to annoy him or what, but i feel like it was just my way of saying that he wasn't ugly or some shit because kids dont keep to themselves, let's be real. I also remember telling my mom that my karate teacher was ""handsome"" and i feel like i was just trying to say that he wasn't an ugly guy just like the other boy, but i don't even remember if i did these things and i feel like they're false memories, but they feel so real, so if they are real i don't want to store them away you know? I'm gonna have to confront them. (I suffer from HOCD) I also remember thinking a girl was hot in my kindergarden class too. So if that helps at all. 

Basically every grade on it's been me and girls. Wanting to kiss, hug, hold hands, that kind of thing (didn't know about sex until like 3rd grade.) I got my first ""girlfriend"" in 2nd grade haha. We didnt even do anything i basically said i liked her and we said we were ""dating"" but just talked a lot. Same story with 3rd grade, except i ""kissed"" her and i use that term lightly because it was like we rammed our face together like trains. Peck on the lips kind of thing. Now in 4th grade, i ""dated"" like every girl in my class. I remember exactly because i was the reason that for the rest of 4th grade all guys had to sit on one side and all girls on the other for lunch, and we also weren't allowed to talk to girls during recess. I was real mature for my age. I mean, i was already trying to get sex when i havent even masturbated yet myself. Haha. 

This is where the issues lie. 5th grade comes and i dont know what happened. I come to school, eyeball a girl, ""date"" her and we ""break up"" like any other kids and it's a big to do. I remember breaking up with her because i thought she smelled lol, but it was her best friend that was always with her so i got the wrong idea. 

Now, this was the year i started using porn and masturbating. The first thing i masturbated to was a girl from a tv show i remember exactly. After that it was a bunch of porn of girls. A LOT. Then eventually i stumble across gay porn, i don't remember how or why but i did and i masturbated to it quite a few times. Then i stopped. I thought it wasn't me, it's not right, so i stopped. I kind of just forgot about it until a few months ago. It took me 5 years to remember this. FIVE. So that also makes me wonder if that was a false memory too, i even remember putting things up my ass and imagining other guys from school. It was so bad, and it honestly embarasses me to talk about it because i don't want to be looked at that way, you know? I want to be straight, have sex with girls, never think about penis ever because i just want girls. I want to be that guy to plow vagina and be able to tell who gives best head. That kind of guy.

But of course there's more, a friend and i wanked eachother off twice. He did it to me twice and i did it to him 3 times. (1 time in 6th. 2 times 7th if i'm not mistaken.) I'll explain in a minute. He's straight and he doesn't let it bother him. He goes and has sex with girls all of the time now. Unlike me, still a virgin and upset. We did it one while watching straight porn, and once while imagining other girls doing it, and then i did it to him once but he didnt do it to me, only because he asked and we were good friends. I thought it was just a ""bro thing to do"" i thought lots of straight guys do it and what's the harm if it's less work for me? Plus i get to imagine the hottest girls in class. Needless to say, i was ashamed. All 3 times. Disgusted. I kept having to convince myself i was straight. I eventually got over it and moved on. In 6th grade i was as horny as possible. 5th and 6th for that matter. (So i was 11 or 12) I really wanted sex (what 12 year old doesn't) and i also had a ""girlfriend"" in both 6th and 7th grade. (6th i was 12 and 7th I was 13 years old.) After that, no gay thoughts, nothing, i spent most of 6th and 7th grade trying to get laid and a good majority of 8th. i was single throughout all of 8th grade. (I was 14). I tried so hard to get pussy and just didn't succeed, unfortunately. Recently my friend told me he macked his girl after 2 days of dating her and i got so jealous and angry if that helps, I got that ""why wasn't it me damnit"" feeling. If that sheds light.

Now i am 15. My HOCD kicked in towards the end of 9th grade and everything i've done from 5th, 6th, and 7th just came rushing back to me. Earlier in the 9th grade year a gay kid came onto me and i started having a panic attack. He kept asking for nudes and i kept saying no and i was about to have a heart attack i was so uncomfortable in the situation, i didn't send him nudes and i just ignored him. I have nothing against gays or bis. I would be friends with you regardless of your orientation. I'm just saying that i have a fear of being attracted to the same sex. 

I have a girlfriend of 9 months now who i can say i love dearly. She is everything to me. I haven't been able to mack yet but i will soon because my parents are HUGE and i mean HUGE cock blocks. ""No sex in my house"" so we have to go outside next time i see her.

Anyway, so does all of this sound like porn addiction related stuff? I know that people on NoFap are straight and watched gay porn. I did watch A LOT of porn and i'm even having trouble not watching porn now, like i can't stop. I tried NoFap and failed after 2 weeks but it made my HOCD go away for a bit.

That's it though guys. Thank you for reading. I swear this is not a troll post. I made this account for the sole reason of making these posts to a few helpful subreddits because i really need some reassurance that i'm indeed straight. Please believe me guys i can't prove that im not a troll any other way. Any help is appreciated, and thank you for your help if you do decide to read.",15Aug2018,1
341,"I know it might not be as serious as other things but I’ve never really been in this situation. My bf is the most amazing guy I’ve ever met and I don’t want to fight with him for something that doesn’t really matter anymore.

Today my I was deleting some pictures and came across a few of my ex and a scar(I kept it to remind myself not to do that again) I got really mad while remembering some stuff my mind chose to ignore till now.  I posted my angry rant on r/UnsentLetters, wanting to get that off my chest, it was addressed to my last SO. The problem is my bf got a glimpse of it, and I think he got scared of something he saw because he kept asking if it was for him. We tell each other everything and he knows some things mentioned in the letter just not all of them, partially because I know he’d get sooo mad at my ex for finding out what he did(already hates him and doesn’t know everything), he’d be hurt by my pain, and also as mentioned above even I “forgot” some of them.

He thinks I’m hiding something from him and things are kinda tensed between us. I’m afraid of how he’d react if he founds out, not in a bad way I just don’t want to hurt him, but I also can’t stand lying to him. I’m away for a couple of days but when I come back I must either show him that or something else. Should I show it to him ?

I’m close to my guy friend and his girlfriend seems to like the sweatshirts since I wore them before in front of her. Is it wrong to do that? I don’t have a reason to keep them anymore.

344,"I didn’t want it to come to this point because I love him and he loves me. I know this will devastate him and it will sadden me but I have to face reality. As of now we have been dating for 5 1/2 months soon to be 6.

I took a year off school and I went on vacation to another country this spring and met an amazing guy. After a few hang outs we started dating, everything was great and he was my first as was I to him. We spent one month long distance before summer then I came back. Since then we have been together almost every day because I was and still am on vacation. We have started making plans about the future, career, getting our own place.. etc because in the beginning, and throughout some time, I had this strong objective/feeling of moving countries to stay here with him and start a new life here. I thought everything would be great but really really looking at it, I wouldn’t be happy.

Now here’s the bad part... after some time I’ve been thinking if I really want this, if this move will be a positive and will bring me success and happiness to my life and I don’t think it will. I want to go back to my country for the fall and start studying in university in a program in hopes of getting a career that I could say I would enjoy waking up to go do. Get a job and start my own life as an adult. I miss my family, I don’t entirely miss my home country I just think it’s the reality of things and success for the long term.

I have brought this up before to him (what if I want to go back, or I can’t stay here, etc..) and he said and still is more than happy in going through the progress of moving countries himself to stay with me. The problem is he barely speaks English and he will not be happy there after some time. ( a woman knows) I don’t have a place for him as of now so he has no where to stay and everything will just be stressful and confusing. This is not to say I don’t love him or I want someone else because if I knew that we would be happy and successful in the long term I would stay with him.

We have sooo many memories good and bad and this hurts to have to come to do this and even write this. Sometimes I wish I hadn’t even taken that first vacation. How do I do this without hurting him...how...?",15Aug2018,1
345,"I'm on holiday with my parents (I'm 16) and it's been mostly ok up until today. Before we left, I asked my parents to not have too much to drink in the evenings, as although they don't get violent, aggressive or black out drunk, I don't enjoy spending time with them if they're drunk.

They kept to this mostly but my mum has been slipping the past few days and last night every time I said something that sounded even remotely critical, she would get upset at me. (For example, she loudly criticised a waiter for having poor English so I jokingly suggested that his English is better than our Spanish)

She's been complaining constantly which I keep trying to get us to stop talking about because it brings the tone down, but every mention makes her more upset.

It's basically peaked today, and we still have about a week to go. I decided to chill by myself in my room this evening and my dad decided to have a word with her, later told me that she broke down in tears because she thinks she's ruining the holiday.

I tried talking to her quietly later, didn't bring up anything negative but just gave her a hug and said I loved her, and said ""I'm looking forward to going out for dinner tonight as a family"" and she basically brushed me off and said she isn't going.

The way I see it, she's ruining this holiday by being constantly negative and I can feel the tension between me, her and my dad. I don't even know what the hell to do and I'm afraid that this is going to have an impact on our family relationship.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can try to fix this? I'm feeling miserable about it, my dad is visibly upset at how this is playing out, and I hate seeing everyone upset. But because my mum is taking everything I say and do as an insult (and I mean it when I say I'm not actually being rude in anything I say), it's impossible to have a good holiday.

350,"I'm 17, when I turn 18 I want to move in with my mom until I'm able to get on my feet because the environment at her house is so much better. It's not deathly silent 24/7, I feel so much more welcome and like I'm able to be myself, I won't be alone 24/7, or feel ashamed of myself, and I'll be able to fix my relationship with her and my sisters. 

I am *legally* adopted by my grandparents, because sadly both my mom and dad were addicts and weren't ready for kids when they had me or my older sister. Me and my sister were separated, so I lived with my dads parents while my sister lived with my mom's filthy rich parents. My mom is finally getting her life back together, is with somebody new, and pretty much owns a house. But my grandparents hate her, because in their eyes she's the one who ruined my dad's life. Most of my family doesn't really agree with her lifestyle either, because she smokes pot. But I know nothing about her side of the family. I'm not sure whether or not to feel guilty for wanting to move out or what, either. 

I'm sorry for kind of rambling, but it needs some context. The environment at my grandma's house isn't really the best. They're older, and they work. But my grandpa is severely controlling. He gets mad when my grandma spends her own money on me, because I don't *need* any of it, when she's trying to be supportive of my interests - like painting, or how I love animals. He won't even let me get a job, because every time I talk about getting one he starts complaining about how he'll have to drive me there because I don't know how to drive yet, and it'll mess with his own work day. He doesn't even have an office, he can literally go to work at 9-10AM in the morning unless he has a meeting, so he's just complaining. He tried getting me a job working with him - without telling me first - which is a really bad idea considering how he treats my grandmother. He told her once that nobody wanted her, because she threatened to leave. 

I have no idea how to handle this, because I feel so bad for wanting to move out. But the environment is toxic, and my grandma clings to me like I'm her last hope. It's really suffocating. I want to love her, and I want to be there for her, because she's done a lot for me. But with my grandpa involved it's so difficult to appreciate everything she's been trying to do. He always tells me she's wrong for it, and how much he hates his life, and complains about how the biggest mistake he ever made was marrying her, and since it's *always* been like this, I keep taking his side even though I don't want too - if that makes any sense. He's been the only male role model in my life, and I don't even like him.  He's even told me that when I was little(6 years old or so) - he never wanted to leave work because he felt he had nothing to come home too. I'm just lost on what to do. ",15Aug2018,1

352,"Lately she’s started nagging me about my eating habits, she’ll eye me passive aggressively if I’m about to eat something relatively unhealthy. Keep in mind that I’m a 19 year old who’s hardly home anymore due to work and school so it’s not like I’m home enough to for her to actually know my eating habits. 
Anyway, last night she made a particularly rude comment about me needing to go on a diet and start going on runs with my younger brother (who she’s also been making negative comments about his weight).  Now I’m all for constructive criticism and her caring about my health IF that were the case- but it’s not. I know she thinks I’m fat and unpresentable, as she’s explicitly told me and honestly I don’t know how much longer I can take of her comments and side glances. It’s also very concerning for me because I’m afraid for my younger brothers self esteem. He’s always struggled with his weight and I worry that her comments towards him could ruin his body image quicker than any bully at school might. With that being said, it’s not as if we are unhealthily heavy or obese. I’m relatively average for my height and my brother is just slightly overweight but he’s in a multitude of sports that he excels at and has very healthy eating habits.

357,"Bit of background: I'm a 23 year old dude currently on medication for anxiety and depression. I've had issues with anxiety since I was a young kid, needing child therapy at about 10 years old because I was petrified of being kidnapped/attacked/ran over or any other general bad stuff that could happen to a kid. I used to pretend to be sick to get out of school even during primary school, due to an intense anxiety related to it that went beyond just not wanting to go to school, it was that deep horrible anxious feeling you get in your stomach when something really scary is about to go down, and this was just going to school and hanging out with my friends all day. It's possible I may have had agoraphobia from a young age reading that back, it would definitely make sense. Luckily, I'm feeling a lot better in myself lately. Although my anxiety issues caused me to drop out of university and mess up the two attempts at holding down a job I have already attempted, I have started to feel a new confidence in myself which I have never felt before. Since starting medication I've also started going to the gym and lifting weights 3 times a week. This has made a world of difference and I genuinely feel like a new man. This is all great, but I'm now at the point where it's time for me to man up, get a job, move out of home and start being more independent, but I'm terrified at the idea of getting a job.

I feel the same pit in my stomach I used to get as a kid just thinking about it, as I'm petrified of falling back down into the rabbit hole of anxiety and depression. I feel like if I end up getting a job that I really dislike that all the progress I've made with my mental health over the last 6 months or so will be completely ruined. I don't know whether I should take a little more time taking my medication, going to the gym etc so that I can build a stronger foundation for my mental health, or whether or not this would just be a bad excuse to avoid getting a job and continue being dependent on others. I want to get my own place, learn to drive, make some money and actually finally feel like an adult, but this is a serious barrier that's standing in my way. I don't really know what to do, so I thought I'd put this ramble out there and maybe get some advice. Thanks guy, appreciate it.

366,"Hey there reddit.

I was seeing a woman since about october.  We were getting along great,  or so I thought... We'd attend church occasionally,  I introduced her to my family,  we'd go dancing and have lots of fun,  we'd spend the day cuddling and watching TV.  I started to fall for her.

We had a few arguments along the way,  but nothing major.  Mostly about her drinking.

Then I woke up one morning and had this weird gut feeling that something wasn't right.  She had been very distant that week and where she normally would jump at the chance to spend time with me,  now she always had something else to do.

Sure enough,  she dumped me that very day.  Her reasons were incredibly vague,  and I could tell she was lying--  but I accepted it and tried to make the break as clean and classy as I could.

Fast forward two weeks and she shows up on my doorstep unannounced.  She lays two bombshells on me.

1) she cheated on me,  The information was kinda welcome,  because I was still pretty confused about her reasons for breaking up.

2) despite us using birth control,  she was pregnant.

I was dubious whether it was mine or not!  But she had a picture of the ultrasound..and I was prepared to provide and raise the kid if the paternity test came back positive...  I was extremely apprehensive for the child, and about co-parenting with someone who was a proven liar, cheat,  with some addiction issues.  But I choked it down and told her my door was always open...  Things ended badly between us,  but the kid was top priority now.

Fast forward a little bit and she miscarried--  After throwing a monkey wrench in things, apparently she went on a drinking binge, and perhaps more (?) Who knows.  I feel like there were so many lies,  and she's just giving me the bare amount of honesty.  I don't trust a word she says--  not even her empty apologies.  What if she decided to keep it and cut me out of the parenting process?  Theres not much I can't handle,  except dishonesty.   I can't trust her and I feel like a fool for ever doing so.

I thought I was OK.  But I'm really not.  I tried to stay positive through it all,  but I just feel weary.  I can feel the anger and hurt down deep,  where it's hard to reach.  I burst into tears today,  out of the blue.  It caught me by surprise a little bit.

To top it all off,  I have romantic feelings for another girl now... We've known each other for about a year and we've grown quite close over the last two weeks...  But I'm scared to engage,  because I don't want to bring this baggage with me,  it's just too soon.

I can't approach my friends/family because I'm ashamed of being deceived,  and she's made me feel like my affection is worth nothing.  The miscarriage is also partially my fault,  because half the DNA was mine.  I feel responsible.

How can I feel clean again?  I feel betrayed,  and I feel like a life was lost,  and it's my fault.  It's eating away at me.

368,"**TLDR: Me &amp; My boyfriend are doing Long distance for half a year now, we've been arguing few times a week. When I get upset about a problem, I have a trouble opening up to him. It makes me really scared to talk to him since it happened a lot of times, he gets mad when I tell him my feelings about an issue and when I don't tell him, he will get even more mad. I don't know what to do. It makes me suffer inside because I have depression I don't know who to go to.**   


I love my boyfriend very much, we've been dating for half a year now. We are 9 hours apart &amp; we grew up with different cultures (A lot of things we don't see eye to eye.) I want to ask some help from someone who is neutral and look at both side.  
I want to tell you my side of my background.  
I have depression for almost a year now, I've been dealing it alone most of the time.. Few times a week i would get breakdown where my mind tells me I'm not good enough or find things i need to fix myself. I rarely talk to my boyfriend about it, I mostly keep it to myself and bottle everything up. I don't have any friends to keep my mind off, I don't have friends to contact with even when I try, I get ignored or usually I'm the one asking for their time to hang out with me. I do have my sister &amp; my dad though. I only contact my sister few times a week so most of the time i feel really lonely. I've been trying to seek female friends to go hang out to help me cope with my depression but I never had the luck. I usually positive around people I never want to spread negative energy to others. I usually try to distract (drawing, video games, watch videos, etc) myself when the feeling comes, sometimes it can be too much to handle.

When me &amp; my boyfriend argue it can affect my emotions, I'm always afraid to talk to him whenever I get upset or if i have something on my mind. I don't recall any time I do open up he doesn't get upset. He would raised his voice at me &amp; misunderstand what I'm truly upset about. I keep rephrasing but it's so difficult he so stuck on one sentence even when I reaffirm him it's not his fault because it is not right to point fingers at the partner in an argument. Sometimes he would say I don't have the right to think like this or I can't compare this to this problem when I wasn't but to him i was. When he thinks like that I have to apologize for not wording it properly to his understanding..   


I find it difficult to communicate with him. He always ask me to open up but when I do, it gets misunderstood and then he gets mad. I've been bottling up so much I don't know what to do...I just want to explain what I'm feeling and i just want to be heard and listened. When i don't tell him he gets even more mad and saying how I expect him to read my mind. I really hate it when he says that... I told him a lot of times that I am afraid of talking to him.  
He would raised his voice at me and it never felt so welcomed. When he gets really mad he would call me ""miss always right"", ""everything's all about me"" and calls me ""selfish"" when it comes to this i'll get angry and hang up on him because I don't want to hear it. I know I shouldn't hang up in mid argument, I have so much anger i don't want to release it on to him and say things I'll regret. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong when he talks about his problem I always say ""Thank you for talking about it I'll try to understand it better.""   


There are some things I have to work on also I do acknowledge I cut him off sometimes when we talk, Lately i've been doing better so that's why I started saying Thank you for talking about it I do appreciate it and we discuss about what he is upset about.   


I don't understand how come I let him know how i feel, I end up being the wrong &amp; he'll respond ""i have nothing to say"". Why ask me to open up knowing that i have fears of talking if it meant to be put aside or blame me saying i have no right to think like that?  
Everything i type is all the negative side of him when it comes to argument other than that he does a lot for me, he's an wonderful boyfriend, most amazing human being in my life.. It just really hurts when we argue..  
if this keeps going on, and I feel like it will affect our relationship in a bad way.  
I have trouble communicating with him, I want to seek help from others opinion what I should do because I am really confused. I really love him so much.. we've been arguing so frequently it very difficult for both of us.

373,"Around almost 4 years ago I met a girl online. We hit it off instantly and we were from the same place in our native country so it was much easier to connect because we both spoke the same language as well. The only real shitty thing about it was that we live 11-12 hours away and back then, we were seniors in high school/freshman in college and neither of us could commit to anything like that. Time went on, we stayed best friends throughout our college careers. We were also on and off for a bit but with jobs/internships/full time school schedule, it was rough and we decided maybe it wasn’t meant to be. We dated other people in this time, but nothing worked for either of us and dating other women only showed me that I still love her. Always have, didn’t ever stop. We talk almost everyday, flirt, send each other cute videos of cats and babies on twitter, send each other birthday presents, all of that.

Also might be useful to mention we have never met in real life before.

None of my irl friends really know about her because they’re the type to not understand long distance with someone you’ve met online and that’s fine, but I don’t want waste 5 hours to explain internet culture to them lol. 

Anyway, I have been contemplating driving to her house during thanksgiving break this coming November but a part of me thinks it’s a stupid thing to do. 

I was thinking about writing a letter, bringing her favorite flower + favorite bottle of wine with two glasses and showing up outside her place (we always joke about me coming and I know she’d be okay with that).

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Should I just say fuck it and take the leap? Any advice will be greatly appreciated &lt;3 thank you for reading.

(She doesn’t have a reddit even though I’ve been trying to get her on the reddit grind for years lol so I’m not too worried about this getting out)

It's dense and I try to memorize and grasp each word and situation, what lead people there and so forth. It's still complicated because every single event is always caused by a myriad of factors.

375,"So I work on a committee, purely volunteer. 
There’s a member on the committee that is straight up handicapped with zero networking/tact. He’s a thinker and loves to belittle. He has an insanely negative attitude. I’ve worked for 10 years. He’s been out 6 months. I work my ass of 24/7 and tonight I have a reminder to all the people that were there to represent our profession. He never ever ever let’s go of the chance to drop a little nugget in there about my experience or how he’s more suitable for a position. Kicking people. Poking people. Generally doing things not acceptable with social media or working environment. Overall destructive or negative comments. 

So tonight when I said to everyone (because you can’t single them out) that everyone just be cool etc etc media etc and so on. Awesome it all went well. 

Then Straight after the meeting I get cornered... I’m berated for two hours, language I hear once in a blue moon to make me feel little talking over my head etc you’re a liar, manipulative basically a shit talker.

377,"sorry if this is a long read but i have to talk it all out i'm sorry but I HAVE TO, TLDR at the bottom

so i was a handsome teenager (not so handsome anymore cz i stopped taking care of my look) i had lots of friends lots of sex friends and a beautiful supportive girlfriend i was a popular guy and most of the people i meet will like me life was just awesome !!!

until one day, i sat with myself and wondered ""he if i keep doing this, how the hell will i be able to pay rent and bills 2 or 3 years later"" and the answer was...I WON'T BE ABLE TO, so i took a little bit of my time and started investing in myself and teaching myself how to code (i always liked to make consumer software) so yeah i did that BUT.... all these vibes from all the people around me they were just KILLING my productivity 

""hey James my girlfriend left me""

""hey James my boyfriend left me""

""hey James my parents are out of town come over""

and my inner self  was like, ""hey James this has to end fucker, we've got work to do""

so things continued that way until everything started to fall apart i got troubles with every one EVERY ONE and i learned something that broke my heart, my girlfriend was just with me to make her ex jealous and when he got back with her she just dumped me ""we've been together for 7 months"" i felt used here.

so i decided to end it all i deleted all my social media accounts changed my phone, my number, and i moved out to a new apartment faaaaaar away from the city i used to live in, everything was just fine but right now i miss my past all my friends the girls the sex life i miss everything, i barely go out anymore and if i do i'll be scared to meet any new friends since i am convinced that somehow in some way history will repeat itself i never visited my old city after i moved out but a lot of rumors spread about my disappearance the most famous one is that i died.

sometimes i just wish if i am able to travel back in time and live my past for just one day and then going to the present again but we all know that this is impossible.

i don't want to get back to my old life i just don't want to but this is driving me crazy there has to be something else to do but i just can't figure out what that is.

TLDR: i miss my past that is full of friends and girls but i can't go back to the same lifestyle because i need to focus on work and right now i'm just lonely as fuck and people in my old city thinks i'm dead!",15Aug2018,1
379,"I'm sitting at home right now after having called in sick even though I am not sick at all. I just started this job about a month ago, and already I can feel myself falling into the same patterns that I had at my previous place of employment. 

While working an office job for about a year, I took a sick day once a month. Like clockwork. About 1/3 of the time was I actually sick. Most of the time, I was just dreading the idea of going into work, due to the fact that my job was mostly sitting on Reddit all day, which I felt I could do at home just as well. 

This new job is far more intensive and overwhelming at times. I woke up this morning an hour before my alarm out of sheer panic. I had a stressful day ahead of me, and couldn't conceptualize going into work. Without getting into too many specifics, the stressful aspect of today will not be waiting for me tomorrow, it was specific to this day. Also, just to clarify, I do have paid sick days at this job.

I just worry that I rely too heavily on mental health days. I don't know how many I should take, and if I continue this pattern in my new job, I fear that I may eventually be fired. 

How many mental health days do you think are valid? What do you do when you can't stomach the idea of getting up and going into work?

I'm working for a new company called REDACTED (as in I'm redacting it because I don't want to come off like a hidden shill; the company isn't called REDACTED although that would be rad) and part of my job is to reach out to people to get them to license and upload videos us. (FOR MONEY––we're not evil)

We have a Google Drive with unlimited storage I can point them to, but for people to upload to it they need a Google account and available space on THEIR Drive. 

The best thing I have found is the Dropbox Request link which allows people to upload files even without an account but it has limitations in that they can't upload folders and there is limited visibility for them besides a confirmation alert. More complicated projects put a lot of work on the people we're asking videos from and later put a lot of work on me.

Is Dropbox the best provider of this service? Most of these companies are really good at giving you options for sharing but not for asking people to share.

386,"**TL;DR:** Mom has a tenant that smokes living in the spare bedroom. I feel that this puts us at greater risk for cancer and is a fire hazard. I want to get rid of the tenant.

So my mom is renting out a room to someone who smokes. We have a rule that she can only smoke outside but have occasionally caught her smoking in her room. Even when she does smoke outside, the door she uses is right in the kitchen and so she always brings in the heavy smell of cigarette smoke on her clothes and breath which lingers in the air for quite a while.

This is a serious health risk to everyone who lives in the house. Exposure to second or third hand smoke causes lung cancer and any number of other ailments that could literally kill us. Additionally, the risk of a fire being started by the tenant smoking in her room is also of grave concern (my mom's dad died in a house fire caused by his cigarette butt).

My mom needs the money from renting that room out but so far has found willing tenants with relative ease (this tenant is the 4th one to be in that room). So I feel she could find a non-smoker pretty easily if she decides to no longer rent to smokers. 

The smoker also said she's tired of hearing complaints about her smoking indoors and threatened to look for a different place to live (she denies smoking in her room even though we have photos of smoke coming from her window). Perhaps I could ramp up the accusations of her smoking indoors to heckle her into leaving.

A less drastic solution could be for the smoker to use e-cigs or nicotine patches, or perhaps she could smoke by the back door instead of the one by the kitchen. However she's very confrontational when anyone tries to suggest she change her smoking habits in any way whatsoever.

I'm not really sure what to do here but I know that I don't want my mom to die like her dad did. What can I do to protect her and myself?",15Aug2018,1
389,"I am a 24 yo female and I have just recently started my first real relationship. I had a couple of flings before but have always ended them because I had no feelings for those people. This time it is different. I think my current bf is my first true love and it is the first time I have opened up like this to someone.

The problem is, I don’t enjoy the relationship as much because I live in a constant fear that he will stop loving me. Or that he will cheat on me. I keep having images in my head of how he cheats on me with another girl, how he calls me and tells me that it is over because he just doesn’t have any more feelings or similar scenarios that just keep rolling in my head.

Now the difficult part is that we are currently in a long distance relationship and won’t see each other for the next 4 months. So trust is extremely important. It is worth noting that my boyfriend has been perfect throughout this whole relationship. He tells me and shows me as much as he can that he truly loves me and the he would never cheat on me. He assures me that whatever happens he will be honest with me and yes, he cannot promise me that he will love me forever because he cannot know this, especially not after a 4 month relationship, which is understandable.

The problem is definitely not him or this relationship. The problem lies within my fear of being rejected. I have always had a need in being liked and accepted by everyone, but it is much harder when it’s your partner and you’re still living in fear of being rejected someday, even if he constantly reminds you of how much he loves you.

Otherwise, I  have the sweating, the diabetes requiring insulin but it's not type 1 or type 2 diabetes. I have the eye drooping symptoms, the hard time lifting my head, pain and fatigue when chewing, pain in the distal parts of my limbs, weakness in my arms and legs and muscle atrophy in my right calf.

To be honest, I'm scared shitless. I want to believe that I will be fine, but I also know that the prognosis for this disease is not a great one. If I do have it, then hopefully I have type 2 and not type 1.  I have all these dreams for my future, I'm pursuing a chemistry degree at the moment and I already have a philosophy B.S.

406,"Throwaway account because I don’t want the little friends I have to see this. 

Every breathe I take hurts. I’m sorry for the length of this in advance. I’ll try to make it as short as possible. I want to be as open and as raw as I can. 

I was raped by two family members for over 13 years. Made to eat my own vomit by my mom, raped by friends, partners, cheated on hit by my dad and partners. I was watched every night by a family member when I would go to sleep. I have developed ptsd and a dissociative disorder because I had no idea how to cope with this pain. So that disorder is my coping mechanism I developed for myself unintentionally. I’ve have zero guidance my whole life and to top it off I’m a very submissive timid person. So I’ve always felt completely lost. I have no family. I cling tight to whoever I’m in a relationship with because I’m in so much pain and and any to make them happy but also want to be loved so fucking bad. That is a very short version of my horrendous past. 

To say the least I’m broken. I love helping others. I love when others are happy. It’s all I’ve ever wanted for myself but I feel joy in seeing others have it. 

Onto my current situation. I met someone absolutely fucking amazing. He got into my mind like no other human being he’s intelligent beyond comprehension. I’m from the US he is from Germany. I moved here about a week and a half ago. He got me away from my abusive home-life. Wanted to marry me. We have the rings. But I fucked it all up. We are still in a relationship but commitment of marriage is on hold. I communicate poorly because idk how the fuck to do it. Also I want to clarify he’s not at all mean about any of this. He treats me VERY well. This was my own doing. I deflect things and get too consumed by my emotions. He doesn’t expect me to just be okay. He wants to give me guidance , a place to live free of rent even if we don’t work out. He knows how hard it is to be in a new country. He’s an amazing human being. But I made him question our relationship. Understandably because the way I acted when I first got here was fucking bad. Not intentionally and he knows that but it’s entirely different than who he and I both thought I was. He needs to do what makes him happy. He took care of a horrible ex for 3 years waiting and waiting on her to treat him well. He has pain and triggers. I fully understand his hesitation. He loves me clearly because he is literally giving me life. I have fucking nothing. He doesn’t have to do any of this. Doesn’t have to support me even if we aren’t together. I’m so fucking grateful. He’s not saying we won’t work out but he wants me to focus on my happiness first. We aren’t on a break still in a relationship and everything. I’m sorry I suck at explaining. I’m shaking and crying while writing this. I’m going to try my absolute best for him. I really really really love him. 

So what’s the problem right? It’s hard but I just need to try and see if we will work out if not I still have a place. So what’s the problem?

There’s one huge problem. And I have no clue how to think otherwise and it terrifies me. I won’t tell him and make him feel trapped. But because of the life that was given to me. Seeing this person before my eyes, the one I need, the one I’m so fucking in love with, having the rings, having it on my fucking finger then taking it off, because of my own bull shit..... if I fuck this up... if he doesn’t want me I know 1000% I will kill myself. Its dramatic it’s selfish. I know. I know. But I want to be raw and honest. I need to get this out. It’s him or nothing. I can’t mentally take losing the only person who has given me life. I’m too broken. I’m too hurt. I cannot handle that. I have nothing else. I know for a fact deep in my soul I will kill myself. I will. And I’m terrified. I cry all the time my head is pounding because I cry so much. I need him so bad. I feel so alone. I’m in a new country. I’m preparing for the worst. I’m awaiting my death. I’m drowning. It’s not a question. I know I will kill myself minutes after he tells me if his answer is he doesn’t want me. I’m done. I can’t even handle minutes of being without him I will need to kill myself as soon as possible. It’s too much. ",15Aug2018,10

It has the opposite effect on me than many stereotypes. I’m not sluggish; I get up and do things, I’m more relaxed &amp; creative and really enjoy the moment. 

Lately, I feel like my 14 year old daughter has been getting suspicious. I have the scent elimination factor down to a semi-science (stove vents, candles, vape pen) but there were times in the past when the house would have a faint scent of weed. Since she’s starting high school soon, she’ll now be exposed to drugs and alcohol through friends, if not already. I’m generally an open and honest person with her and hiding this from my beautiful daughter has been killing me. So my question is, should I talk to my daughter and tell her I smoke (along with all of the negative effects that go with it, ex. smoking before 25 decreasing brain development, legality, etc.)? Or is less information better? Also, I got a medical license (in another legal state though); if I talk to her, should I mention that to stress the importance of only using things prescribed by a doctor?

My second option is quitting smoking altogether. While weed has helped my life tremendously, the guilt of smoking in an illegal state and putting my family in danger makes me feel ashamed and guilty. When I tell you it helps me though, it really does. When I smoke I easily tackle tasks I avoid when I don’t smoke. It helps me get out of the house and want to do things. I’m more attentive and relaxed with my kids and not worrisome as much about little things. I know my lungs and health are at risk though. I’m torn, Reddit.  Sorry, I don’t have parents to turn to, so any advice would be hugely appreciated as this has been weighing heavy on my soul for a few months. 

TL:DR Pothead parent in a non-legal state. Should I be honest with my suspicious teenage daughter that marijuana helps me but isn’t tolerated for her? Don’t say anything and proceed as usual? Or quit smoking for my family’s sake?",15Aug2018,1
408,"Its not big of a deal but it keeps annoying me for past few days. So I am a 25 male PC gamer and plays mostly online games. And I got into this game called 'battlerite' last year and thats how I first met this guy online(well atleast that's what I thought). I was noob and he was being super helpful so I friended him via steam. So we played few games together and during those time we talked about our hobbies and interests for some reason and it turns out we actually kinda knew each other online on small-movie related-forum site. And I also noticed he was type of gamer who is logged into steam like 24/7. His play time were crazy high and it seems he plays game atleast 14~18hrs a day. But I got bored after 2 month-ish so I stopped playing battlerite and I thought that I would never hear from him again. After few days he sent me a message so I kindly replied that I lost my interest in that game. And he told me he lost interest as well, and asked me to recommend him some games. Since he was super helpful before I kinda felt that I owed him so I recommended him warframe since its f2p and that's what I played mostly back then. So we played together and after an hour-ish it was evident that he didnt like it at all so I told him that he dosent have to keep playing it for me and thats the last time we played together... But he kept on sending messages like everyday or every other day. For a month I replied kindly but since I didn't really wanna keep this  'friendship' I implied that we dont really know each other. It seemed like he understood the situation and stopped sending daily... But still kept sending messages from time to time. So yeah I imagine this happening to other people too so no big deal but then after a year or so, since he keeps on sending messages from time to time, he sent message while my brother was on my computer. He's real academic type and knows nothing about gaming. So when that guy sent message my brother replied

""Sorry this is (my full name for some goddamn reason)'s brother""

Yeah my brother really knows nothing about steam and did not know that alot of 'friends' on my account were not really friends. 

Now if that guy didn't reply after that I won't really care about it. But then he replied

""So that's his name""

I don't know if I'm over reacting but that was most creepy message I've ever gotten in my whole life. So I went to that forum that we both happened to use(we know each others username) and deleted most of my personal information just incase. He didn't send any message after that.

Now what should I do? I was planning on acting like nothing happened and if he does send messages act normally and reply back. But some of my friends told me to unfriend him... But I don't know those horror films about internet kinda got me spooked and at the same time kinda think that I'm worrying about nothing.",15Aug2018,1

410,"To preface, I am 20f. I have had a lot of death in my family. My dad, all four grandparents, an aunt, and numerous family members have all died in my lifetime. I would say I was used to death, that is until my dog, Harvey, a 12 year old boston terrier passed away. It hit me differently than all the others. 

That was in May, and in June we got a shih tzu puppy Murphy, and in July another shih tzu pekingese Maisie. I love them so much. They sleep with me and are allowed everywhere in the house, which my mom never allowed with Harvey (I still live at home until I graduate from college). Harvey was a bit of a loner and preferred to do things on his own, he didn’t like people much, so having two super friendly and personable dogs is very new to me. But everyday I think about how devastating it is going to be when they die. 

I also keep thinking they might be sick/hurt. So now I am constantly worried about their health and safety. I keep finding myself thinking about how I am going to handle it once they pass away in the future, or worry myself sick thinking about what I would do if they had an accident and died today. I know everyone dies and I can’t prevent it but I don’t enjoy being constantly aware of it. 

I don’t really know what to do. I wish I could be with them 24/7 to make sure they don’t eat anything that could make them sick/choke and be able to take them to the vet every time I think they might have some new illness. The vet tells me they are perfectly healthy but I worry that they might have something that won’t show symptoms until it’s too late to help them. I don’t have any evidence of it, I just worry because that’s how Harvey died, he had bone cancer. I know this is not a healthy mindset but I don’t know how to put myself at ease. ",15Aug2018,0

417,"Okay, so I'm in this situation and would really appreciate some advice. For years, my parents have almost never been friendly with one another. They constantly argued, and one day when I was very young I asked them if they loved each other. My mother's response was ""not for years."" So I've suspected for a very long time that they would eventually separate, and since they both obviously hated each other I didn't expect much sadness or resentment to come out of it. 

A while ago though, my father started to see another woman. I wasn't surprised but didn't really approve of it. My mother found out, and that was actually the first time I've heard her sob in my life. From that point, things just got so much worse. They both seem to think they've done nothing wrong, even though my mother was emotionally abusive for a large part of my childhood and my father abandoned reconciliation attempts seemingly after my younger sibling was born.

The thing is, my relationship with my mother has been improving dramatically over the last year. After I got diagnosed with a mental disorder she must have started feeling guilty, because she honestly treated me and my sibling much better after that. During my childhood I never would have imagined having this sort of positivity with her. 

My relationship with my father has (aside from a few arguments) always been positive, and me and my sibling feel most comfortable talking to him about our problems, especially about any issues that may arise due to my condition.

A while ago my mother came to me and my sibling in tears, asking that if the divorce happened would we want to live with her and if we thought our father seeing another woman was okay. For the most part I didn't say anything, because I knew I wouldn't be able to tell her what she wanted to hear. While our relationship with her has drastically improved, it's not like we've forgotten what she's put us through. 

I didn't want to say no because she assumed that we hated her, which I don't (Can't speak for my sibling), but couldn't say yes because neither of us would want to live with her. For her part, she doesn't seem to comprehend why we don't trust or talk to her as much as we do to our father, which to me says she doesn't even know what she did to make us that way. I don't want our budding positive relationship with her to crumble because she assumes that we hate her, but I also don't want to have to go explain that a lot of things she said and did in the past hurt us because she seems to think that she's done nothing of the sort.

I don't know how to talk to my parents about these things, and even though I know it will eventually happen, I don't want me and my sibling to have to choose which parent we want to live with. I don't know what to do, and how we respond to our parents in this situation is basically left to me because my sibling refuses to talk in front of them about this.

Any advice on what I should do or say would be greatly appreciated.",15Aug2018,2
418,"A few months ago, my SO's grandparents house caught on fire. Gramps barely made it out, two very loved birds and a dog did not. It was devastating to say the least. The (volunteer if it matters) firemen came out and it was ridiculous. 

They refused to listen to the people who had lived there for years about the river bank not being strong enough to support the truck. Well, it wasn't, and they spent a decent amount of time getting it back out. Now, had they not wasted that time there's a chance even one of the animals might have been saved. We don't know for sure, we also don't know if any of the house could have been saved in that time. Annoyed, but tensions were high and there's no way of knowing, so we let it go. 

Once they started actually putting the fire out, these guys are *laughing, joking, taking selfies for facebook*?! Yeah, the pictures were posted the next day. Now I understand that the job must be stressful, and that they can't get emotionally involved every time or they'd go crazy. But, I mean, the past 30 years of these peoples lives were just gone, save it for when you're not by a crying old lady! 

Now, that family is a bit back woods, and they look the part. Guys start joking, asking if they'll still pass a drug test after breathing in the smoke. Hardy har har, those guys are lucky grandma was there and that no one will start drama around her. 

It was just horrible, unprofessional, I'm still angry about it. But we were all so focused on grandma and gramps that no one really thought to say anything. I was thinking the other day, what if they do this all the time? What if every ones too shocked to speak up? I'd hate to think others felt how we felt, and that nothing is being done. Then, of course, they act like these big bad heros and everyone plays into it. Our full time firefighters never act like that, and they have a right too. 

I plan on snooping around and seeing how often I find pictures smiling firefighter in front of a currently burning building. If I do, I feel like I should bring it to someone's attention. If I don't, I still feel like the earlier instance should be brought up but it's been a few months now.

419,"TL, DR; I’m really depressed, lonely, and have been socially isolated for a while through my last relationship. I need suggestions for hobbies and places to go that wouldn’t be absolutely daunting for the socially anxious/depressed. Meetup hasn’t been helpful so far. 


To elaborate, I’ve recently become single after 4 years and, unfortunately, did the dumb thing of letting myself become pretty socially isolated during the relationship. I’ve never really been the type to have a huge circle of friends, but at this point I literally have two friends that I would consider close, and even then, I hardly get to see them anymore (one lives a couple hours away and the other is usually working or busy with other friends that I don’t really relate to). My family doesn’t live close enough to visit easily and I don’t work very much right now, so human contact has been pretty limited for a while. 

So naturally, I’m quite lonely and the recent breakup has definitely exacerbated my depression. I’m handling it the best I can through therapy and I’m looking into medication. I know that in these sort of situations, it can also be helpful to try new hobbies/put yourself in situations where you can meet new people. But with that, I don’t really know where to start. Not only is it really hard for me to get myself ready/out of the house most days, but I’ve also been feeling extra socially awkward most of the time that I speak, so it makes attempted human interaction pretty discouraging. It feels like the more time I spend alone, the more awkward I become. But at the same time, pushing myself/going outside and talking to people feels impossible a lot of the time, and on top of that, I find very few things interesting these days. 

I really don’t want to stay like this. I don’t want to get worse. I know that one of the most important things for me right now is healthy human contact, I just can’t figure out what type of places or activities would be interesting or doable for me right now. I feel like I need to take baby steps back into socializing normally, but I can’t seem to come up with things that don’t sound too overwhelming or uninteresting. I’ve looked at countless Meetup groups over the last couple months and haven’t really found anything that I would enjoy, or the ones I am interested in are inactive. I’m also definitely not the type to go to public places alone and just strike up conversations with folks. That’s like pulling teeth for me. So, I’m pretty stumped. 

I’m sure that when I finally get on antidepressants, leaving the house and doing things around other people probably won’t be so hard, but I have to wait a whole month for that appointment and I feel like I’m literally losing my mind here, so I would appreciate any suggestions any of you may have if you’ve been in similar shoes.

420,"hello guys,

i am a 22 year old guy from Germany.

I have always lived with my family and they are very strict when it comes to going out and so on. They don\`t really like if I go to Partys/birthdays and so on. This has led me to be very insecure and live a boring ass life. 

I always wanted to study psychology which is very hard to get in, in Germany. Last year in my first attempt I did not get accepted and started to study computer science as my second option for reasons like safe job, parents obv. also prefer it over psychology. 

Im in my second semester right now with good grades. But this isn\`t what my passion is (Psychology). So I tried to apply again for Psychology for the next semester, also in different towns. And I got accepted to a few (outside of my hometown, where I life with my parents).

And now I have a few days left to decide if I leave everything behind and start a new live in a different town or to stay and continue studying computer science. 

The reason I think about leaving is to follow my dream (become psychotherapist) and I think I will never be happy if I continue to stay with my parents. I have the most boring life in the world. The only thing I do is study and workout, sometimes go out to Partys im invited to but my parents always terrorize me if I do it. 

Why I think about staying is that im 22 years old already. If I start to study Psychologie now I would need (3 years bachelor, 2 years master and another 3 years to become psychotherapist - IF ALL GOES WELL). Im not sure If im to old to start..

421,"My (F) best friend (M) has recently been triggered by something that caused him to dredge up a repressed memory of something horrible happening to him as a young child.  He hasn't told me what happened, but I have a slight inclination of what it might be. 

He has completely switched off.  His once bubbly and fiery personality has completely disintegrated.  I understand how reliving a horrible experience you buried deep within yourself can upset you, but he is completely withdrawn.  I try to get him to open up to me, but he insists he doesnt want to talk about it.  He has told a couple other people about this upon discovery.  

He has joined a few support groups, but I dont think they're helping him.  Every time I speak to him his once peppy and spirited voice is now robotic and disconnected.  He doesnt care about anything and is in a bad depression.  I honestly fear every day for his mental health and want nothing more than to help see him out of this dark time. 

Basically what I'm asking is, what should I do?  Anybody who has, unfortunately, suffered from a traumatic experience as a child, what advice can you give me on ways to make sure he feels comforted and safe without feeling pushed or hovered over?  

I feel I would be able to help more if hed tell me what happened and, honestly, it hurts that he doesnt feel comfortable to talk about it with me.  However, I would never make him feel pressured or guilty for not telling me.

Also, he doesnt eat and has dropped weight over the past few days and he doesnt sleep...

I work for a small business development agency that consists of 5 people. 3 business developers and 2 social profile managers for linkedin. We outsource our clients and have about 9 clients, and I’ve been given 2 under supervision. 

I get told that eventually I should be getting 2 to 3 hot leads a week and I’ve been given the phone and taught how to make the sales calls, send sales emails and message leads on LinkedIn. As well as generate leads using sales navigator and the clients reccomended leads. 

I make about 40-50 calls a day and am expected to do other things. I can’t seem to get anyone to answer my calls and when I do everyone is uninterested and I’ve tried adjusting my tone and intro and how I speak to them to no avail. 

A little bit of me is thinking I’m not cut out for this line of work but my friends and family encourage me by saying I wouldn’t have been hired if I wasn’t cut out for it and I’ve just got to trust myself and keep working hard.

After a month I’ve failed to generate a single hot lead and I don’t know where I should be. My boss is fairly inconsistent in coming in and works from home 2 or 3 days a week. A small office also means he sits right next to me and when he does I get nervous calling in case I screw it up. He hasn’t advised me or said I’m doing anything wrong in particular but he just says keep bashing them out.

431,"So about 3 weeks ago my friend (we'll say Nate) and his 2 roommates (Mark and Peter) asked if they could stay with me for about a week and store their furniture and boxes at my place while their place gets finished being built. (He knows I have 2 empty bedrooms at my place because recently I offered him and one roommate to live with me after my other roommates moved out but they didn't want to abandon their 3rd.) He explained the situation and said ""We'll like buy you food all week for your hospitality."" I know both the roommates and have been on a vacation with them before so for the most part I know and trust the guys. I said yes, I thought it's only a week and getting groceries or something seemed fair (a week of groceries goes a long way for a college student.) 

Now first Nate texted me on July 28th almost midnight saying they wanted to move in the next day instead of the 31st. I said it was fine but I had to clean my place. So Sunday I spent my morning washing towels and sheets, cleaning up the guest rooms, and helping them move instead of going to my parents for lunch. 

Nate, whom I'm closest too, ended up only staying the night on the couch the first 2 nights and staying the night with his parents the rest of the time. 

Quick rewind: A few years ago 2 other friends of mine were waiting to move into a different new apartment complex. My other 2 friends stayed with me and paid me $200 for 2 weeks each since they got refunded $400 by the apartment complex for not opening on time, giving them still $200 pocketed each. Nate had also moved to that same apartment with the same situation at that time and received $400 back.

Last Thursday we were all in the living room, I brought this story up to all of them to see if they had anything to say, and they said they each got $300 for it being 8 days late this time. I didn't ask how or if they planned on paying me right then because I didn't know how long they were gonna be, but none brought it up and eventually the conversation changed.

Their place got finished on august 9th and Peter ended up staying until the 10th and Mark lived with me until today when they got internet because he's in a summer class. Mark said on the 10th he was moving out and I left town for the weekend that day assuming he'd leave the key on the counter. Sunday night I walked in and my kitchen smelt straight awful from some meat that peter had left in the fridge all week. A couple minutes later Mark and peter walked through the door and mark said he'd been there the whole weekend since they still didn't have internet. I asked him why he didn't think it was important to tell me and he said he didn't think I'd care. I said it was fine I just didn't like that he didn't tell me.

432,So this is such a weird question but so Im a male(18yo) and back when I was 16 I had a driving instructor (probably about 30-35yo female) who I could tell really liked me. A lot of our sessions we were alone for and we talked alot about personal stuff. I had a feeling maybe she had a cute sort of crush on me in the older woman sort of way but I was a horny 16yo so never thought anything of it and dismissed it as horny delusion. Fast forward to after I get my license and 2 years go by. on New Years this year she messaged me happy New Years but I never responded but I have a good excuse why. im just thinking now like she must have took a liking to me to reach out so long after our bussiness together. would it be un professional or weird to shoot my shot lol? I have an idea to invite her to get this food she mentioned she never tried but it all seems too good to be true to my horny brain? please help,15Aug2018,1
434,"I guess I have finally joined the masses and have officially been “ghosted” as the kids say. Matched with someone on bumble a month ago, we chatted every day for a couple days, hit it off, exchanged phone numbers. Texted every day and eventually exchanged Snapchat and Instagram handles. It basically got to the point where we had been talking for 3 weeks, texting every day and sharing photos with each other, asked them to go to a sports game with me the following week (now this coming Friday). They said yes and seemed genuinely excited. We continued to chat, then 4 days go by and I hear *nothing*.  First day or two I figured they were just busy and haven’t had time to respond back (they had done that in the past, but still same day usually). It’s basically been a little less than a week and I think I’ve been officially ghosted, to which I’m a little surprised because I thought I would be the one who would bail to be honest. 

What’s usually the typical behavior of the other party at this point? Mass deletion and blocking? I’m not sure. We both have iPhones, and I know they haven’t blocked my number because it still says delivered on the latest text, and they haven’t unfollowed me on Instagram and Snapchat. I sent a generic snapchat to them the other day and it still hasn’t been opened. They also haven’t unmatched me in bumble and we still have our conversation thread. I know they went to a concert the last time we spoke, so a small part of me is hoping they lost their phone, but I’m accepting that it’s no dice at this point.

443,"I just turned 20 and haven’t seen my father since I was 9. He and my mom got divorced when I was 5 and I had limited visits with him for those 4 years. My mom made the visits stop because my dads mind was going and because she hated him and chose for me to not have a relationship with him.

My aunt on my dad’s side recently reached out and asked if I wanted to meet them for lunch this weekend. I know from talking to them previously that my dad is going blind, going deaf, an amputee, and he doesn’t take care of himself and barely speaks. He’s about 60 years old. When I picture my dad I see a fun guy who I had good memories with. I’m not sure if I’m ready to see him the way he is now. However, he has declining health and if I don’t see him now I possibly never will and I can’t live with that either.

Also- I don’t know who can go with me. My brothers want nothing to do with him. My boyfriend probably won’t miss work on such short notice, and both of my grandparents are sick with cancer and it would be unfair of me to ask them. I don’t know if I could handle going alone, but it seems like now or never. On top of that, my mother would be super offended if I meet with my dad and I live with her. She can make my life really hard when she wants to and I don’t know if I can deal with how negative she will be. She’ll take it as a personal dig against my step father and be super mean to me for a while- possibly even not forgive me ever. I really want to see my dad and I feel like it’s what’s right, but it’s not going to be easy.

Female here

So I'm looking for some advice because apparently my brain doesn't quite get it. Where exactly are the boundaries between male and female friends?

I've had two really close guy friends since jr high and I'm just used to my actions and words being interpreted the way they are suppose to. If I start cleaning their place they're like, ""Hey Overly, why the hell are you getting mad at the rug with the broom?""

Or they just know I'm bored...Or that I'm repaying them back the way I can since I'm usually broke and we all take turns buying coffees for one another lol

I don't cross any PHYSICAL boundaries. No arm touching, no shoulder touching... Opposite couches if possible or at least opposite ends of the couch if there's only one. No cuddling. I'm not THAT stupid lol. I don't physically lead people on

But I care about people. Aren't we supposed to care for friends? I mean, isn't that what friends are for? what they DO? They help each other out When you're too depressed to get yourself out of bed, it is a friend that shows up and drags you out of bed lol. I don't want to lead people on and I don't do it intentionally. I don't want to ""fuck"" up anyone else's life because they fall for me or keep losing potential friends because of it. 

And where I don't exactly have many friends... I suppose I can pay too much attention to the few that I have. But people tend to know I don't have many...Especially since they tend to become a few close friends kinda thing.

452,"Hello everyone, I have question regarding former relationships with friends on whether or not I need to let them go in my life. For starters, ever since high school, I have had a hard time finding that one group that would take me in. When I had found that group, for a time, I felt that I had belonged.
Fast forward to now, as  I look back and how they are currently, they never really involved me or treated me equally conpared to the other friends in our circle. When it came to events, I was often the person whowould be treated as third wheel. Only during certain moments they would talk with me then after that nothing. I would try to even try to start conversations with them or try to keep up with how they are and what they have been up to recently, it would only end in, ""Oh, I am good."" Then after that nothing.

 After high school, when we ocassionally get together, we would only play video games or do activities that would cost a hell of alot of money but we would never engage in anything else or even try to catch up. However, they seem more involved in each others life than in mine. Currently I  am in college while several of them have gotten married or getting married. For those moments, even with money being tight, I would go out of my way to get them things, I never want anything in return but only to be acknoledged by my friends.

 It sometimes feel painful that I put a lot of effort to keeping our relationship as friends but they never reciprocate in equal measure. I have at times tried to call them or message them, but in never leads to anything. I feel that I am trying very hard for people that just generally don't care.

455,"So I wasn't really sure where to post this so I thought here would be the most appropriate. About 5 days ago, I was playing Siege with some friends (4 of us total) on xbox and during one of our games, I guess I took another guy's character, which happens. Anyways the guy messages me and tells me that he's going to team kill me for taking his character which I'm used to because this kind of thing happens. We continue playing and the guy kills one of my teammates so I of course kill him and we start messing around with this guy. He messages me from a different account (this one not having a profile picture or anything like that) and tells me that he's found my ip address and found the city I live in, which kind of creeped me out but whatever. I'm in a party talking with my friends about this so I ignore the message and talk with my friends. A few minutes later I get another message from the same guy telling me specific information I said in the party. Keep in mind, this guy was NOT in the party so he shouldn't have heard anything we were saying at all. He claims he hacked into our party and was listening to everything we said. I turned off the console at this point and unplugged my router and modem, basically everything and went to bed kind of paranoid. I got an Instagram request from an unknown account which I ignored only to get a message saying that guy can still see my account and my messages despite me not accepting his follow request. If someone can explain to me how that works, I would appreciate it. Fast forward to last night and after not receiving any messages or anything for a few days, my friend that I was playing that night asks me if I had been pranking him. He said that he physically saw someone leave a sign on his door reading ""your friend is next"" followed by them running away. I told him that I didn't even know where he lived, nor did any of us so it had to be the person that was messaging us on Instagram. That brings me to now, I'm kind of a paranoid mess rn and that might sound stupid but I just don't really know what to do honestly. I do have some questions though. Can a person who found my ip address hack my phone or my laptop or something like that? I went ahead and factory reset my phone and taped over my camera just as a precaution and I haven't opened any weird links or anything like that. How would I know if this person has hacked into my phone or not? Nothing appears out of the ordinary with my email or my social media, just that he can somehow read my Instagram messages. Should I block this person? Report them? Tell them to get a life and stop? I'm kind of scared of the outcome of doing that honestly. I have the usernames of this person who is harassing me if anyone can be of any assitance. If this person decides to show up at my house, what do I suggest I do?

So this needs some context. Me and the other guy work together and met my girlfriend at about the same time - she was a junior in our department. This guy has a serious girfriend (LDR, talking about marriage) but is the office pervert - openly flirts with women and brags about cheating on his girlfriend.

So me and my girlfriend started texting at first but after a brief period of me fighting it off (she is much younger and was my junior at work), we started dating. 1 month into us dating, she tells me that she and this other guy had a period of texting and went on one day-long date together about a week before we started interacting. At the time she told me it was completely platonic, but it was obviously at least a flirtation. Nothing physical happened (some time later I asked this guy about it and he told me the same - he was actually surprised that there was an issue at all). She moved to another department but would still see this guy in the office lunch room etc. Every time she would see him, it would bug me and I would have that awful feeling that I was missing something (while feeling like a jealous idiot for feeling it). We have had this recurring conversation about it and it evolved from ""completely platonic"" to ""friends with a general interest"" to ""yes, something could've happened"".

I eventually decide that I need to relax, people have feelings etc, it's in the past and I need to let it go. She has been committed to me in every way and we have started having the first few talks about our future together. Then last week the 3 of us ended up sitting together in the lunch room and it was really awkward between the 2 of them..like palpably awkward. I had that awful feeling that I was missing something again and when we got home, I asked her again if there was something unresolved there. Eventually, she conceded that she still has ""some feelings"" for him. When I asked her to describe these feelings she said it's a chemistry or attraction that has lasted from their time together. She thought they would disappear but they haven't. I flipped out and said that I can't be with her if she has had feelings for this guy this whole time, basically our whole time as a couple. I feel heartbroken and betrayed that she had kept this from me this whole time.

Since this has all come out, she has been begging for me to not leave her. She is now saying that she didn't mean what she said, that she used the wrong words because I put her under pressure, and that she doesn't have ""real"" feelings for this guy. She is being really unclear, going back on her words and contradicting herself repeatedly. It makes it impossible to believe anything she's saying. When pushed, she admits her feelings aren't platonic, but says they aren't ""wholly romantic"" either, and she has no intention of acting on them, only wants to be with me etc...

Reddit, I am in an emotional mess and need your logic on this. I feel that someone who has any kind of sustained feelings for someone else during your whole relationship, especially during the honeymoon phase when 2 people should be completely smitten with each other, means that there is something missing in her feelings for me. Am I being too black and white about this, or am I right that this is a red flag for future heartbreak? I should also mention that I am her first serious relationship...

457,"I'll try to keep this short. You can find more backstory on my relationship with my ex in my post history but it's not entirely relevant anymore.

I was dating my ex for about 2 years, the entire time we were sexually open in some way or another. Swinging, then open relationship. He had no interest in polyamory and opening our relationship romantically for the longest time, but I did. He changed his mind when he met Ash (names changed). The last few months of our relationship were tumultuous as he screwed me over financially, changed the terms of our relationship without my input, and started putting more and more energy into his relationship with Ash. During this time, I started seeing Bill, Ash's other long term boyfriend.

My ex broke up with me and he hurt me terribly in the breakup. Slept with my closest friend and coworker who rescinded her offer for me to stay with her so she could stay the night with him behind my back, love dumped me and kept promising that we could work on things and still be together (and followed up with ""this doesn't change anything, we're just fucking""), made plans for Ash to move in immediately after I moved out and lied to me about it.

Bill was amazing to me during this time and let me stay with him for 3 weeks while I was finding a new place. Generally things have been awesome. Until now the only hiccup was that he got frustrated with me when I blocked Ash on Facebook because it upset her. But I hadn't signed off of the lease or returned the keys to the old place yet as I had just moved out and had been told Ash wasn't moving in for a month or more. But she did move in and my ex was facing eviction as she couldn't be added to the lease because I was still on it. 

Bill texted me and was really on my ass about doing the paperwork immediately, and I did but didn't want to bend over backwards to fix my ex's mistake after how he treated me. I got the paperwork done for Ash's sake as she never hurt me directly. But I was being petty and wanted to keep the keys so my ex would have to pay for new ones after how he abused me financially. Bill gave me a really hard time about it and eventually convinced me to give the keys to him so he could turn them in. Only for Ash to show up and get them from him while I was present. 

As much as I really like Bill and as much as he was the only one there for me when I ex and closest friend ditched me, I'm torn about staying with him. He's been seeing Ash for over a year and she's a large part of his life. It's hard hearing about her after all that's happened. He wants me to move past this and be friendly with her eventually. I want to put this all behind me and part of me feels like I can't do that while I'm still connected to this poly network, but part of me doesn't want the situation to cost me another good relationship after it's cost me so much already. 

I have a new partner, Carl, and new friends that I didn't have when I was in the heat of all this and when Bill was my only support. So I have that going for me. I'm just looking for advice. My ex was absolutely awful to me for the past 6 months and Ash has been complicit in that. She's going to continue to be a part of Bill's life. I feel like it would be wrong of me to leave him for that reason after he was the only person who stood by my side during everything, but I don't know if I can continue to be so close to this while I'm moving past it.

He is just rude in general and I was wondering if there is any way I can submit a complain to the town or the chief of police or should I just disregard it and move on with my life. People like him really bother me. I feel like he has no respect to anyone and he thinks of himself as a god and that nobody else matters. Any advice helps. Thanks.",15Aug2018,1
463,"I got my cat Bella 10 years ago before I left for college. I brought her with me my first year but after that had to leave her back home because of house restrictions.

When I came back after my last year I noticed she was a bit overweight. I instantly put her on a diet and she got back to normal cat weight pretty quickly. 

Five years later I ended up moving to a different country. My mother and grandma loved her and asked if they could keep her while I was away. I said yes. I was a bit weary because my mom isn't the best trainer with our dogs but j figured a cat would be easier than a 30 lbs dog.

Fast forward to February when I come home for a surprise visit (around 4 years later) And Bella is HUGE! Like, a really fat cat. Even my best friend was like ""What happened to Bella?"" 

I confront my mom and she laughs it off saying ""she's just an old, lazy cat."" After more prying I find out that my mom feeds her rotisserie chicken (claiming that's all Bella will eat), rotisserie chicken juice instead of water (claiming she never sees Bella drink water to she's making sure she's hydrated) And feeding her whenever she meows because now Bella has conditioned my mom to it.

I told her that was not okay and she keeps thinking it's a joke. I asked her to take her to the vet to get a diet plan going. She said okay and I left to go back home to my other country.

The February trip was a surprise but the trip for the whole month of July was planned. I brought my boyfriend and when we walked into my mom's house I noticed that Bella was even fatter than before. No neck, could barely clean herself and just so heavy. I lost it on my mom who, again, was laughing saying it's not a big deal because she's a cat.

I asked her if she took her to the vet and she said no. She doesn't believe  cats need regular check ups like dogs do. I was livid. Because this trip was planned for us to see multiple states and was jam packed with things to do I didn't have time to take her to the vet myself.

I don't know what to do. My cat is very unhealthy and she's only 10. I cried to my mom to take her to a vet and get on a diet so she can live to a normal cat age and she said she would but I don't believe her. I'm already back in the country that I'm living in and I don't know if there's anything I can do.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do or what more to say to my mom to make her see how fucked up and serious this is?

**TL;DR**: Moved abroad, left my cat with my mom, she overfed her and now she's severely  overweight.  My mom doesn't see a problem and won't take her to a vet for a diet plan. What do I do?",15Aug2018,1

I live in a house my Mom owns and shes been away for a year teaching over seas. While shes away my older sister and I have been taking care of bills. Our HVAC Unit dies and we need a new unit. Since my sister works at home I have been the one in charge of finding financing. I found financing and have been getting contractors. We get enough financing to do a few home repairs. My Mom comes home for vacation for a few months and will be going back to teach. Ive put lots of work into getting contractors and setting up financing. Now she wants to make decisions on what to get.

Im upset because I have been the one in charge of getting financing and talking to contractors the whole time. She wasnt there and now shes here I feel shes puting her imput and comments where it doesnt need to be. I mean shes going to be leaving soon so really wth. I feel she doesnt trust the fact that I had it handled. I realized that this is not MY house. I feel though she should be open to suggestion.

We just bought a new house, and as soon as we did, everyone knew. Our soon-to-be neighbour came into my work to introduce himself (70 ish year old man who lives with his 95 year old mother). I thought it was very nice of him to come in and welcome me! However, he has been in to visit several times since - stopping me on the street as well for friendly conversation. We haven't even moved in yet. Most recently, he came into my office and asked if he could temporarily store wood in our wood shed. I said that was fine, but once we move in we may want to use the woodshed for something else. He the continued on to say that in exchange for using the woodshed, he would clear our driveway in the winter. This leads me to think that temporary is not  just until we move in. I said, that won't be necessary - but thank you for offering. When he was leaving he said ""So we got a deal???"" I wanted to say no, but I just sort of laughed awkwardly. He also said that him and his (95 year old) mother would be over on moving day to help and bring lunch. I do NOT want this. I said, no need to bring lunch. We have lots of people coming over to help. Thanks anyways. I feel like he is not getting the hint, but he's one of those old men that talk softly and seem lonely. 

Anywayyyyssss I am sort of extroverted but also need privacy. My partner is very introverted even more private. I don't want her to think I made this deal with him on purpose - but I'm not addressing it until it actually becomes an issue.

So this really hot guy asked me to hang out sometime. I’ve been in class with him a few tines but we didn’t talk that much. A few tunes he has very obviously flirted with me.

I got excited and gave him my number but I have a really bad feeling about him, like he’s too good at this stuff, too self absorbed, cares too much about how he looks. I friended him last semester and saw that he had posted about how he only wants to talk to hot chicks. No one else. He was in high school, but he never deleted it. Also he basically made a sexual intending in a flirtatious way last semester, saying he was a bad boy and he’d see me in the office. I already have too much stress in my life and overactive adrenals, which are just starting to heal, and I don’t want this to mess it up.

477,"How can I fix my ear?

So since Thursday my right ear has felt almost.. blocked? And has had muffled and reduced hearing. I could temporarily fix it by kind of pulling on my ear lobe and pushing and pulling again and id have normal hearing for a short time but now that doesn't work. I've avoided q tips since those aren't meant for ears. I've also tried those ear wax drops that are some peroxide compound and while now there may not be ear wax my hearing is still muffled and blocked feeling and like whenever I yawn it feels like my ear is trying to pop but it can't so it just has a weird sensation of like many many many tiny tiny attempts at popping but it all fails. When I use my fingers and feel my ears my right ear also feels like it's different. Like my left each which is normal has a sort of almost small suction like effect and sound when I touch it with my finger but my right ear has no such effect at all. What's the issue here?

This is the drops I'm using https://www.walmart.com/ip/Debrox-Earwax-Removal-Aid/23598026?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;amp;adid=22222222228017144188&amp;amp;wl0=&amp;amp;wl1=g&amp;amp;wl2=m&amp;amp;wl3=40754201792&amp;amp;wl4=pla-78606393752&amp;amp;wl5=9015301&amp;amp;wl6=&amp;amp;wl7=&amp;amp;wl8=&amp;amp;wl9=pla&amp;amp;wl10=8175035&amp;amp;wl11=online&amp;amp;wl12=23598026&amp;amp;wl13=&amp;amp;veh=sem


Another thing to note:

When I mentioned that earlobe thing that temporarily gave me normal hearing, when I would do it there be an almost... sticky? Sound as if it was actually sticking earwax and stuff and temporarily moving it out of the way or something. After using the drops this morning that thing no longer works and that sound is no longer present. What does that mean? And note that my left ear which is normal never made a sound at all

480,"Ok, so I’ve known this guy since middle school. He was my first kiss. Then he dropped me for someone else (obvi that part doesn’t matter, we were like 12). But after that, anytime his relationships were doing poorly, he’d contact me, say he missed me, talk as if he were hiding some secret emotions for me without ever actually saying he loved me, and it’d keep me around when I would be starting to get distant, obviously tired of only being there when he was getting lonely.
My graduation rolls around (2015; he was a grade above me) and we meet up, get drunk together, and have sex. I was talking to someone at the time, he was having relationship issues himself. It was a messy mistake, and we don’t talk again until about January of this year, when he confesses he’s always loved me and he’d like to at least be friends again. I blew him off. I was with someone, and obviously I’d hardened myself to him. Or so I’d thought. 
I broke and contacted him in June, and we were both talking to other people. But we weren’t in any relationship, both technically single. So we started hanging out, and eventually having sex. I quit talking to the other guy a couple weeks in, and my first kiss was stuck between myself and the other girl, figuring out what he wanted to do as the other girl was in a mess of a life herself.
Now he claims that he quit talking to her way sooner than he told me, that he had chosen me but then things got physical and he didn’t want things to be only physical between us, and that he was trying to figure out a way to start things over. He admits to slightly pushing me away so he could figure things out. He admitted this all after I told him I’d met someone and was pretty interested in the other person.

Do I give him a chance? Or blow it all off and move on? This would be the first time he’s ever chosen me, and part of me feels I should give it a chance, but the other part is incredibly worried he’d just hurt me again.",15Aug2018,1

489,"Hi all,

I'm 24 and filling out Medicaid forms for my grandparents to start transitioning them into long term care. My grandma lives at home and has been diagnosed with stage 1 Alzheimer's - she repeats herself sometimes within minutes of each other. She is easily confused and disoriented. She forgets where she puts things and therefore the house has become cluttered with paper.. paper upon paper. Like papers from 2012 papers. She cannot manage the Bill's of the house.. the yard, anything really. But she thinks she can. And becomes overwhelmed. This has been very hard to observe the slow changes to her mind. 

I'm sitting in the nursing home with my grandpa right now. We're keeping him here 30 days to get him qualified for Medicaid and possibly into long term care.but he wants to go home. He cannot get into or out of bed by himself. He cannot walk. He has a calcified heart valve. In other words, his heart is failing and he's 93.

 I want to keep him happy by bringing him home, but grandma can't take care of him and in home care is so expensive. If he stays in the nursing home, we will get him on Medicaid..even though he doesn't want to stay here. 
 His VA benefits cover 4 hours of in home care 5 days a week. But we feel he may need 24/7 care available. But that would likely mean he can't be home..

When my grandparents are in the same room, they cannot have a conversation without several misunderstandings and lots of ""what did you say?"" 

This year has changed my life in multiples ways because of this situation. 

I'm wondering if there are any others out there who have had to go through this process before. Changing the situation with your grandparents.. ways to help my grandma as she slowly processes and ways to process that my grandpa won't be here much longer. 

I feel like I can't really talk to people my age about it, or have a hard time finding people who have gone through this situation.

494,"I didn't want to create a sensationalist title, but at the same time I need the attention, so bear with me, please... First of all, throw away account for obvious reasons and english isn't my first language, sorry for any mistakes(besides, I'm really emotional, so it might take a part on that as well)... Oh well, I will cross post this on r/relationships...  


A little bit of background, I've always been daddy's little princess, he treated me really well, he was caring and even spoiled me more than he should... Recently it came to scene that he has been cheating on my mom for a while, and although we knew something was off(he was flirting with other girls over the phone and stuff) we never knew that he actually met somebody... That broke my heart, obviously, as a woman I couldn't really accept this behaviour that easily... But after some months, he moved out, I sorted out my feelings, and even though I know he made a pretty huge mistake, he is still my father, so I love him, right? Yeah, that's where the fucked up part begins...  


One day my brother and I went to celebrate a holiday with him, when we returned my mom sat us down and start questioning everything we did... I got pretty mad because she hide things from us and expect we tell her every detail... That was the part where she actually revealed what I could never imagine and it's been haunting me... My father is a pedophile... I didn't want to believe it, but it seems he caressed(should I say abused? I don't want to, but deep down I know it is) a few children on the past and it came to light more recently... A neighbour's kid, one cousin of mine and one cousin of my mom are the ones who I got to know... As far as I've been told, he never really raped any one of them, it was on the base of touching(I don't know to which extend went this ""touch"", I only know that he ""touched"" the panties of one of the girls and did something while gave a bath to the other)... My mom told me that he stopped doing that, and she could see that it was true, she's been keeping an eye on him, but now that he doesn't live with us anymore, she wants me and my brother to persuade him to look for therapy(but without revealing that we know about his tendencies, otherwise he would surely kill himself out of shame)  


I don't know what to do about this piece of information, really... Ignorance is a bliss and I only found out that now... My father was overprotective when I was a child, maybe because he was afraid that someone like him showed up around me? I keep thinking that maybe I should've been the one he messed up with, it would take so much from the head of those poor girls, although I know that none of them has major problems(like panic, fear of man, anxiety, depression), it still affected them in a way that I'm not aware... I simply don't know how to look in his eyes anymore... my brother and I had a meeting with him yesterday and it was so stressfull...   


He has always be kind to me and NO ONE would ever suspect this... I am deeply greatful to him because he made every effort he could to raise his children, but I was already disappointed in him as a woman, now I don't know how to think as a human being...

I am at loss, I don't know what to do... Should I confront him and risk having the blood of my father in my hands(he is REALLY pridefull and if he had I glimpse that I knew this information it is really possible that he commits suicide)?, should I try to pretend nothing happend? I know some people will tell me to report him, well, I will say beforehand that I can't... One of the victims has to go and do it, I don't have any evidence to back me up, and ffs he is my father, unless I caught child pornography on his computer or saw it with my own eyes(at least the after effect), I guess I wouldn't be able to do it... Should I cut contact without telling him why? I need your support guys... Thanks in advance...   


PS: Some stuff might sound different in english, some words I really didn't know how to translate, if I see any misconception I'll try to correct, sorry about that...",15Aug2018,1
495,"My boyfriend’s parents always hated me because of my condition (I’m diabetic).
I never let this get between us, but he eventually did. 

They forbid him to come visit me during summer and to go on a vacation together.
They forbid me to visit his apartment while he’s in town.

I should also mention that he cheated on me and I forgave him. He also said he’s not crazy about me many times and I know those were red flags but I didn’t want to give up.

He always promised he’ll never stop fighting for us, but he never did more than speak these words. I never asked for him to stand against them, I just wanted to spend time with him. 

I broke up with him two days ago. He tried using the same old beautiful words that I knew he doesn’t mean. And then, he gave up.

I’m heartbroken. I need to know how to cope with the feeling of being of zero importance to someone that meant the world to you.
And also, being treated like a cripple has really made me lose faith in myself. How can you “cure” this?",15Aug2018,2
496,"My friend wants me to go to an under 21 club with him, me being 17, and I really don't want to go but I still am anyway. It's not that I have social anxiety it's just that people are weird in there and it's just not fun. How can I make my time there more enjoyable and get over it? ",15Aug2018,1
