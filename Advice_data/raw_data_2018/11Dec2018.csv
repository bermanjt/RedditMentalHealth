1,"Hello, 

My name is Adrian and I go by the rapper name Adrian.EXE. I didn't always want to be a rapper, after I graduated with my degree in forensics, I wanted to pursue a career in forensics. After trying and being rejected from many police departments I turned to rap music as an outlet. Some people enjoyed my music and others didn't due to my monotone voice or the delivery of my lyrics. I studied music theory, how to produce, and practiced rapping for almost a year while putting out many songs and trying to maintain a job as a Lab Technician (non-forensic related). So far I have amassed 715 followers, a cumulative 36k views, many comments and likes, however, I still receive some of the same feedback and it feels like my career in science and in music is going nowhere. I have tried promoting myself using different music promotion companies like Repost Exchange and using FB ads, but I'm not seeing the return on my investment like I was hoping. Should I give up my dream? Is my music really any good? Is there a place for me in Hip-Hop? Any feedback would be helpful, here is a link to my profile if anyone is curious: [https://soundcloud.com/adrian-torres-156636319](https://soundcloud.com/adrian-torres-156636319) I'm not trying to promote my music here, I just want some honest feedback and advice.

Sincerely, Adrian",11Dec2018,1
2,"Hello, I am a 17-year-old girl who is from the USA. I have a learning disability which makes it hard for me to do certain things in certain areas. (Just a little background) I took my permit test months ago and now I lost all motivation to do anything. My brother bullies me by telling me that I am stupid and that I shouldn't even think about applying for a drivers license lol. I'm currently in high school and I'm so tired of my parents driving me places I want it to end. I also am very overweight and I don't know what to do. I have tried diets but I just gave up because I realized that I shouldn't care for myself anymore, because deep down no one care's me. I have thought about just leaving the earth but then I realize it is NOT worth it. I am also going to attend a community college and my family keeps giving me crap over it, telling me how stupid I am and that I won't even last a year in there. I feel like my life is falling apart, and I don't know where to start. What do I do?",11Dec2018,1

4,"Older brother [21] dropped out at 15, mother paid someone to complete online work through alternative school to get diploma. Since then brother has done nothing but attempt to sell weed, rob others, and get robbed. A year ago he got a dwi (lawyer wiped off record but still on prohibition) and then he hangs out with same people doing the same bad stuff got fucked up and fought one who was 17 at the time and a video was taken. He was facing charges but for some reason never filed. Due to this and robing others he has received serious threats and people have came by our house looking for him. He has also robed my friends before and once caused me to get jumped leaving my house while visiting from college. He also seems to like younger girls 16-18 who have problems like he has. Due to the threats he has received, two times he has tried to relocate to other states and mooch off of others until he was homeless (all within 1 month each time) and my parents had to intervene (driving 8+ hours both ways one night to get him). He is also physically and emotionally aggressive and sometimes abusive refuses to listen to my parents. My family also has history of mental illness mother and me have depression, anxiety and paranoia with possible other underlying undiagonsed things but that is all that is diagnosed. Brother was diagnosed with adhd when young but refused to take medicine. He also refuses to go to therapy or get treatment if I had to guess I would say borderline personality disorder because he has cut himself on wrist before for attention on Snapchat after a breakup and he either loves me or absolutely hates me and wouldn’t care if I live or die when confronted. Mother refuses to lay down rules and tell him if drugs in house or you don’t get a job you need to get out letting him do whatever. Father and I beg mother but mother and brother don’t listen to father because he is not biological and me because they claim I am a child even tho 18+. Really don’t see how to help brother he was in jail once but just overnight and paid a guy he knew for protection. Fear that he will end up dead if he doesn’t get his life together but don’t know how to help please give advice begging you.",11Dec2018,1

6,"I feel too dependent on him for my happiness. I flat out confessed to him that us hanging out is the only thing that makes me happy at all anymore. He told me he thinks I’m creepy and overbearing. He rarely responds to my texts and I text him every day. He is the type of person who is super extroverted and easily makes friends with everyone and he has a lot of friends. Meanwhile I only have him. He does like me, he has said good things about me. 


Honestly I think he is so cool and fun to be around that anybody else would just be disappointing and boring to befriend. But when he is not around I feel so lonely. I only want to talk to him ever.

9,"I have always loved gaming and had a lot of different consoles since I was a kid. I had a ps3 not long ago and sold it because I started working and wasn’t playing much, also I needed to buy a phone with those money. But now I really miss playing and the idea of a ps4 really excites me. I do have the money yet it’s a bit pricey for my pocket lol ( around 1/3 of my total savings ) Should I go for it ? I’n not sure what to do...",11Dec2018,1
10,"Well. There's alot to explain so excuse me if i miss anything. When me and my gf (lets cal her tiffany) had our child (let's call her hailey), we lived in our own apartment. I worked, she stayed at home with her. I was fighting addiction with Vicodin. I was keeping up with rent and bills but failed to pay on traffic tickets. Ended up getting pulled over with no license and lost my truck and went to jail. Upon getting out of jail, I couldn't afford to get my truck from the impound. I couldn't make it to work. I work in construction. Jobs were too far. We got evicted after failing to pay rent. We all moved to her brothers house. I had to go through withdrawal while looking for work in a new city 2 hours away from home. Finally got a temp job in a factory, and made enough money to move back into my home town. Got a hotel near my boss so I could get back to work. My mother took our child so she wasn't living in a hotel with us. My mom brought her over every day and took her at night. I got back into my addiction as soon as I got back in the area. Nobody knew at the time. My gf or my mom knew. Time went on and tiffany got a job to help speed up the process of getting into an apartment or house. So my mom started to just keep Hailey everyday, and we just visted after work. That eventually turned into only seeing her on the weekends. Tiffany finally got involved with my addiction. If you can't beat um, join um. She got tired of fighting me and started getting high too. Well the vicodin got hard to find and too expensive. Friends we knew from highschool turned us on to heroin. We couldn't find pills. We were desperate to not be sick. This was life changing. It ruined us. My mom wanted guardianship incase of emergency so she  could take Hailey to the doctors or hospital without our consent just incase. I agreed but tiffany would not sign the paper. My mom and tiffany already hated eachother. This grew worse with time. My mom sweet talked me into taking this to court. Like everything was going to be fine. She eventually found out about the heroin. It became impossible to hide. I grew up telling my mother everything. From drugs to sex, I had no filter with her lol. It was a good relationship. But I knew heroin was too far so I kept it to myself. So it turned into, we need to get off drugs and get a roof then we can take Hailey home finally and be our happy family. We always tried to give money when we could and see Hailey as much as possible. As well as trying to clean up and save money. We kept doing good, getting clean. Then relapsing. Eventually she got sick of it and said we can't come see Hailey until we get clean. Now we have been clean going on 4 months. The longest we have ever made it. It's now been 4 months since we seen our talked to our daughter. As soon as she cut us off, it broke us enough to where we would rather be sick and sober than go another minute without her. But respectively, my mom doesn't believe we are sober. She's heard it too many times. I'm also on probation for a 2nd DUI and if I fail a drug test, I go to prison. So I'm not fucking around any more. And I haven't been working much. Burned too many bridges. So saving money has been really hard. Paying 240 a week for a hotel, with only 300 a week income from tiffany. So, one issue I would like to talk about is, can my mother legally cut us off like this from seeing our daughter? And secondly, besides me finding work and paying off my fines, any advice as to how to better ourselves and get into a home finally? Our credit both sucks and we each have and eviction from about 4 years ago. Hers is 5 years ago. Finding someone to rent to us is hard. We are in Michigan btw. Any advice would be nice. Thanks for reading. Anything I missed, please ask. Sorry for a giant paragraph, on mobile. ",11Dec2018,1
11,"Long story short: Broke up 2 months ago on good terms because it wasnt working out (decided to break up before things got worse) but havent talked since. We share the same friends. Now that Christmas Break is approaching, and plans are being made by friends, she has asked me if I want to meet up 1 on 1 (very sure that it is only to talk about how things have been going, what the situation is gonna be with friends etc). 

I have been anxious and paranoid since the break up because of how thing are gonna be over christmas. I still have some feelings for her, but dont want to get back together with her because things went sour. Seeing her over the next few weeks is inevitable.

Emotionally things usually don’t seem to reach me, like failing an exam, or even heavier shit like a somewhat distant family member passing away or a bad diagnosis of someone from a doctor. But then, every year or two, I seem to just completely break down over shit that is usually less of a big deal than some of the things that didn’t bother me, like I’ve hit my tipping point, and it usually results in me being incapable of getting out of bed that day, and being mentally checked out for usually another few days afterwards. A few years ago it was realizing I had left some final projects too late and it literally wasn’t feasible to finish them all, and just this year I had a really bad breakdown over spending $100 out of my emergency fund, despite having over $400 still in there.

A lot of things bothered me about her though because she always brought drama with her wherever she went. She had a lot of issues too. I really don’t wanna care about her anymore, but she keeps coming to my mind and I really want to understand everything that was up with her. Should I just forget about her or maybe try and contact her again? ",11Dec2018,1
17,"I'm a soon to be college freshman (starting in spring) majoring in an engineering related field at a top 20 university. I know my major is something I truly want to do, as well as something I have a natural talent in. I have already signed up for external events related to the major and applied for dozens of summer internships and plan to apply to more in January. Supplemental to my major, I am super interested in creating or being a part of a start up and plan to take entrepreneurship classes to this end.

Everything sounds great, right?

Not exactly.

See, I also love acting. I did plays all throughout high school, and I plan to continue doing them in college. Also, I will be spending any open slot I have in my schedule on theater related courses (as well as entrepreneurship classes). I really want to do film acting, and will be registering with the casting agency that supplies extras to movies in the area once I move in to college. Of course, I will also be doing everything in my power to score auditions for student films. Now, this isn't really a ""hobby"" kinda thing for me. I seriously love it and would've majored in it had my circumstances been different (can't explain without revealing too many personal details, for sake of explanation, let's just say my parents wouldn't let me).

It doesn't end there (unfortunately).

On top of those two things, I have been running a Youtube channel that I started a couple months ago. While this is of less importance than my stem-major and acting, it is something I refuse to give up. I can't give it up mainly because of the FOMO (fear of missing out) I mentioned in the title. I'm afraid one day I'll be 30 and regretting never having at least given Youtube a shot. No, I'm not an idiot, I realize Youtube success is incredibly rare, but I have honestly been enjoying posting over the past months despite the low viewership I have. 

As I begin to learn more about the commitment level both my major and acting take, I'm beginning to panic that I won't be able to give both the honest effort I desire giving them. Theater students have so many more resources available to them (most importantly, access to where the film students cast from), and I am stifling my potential infinitely by not being one. At the same time, my major's industry values dedication and externally created projects, so by taking theater classes and skipping engineering weekend-events for rehearsal, I severely impede the quality of my resume. 

I wish I could do two runs of college in separate timelines and pick whichever works out best, although thats obviously a pipe dream. There is the possibility of doing a double major, but then it would take me 5 years to graduate and the school is fucking expensive. My mental health is fine, but I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind. I drill into one of the three things above for a couple weeks before starting to become concerned about the other two, and then switch my focus to one of the other interests so that I don't lose my grasp on it.

If you read all this, I really appreciate it. I have no clue what to do, but I know that if I don't find an intelligent solution soon, I'm gonna be really fucking disappointed in myself 15 years from now.

Thanks in advance for any responses. :)",11Dec2018,1
18,"Last year in school I met a male, the first our class went on a hike he was very nice to me and we became friends until this year.
This year he has hurt me so many times on numerous occasions, but the thing that hurt me the most was the fact that he still hasn't acknowledged his childish behaviour.
Here is a list of the things he has done or said to me.

-He has put me down to seem 'cool' infront of other females that he deems attractive.
-He doesn't respect me at all.
-He has talked about my apperance in hurtful ways.
-He doesn't support anything I do.
-He has hurt me and when I asked him to stop he didn't.
-He doesn't respect my personal space but will incessantly lecture me about respecting his.
-He doesn't find anything I say funny, it's stupid.
-He thinks I'm lying about every single thing I tell him.
-Whenever I ignore him he is deadset on making me talk to him, when I begin to speak he turns and doesn't talk to me.
-He doesn't make any effort to contact me to hangout.
-He has called my thoughts and opinions stupid and weird.

I'm so fed up with this shit, I broke and talked to him for the first time in a week and it didn't feel good, it felt forced and awkward.
He's asked why I am mad and even when I walk away from him he continues to follow me.
I did sit with him and chat for a while, we had a laugh and whatever.
He still hasn't changed his shit, I am over it.
He not only ignored me when I was open to talking, but he had already begun to critisize me again!
I won't allow this behaviour anymore, I don't even want to consider being friends or ever speaking again.
Am I doing the right thing?

If I don't pass this class my parents are going to pull me out of school so I'm basically willing to do anything to pass, no matter how sketchy, but I need a good way to falsify at least like 8-10 absences to make it viable for him to pass me.

Before I even entered school I had a couple of breakdowns because I was so confused and went to school because my parents basically told me I had to.  My mom thinks I'm taking a semester off but I haven't applied to any schools yet, plus the deadlines have passed. I plan on going to school next year for business and maybe acting as well.

I also quit my job at a restaurant and haven't had a job in three months although I've applied to more jobs than I can count. 

Right, now all I do is sit at home, watch Youtube and literally mourn my motivation. I've always been terrible at self-motivation but now it's getting worse.

I have friends but they're busy in school.  I'm a creative and I think I want to be an actress. I've been taking classes. I just second guess myself too much and I jump to different things too often. 

This is kind of a rant I guess but I just really need some kind of guidance. If you were in this situation or have any advice I'd love to hear it. Thank you.

25,"Alright, my teacher(am in grade 12) confronted me last week about not working with my group and to sum it up, called me lazy. The reasons behind me not wanting to work with them is because I always feel like i piss them off when i speak with them. Also, i felt like crap that day, thats besides the point, though. I did not respond to his claim and decided to just carry along since i understood where he was coming from. He made me move close to my group memebers (which I didn't mind, either). After 2 days, we did group work again (i actually tried to contribute to the group) and he commanded me to move closer to my group members. I am not sure if he saw me working because he sounded really pissed. The next days was just awkward and i didn't  know if I should approach him like i usully do. Now i have to send him an email regarding a few concerns i have (other than these situations). Should i apologize for last weeks lack of cooperation, or would that release too much info about my emotions? I am really usure of what to do. If i address the lazy part, I would like to keep why i was ""lazy"" private and just state that it was personal reasons that caused me not want to work with them.

There is someone in my life (that I would like to keep in my life) who just refuses to acknowledge that I have even a remote idea of what I'm talking about. They'll ask my opinion on an emotional topic, like how to handle a relationship problem, and I'll try to give an unbiased answer but they insist I'm putting personal feelings into it. They'll ask about a tangible problem, home repair, for example, and when I give them ideas they completely ignore whatever I said and just say they'll call a professional.

39,"Im still confused. About 20 minutes ago, I arrived home and quickly notice a plastic water bottle with unknown orange liquid mixed with dirt. The bottle was upright in the middle of the floor in my living room. I know it sounds like its not a big deal and its just a plastic bottle but, I live alone and I have no idea who did that. The plastic bottle came from my house because its from the brand of water I have right now. However, it wasn’t me who filled it with orange liquid and put dirt in it. My house is always locked no way someone entered. Nothing else is out of place and I don’t even own orange drinks at all! Who filled this bottle and why put dirt in it! Im kind of scared because Ive experienced a lot of supernatural activity here and the fact that it has dirt in it, makes me think it could be bad. Does anyone have any idea of what it could symbolize?? I know its vague, but I don’t know what to do with it now and I have no logical explanation. Im curious of what the orange liquid is but Im scared to open it. Maybe I should just throw it away and forget about it. ",11Dec2018,1

I apologize in advance if there is some grammatical errors in text cause english is not my first language.  

So hi all, am 25m from South Europe and am in a need of advice.

Basically i finished high school which i didn't liked a bit and at the time i should join some colege my parents and i didn't had that much amount of money so i didn't go ( i regret it every day of my life). After highschool i started working and i had worked for 4.5years ( in some type of hardware store). At that time I was thinking that would be enough for me but i was wrong. I quit that job like year and a half ago and since then i worked some part jobs but nothing serious and permanent. For more than a year am struggling with depresion because of meaningless in my life and the worst part is that I don't know what to do in life, like i can't find  something that i would like to do.  
So it would be nice if you could reccomend me some jobs/career i could learn in a few month cause I really need to learn something to do which is  fairly/good payed and can be learned in  relative  short period of time.  


Am very  thankful for any kind of advice.

43,"**Background:**

I am 23, and live at home with my Mom and Dad. I recently graduated college, and am working full time and looking to apply for Grad School. 


My younger brother has Bipolar disorder and possibly Conduct disorder. He has been a heroin addict since 14, and is now 21 with a pregnant girlfriend. He hasn't lived with us for a while. I think my Dad feels like he failed somehow, and my brother hates him, calls him abusive. I grew up right alongside my brother, and my Dad was never abusive. Then again, my brother thinks my parents owe him something despite stealing from them and faking a pregnancy and miscarriage for money. He called them abusive when they wouldn't bail him out of jail or give him what he wanted. 


Growing up with my brother like he is, I quickly became a parentified child. I was more the adult in the house than my Mom when dealing with my brother. Because my Dad's work, he's away from home at  least half the month every month. So when he was gone, I was always the one that directed what would happen. My mom would be breaking down when my brother did. I've always been the cool, calculating, logical, and decisive one. 

-----


My Dad is becoming seriously depressed, and it's scaring me. He's in his 50's, and drinks so much when he's home from work. I can't tell if he acknowledges if he's an alcoholic or not. He doesn't go to sleep without at least 6 beers. He just sits at his computer and does some things around the house ever so often when he's home. 


I've always looked up to my Dad. We're similar. Neither of us really talk to one another unless it's necessary, and we understand each other. Keep to our own business. 


He's been texting my Mom, though. And she's coming to me about it more and more often. She said he's texted things like ""I'm extremely depressed and it can't be fixed"", and keeps bringing it up that ""Dad really isn't doing well."" It seems like she's relying on me to do something, but every conversation she has with me like this ends up with my stomach twisted and leaves a nauseous feeling. It scares me so much. It seems like she's not going to do anything. 


 I love my Dad, I've looked up to him, and I'm so scared for him and my family. I don't want to lose him. He's not the type to go to a counselor and maybe, *maybe* he'll take medicine, but I'm too emotionally distraught to manage this logically right now. 


I want to move out and be independent and on my own and go to grad school and find myself, but I feel like I can't leave my parents like this. I seriously don't know what I should do. I don't want to leave with him like this. ",11Dec2018,1

45,"I'm a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me horribly. All this in a bad way? When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way which confuses me because I worry she thinks I’m a gross loser

Edit: she started saying the ‘awww’ from when I’d get up to leave at the end of every appointment since the time I failed an interview a few months ago for not having enough confidence but I usually would say ‘oh ok thank you’ when I’d get up to leave at the end when she said awww so it could be that idk",11Dec2018,1
46,"If you are sitting down while reading this, tie yourself down to whatever it is you’re sitting on because this is going to be a doozie of a ride. During the Spring of last year I decided to transfer to a different university across the country and get a fresh start for myself after pursuing a degree I didn’t like. My only brother had died the summer prior from a drug overdose and possible suicide, and I lost all of my friends at college afterwards being told I had become cold or distant. My first semester at my new school was going well-I had many acquaintances and one very close friend, and I was content with my studies. Last month, my mother unexpectedly passed away, found collapsed and suspected suicide. I should probably state that I was raised by my single mother and have never had a father figure in my life, so at this point practically my entire family is gone. I had to make the arrangements and I flew back home for a weekend to the funeral before heading straight back to school to continue my work. Since my brother’s death last year, I haven’t shed a tear. I didn’t feel a single thing when I saw my own mother at her open casket. I feel very empty. I can’t deeply connect with anyone or feel that I’m not good enough for anyone’s acknowledgement, and all I do is practice my instrument, go to the gym, study, eat and sleep. I am living like a cog in a machine. There are no deviations in my schedule; it’s exactly the same every single week. I guess what I’m trying to ask is, is there something wrong with me? Is there something I should be working to fix, or is this just what life is now? I’m
torn between thinking that I am just an animal, a part of nature and I have no time for love as it’s just a chemical reaction-and also feeling like if I just mattered to a single human being I might actually feel something. This cognitive dissonance or tear in my beliefs has me feeling fine on the days I can convince myself I’m nothing more than a part of nature, and dreadfully empty on the days I want to be cared for. I spend a lot of time with the questions, “what is it I’m missing? Why am I not worthy of anyone’s love, and why is it that I am the last left of my family, when my brother was actually someone who was worth something? Why didn’t I feel anything at my mother’s funeral?”",11Dec2018,1
47,"I feel embarrassed asking but I am young and naive and am just beginning to have to pay for my own things now as opposed to relying on my parents.

My friends are all planning on going away this coming reading week to Mexico together. We all made this amazing plan and we are all so excited. We need to book in the next couple weeks. I do not have the money right now and my parents told me that they had a bad year work wise and would not be able to spot me before I start working in January to pay them back.

48,"For a while I didn't really have too many friends until recently. Most of them go to my school and we all like the same things. Cars, gaming, etc.

They are all awesome people, although they can be a bit childish. Today my friend was speeding toward me in his Toyota 4runner and decided to throw a piece of a big mac at me while he sped past. It was kind of dumb but kind of funny I guess.

The one thing that really bugs me about all of my friends though, is that they only listen to rap. And I hate it. I listen to metal and 90s electronic music. Every time I hang out with them they are blasting Migos or Sheck Wes. They show me songs that are supposedly ""bangers"" but it just goes way over my head.

I'm really not sure how to deal with this. Is there some way that I could sort of teach myself to like it? I will admit that SOME of it is ok, but most of it is just garbage to me.",11Dec2018,1

53,"I’m 20 years old and I honestly feel like I’m surrounded by users. I’ve had 2 ‘best friends’ who have both done the exact same thing to me.

M -
Was best friends with this girl for years and years and she started dating my other friend , B. When I would hang out with M and her group of friends I noticed they were all very off with me and wouldn’t really give me the time of day.. when her and B broke up I would chill at B’s apartment with this entire group of friends and one by one they each came to tell me I ‘wasn’t nasty after all’ or ‘did you really do XYZ?’ To which I would be confused. Basically what had been happening was that M would do bad things, she would sleep with someone’s boyfriend (before dating B) and she would then tell this group of people that I had been the one to do that, she would gauge a reaction and act accordingly, she would also talk behind my back about personal issues in my life. She stabbed me in the back. She knew I was very protective of her, I had been in physical fights for her as she would lie lie lie to me and get me to believe that someone was going to hurt her over something she hadn’t done, when 9 times out of 10 she had done the thing that caused people to be mad at her. She also wanted to have a clear break between me and her other friends, myself and B deduced that this was so she would always have me to fall back on if something went wrong with her group. 

H -
I was on and off friends with this girl for many years, she would seem to come back to me every 2 years or so and when we were together our friendship was very intense, I was almost allowed no free time to myself. Now I have a very big issue in saying no to people I love and she took advantage of this. She would know I was at home on my one day off and tech me saying ‘come out, I’ll pick you up’ and when I would reply saying no she would just say ‘well I’m outside your house so’ and she would be outside in her car waiting. This friend got pregnant to a not so nice chap and she was struggling financially. I worked a bad paying bar job at the time but I would give about 70-75% of my paycheque to her a month to help her out. One day she picked me up with another one of her friends in the car (this friend had come back to her shortly after he’s getting her car back after temporarily having it taken by the police as the insurance had run out on it and it was going to be sold in order to pay off the remaining bills) and we just drove around for a bit, when it came time to drop me home she started an argument with me from in the car.. her telling me I wasn’t spending enough time with her and I wasn’t making the effort to talk to her ect.. when I got home I text her, she ignored, the next day I texted her and she ‘accidentally’ called me and said ‘didn’t mean to call you’ and we never spoke again. I only sent her one text basically outlining that she was gonna have a baby soon and wouldn’t be able to spend time driving round all day and that I had a family too and for her not to come back to me again.

59,"Hello everybody

I am a senior in highschool. I work very hard to get good grades and to maintain a job where I work 10-15 hours a week (mostly on weekends but I work Tuesday nights as well). I literally do not comprehend how everybody has time to live. I have made a handful of changes in my life, most drastically my phone usage. I only have my phone on my when I am driving. My screen time was 8 minutes a day according to Apple's screen time function. Back in the good ol' days, I would play guitar and hangout with a dynamic group of friends I had and then I got a job. I actually ended lightening my course load because I wanted to ""enjoy my senior year"" while still maintaining a job, but I still feel mediocre. I have put forth a lot of work towards my academics and I am dissatisfied with my class rank; the only person I really ever hang out with is my girlfriend; I haven't picked up my guitar in a long time; I rarely see any movies; I don't watch much television. I am honestly baffled as to how much my peers do in comparison to me. 

In case you were wondering, here is what my average day looks like

5:30AM- Wake up, drink coffee, eat cereal

6:00AM- Do some sort of homework/studying

6:30AM- Get ready for school

7:00AM- Go to school

4:00-5:00PM Workout

5:30PM- Go home, shower, eat dinner

6:30PM- Work on homework

8:30PM- Get ready for bed

9:00PM- Call my girlfriend

9:30PM- Bedtime

She obviously has time to do that but not even send a simple response to my text. I text her maybe once a week so I know that it isn’t because she is bombarded with messages from me.

Should I assume at this point that she just isn’t that interested in continuing the friendship? I can cope a lot better if i know for sure one way or the other, but the not knowing is upsetting me. ",11Dec2018,1

I just turned 25 years old and am working a decent job in the trades paying me decent money ($24). However, for the last year or so I have felt more and more discontent with my current life here at home - my job bores me, I am not looking to pursue an education at this point, most of my friends I have grown disconnected/ they have moved away to pursue their dreams, and I have no serious relationships. My family relations are strong but at this point im ready to pick up the very few things I have, leave everything else behind and start pursuing my dreams and a new life.

My youngest siblings are about to enter their twenties, and my brother and I are in our mid-twenties. We all agree the gift-giving needs to settle down --and it has--but we don't have anything equivalent to replace it with.

76,"I just graduated high school this year, and about two weeks after my oldest brother passed away unexpectedly from heart failure. I  woke up to my parents and other brother coming into my room around 4 am to tell me. My mom was throwing up in the bathroom from stress and grief, which I’m sure has traumatized me. Because he lived in New Orleans and we live in Pennsylvania, we had to drive about 20 hours to his apartment and clean it out. While we were clearing it out, we had him cremated. I have a small urn of his ashes I keep in my room, and once we move to Florida we will spread the rest of his remains in the ocean that didn’t fit in the larger urn we have.

So let’s fast forward; it’s been about 6 months since then and not a day goes by where I don’t think about him. Christmas is coming soon and I just want to skip over the holidays this year. I keep trying new hobbies and video games to take up, but again and again I lose interest. I don’t know, life feels so dull and every day blurs together. I deal with so many shitty people at my minimum wage job while I wait for us to move before I start college. 

Does anyone have any advice to better deal with things like this? I don’t try to avoid thinking about his death, and do my best to confront and deal with my feelings, but the hole left in our family has ravaged us. I don’t mean “moving on” as forgetting about my brother, but more as fully accepting it and being able to live life anywhere near normal again. Sorry if this doesn’t flow well, I’m just kind of in a near constant state of having a scrambled mind. ",11Dec2018,1

I feel like I’ve mentally checked out and it’s hard to put on a fake face each day. My current team is short a person and if I leave it would leave 2 people in charge of 2 hotels going into a busy first quarter.  I feel depressed, and stuck. And I feel like I just don’t have the time to take care of myself anymore which I think is what’s making it even harder for me lately as I’m unhappy with myself. 

I have the option to start working with my dad at the beginning of the year, allowing me to work from home and even travel occasionally. While I love the idea of the flexibility, I feel really guilty about leaving my team high and dry. Especially considering they just gave me a 4.5% pay increase..(Which still isn’t enough to really let me live comfortably, whereas my pay with my dads company would increase significantly) 

Another note, my next position within the hotel would be proactive sales which I don’t really want to do. The idea of cold calling and blitzing and shit makes me want to curl up and hide.

82,"A little background: I have no tattoos. I've wanted ome for years, but never got around to it. Now I'm at the point where if I think of an idea for one, I end up going back on it after a week or two. Really, I think most tattoos are lame. I mean, I love the art, but sometimes I just feel like ""why did *you* get that"", or some people who have them put off a pretentious vibe that turns me off- like every tattoo has to have some layered meaning that has nothing to do with who they are. There are a lot that I've seen that are really cool or are really special, but sometimes it's just... well, anyway. 

So I've thought about it, and I've decided what would be most representative of me is something that walks the line of funny and awful. I came up with this a week or so ago drunkenly bullshitting and said it as a joke, but I actually like the idea:

A tattoo in nice cursive lettering that reads ""mind your fucking business"". I like it because then when anyone asks what it says, I get to tell them while alwayd coming across as a sarcastic asshole.

83,"In 2017 I graduated with a degree in Math and Computer Science. I completed a web development internship but struggled to find a full time programming job which is all I'm asking for right now in terms of a career. So I settled for an IT support type of job in a city far away from home but on the other side of the coin, my girlfriend of 3 years lives in this city and we had previously been long distance for most of the beginning of our relationship.

I really hate my job. I'm sorry to say, it but I hate dealing with people's petty computer problems. This wasn't what I had in mind when I went 35k in debt to get a degree. I hate the industry my company belongs to. I don't particularly care about any of the people.

Honestly the only reason I am still here is because my girlfriend lives here and doesn't want to move elsewhere. If I chose to move somewhere else it would probably mean the end of our relationship. I love and care about her a lot but honestly our relationship has been pretty messed up at times, and for complicated reasons she is afraid to tell her family about me, and it doesn't seem clear when she ever will. 

I've tried applying to other jobs around where I live, but after facing many rejections I just feel really demoralized. If I move back home I can possibly work where I interned or at least get a temporary job and live with family while I figure something out.

85,"So here is my dilemma.. 

I am 18 years old, bout to be 19. I’m just now starting to love life, and have a real interest in a certain industry. 
While I was back home for thanksgiving, I ended up having sex with a girl, a one night stand. I have terrible anxiety, and during sex I thought I was on the verge of cumming, and didn’t. I didn’t want to chance it, cause I thought maybe something came out, so I put another condom on, and then went at it again, but pulled out after my anxiety was going crazy. I was so embarrassed, but my mind was going crazy so it was for the best for me to stop. 
I wasn’t even sure that I did or did not come, and it was really bothering me. She said she was one week off of her birth control pill, and said she wasn’t worried. That didn’t calm my nerves at all, and the anxiety grew. 
The next morning she had told me she got her period, and I wasn’t sure if she was lying, or even if she wasn’t lying that I’d be good. 
It is my worst fear in the world to become a father but this is where it gets even more crazy. 
Two days later, she has a boyfriend. And I’m talking like a serious boyfriend. She can’t stop posting pictures of him, and vice versa. This was about 2 weeks ago. As I was checking my feed, she had reposted a post about him saying “I’m gonna be a dad” and then following saying “one day.” As I did some more digging there were some other posts that made it seem like he was going to have a kid, but nothing that looked like it could be 100%. She hasn’t posted anything about it, and she hasn’t told me anything about it. But as soon as I saw those posts I immediately went into full anxiety. A lot of my friends think it’s just a coincidence, and that he knocked her up and not me, which I would agree with if I didn’t have crazy anxiety. It’s all I can think about. She hasn’t texted me or been in contact with me at all, and I’m scared to contact her, because I don’t know if she’s even pregnant or not, or the fact that she could be with her boyfriend and that would make him pissed at me.

 I’m scared of a few situations. 

1. She is actually pregnant, and I’m the father, which means she lied about her period to me, they break up, which is likely considering they met about two weeks ago, and I’m the fallback to who is the father of it. 
2. The baby doesn’t resemble him, as were two different races, and it crushes him, and I’m caught off guard with the father role, abruptly 
3. Having to take a paternity test. This would probably be the best situation, because I really don’t think it’s my baby, but who knows. 

Do I text her?
Do I wait to see if she’s actually pregnant?
Should I be worrying this much?
I’m terrified. In hind sight this is most likely in my favor, but if she’s actually pregnant I will really be in another dimension of anxiety. I have no plans of becoming a parent or getting in that drama. I’m scared that I’m going to have someone else be the father of what is biologically my kid, and what he’d do if for some reason he is let known that I hooked up with her before . I’m even scared of this girl, she seemed into me and it is really weird to see her bounce from guy to guy like that, and I’m really sketched out because i don’t know what she would do if I texted her.

87,"So I made a friend a few months back online, through a video game. I’ve never actually met her, but we talk through a messaging app and sometimes call. Recently she said something that was kind of... iffy? She started going on a rant about white people and how they are all awful and tbh she never said anything really horrible, (nothing I would deem as hateful) but she made it clear she thought all white people were bad. Just talking about race makes me uncomfortable. I personally like to believe that race does not define whether you’re good or bad. So I just wanted to get off the topic. I asked her if we could just stop talking about it, and she accused me of being white. I’m Asian. (And I’ve told her this, which makes me think she could be joking, or genuinely thinks I’ve lied to her.)

I couldn’t say anything else before she decided that I disgusted her and when I explained why I wanted to stop talking about, she never responded. 

I think I might be overreacting and just being too sensitive. So my question is, should I bother trying to talk with her and/or look past this? Should I just assume she was joking and forget about it?
I’ve known her for several months now, and she always seemed nice. But it kinda just shocked me that she just stopped the conversation, as if I wasn’t her friend to begin with. I guess I’m only asking is because I’ve only known her a short while, and I’m just not sure if it’s worth it to preserve this friendship.

88,"I’m not here to make a bunch of excuses, but if you’ve ever lived in the heart of Koreatown you know how cutthroat the street parking situation is. I live in one of those neighborhoods where, some nights, people could literally be parked on the sidewalk and no one gives a shit. “Red Zones” are more pinkish, if anything, and cars line them nightly when there is nowhere else to park for half a mile in every direction. 

I moved down here with my partner from Portland, OR in May of this year to pursue my career as a personal trainer. He is in music, and we are both in the “grind really hard without a whole lot of payout” phase in the whole deal. I love it, honestly. It’s exhilarating to find out how little you actually need. I’m even eating way healthier just from cooking all my meals at home. 

Don’t get me wrong, we’re both employed. Just in professions that are inconsistently busy and, without enough to fall back on, can lead to being without work for weeks at a time. We make it work and are usually able to scrounge up what we need to, taking an InstaCart or Postmates shift here and there to make ends meet.

Parking tickets are inevitable, to some degree, I know that. Especially around here. We’ve been putting off payments because $93 - when rent is $1400 and you’re bringing in &lt;$700 every two weeks - is a big chunk of money. 

I knew if we had 5 or more unpaid tickets, we could get booted and towed. Four accumulated over the first few months living here, but shit was still tight and I thought we could just push it a little longer... just a few more weeks and I can pay a few off! I just need a few more clients! 

Then Mercury went retrograde again and ill- timed parking enforcement agents were rampant. Since Nov 17th we’ve received 5 more tickets, in multiple areas, under varied levels of acknowledged risk.

Last night I got the final ticket as I was waiting for a Postmates order pickup in a restaurant and misread the sign. The agent warned me he was about to have me towed, and not to park on any public street until I paid it off. Literally this morning it had a boot on it outside my apartment in the pinkish spot that always has a car in it.

I don’t know what to do. The total fine for all the tickets, with the late fees they accumulate + the boot fee (unsure of added tow fees at this point) is $1888. 

To get a boot taken off immediately, you have to be able to pay the entire amount over the phone (but don’t worry, you can use up to three credit cards.) Otherwise you can go into an office in person and apply for a payment plan, where you still have to put down 40% of the total amount to get the car back.

I get paid around $700 on Friday, and have a client or two in the meantime that will bring in maybe $150. But I can’t even get to them if I don’t have my car. Our credit cards are maxed because we came here with almost nothing. My parents have already helped as much as they can, and his aren’t around.

I see my options as : 

-wait until Friday when we both get paid, hopefully enough to make the downpayment but leaving nothing leftover for the rest of our bills/food/gas. 

-try to find somewhere I can take out a sketchy loan or something to put down the full or partial amount

-keep working as hard as I can, now without a vehicle, meaning potentially cancelling/losing some further clients, until I have enough to get it out of impound. 

What happens if it takes weeks before I can afford to get it out? Does it continue to accumulate fees? 

And realistically what is the benefit to backlash ratio with taking out a loan with crazy high rates or something if my debt situation already isn’t great? 

Btw this is my first Reddit post, ever. Like I said, I have no idea what the fuck to do. 

Thanks so much. &lt;3

89,"I've changed jobs a few times over the past several years. My last 2 jobs I didn't get along with my coworkers or bosses and it's a big part of why I left. I also felt under appreciated at both and was getting overlooked for people who weren't doing a very good job but had good personalities. I've learned from those experiences and have matured more too. I still have a lot to work on but I took a lot away from it.



Now I'm at a new job which I think is great so far and I'm really hoping to be able to get along with everyone and stay here for the long haul. It would be really great for me personally and professionally if I could keep this job. My problem is I've learned from my past experiences that I am just not a people person. I think I'm a nice person, but I don't click with a lot of people. I'm really introverted and shy, and the people at my new job don't really get me. When I feel test way I just kind of shut myself off. I really have no interest in making friends at work, opening up about my personal life, or socializing much. I also don't care about hurting feelings. If there is a task to be done I will do it and sometimes that has gotten me into uncomfortable situations because I've shown people up or stepped on toes. At the same time since I don't really put myself out there a lot or bring attention to myself, other people tend to take credit for my work. Every. Single. Job. This has happened to me. I've never been one to argue about it or bring it up, I just let it happen and it happens all the time. 



I'm really wanting advice on how to navigate through this. Being social is obviously an important part of this job but it goes against my instincts. I'm already seeing though that the people I work with are almost offended by how disengaged I am. It's like I can tell they don't really like me that much but at the same time they want me to socialize with them...? It's also the same patterns of me doing so much work but others taking credit for it where they can. I don't know if it's linked or not. I'm really sick of this and am feeling low about how these same things keep happening to me. I hope this all makes sense. I just need to figure out where I'm going wrong.",11Dec2018,1

I wasn’t entirely open with her about the subject and we didn’t live with each other or anything so it was easy to hide. I became fairly depressed and was contemplating suicide. During this time I confided in a friend of mine and told him that I was depressed and that I didn’t know what to do and I wanted to die. I also told him that I was considering leaving my girlfriend of three years at the time. I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t want to hurt her and so I was going to do what I always do when things get though and I was going to push her away. A few days later she confronted me about it. My friend had told her that I was thinking about leaving her, but he told her nothing else. He didn’t mention my reasoning and in the moment of being confronted I locked up. I didn’t want to say why and so rather than talk it out I told her that it was true. We split and cut off all contact. I was and still am madly in love with this woman. A few years went by and the depression got worse. I cut myself off from meeting new people including women and I started harming myself in various ways. I’ve burnt myself with cigarettes, abused alcohol and developed a minor addiction to cocaine. Since then I’ve been doing a lot better. It’s been about ten months since I’ve done cocaine. I still drink a fair bit and smoke cigarettes. They’re hard habits to cut and I wish I had never picked them up but the drinking isn’t as bad as it was in the past. I’ve adopted a stray dog I hold steady work and I’ve been dating a girl for a while now. The girl that I’ve been with is going to be moving in soon. Things are going well you could say. I’m hitting a point where more often than not my days are good. However I still have my bad days. Lately my ex has been popping up in my dreams. It’s been happening a few times a month for the last few months and every single time it happens I sink. When I wake up after one of those dreams it ruins my entire day.

I’ve had the same group of friends since
I can remember. All the way the through school to sophomore year we’ve been pretty close. You see I live fairly close to the campus, and during off-periods and lunch breaks, we would usually chill at my place. However recently things have been different. Nobody seems to respect the home, things have been broken and stolen, and nobody owns up to it. If I ever make a big deal about it nobody really believes that it really matters what happens. For instance, if i complain about *blank* being damaged,  they say “it was just a *blank* anyways, who cares?”  I’m tired of constantly getting in trouble with my parents over stuff that isn’t my fault because I can’t control what happens when I have people over at the house. So I try to put my foot down and say we’re not going to head to my house today. Nobody cares, people still go, lie that nothing will happen again, spoiler alert: it happens again, and the cycle continues. If I refuse to let them in the overpower me to take my keys from me to let themselves in. I can’t do anything. Sometimes i just hang out by myself at lunch so i won’t have to deal with them but I don’t like being lonely and i’m afraid when i return to school I won’t have my friends anymore. They will not want to hang out with me, I only get used for access to my house outside off school 

TL;DR I am losing friends because i don’t let them come over but i don’t like hanging around by myself, therefore I don’t know if I should hang around my friends or not.

95,"I honestly never thought it would come to this point.

To begin, I never was an ""amazing"" student academically. Professors have noted that I'm well behaved and offer great input on conversations and stuff, but my grades are always best described as mediocre. This was the first semester of my sophomore year, and if I remember correctly, I started with a 2.5 GPA. Basically this semester I found out that I'm not cut out for engineering, and as such I'm switching to a digital media program (and as such all the hours I've poured into trying to pass weedout classes have turned into attempts at the hardest gen-ed courses I could've ever taken). With that in mind, most of my classes I took this semester won't count towards anything at all (and knowing this, I did admittedly kind of give up all together on them). The deadline to withdraw was on Friday, before it had hit me how badly fucked I was.

So today I had a math final, which I didn't even show up to (I've got a 62% without it, missed over 25% of lectures, stopped doing the homework, got a 25% on the second of two midterms for, and won't count towards anything in my new field of study).

I'm just so fucking pissed at myself for how I handled (or didn't) this semester, I'm left wondering why I didn't even talk to my parents about withdrawing from this semester (I'd would've talked to engineering advising, but they're completely fucking useless, and don't have anything useful to say). I fear that my GPA is going to drop below 2.0, which will put me on academic probation, and keep me from working my job I have with the university (which I actually enjoy a lot). Not to mention I'm going to have to explain this huge fucking mess to my parents at the end of the week.

What am I even supposed to do? I don't think I have an ""extenuating circumstance"" to allow for a retroactive withdrawal, because this was all my own damn fault. This is gonna be a hell of a long week.

She doesn't have any history of mental health issues besides an anxiety disorder (not debilitating, but certainly severe). At some point she told me that she had been talking to a man online, said he was high up in the military, has little to no family, and might want to come into our (me and my siblings) lives at some point in the future. She briefly mentioned that she had seen him in person before, but that they weren't allowed to talk because of something involving his military background (I'll get to that later). I cautioned her about meeting people online and explained how people get catfished and/or scammed, but I didn't really think much about it. I figured she was smart enough to know this and I thought a good guy in her life would be a healthy thing. Plus, I was pretty broken up at the time about my parents, and also in a dark place due to some other personal issues. So I honestly didn't want the added stress of having to question my mom's new relationship, it was easier to just let it be. My siblings don't know about any of this yet because my mom doesn't think they're ready.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, my mom showed me a picture of the guy (some beefed up guy probably in his mid 30s/40s, decades younger than my mom), told me that they've been talking for somewhere around a year now, that he was going to be retiring from the military soon and wanted to meet us all. The picture she showed me was off his social media, so I looked up his account later. Red flags everywhere. The account is clearly a real person, but when you google his name there are news articles about scammers using this guy's identity, plus a ton of scam identifying websites warning to be careful of people online using his name. The real account even has videos up saying what accounts are his, and that if you haven't been messaged by those accounts, it isn't him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I gently confront my mom about this, because I know this can be a traumatizing situation, and ask her if she has actually been messaging the real accounts. She says no, so I show her the articles and videos. She says she is well aware of them, that she has confronted the guy about it numerous times and has had her doubts about him, but that it's a lot more complicated than it seems.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She tells me she had begun contact with the guy through an account that had a similar name to the real one, and didn't find out about the real accounts until later (likely after she began to feel emotionally attached). She explained that the guy came forward about it by telling her he's had his identity stolen multiple times and because of that, he had to change his name and now the military controls his real accounts. He also said he isn't allowed to message my mom through those accounts because the military isn't allowing him to begin a new relationship until he retires. When I tried to point out the bullshit, she kept saying that it's more complicated than that and she didn't want to get into it. My guess is he spun some story about how he did something bad and the military is on his ass. Seemed like she wanted so badly for it to be real that she believed him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her if he has ever asked for money, she said no. I asked if she had ever done a video chat with him, she said yes, for about 15 minutes and it looked like the guy in the pictures. I then asked her to show me the account that she had first started messaging. Doing a reverse image search, none of the pictures are of the guy the scammer is trying to impersonate. She says she knows this, that the guy said he has to be extra private due to his background and can't have people knowing this account is his.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where it starts to get fucked up. I ask her to tell me the reasons she has to believe this guy, and she starts with the obvious. A year of messaging, the frequent photos he sends her that are of the real guy but aren't on his accounts, the one video chat, and then she reveals some new information. That she has seen him parked in a car on our street with some of his military associates, that she waved to him and got a wave back. Also that she had seen him in a store, but they couldn't talk because he was with military people. She said the guy messaged her later to say that it was him trying to surprise her. One time she wanted him to prove it was him, so she asked him to put something on her car in our driveway, and claims she found a military bracelet on it the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout our conversation I'm pointing out all the flaws in his story, explaining how it all sounds like exactly what a scammer would say. I read to her some similar stories of these ""romance scams"" and point out how it sounds exactly like what the guy has said to her. She just keeps falling back to the ""it's complicated"" and ""I don't want to get into it"". I tell her even if the guy is who he says he is, is it really worth it to find out given his extremely unlikely story and the multiple social media accounts? That there is such a small chance that this guy is real, it is not worth the risk to go through with a planned meet up with this guy. She is convinced she has seen him in person, that he looks like how he does in the pictures, and that she knows this guy is for real. I tell her she could just be seeing people who look like him and letting confirmation bias take over.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

None of my arguments convince her much since she believes all the bullshit explanations the guy has given to her, thinks she has seen the guy in person (but not talked!!), and was given that bracelet. She tells me they plan to meet up soon, with him coming to our house, meeting us, and then taking her out. She says if it doesn't happen by the date they set, then she is done with him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want her to meet with this guy. I keep thinking the guy is going to give some reason not to meet, that he needs money to be able to meet her, and my mom will finally come to her senses. But the meet up keeps getting closer and none of that is happening. I asked my mom to prove to me that the guy is real before meeting him, and the guy offered for us to go meet with his attorney (??) and have the attorney show us the house he is moving in to after he retires. Plus, I REALLY don't want my mom to have to explain to my siblings that a guy she met online is coming to meet us and take her out, and then it ends up being some sort of catfish. That would make her feel like shit and might hurt my mom and my siblings relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm completely open to the idea that she may be lying about some of this to convince me he is real, or because she doesn't want to admit she has sent money to him (although it would be very out of character for her to do so). But when taking all she has said as fact, I'm extremely worried. This could be a guy who knows where we live, has been stalking my mom, and so far seems adamant about meeting in person. If it's true that he hasn't asked for money, then I don't know what his motive could be. Is it overly dramatic to think about human trafficking? Or maybe he's collecting information to use to blackmail my mom?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I also can't help but think that maybe my mom has developed some new mental health issues, or at least the stress is wearing on her. If she is not lying, then it worries me that she claims to have seen this guy in person, and he looked like he does in the photos. Plus, how can she believe all of his explanations? I know she is lonely and emotionally vulnerable, which could lead her to wanting it to be true. But hearing all this from my mom feels so unnatural, and this situation so unreal. She has never fallen for anything like this before and doesn't show any signs of mental illness outside of this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, I just don't know what to do. I feel like I need to treat this as seriously as possible. My mom has obviously been emotionally manipulated in to believing this guy, and I don't want this situation to cause her any more pain than it has. I'd prefer that she didn't go as far as trying to meet this guy, but so far she can't be convinced out of it. I'd like to get more information from her so that maybe I can point out more inaccuracies or conflicting statements, but I don't know if that will help. Plus, continuing to question the validity of my mom's year long relationship to this guy who she believes is real is putting a bit of a strain on our otherwise great relationship.

99,"I’m in a strange moral scenario. I’m 20 years old (male) and am in a happy relationship with my girlfriend of 4 years. Recently, an old friends name popped up on my Facebook and I was curious to see how she’s doing. We had a thing back in like grade 8, but remained friends afterwards until she moved a year later. I genuinely want to see how she’s doing, and have no intention of anything more (even if I did, she lives about a 10 hour drive away). However, I know my current girlfriend will feel weird about it and be jealous. The question is, should I tell my girlfriend about it straight up and risk her being upset and not having the chance to see how my old friend is doing, even when she arguably shouldn’t be? Should I not tell my girlfriend at all and just do it? I would feel bad about this, but it’s not like I would be actively trying to hide anything from her. If she found out for some reason I would have no problem explaining to her. Or should I just forget about it altogether?",11Dec2018,1
100,"For the past 6 or so months I have been a user of porn. Today my parents were very open about their concern with the content of what I’m watching after my mother searched through my history.

I only use it because it is a stress reliever and I know what I watch is not real love and real sex is very different than porn and I should in no way bring expectations from porn into real sex.

My parents have taken action to prevent me watching porn by 1.making me keep my door open at night(their room is directly across from mine and they keep their door open),2.limiting my use of electronics,3. Inquiring inquisitively about the reasons for my trips to the bathroom. 

How should I best convince my parents to stop this kind of behavior?

104,"I know it sounds douchey and - shamefully, even though I try to fight back and hide it- I kinda am. 

When I see success stories of other people and the cases of brilliant minds from birth, the only feelings I can feel are anguish, sadness and envy. Even though I was never a terrible student, I always feel depressed when hearing about other's accomplishments. 

I know that the right mindset is to focus on your own stuff, but the comparison is inevitable, especially when the compared ones are from a relatively close environment (same school, class, you know the jazz) and what you envied on others was exactly what you always dreamt of becoming and, sincerely, fighting this frustration is tough.

105,"I am the store manager at a small electronics retailer, owned by a larger chain from outside the city. My job pays relatively well, I like my staff, and I honestly enjoy the retail experience most days. I enjoy talking to customers and helping them solve issues, and I naturally sort of fall into management roles wherever I go.  


My issue is a constant string of abuse and mismanagement from our head office. We have entire weeks where stock is delayed, followed by phone calls by the owner demanding an explanation why our sales are so low. A new product will launch, and we won't receive our stock on it for sometimes over a month. When the cancelled backorders start rolling in one after another, I start getting angry calls from my boss threatening my job, or the jobs of my staff.  

I'll sometimes get 5-6 phone calls on days I am off, either from my boss deciding something has been done wrong, or from staff who are so afraid to screw up that they won't make any decisions without checking with me first.  


Most recently, we've had the owner of the company watching our cameras, and calling me to critique the smallest things, even when I am off shift. If my staff so much as have a water bottle behind the sales counter instead of in the break room (During a very busy time of year where they are required to be on their feet all day, and may not get to step away to take a drink), I'll suddenly get a call at home demanding an explanation.  


Another example; My office doubles as our shipping/receiving room. With the Holidays approaching, we have been working overtime to get in extra stock, or send out orders from our online page.  This has resulted in a bit of a mess as I separate stock for orders, and get things ready to ship out.   
I got an email at 3 in the morning on a saturday, with a screenshot from the security camera in my office, explaining that ""This isn't how we expect your office to look."" and a reminder that ""Disorganization like this is why our sales are not where they need to be.""  


My staff are all hard working, and genuinely pleasant to work with. I'd hate to leave them, but the mismanagement, passive (and sometimes not so passive) aggressive attitude, and constant pressure to improve sales on stock we do not have is driving me to dread coming into work.  I'm losing sleep, and am so stressed out all the time.   


The other factor holding me back is that I'm unsure what I could find for other work. I have a decent resume, but at the very least I'd be taking a moderate pay cut. My budget is already fairly tight, and I'm worried financial stress would just replace the stress at work.  


Any advice would be welcome.

My dad threatened to kill him, found out where he lived, found out his family members names, etc. Sent me into full blown panic attacks. 

Needless to say, we almost called the cops on him, i made a huge post on facebook finally calling him out on all the abuse and trauma he and my mom caused me. Blocked them out of my life basically. I just cant stop thinking about them though and blaming myself for everything.  A lot of their friends took my side and my parents are mad at me for that. Ive been told that my parents are narcissistic. 


Anyway, ive been wanting to go to therapy but im not sure if it will even help me. ive heard about 50/50 on if it helps people. even if i did make up my mind on going, i don't have money or insurance for it. so I'm stuck there. I feel like my life is going nowhere. I feel like there's no point in anything, once im dead and gone nobodys gonna remember me in 50 years. I constantly dissociate and its making me feel like crap.

Im so disappointed in myself but I know I’m the only one who can fix this for myself. I’m scared to dance because I know I’m not good at it anymore and I’m scared I won’t be passionate about it if I start again. I accepted that staying angry won’t change anything for the better so I’m trying to let go of it. But I just can’t motivate myself to do anything! Help!",11Dec2018,1
128,"TLDR: Im moving from my hometown in DC to BF's hometown in Cincinnati and all my eastcoast family/friends are kind of giving me a hard time about it, and I'm sick of it. How do I respond?

BF and I have been together for 4 years. we met in NYC. He just moved home to Cincinnati early this year to help care for his terminally ill father. This year i also happened to end my career as an actress, which had been unrewarding and miserable for many many years. (And no, I really don't think anyone believes I quit my career for him or anything, because i had been so famously unhappy with acting for so long, and also famously hated NY for so long. BUT that being said, no one seemed to care that I was unhappy or talk me out of things for all those years. So for them to do so now under the guise of looking out for my wellbeing seems like BS.)

I went to a 15 week bootcamp-style school for software development and just finished. I'm moving to Cincinnati in January and will begin the job hunt for my new career there. (for those who dont know, tech jobs are some of the most ubiquitous and you can pretty much get a good career in any city in America.)

Literally the randomest people are making me defend to them my choice to move to Cincinnati. I'm so tired of it, and I'm so tired of them pretending it's out of concern for me. I suspect that mostly the real reason is that A) they're my actor friends and theyre insecure that I'm quitting the career theyre still miserable in. B) theyre new york friends and theyre insecure that im leaving their city C) theyre my eastcoast upperclass, possibly-snobby family who thinks Ohio is just corn or something. D) they think its somehow weak or demeaning for a woman to make a sacrifice to be with a man.

In reality, yes, I probably cant become Bill freakin Gates in Cincinatti--but i dont want to! After years in a miserable career that consumed every aspect of my life, what im pursing now is a stable career that I can tolerate, and that will allow me to have a fuller life AFTER work, and to be with the person who loves and supports me most and makes me the happiest.

My aunt is asking me to meet with her this week and I'm like 3000% sure its for a straight up sit-down intervention on this subject. and i want to be equipped to best deal with this. because I've just had it. All articulations appreciated",11Dec2018,1
130,"Ok, so I got a new job as a busboy at a pizza place near where  I live.

He basically told me here's the ice, make sure its full, and here's what you need to clean the tables. The complaints were as follows ""you were late (wasn't told I had to ""time in"") I followed a waitress and bartender around(due to me not being trained, so  had no idea what to do, and they were helping me) and I started cleaning the place too late so I stayed after closing to finish (I was also not told  had to do this.)""

131,"Hello Reddit,

I was raised speaking Spanish and didn’t learn English until the first grade. Over time, I have spoken less and less Spanish. I have now reached a point in my life where I have zero contact with Spanish speakers (little to no contact with family) and have developed a very strong and awkward American accent whenever I do speak Spanish. I am embarrassed to lose such a beautiful language but am also embarrassed to practice with others. 

Anyway I can get rid of this accent and speak fluent Spanish *whilst remaining introverted*?

Many thanks. ",11Dec2018,1

139,"I know reddit isn't the ""place"" for a discussion like this, but I want a mixture of opinions and I really can't get advice IRL.   A boy was expelled the year before for racism, and I don't wanna be just another ""racism is bad but it's not MY problem ugh sjws"" type person. Okay? Okay.

I'm a white 15F, my friends are white 14-15M (yes race is important). I'm new to the school we all go to, and I hang out with them at lunch sometimes. It's weird because I felt so comfortable and safe with them, even though I'm usually the only girl when we hang out. Other than this next stuff, they're all incredibly sweet and caring. But that doesn't justify this. Nothing does.

Last Friday we had a talk about how being racist for lawlz is still bad (not gonna get into it, but I think this is what triggered the next shit). Then this weekend my one friend sends the n-word (hard r, no context) into our discord chat. I don't know why. I'm embarassed to say I cried, but it really bugged me. I told him that was sick and he had to delete it.

He didn't argue with me, he didn't call me a libtard or a snowflake like I thought he would. He just deleted it.

We ""moved on"" but that didn't fix it. Tonight we were video calling, and they started playing all these super offensive songs (holocaust/racism) and I couldn't bring myself to tell them to cut it out this time. I hate myself for staying silent, because it's really bothering me and I'm sure they'd understand.

Some of you are gonna tell me to stop being sensitive, and I really tried to not care, but I have limits. Bigotry is one of them. I like these guys too much to report them, and I know that's selfish reasoning, but I'm a selfish person.

TL;DR: My friends are being bigoted assholes because ""fuck pc culture lawlz"" and I don't what to do. This could do so much damage to so many people and I'd hate knowing I could've done something.",11Dec2018,1

141,"My ex and I decided we would try to still be friends, since we were best friends for forever. He broke it off, which caused him to kind of push away from me as well. You can disagree with me, but I think it’s reasonable for me to expect him to put in more effort into maintaining a friendship that’s in a rocky spot because of him. 

Anyways, apparently he spoke to one of my friends about me and basically said we aren’t friends because I behave differently now. I really don’t think I’ve treated him badly. I think he just fails to realize that since he dumped me I’m not going to act like his girlfriend. I’m not going to send heart emojis and smiley faces and compliment him constantly. One part specifically I know had been pissing him off is now that we aren’t dating I’ll be more straight up and blunt about my views. If he does something that bothers me (ex. He and his friends threw pencils in our uni math class and hit a girl sitting near them multiple times), I’ll be blunt and say “that’s rude and inappropriate; please stop” instead of coddling him and kissing his ass.

Honestly, from my perspective, he’s an ass to me as well. He’s just a lot more patronizing and unnecessarily harsh with me now. But I try to put up with it because I want this friendship. 

Should I confront him about him thinking I need to behave a certain way or just avoid speaking to him for a while? Part of me feels clearing it up is necessary, but I also think going in already defensive might be bad. What do you think?",11Dec2018,1

144,"I honestly don't know if I should even post this on here, but here it goes. I feel as if my father always blames me for things.

When I was younger I was blamed for things like taking something, minor things like that, as a got older, and when my parents got divorced, sometimes I felt that he blamed me for it.

After that, whenever he was with someone (and currently still is), he would always blame me. If they fought it was my fault, if they broke up, if she was unhappy, ect.

I am gay, and I feel as if I should mention that because I actually caused his girlfriend to get angry and upset that he had a ""queer daughter"". One time we were driving home and he talked about how I should never even talk about being gay or anything, and in future relationships even told women that I would rub it in their faces to make them want to leave.

Anyways, that's what not all he blames me for. He will also blame me for my dogs being loud, for something not happening right, ect. Recently we got a new dog, she gets along with our other dogs pretty well, but our oldest one tends to get snappy with her sometimes.

She was acting up and its suddenly my fault. I probably should have mentioned this earlier but this has happened at least 3 times.

He also likes to jokingly blame me for this, or I think its jokingly. If he runs off the road when hes texting and driving he will say it's my fault, if he cant find something he will say it's my fault, ect.

I don't know what he expects from me at this point, no matter what I do I feel as if I get blamed. He always says hes sorry afterwards and will say he was just having a bad day or felt bad.",11Dec2018,1

I was studying with a girl and she got an email saying what was on the written final. This kinda made me mad since my professor told us NOTHING about the possible topics.

As time went on and cliques sort of solidified, I now find myself hanging out with the same friend, but we meshed in with a bunch of lazy stoners and nicotine addicts. I know reading that makes seem like I'm just stupid but I knew all these people since I was a kid and they sort of just adapted the lifestyle, and only ever do drugs and shit when they hang out. Now I'm finding myself going from a 4.0 student to a barely passing, and not getting involved in school. I tried spending time with other ppl but it just feels awkward now since we have such different likes/dislikes now than before.

149,"This has really been bothering me. Last saturday night my good friend went to some party, and came back around 1:30am totally trashed. We're freshmen and live in a dorm (double rooms, one communal bathroom per hall style). When she first got back it wasn't that bad, an upperclassman who had been at the party was with her, so we helped her change and get in bed. She threw up like twice, so I said I'd stay and watch her, then the older girl left. I was planning on just getting some work done while she slept, but I figured I'd clean up a little first. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and when I came back she was vomiting in her sleep, so I shook her awake and let her finish. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that I got her out of bed and changed her sheets and shirt again, and she tried talking to me but she couldn't make out any words, it was just gibberish. Earlier she was at least making some sense. She couldn't stand up and was falling down everywhere, I had to hold her upright and lift her into bed. At that point I ran downstairs and called two of our other friends, who said they'd come. When I got back to her room she had thrown up again and was getting undressed (trying to take a shower), but she couldn't even stand so I helped her get dressed before our other friends came in (both guys). While we were alone she pushed me a couple times and I was scared she would hurt me. Our other friends agreed that it was really bad and helped me lift her into bed (again). She couldn't say our names and kept throwing up (she had left the party like two hours ago at this point and had gotten worse instead of better). We called her friends who had been at the party, no one knew how much she had, we asked if we should call an adult, and they said it was our choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

We do have safety rules that say no one gets in trouble if we call someone for help, but of course its embarrassing and expensive and we'd like to avoid it if we could. My other two friends that were there said we should call, but I said we shouldn't. We ended up not calling and staying awake all night to wake her up when she started to vomit again, and she didn't remember any of it the next day. 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize:

\-breathing regularly, normal body temp

\-conscious, but hard to wake up

\-vomiting while asleep, at least 6 times, and 3 hours after she stopped drinking

\-can't speak or stand up

\-no control of actions

\-no memory of what happened the next day

&amp;#x200B;

At that point we should have called, right? Is that normal? And how do I make sure it doesn't happen again? We've talked and she knows it absolutely not okay, she just didn't keep track of what she was drinking. I just feel like I made the wrong choice by not telling our RA, and she could have gotten really hurt.",11Dec2018,1

157,"So I'll give some background of myself since asking for advice doesn't really work otherwise.

I have a Swedish girlfriend and I went to Sweden for university, but as an American, I could not take any loans for tuition from my country nor from Sweden. As such, I had to leave after the first semester that I paid out-of-pocket. However, I want to finish my education there, and my credits are deferred. I can work in Sweden as I speak decent Swedish now, but I need to raise as much money as I can here in the states for a year until I can go back into school. I can only get a visa for school in Sweden, really. 

So I come from the Palm Desert / Palm Springs area of California. When I returned from Sweden, there were no jobs at all. I was broke from paying tuition and didn't have a car. There is no way to get around the desert without a car, so I moved to the city for a job and public transport. More specifically, Los Angeles, as I have a grandma whose boyfriend lives here.

Long story short, I live on my own here now, and they won't let me live there for whatever reason. Living on your own in LA is very expensive. I've come to find the public transport is not as reliable as I'd hoped so I got myself a bike to get around. It's working, but it's a ton of exercise that leaves me exhausted. At my current job, I don't get that much profit after rent, but I think I can convert my bike within the month to an electric bike that can go 35mph(55km/h) for an hour straight. I've been thinking about how I am back in California to make money, and it doesn't seem like I'm making much paying $900/month for a room. I've been wondering if maybe I should move back to the desert where my family is and maybe I can get around on an electric bike (The weather is extremely hot, 50°c in summer, so it must be electric or I'd die). The wages aren't as high as LA, but if my grandma would let me stay at her home, I could be paying very little for rent and have a much higher profit without paying for a car like I used to way back. I'm not sure how my grandma would feel about me moving back in though. I just feel like reaching out for advice because I'm not sure where to go from here. I want to continue my studies in a year but I \*have to make money\*. At least enough to get through the first couple semesters, while a job in Sweden can get the rest going.",11Dec2018,1
158,"Hi 

I have a small toy poodle. I’m 19 and I’ve had her as my own dog since February of this year. 

She has had a pottying problem for the past several years (she was a friends dog before she was mine). She pottys in the house. I bought her diapers and she potty’s in those. She isn’t embarrassed to go potty in front of everyone, she’ll poop in her diaper right on the couch. 

If I let her out every about hour and a half, and I put her in the same spot every time, she goes potty outside and doesn’t in the house. I praise her when she goes potty outside and try to make it a positive experience. If I’m at work (I work about 5 hours a day), my family doesn’t let her out and she goes in her diaper. My mom has get been getting really angry about it, which is understandable but she also thinks it’s because I don’t take care of her. It’s SO weird because she sleeps with me and I sleep my whole 8 hours and she does not bother me to go potty once, and she holds it all night no problem. 

I have tried a couple potty training methods and she still manages to potty when I’m not home. I have no idea if it’s because my parents don’t let her out frequently enough or it’s a health problem. My mom is wanting me to get rid of her but this dog has helped with my mental health immensely. Multiple times I have been in that dark dark place and ready to kill my self but then I look at her and it makes me stop. Who would take care of her? My mom would surely get rid of her. 

I could give her back to my friends mom who has offered, but I know it would make me so sad. I could keep trying to potty train her. I can take her to the vet and see if it’s a health problem but I took her for a check up awhile ago and they said it might be a behavioral thing, but they could do blood testing that would cost over $300. I’m not sure if it’s a health problem since it’s been going on for years and the vet said she was healthy at her check up. 

tl;dr dog doesn’t potty if i’m home to let her out, does when i’m at work and she’s with parents bc don’t let her out, potty training doesn’t work and she doesn’t want me to keep her",11Dec2018,1

I’ve only worked here for about a year, but I’ve been told moving over fresh and relevant content isn’t a problem. Things aren’t generally rewritten so I didn’t rewrite it.

I’ve never had a problem before so it wasn’t as if it was an ongoing issue. Even if it was meant for all producers (all producers have done it), it seemed really aggressive.

The nighttime producer whom I am close with told me not to take it personally, and he has random angry outbursts like this all the time, but I’ve been home for several hours and I’m still bothered by it. Any advice? ",11Dec2018,1

163,"I don't have depression or anything. In the past, I did have severe depression, but nowadays I feel the happiest I've been in my entire life.

The problem is -- I don't have the desire to do *anything.* I'm not bored. I have many things that occupy my mind, and I am always fascinated with those things.

It's just... I don't desire to do *anything.* I have no drive, no motivation. I have no desire to hang out with my friends, to go outside, to go to concerts/clubs as I have usually done. No desire to exercise, or whatnot.

I can *rationalize* pursuing something may be beneficial to me, or be in my self-interest, but that doesn't do anything for me. ""Forcing"" myself to do things is an ineffective method, too. I need to feel that self-desire and passion to pursue something in order for the pursuit to be worthwhile, and to be engaged.

164,"I apologize in advance for the length, I've provided a TL;DR

I'm a 21yo male, my girlfriend is 19. She's not on BC because she isnt comfortable with the possible side effects and I don't want to pressure her into something she isnt comfortable with. I literally just found out less than 2 hours ago that my girlfriend is pregnant. We've only had sex twice in the last 6 months, once in late September, and also around november 30th less than two weeks ago. In September we had sex with a condom, however it broke a few minutes in. I didnt ejaculate and I noticed the break immediately and pulled out after one thrust (pre cum is the worry). She had her period 5 days after that. Then a month later she was 14 days late on her period. This isn't too unusual for her as she has been late on her period before (the longest before this was last February - 12 days late for no apparent reason). She eventually had her period in early November, which means she's had two periods since we had sex in September. She also took a pregnancy test in late October when she was really late and it came back a hard negative. That alone plus the fact that the odds of her getting pregnant from pre cum are super low makes me think that this is the most unlikely scenario.

Like I said, we had sex on the 29th or 30th of November, which means she would be at most like 6 days pregnant if that was the cause (she found out on the 5 of December). Condom broke that time(no more Trojan ultrathin from now on lol), I didn't ejaculate inside, however afterwards I finished on her ass and perhaps some of it dripped down to her baby maker. She has a doctors appointment for next monday to find out for sure.

So there's 3 scenarios I can think of 1. Last september - least likely 2. There's something wrong with her hormones (hence the frequent random late periods) and she got a false negative 3. She got pregnant less than a week ago - most likely

We are both willing to do an abortion so long as the fetus does not yet have a heartbeat or have brainwaves. We are both in complete agreement that if she if multiple weeks pregnant then we will do adoption. So really the worst case scenario is that the next 9 month are going to be really awkward and stressful for both of us. I know I shouldn't be so worried, and on the outside I'm not and I handled the news insanely well. With that said, I keep getting anxious chills and have been holding of a panic attack, despite not feeling too worried. I can't get my mind off it. How do I keep my anxiety under control. I need to be calm and think rationally but my brain is giving me a hard time. Any advice? 

TL;DR: found out two hours ago that my gf (19) is pregnant (I'm 21). We likely spotted it very early and abortion is likely on the table, along with adoption. I've been dealing with bad anxiety (panic attack mode) and I don't know how to keep myself calm. Please help if you can!",11Dec2018,1

169,"I'm a full-time student, just finished my first semester. I'm working on the side for some money to pay off my bills, and a bit of credit card debt. I've been working in retail for about 6 years now at this place, stocking shelves and all that. Had this job ever since I was legally allowed to work (I'm 21 years old and the legal age to work here in Canada is 15½ with your school's permit). I've been dreading my time there for as long as I can remember. It was a good place to work in when I was in high school - flexible, rarely any jarring coworkers, etc. But ever since my old manager retired and another took over - so many things have changed for the worse (including the employment of this bitch lady who is definitely much older than the aforementioned retired manager). I could go on about how terrible this job is, and I'm sure that at some point you'd be inclined to support me in quitting this job. However, my brain tells me that I should keep this job, no matter how much my body may disagree with it (I have been suffering from knee pain lately due to all the physical work, including countless amounts of kneeling over the years). Anyways...

Recently, I scored this 1-3 month contract at a place for data entry - I'm helping them with uploading the content from their documents onto their websites. Work from home, work whenever you want, work as much as you want (within limit), better pay even in comparison to what I'm making after ~6 years at this retail place, no deadlines, etc. You get the gist of it - it's pretty much everything a student would want. I started training today, and while I'm still getting used to the process - it's much less stressful than my other part-time retail job. It also helps with getting experience for, finally, *something new*. Now, while all of this sounds like rainbows and butterflies - it's not a contract position where I have the possibility of being offered a permanent position, it's only a contract for services, meaning they'll let go of me as soon as the term/work is done.

But I want to be a selfish fool.

For the longest time, I've been stuck in this vicious cycle of ""I'm going to quit this job"" -&gt; not quitting because ""I need it for the money"". I've tried applying for other jobs and have gotten none. Until now. I've finally been given a legitimate way out - I'm on the verge of finally accomplishing what feels like a life-long goal of mine: to leave the place. My oh-so-reasonable plan is to quit my retail job, keep looking for another job during my 1-3 month contract at the new place, and once it's done, I can work elsewhere from there. But the realistic side of me tells me that it's possible that I won't get another job. And if that happens - I'd have to find ways to support myself for the remainder of my 1½ years in school as my parents are unable to financially (although I am absolutely thankful that I am still living under their roof). Regardless of all of this, my personal feelings about this is that I want to do *something else*, anything else that would break this cycle of being stuck in the same place. I want change in my life, and this work has been wearing me down for as long as I could remember.

Would it be so selfish of me to quit this job now? Would it be so irresponsible of me to take the risk, despite my responsibilities with my bills and credit card debts lurking about? Somebody please slap some sense into me. Is it a bad call to quit the retail job? Can I be selfish *just this once* and take the risk, but bring about *change* in my life?",11Dec2018,1
170,"Hello reddit world,

I’m 25 y.o. Female having an existential crisis.

Ya see for the last several years I’ve worked in film . Storytelling is a passion of mine as well as acting . I’ve spent over thousands and thousands of dollars poured into becoming great. 

Tbh I’m not the best. I have my moments but struggle with getting stuck in my head and second guessing myself .

Regardless , I’m currently going to school for film and hopefully a minor in production and have taken a hiatus from film , but my subconscious won’t let film go. 

I can’t get my mind off of it.
It lingers in my mind all the time to the point where it feel like I’m a psychopath on a merry go round having to solve the same issue multiple times.

In addition , I can’t help but worry how insecure having anything to do with film, be my career path. Whenever you do anything with art I feel people think you’re a charity case.

I want to be able to provide for my children one day .

I just don’t know how people make decisions and follow through 

I’m completely terrified. I want financial stability , I want to be successful and I don’t want my husband to feel as if he has to financially support the family because I can’t .

To keep you up to date we do not have kids, just a doggo. Hence my username.

What are questions you ask yourself when choosing a major?

How do you choose a career?

What if I make the wrong choice? I have a responsibility to my family and don’t want to let them down.

Furthermore, you may ask why don’t you ask your parents. I don’t really have them present in my life currently . (Long story for a different question)

How does one get clarity from ego and their own ideas of what a career might be to dedicate their lives to a specific job path? 

Please let me know what you think. Thank you.",11Dec2018,1
171,"My daughter has a Theology teacher that she is not fond of. She goes to a Catholic school where theology is part of the curriculum. Of course they are exploring certain life issues. Most Theology classes so far have allowed a healthy amount of discussion and discernment to help mold student beliefs and faith. This one particular teacher has a teaching style of lecturing which is not very exciting for the seniors in there class. He also has a tendency to talk down to the kids and doesn’t listen when they want to challenge his lecture. What he says is what they should know and those are the only correct ideas. Needless to say, he is not my daughters favorite teacher. 

Anyway, she came into class a minute late today and he asked why she was late. She told him she was at her locker. He MOCKED HER in front of her peers and some in the class laughed. She told him she thought he was rude and he said she was rude for being late. It was obvious that he struck a nerve with her. She said she almost cried. Im upset because the number one rule I was taught as a teacher is that there is no room for sarcasm when dealing with a student. It is unprofessional. Do I call this guy out or make a complaint? He acts as if he is so pious and then he jabs at my daughter?  I feel like he needs taken down a notch. He’s only been in the classroom for about 7 years. I think he still has a lot to learn. I also am concerned about his ability to reach kids this age. They have opinions and the ability to think on their own. 

She is not a fragile girl and is capable of speaking her mind. This just struck her because no one has treated her this way at school.

173,"Reddit, I am in search of some words and/or stories that will help me with something that I haven't been able to shake since April of this year.   


To make things simplified, I smoked a little to much weed which lead me to a bad experience. After this experience I decided to stop smoking weed for at least a few months, as I've been smoking for about a year up until that point. About a week later, I'm at work and I end up getting a panic attack that was much similar to my bad experience when I had smoked too much alongside with light sensitivity and what felt like an outer body experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

From that moment things seemed to go down hill, as I was experiencing something that can be common after a bad weed experience known as depersonalization/derealization (DP/DR). Since April, I have had a few waves of heavy numbness-like depression, but generally being mildly depressed and experiencing DP/DR and these generally take turns swinging at me metaphorically. I've seen a therapist, but it was through the county hospital (tax paying doctors, meaning I don't pay for it as I can't atm) and although I understand there's a clinical process it just seemed like the therapist didn't really understand my condition any more than I did, as they admitted they work on particular areas of which didn't really include my area. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working on exercising and eating healthier, and I've listened to a podcast by a person who seems to know a lot about anxiety known as Dennis Simsek (TheAnxietyGuy). I do not take medication as of right now, I'm trying to do literally everything before going to it. Lastly, a positive note is I have not felt suicidal in this entire process. I am often tied between the two feelings of:"" I want this to be fixed and i'm determined to do so. What can I do to make this even more efficient/optimized?"" and ""Wow this feels really bad and nothing is changing my mindset of feeling this way.""

&amp;#x200B;

As an important side note, I am 26 years old, and feel like I'm just really behind not only just my age group but period. I chose the route of living with my parents and working menial jobs while not taking school serious because I'm not passionate about anything school has offered. I told myself that it's more important to play video games and fuck off basically, and because I was able to just pay my own way that I could justify it somehow by saying ""hey at least I work."" A lot of my friends aren't around anymore, we are all becoming adults and are moving and/or not having time/ability to talk to each other like we used to. My social circle is pretty much empty aside from my family, which they are as supportive as they can be. My family has a hard time understanding it, aside from my dad who has been a big help, having this disorder run in the family. I think this is important because when my mind isn't working off of what I'm currently experiencing, this is commonly what my \*nobody is around this is what I think about\* sort of thoughts are.  Reddit these are things I understand are not okay, but I chose this path and repairing it was a lot harder than I thought it would be.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it sounds like it, but I'm not looking for anyone to feel sorry for me, Reddit. The last thing I really want is for someone to say how hard I've had it when in fact it's the complete opposite. I understand some of the things I need to do such as nutrition, exercise, finding ways to think positively, stop taking the easy route in life, and what I've learned recently is RESPECTING THE PROCESS. However, when you're in the middle of it, this feels never-ending and it's nice to hear from people who've been through something similar to boost my spirits. I understand that time is the most valuable currency in the world, and I thank you for spending some of yours with me. ",11Dec2018,1

178,"Over the course of the past 8 months or so, everything my friend does has become increasingly cringey and obnoxious to me. It started with a sudden realization that she lacks all self awareness, and boundaries. She is the type to claim that she always puts more into relationships with friends, family, and men than she receives. From what I have observed from her relationships with others, as well as myself, is that she is there for people when it is convenient. She is a really emotionally taxing person to be a friend with, as she seeks out relationships with toxic people who she admits knows do not care about her well-being (men with legal troubles, friends who openly call her a try-hard) and expects the people she takes for granted to pick up the pieces when she is heartbroken. She is also very taxing due to the fact that she incites drama. Any information given to her (venting) always gets back to the people who you’ve spoken to her about, even when the people you’ve spoken about don’t know her at all. This occurs because she has a tendency to add people she doesn’t know on social media. She has followed everyone in Greek life at our university, and because of this many people follow her back blindly. She has had a history of DM’ing exes of her friends. It seems as though she thrives in “stirring the pot.” My last boyfriend dumped me because he told me she made him uncomfortable on several occasions, wouldn’t tell me why because he didn’t want to talk about it, then gave me an ultimatum of him or her. 

Once in a while she will take you a soda, and later when people disappoint her, she will vent to her other friends (ie. Me) about how those people took her for granted and how she can’t believe that anyone would disregard her friendship when she had brought them a soda or ice cream “just last week.” Although this sounds oddly specific, it is a strangely common occurrence. 

This all paired with the fact that we simply don’t enjoy the same things anymore. I honestly am not sure if we ever had. She is 22 and I just turned 20. She goes out a lot, and drinks daily. She’d always really been into the party scene and has a tendency to get belligerently drunk and expect other people to take care of her. I would go to parties and try to enjoy myself but at some point I realized I got along a lot better with the grad students in my department. I enjoyed going to colloquiums and getting brunch and reading books with people from my major’s honor society on the weekends. I’m at a point in life where for the first time in my academic career, I get excited to wake up in the morning and go to school every day. She lives for the weekends and talks about how much she hates school. She’s also lately enjoyed talking about how much harder she thinks her major is than my own (she’s studying communications. I’m studying philosophy and mathematics). This kind of hurts, and I don’t think she understands my majors at all. 

I found out I will be graduating a year early. She recently discovered that she will be graduating a year late. I don’t think that there is anything superior about my circumstance, however I think that it has kind of opened my eyes to the difference in the paths we are going to pursue are, and how different our priorities are currently. I’m trying to make myself a desirable candidate for grad school, writing an honors thesis, studying for the GRE, balancing 21 credit hours, and trying to maintain a gpa above a 3.75. Her priority and goal is currently trying to convince her parents to pay her sorority dues for an additional year, and to be fair also focusing intently on a managerial position at Sephora (which is something I’m obviously proud of her for aspiring to). 

I don’t know how to distance myself, but I know my feelings toward her aren’t fair to her and are toxic for me. It’s to the point of me simply seeing her name pop up on my phone causes me to release a huge sigh and I’m inhibited by anxiety and LOATHING. I know I’m the problem. Why can’t I see the positive attributes I used to in my friend?

I contacted a handful of people all of which meet the requirements a month before the paper is due asking if I can interview them. They all say yes so I send a video of me asking questions in their language as well as me having the questions typed out. 

They all say they will get back to me within a few days (all varied in time) I say no problem but the paper is due the 12th so please get back to me at least a week before the paper is due. They all say they can do that. 

Then a few weeks pass and I remind them all individually asking them if they had a chance to look over the questions yet and if they need me to rephrase or explain anything. They all say they will get back to me in a few days again. 

So yesterday no one has gotten back to me. I explain to the professor that I don't know what to do and she said I need to figure it out. 

I contacted them all individually again asking them if they could answer at least one question. They all say yes, again, all promising they will do it tonight. One contacts me having questions about the questions I provided so I explained it to them and asked if he understood. He said yes and that he is making answers now. That was over 5 hours ago and I heard nothing back.

Clearly they don't owe me anything but I went out and asked multiple people to answer simple questions that could have been answered in a manner of minutes and it's been a month. They also all promised me they would do it but not one person has done it yet. 

I'm going to fail this paper even though I asked multiple people a month ahead of time and tried my hardest to make it work. I have even told some I would be willing to pay them if they answer the questions. 

We are all also friends that have been friends for 3 years now and hang out multiple times a month but they never want to answer the questions then either.

My record was reveiwed and accepted and I'm supposed to have my interview tomorrow, great right?, finally, the hardwork is taking form, finally I'm in the place I wanted to be for a year, I'm alomost there, just a few hours away, so what I do?, yes, I just left my station and went to socialize because I didn't feel like working, the inevitable happened and my suppervisor that's been helping my with my application and coaching me for my interview sent me home for the rest of the day and it's propbably going to submitt a well deserved report on me which can possibly ruin my whole year of work or even get me fired. 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part of it is that I deserve it, I caused it, no one else, I wish I could adopt the whole ""me againts the world"" narrative, but, no, the world has been pretty good to me, it's me, I've been fucking up my own life this whole time. I started to think about it, I was wondering if it could be a form of subconscious auto-sabotage related to being scared of succeeding, I've heard that concept before. But, no, is not, I really wnat to succeed I want to be an adult, and follow my dreams and achieve everything I want to achieve, but something is preventing me, and that something is that I am spoiled.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been granted everything I asked for, people are always going the extra mile to help me and support me, and I just take it for granted and don't put enough from my part, ultimately betraying the trust of everyone that ever offered me a helping hand, and I don't mean to, seriously, my intentions are never bad, and I think people know that, that's why they always giving me second, thirth, fourth, fifth chances and getting let down on every single one of them. My mom has already given up on me, on a passive way, she hasn't told me anything about it, but she just won't help me because she knows that I won't probably do my part. The people at my job had given me so many chances as well, and I know that there's going to be a moment where they either give up or find out that I've been fired for some stupid shit and think ""what a waste of potential"". Early this year, I began taking singing lessons, something that I always wanted, and I was also on a diet, and I was doing great, my teacher was very supportive of me and really enouraged me to continue, telling me that I had a lot of potential for singing and that out of all her students I was the most promising, she also started her own diet because my weight loss inspired her, always making remarks on how admirable my discipline was, what she didn't know is that I was back to my old eating habits and that in a few months I was going to quit the lessons, because ""I wasn't in a good place and I needed time for me"", of course I didn't tell her that, instead I lied and told her I  had limes decease and that I was going to take a few months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired of this, I hate myself, the part that eats me up inside is that I'm completely self-aware of all of this and I keep doing it, is not that I don't know better, is not that I don't have the resources, is not that I don't have the support, I have everything, I'm stucked, most fuck ups do this shit because somehow they have fun doing it and because they don't really acre about any of this, but, I do care, I really do, there's just something inside me that's broken and I need to know what it is and fix before it's too late, this is horrible, I can think of all the people I've let down before and is so fucking heart-breaking, I just can't do it anymore, but I don't know how to fix it, they day that identifing the root cause is the best way to fix a bad habit, but I don't know how. I just can't please, help me, seriously, help.

186,"So at a tennis match, I was with a friend on the team and we just sorta started talking to a girl from the other team. I went to the restroom(I left my phone on) and I told the two of them to watch it. The girl from the other team put in a text shortcut in my phone, she changed ""good"" to ""penis stick"". (In reference to a google translate fail we were laughing at before.)

My parents are getting divorced, they aren't legally divorced yet but my mom already moved out. On Saturday, my dad texted me asking how my day was, and I tried to respond with ""good"" but it changed to ""penis stick"". When I got home, he was fuming. I explained what happened and he's blaming for everything that happened. We called my mom and we agreed that we should just talk to my friend's parents about how we can stop this from happening again. (I tried to explain that it was a joke, but he doesn't see it that way.)

Now, he keeps ranting about how he has to find her and ""punish"" her. I've already explained to him that we can't do that, and she lives in a different city. (And if he finds out a way, I won't do it. He has awful anger issues) When I said there was nothing I could do, he punched me in the face. (Which is bruising already) and later on he started pulling my hair and I kicked him in self defense because I was scared. In retaliation, he took away my phone so I don't have any way to contact my mom.

He's still trying to find her. How can I get him to return my phone and to convince him that it's impossible to track her down, and that it was just a joke anyway?",11Dec2018,1

191,"So part of the class I'm a TA for requires each student to give a short presentation of how they did one of the lab problems. I'm supposed to grade them all.

Firstly, in the beginning of the semester the lead TA told me that they rarely take off more than a point on the presentation. This confirmed the notion that the presentation is mostly participatory and it's not actually meant to help improve your communication skills. Although the points on the rubric are still about these communication skills.

Secondly, the presentations are extremely short. There really isn't any time to show off your communication skills. It's just ""here's how I did problem 4a. Any questions? No? Ok done"" 

Thirdly, they are expected to present the question on the day everyone else starts that lab. This I find pretty ridiculous. They are expected to read the next lab ahead of time without me having presented what the scope of the lab is, and their question is often dependent on the rest of the lab.  So often they have to understand the entire scope of the lab ahead of time in order to do that one problem and present it. I also hate how the presentations unfairly give the answers away to everyone else. It would be way better if they presented a problem after the lab was due, not before everyone started it.

Basically, I think the whole system for presentations is kinda messed up, so I was just planning on giving everyone perfects. If I paid attention to the presentations, I would only mark one point off max anyway.

But now I find out that the department wants the presentation rubrics with comments, even though they didn't want the actual lab rubrics. I honestly have no idea why they want them. I don't think the students get any sort of special credit for these tiny presentations.

So what do I do? Print out ~30 individual pieces of paper and write 100% on all of them with no comments and hand them in? Seems wasteful of time and paper, and they'll probably be mad there are no comments anyway. Do I just not turn them in, since I'm not going to TA for the class next semester so it's too late to fire me? Or will that leave me with a bad reputation if I want to pursue a career in academia?

I have pretty bad anxiety, especially in social situations, and it has gotten so much worse since starting college. I've been seeing a therapist and she thinks I may also be depressed. The only people I really talk to are my boyfriend, who I spend almost all my free time with because I have no one else, and one friend who I only talk to in class because he's older (27, getting his second degree) and has a full time job and a wife and a real life outside of class. 

I feel like the root cause of my unhappiness is my social anxiety. I have no idea how to make friends. When I'm around new people I'm so afraid I'll say something stupid that I straight up just don't talk. I met my boyfriend during welcome week freshman year and he was just kind of always around, which is how I got to know him. I joined one club this year but I felt like I didn't really fit in and I kept making excuses for myself not to go and now it's been about a month since I last went, and they meet 4 times a week (fencing club so it's practice). I also don't drink so I've never been to a party.

Then they go into the bedroom no curtesy to even whisper. Big bone drops I’m defiantly up now. And until now I controlled my self I have been waking up multiple times because of them for the past month. I said something to my roommate through text and communicated we have a thin wall and also about her dog. Tonight though I was just sick of it and needed my sleep and freaked out kicked the wall three times and screamed “stop being fucking disrespectful”. Then when outside for a cig first slamming my bedroom door and the main door. I might have been a bit overboard I just can’t take it anymore. She never goes there he only comes here. Always at night. She goes out for hours and leaves her dog here thinking it’s my responsibility to walk it and make it happy because it looks sad and just sits alone in her room. I’ve gradually stopped hanging in the main room and just hibernating in my room. I feel as though I show a lot of respect but get none back and blew a fuse.

Guys please i need someone to talk to.

I was seeing a man for some 3 years. He was great to me and I thought he truly was my best friend. Earlier this year I got a job offer in another country on a 2 year contract and decided to accept the offer. I had to think hard because i love this man. However, he is divorced with two children. My parents are catholic so i knew it wouldn't be an easy situation. I nonetheless introduced him to my mum who was fine with it and mentioned him to my dad though he was un-supportive.

My plan was to return home after the contract and build a life with him. He visited a number of times this year and it was great. However, in the last month he started to drift away, taking time to respond to messages. I wasn't worried at first i just thought its just the distance. We made plans for him to come for xmas. However last week he continued to be distant and i asked if he was ok and he said a number or things; distance and depression which I thought was understandable.

However my brother who still lives in my home country text me to say he has been seen with a girl regularly. Now my country is very small and gossip is rampant. I experienced my fair share there with rumors of relationships with male acquaintances which was incredibly frustrating.

Anyway i asked him about it and he said no they just hang out there is nothing there. But i felt he became even more distant. So i text him to say if the distance is too much or he has met someone else he should just tell me and i will respect his decision.

He made a number or excuses the first being he was a little busy at work and that he was not distant. When I pressed he wrote me long text messages saying that heard numerous rumors that i slept with a lot of men (we lived in different cities) even said he had proof. I asked him to share the proof since i know it isn't true. He said he would rather leave it. He has a prominent government job and he said he cant have a girlfriend who is all of the place. I found it confusing how he would only be hearing about the supposed cheating now. Seems awfully convenient. He then said he has slept with someone else but because he was so depressed and confused over all the rumours.

I assured him i did no such thing but he was hell bent on it for some reason. At that point i said for me it ultimately doesn't matter because either he trusts me or he doesn't or he has just found someone else and wants to move on which i would have expected him to be man enough to just say.

I wrote one final text expressing my disappointment at how he handled the situation ( he said he wanted to ask me about the rumors in person because i questioned why he just didn't ask me about them right after he heard them as i did when i heard about his alleged cheating). I said goodbye and all the best for the future and deleted and blocked his number at that point. I couldn't get a clear answer and he kept saying he needs time to think. And i am.like think about what? If you have really seen evidence (which i know cannot exist since i didn't do it) then what would you need to think about?

Now i am suffering from such heartbreak over how the events occurred. I never thought he would treat me the way he has and it is so painful its unreal. I have to cry every few hours or so. To add to that there were rumors when i started going out with him that he beat up his ex wife cheated a lot and slept with the house help. I gave him the benefit of the doubt given that rumors in my country can be terrible. So i thought that if he truly heard rumors about me he would do the same.

How do i move on from here please help with some advice or your experiences. I am trying hard to keep busy signed up for an MBA. I would like to learn french and i am starting to go out. But at the moment none of these activities seem enjoyable. Please i'm so tired of crying its been a week now.",11Dec2018,1
205,"Hello... I graduated with a Bachelors in psychology and a minor in film... ive always been interested in video editing, game design, coding, and stuff...  but I had fun thinking psychology was what I wanted to get into. I was sure of it. After my first semester in my MA program for school and professional counseling I don't know if this is the job I want to get into.... in one way I believe it would be fun to get credentials in play therapy and cinematherapy, but on the other my senior year of undergrad they added a ""game design"" degree to my school and I wanted so badly to revert back to being a freshman.... but out of pressure I said I should at least graduate with my major and minor in psychology and film so I did that and entered a degree in MA cause it was the most logical step. I feel like I've always just done what others expect me to do... but what I really am interested in might be in something else idk. I actually don't know. I'm pretty unsure. Seeing as I just finished my first semester in my MA program and it was incredibly boring, and I'm working right now in the most boring job in the universe.... but games, design, technology- this excites me so much more and it sounds fun to do those things as a job.... right now i have a boring desk job, and am so unchallenged and bored in my MA program for counseling... advice? 
(another hang up on all of this is that my  best friend has followed me throughout the whole time, she graduated with psychology and a minor in philosophy and we do the same program which is school and professional counseling) I keep joking im gonna leave the program she always reacts badly to it- everyone wants me to stay in the program (Ive been a predominant leader at my university in psychology. winning various awards in research and leadership within the psych, everyone knows me and loves me and follows my lead) so.... there's that whole aspect too) and so theres all this pressure on me to follow that path.... but I feel like there maybe another path. what Im asking is, do you think it would be possible to even get a BA in something else WHILE getting my MA in school and professional counseling? or would it be foolish? (I am also considering other options such as an MFA in writing... idk)

tl;dr: dk what career path I should take, I a BA in psychology a minor in film and just completed my first semester of my MA in school and professional counseling.

208,"A little backstory. I met this streamer 2 years ago and found him entertaining, so I stuck around and we eventually became friends. He got lucky and played a game where bigger streamers were present and got noticed which boosted his viewer count to \~1-2 thousand at his peak. He was consistently getting a few hundred viewers per stream during that time. The thing is, he was having fun. I don't think it was about the money at this stage of his streaming life cycle. He got banned in the game and had to resort to other games and slowly, there have been less and less viewers. It's been 2 years now and I think he's lost all hope of becoming a successful streamer. He averages 10-30 viewers per stream with most of them being old viewers who found him 2 years ago and stuck with him. Most new viewers don't stick around for long and has a low retention rate. Overall the atmosphere and his attitude has changed. It's like he's defeated and the streams don't feel the same anymore. I don't know what to tell him. Any advice?

My manager is a lovely woman but her rostering is putting me in financial hardship. 

The owned of the company has clearly asked for shifts to be cut, yet my manager has hired someone else recently. Shifts for everyone are sparse but it seems that my manager is rostering other people more favourably, like someone will be getting 19-40 hrs a week and I will only get 5-8. 

Either I could have done something wrong (no one has told me so) or my manager just isn’t considering me. I consider myself to be a pretty good employee so I don’t think I have screwed up and caused my hours to be cut. (This isnt the main problem though)

So obviously with not getting enough hours, I need to get another job to keep up with payments. A co worker of mine did just this, and got another job to pay for rent when shifts got cut, but when my manager found out she completely wiped her off the roster, giving her no hours at all since she got another job. now she is in the exact same spot as she was before. 

How can I tell my boss that I can’t afford to leave this job but I either a) need more hours or b) cant lose shifts if i get another job to keep up with payments?

im 20, i feel like my life is destined to be awful and i dont know whot to fix it before its too late. I work in oil and gas and its kind of soul crushing and even though it pays well enough it doesnt pay well enough for me to be happy and im really materialistic to i think a job that does pay well enough could make me happy. or at least decent and let me sleep in my own bed every night. ive slept in hotels for maybe 20 of the last 24 months and i hate my life. i have no other skills really. i really like making youtube videos when i can because i have like 25,000 subs and it makes me feel like someone cares even though its effectively a number on a screen but i cant just stop everything to pursue that because it isnt practical.

so my question is this, should i go to college to be a software engineer or what. im not particularity insterested in that but i like technology i guess and i dont think any other major id really be interested in. the way i see it i either do that or i stay in oil and gas and eventually kill myself. i cant quit and coast on the money i have saved up because itll run dry eventually and i have a mortgage to pay and a big boy car. i dont want to give nice things up because i like them but i wish i had a more fulfillng way to maintain these nice things. in my dream world i could make youtube videos for a great living like others but im figuring out life doesnt ever go your way and it just sucks. its hard for me to comprehend truly being happy because i know what i want in life but i have no idea how to get there. is anyone really happy or are do you guys just drink like me to forget it. which obviosuly doesnt work because im still depressed when ive been drinking.

214,"Does anyone have advice for quitting a career without a plan? Or experience/regrets doing so?

Ive been at my current job for 8 years now... which I've mostly just tolerated because the company has been fairly good to me, I've grown to love some of the people there, and I'm fairly good at the job.  I've always wanted to leave, but for various reasons i feel trapped, even knowing I'm not. 

Recently, i decided to take a promotion against my better judgement. I didn't want the extra responsibilities, but I wanted to help my boss. And it was rewarding to even be asked. But unfortunately, things have been so stressful with no signs it will ever let up. I feel so mentally drained and burnt out every day, and I can't stop fantasizing about leaving it all behind. Worse is I feel like it's turning me into an angrier person, even outside of work. 

But I was like this to a degree before the promotion too. And I have to wonder how much of my misery and dissatisfaction is simply a product of my general depression and demeanor. I've almost quit on a number of occasions, but always pulled back because I'm so profoundly afraid to make a change. 

But I'm also afraid this job will kill me. And when i say that it will kill me, it might be more accurate to say, my job increasingly makes me want to kill myself and/or just be dead. It's slowly sapped every ounce of excitement and ambition i once had, left me hollow, going through the motions for a paycheck.

So what do I do? Do I quit without a practical plan in place or keep trying to weather the storm until things get easier (will they)? I have no dependents and a chunk in the bank, it should be easy but I can't seem to jump on doing something so irresponsible. Especially with the nagging thought that no matter what i try to do, where I try to go,  I'm going to be miserable.

Maybe i should just ask if i can abdicate my promotion... even though they warned me when i accepted that it might not be possible... and that still would leave me in a job i mostly hate, just with less stress and less money. 

I just don't know what to do.  Thanks to anyone who read this far. Im not even sure what I expect to come off all this rambling and whining. Any insight is appreciated.

215,"tl;dr at the end of this post.

I [20F] moved in to my new apartment at the beginning of September of this year. It was going great until my upstairs neighbors moved in. They are all male, and one in particular lives in the room above mine. This apartment is a university-only apartment, meaning only students &amp; staff are the only ones who can rent here. I’m a STEM major, so I value my quiet time to study since I have to study pretty much constantly.

Since the day of move in, he has been making so much loud noise, it’s ridiculous. Dribbling basketballs, stomping his feet, dancing (I think?) really loudly, banging, slamming furniture, blasting music with loud bass, etc. The list goes on.

So far, this is what I’ve done to take care of the issue:

Called the campus cops, twice. The guy tends to make the loudest noises after the set quiet hours (makes them at around 12-2 AM). Keep in mind, I have 8 AM classes Mon-Fri. The cops were successful the first time &amp; unsuccessful the second because the noise couldn’t be heard from outside.

Complained to the resident manager...8+ times, with video evidence. The guy(s) also smoke which is a lease violation and leave tons of trash outside their apartment, so they’ve been given lease violations 4 times, a 3-day notice once, and a referral to Student Judicial Affairs since this is university property. Nothing has come of the noise issue, it hasn’t been dealt with.

Confronted the guy 3 times, with friends with me just in case things went downhill. First time went fine, second time was a few weeks ago when their smoking was seeping into my room and closet, causing me to get sick and have breathing issues for a good two days. Third time...was this afternoon.

I confronted them about the noise since it’s finals week. I have an 8 AM final tomorrow in a difficult ecology class, so you can see how noise would be a severe issue (aside from the normal footsteps &amp; furniture being shut). I told the guy about my final (he had no idea it was finals week???), and politely said that if the noise keeps happening and doesn’t stop, I’ll stop complaining to the resident manager and resort to calling campus police and speaking with SJA. He slammed the door in my face and proceeded to throw everything in his apartment while screaming “FUCK” as loud as he could. I believe he punched the concrete(?) wall a few times.

That brings me to now where I am terrified for my safety after that incident. I need advice on how to go about it because he’s now increased the noise level on purpose and I just want to sleep enough for my final tomorrow.

Tl;dr: loud upstairs neighbors always banging and stomping, interfering with my studying. Have already called police on them &amp; spoken to the resident manager many times. Guy lost his temper when I told him what would happen if he didn’t stop all the noise since it’s finals week. How do I deal with the issue",11Dec2018,1
216,"There are no aspects of life that I enjoy. Every day I just wait for something exciting or fun or enjoyable to happen and it never does. I live for anticipation and it is always unfulfilled. I have friends and family who I like very much but spending time with them, and doing things that should be enjoyable just feels like work. Actually, everything feels like work. When I was younger I remember liking spending time with friends, and reading, and doing art, but when I try to do things like that now I always just feel crappy. I try to take up hobbies but again, it feels like work. I've gotten really into art, an at first I though I had found something I genuinely enjoy, but I realized I don't actually like doing it, I just do it because it impresses people. I feel like I'm waiting for something to happen, but I don't know what it could be. Even the thought of having a well paying job, or a relationship, or a family just seems... meh. I wish that there was more to life than what is actually achievable. But there's not and I just feel sad all the time. I don't know what to do because I've been becoming increasingly suicidal recently. I don't want to die, but if there's nothing more than this I don't really want to be alive.

217,"**A little backstory:** I started school in 2011 right out of high school. I absolutely loved where I went. It was a dream university. However, due to depression, family problems, and other things I wasn't prepared for, the 4 years turned into 7 and I still don't have a degree.

**Fast forward to now:** I'm now 25 (about to be 26) and I finally have my life pretty much together after taking a year off and reflecting on what I want my life to be like. I know that what I was going to school for is what I'm destined to do and really the only career I could see myself having. I eventually pulled the trigger and applied to 8 different schools and got into 6. I knew I didn't want to go back to the university I was going to. They rubbed me the wrong way towards the end of the 7 years. One day, I actually left the student services office crying. I also always loved online classes and now that I'm trying to be an actual adult and work my butt off, I figured finishing my degree online would be the best option.

These past few days I have been considering each one carefully and have narrowed down my choices to 3 (maybe 4). But now, I'm wondering if this is all even worth trying to finish since I would be 28 or 29 when I would graduate. It scares me to think about job searching and what employers would potentially say about me graduating so late. I also don't want to regret what school I end up choosing. I know people do it, but I guess I'm just looking for some outside motivation and was wondering if anyone was/is in the same boat? Also, if anyone has gone to the universities listed below, what are some pros and cons of where you went?

**These Are My School Choices:**

Southern New Hampshire University

University of Iowa

Eastern Kentucky University

Liberty University",11Dec2018,1
218,"So throughout this year, there was a lot of self reflection, self improvement in my part mentally and physically. I was really in touch of myself and came to an understanding that I needed more self improvement to become somebody I wanted to be, a better version of myself. I met some new great friends, and had a revelation of the importance of my current friends and family as well.

So at the end of the year I thought of showing my appreciation in the spirit of the holidays as well, so I wanted to buy gifts for my friends and family, and also a gift to myself. 

But the problem is I can only choose me or my friends and family. And knowing the financial situation I am currently in, I would not be able to buy a gift for everyone. So I need some advice on whether I should still try, and leave myself last. Or Treat myself for a years worth of self improvement. I know that this might come off as selfish being unable to decide whether to buy myself something or for others, but the previous years were really tough on me and I had to pull myself out on my own in the end.",11Dec2018,1
219,"So I have never dated before and I really take a lot of time working on myself trying to be the person I want to be in the future, I've been working on my career, working on my wardrobe, working out, trying to better my social skills, things like that, and although most of it is for me, there is a part of it, that's to attract the type of man that I want to be with in my future.

 I understand the road that I'm on is going to take years of what I'm doing to reach where I want to go, and personally having someone in my life right now, that would play such an important role in my life feels like it would slow me down, unless we had the same goals and understandings about each other, and I understand that it all depends on the guy but it feels like all the guys that I've tried to consider just aren't in the mindset I feel I need them to be, for where I want to go.

226,"I'm in my second year of college and my relationship with my mom has been getting increasingly worse. she constantly threatens my tuition whenever I do anything she doesn't approve of. For example, I changed my major from Bio/Pre-med to Global Health and she nearly pulled me out of college altogether. Last summer while I was living at home, I was seeing a guy she disapproved of and when I missed curfew because I was out with him, she locked me out of my house for 3 hours in the middle of the night and cancelled my phone plan. After that, I decided to play by her rules because she pays my tuition for college (which I'm extremely grateful for) and I want to avoid loans as much as possible. But once I went back to college this semester, I started seeing the guy again. I kept it hidden from her because 1. it wasn't a serious relationship and 2. I knew she'd flip tf out. More recently though, things with him have become very serious and we are both really invested in the relationship, so I was planning on telling her soon but I knew I would need to put a lot of thought into how I did it. Anyway, she snooped through my debit card charges and noticed I was taking a lot of ubers and basically confronted me tonight that she knew I was seeing this guy again. I didn't deny it, and it turned into a huge argument where she basically gave me an ultimatum: either him or her. At this point, it's clear that there are some underlying issues she needs to address and this ""boy"" is merely a vessel through which she's expressing her own insecurities. She's made me share my location with her and give her access to my uber account so she knows where I am at all hours. I can't live this way for another 2 years (the amt of college I have left); it's suffocating and extremely toxic. At the same time, she is supporting me and saving me from thousands in student debt.

I guess I was very involved in my friends lives and never felt like he wanted to see me more than once a week. I guess I was wrong? But he didn’t ever show signs of it and never made plans so idk why he blamed me. He even said it was unfair to me when we were breaking up because he “never talked to me about it.” I don’t think he has been in a relationship since though. Now my newer ex cheated on me while I was traveling. He was showing signs of straying as my trip got closer and even broke up with me once a few months before the cheating claiming he was in a bad place emotionally. See him and I had the opposite issue of not communicating. We argued a fair amount, but we always made up and I thought we really cared about each other. I really shaped up on the arguing after the first time we broke up but idk.... idk what I did wrong. I feel as though he found me boring or something and it hurts me to this day. It’s been months. He also got into a new relationship a couple weeks after the cheating. He did actually contact me after we were through about 5 days after the breakup saying he wished he could talk to me. I obviously didn’t reply and a week or two later he was in a new relationship. The guy I’m with now says he loves me and could never want to lose me but that’s what that cheating bastard said too, before he broke up with me and CLEARLY just got back together with me for his own sake and cheated when the opportunity came.

&amp;#x200B;

It started with my alcoholic sister having parties after 10 in her house with my nephew, it grew into her verbally harassing me in front of her friends The day before thanksgiving, the boy's dad stepped into the house. Change of rules: I wasn't allowed to eat house food, they gave me the address of the food bank. So that was my new place to go.  


The dad is also verbally abusive, sizing people up and openly judging them. He has 4 confirmed criminal charges (domestic abuse and assault). On thanksgiving while I stormed out after the fight, my sister left her wallet out in the open with around $1,000 cash. When I got home, the money was gone. She suspects that I took the money, but her kleptomaniac daughter was there, two drunk friends, the dad, and the son.

&amp;#x200B;

I got them to agree to let me go on account that I was doing such a poor job taking care of their hoard. The day I started packing, I sold several possessions to pay rent at my new place. (Playstation, some DVDs and Blu rays). When I was unpacking at the new location, the dad sent me photos of my bare room stating that it was ""shady as fuck"" and that he knew I took the money and was running away. They gave me one day to get my stuff out or they would throw it onto the curb.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got my things out, he confronted me, pressing his nose to mine, saying that he knows I'm a thief and that I'm lucky he doesn't beat my ass for hurting the family like that. There is no evidence that I took the money, but he picked up my wallet and noticed the Playstation cash (which I had a receipt for) and stated that it was proof. I know for a fact this man is dangerous, but as my friends stated, I'm lucky to be out of the asylum.

&amp;#x200B;

They did an incredible job making me feel as though their problems are directly my fault. The dad has been kicked out of the house in the past for hitting my sister so I know his reputation is tarnished. I'm not sure if I should go to the police regarding the missing money, or if I should just leave this nightmare alone. I also documented every message he sent me, threats and all, and backed them up despite that the dad claims they're untrue.

231,"I 43F have been dating a very nice 47M for about a year. He has three children- 26 and married, 22, and 15.... He has a good job and more resources than I do, big family, etc.....I am a single mother and 100% financially responsible for my children 12 &amp; 14... I have a good job, but again I pay for everything..... and I have no family in the area to help us out..... it's literally just me.
That being said with Christmas coming.... I have a lot of expenditures. 
I have my Christmas shopping done for my children,which I start early as to get the best deals on things they want.... I work extra and try to give the kids everything they want and need and stay within my budget.
I have also bought presents for my boyfriend as well as his 15 year old.
This past week I was informed that I was invited to his family Christmas. Although I'm super flattered by that, I have some concerns.
 I think that he feels that I should buy his adult children and their spouses, gifts [ he is very generous, and has the means to be generous to his children and gives elaborate gifts]
... and I'm having kind of an issue with this. I have only met them a few times and even though they've been pleasent to me, I can't say that I've had a full conversation with any of them. 
He suggested to me that I get them gift cards....His mother and several other relatives will also be there. 
I think it would be kind of awkward to give some people presents but not others. 
It would really not be in my budget to give presents to all of his family ...And I really don't think any of them were planning on giving me or my children any presents.... due to the kind of last minute invite...

I'm thinking that I should leave his gifts ...along with his 15 year olds with him early before the family get together so they may open them themselves without everyone around....
Or, perhaps just show up very,very late after dinner....if at all?
I'm not really trying to be cheap ...but I guess my question is, is it necessary to buy someone you are dating's adult children presents at Christmas time, when you don't really know them?

232,"My big brother and me were our parent's only two kids.  
  
He was born six years before I was. So he was always much much bigger, stronger, smarter, faster, you name it. Than I'd ever be.  
  
From the age of 5 to the age of 15 he'd always antagonize and taunt me. He had a list of things that he knew he could to do piss me off and every day he'd go down that list like clockwork 'till it would drive me crazy and I'd get mad at him.  
  
Then he'd use the fact that I was mad at him as an opportunity to physically abuse me.  
  
Of course, after he'd hurt me for being upset at him for intentionally pissing me off (essentially trolling me IRL). It would just make me even more pissed off and I'd attempt to seek out revenge. Of course this would always result in him just getting another free shot to hurt me again.  
  
My parents never seemed to have a problem with this. They always told me that it was my fault because I, ""... always went back for more."" so they never once felt sorry for me.  
  
But, now that I'm in my mid thirties and I'm thinking back to how he'd treat me and how my parents would react.  
  
I can't help, but, feel that my parents are just really shitty parents. Of course a 12 year old knows what he's doing when he's antagonizing a 6 year old and then physically injuring them when you've managed to get a reaction out of them.  
  
Of course this isn't OK. So, why was it so cool with my parents? Why did he never once get punished for antagonizing and tormenting me and then using that as an excuse to physically injure me?  
  
I mean, of course the older one should be held to some sort of level of responsibility and that should probably include leaving your younger brother alone, stopping taunting him and especially stop hurting him repeatedly.

I also felt he may have mild learning difficulties. None of this was apparent before we met. I was keen to leave after lunch but he wanted to get a photo together and stay with me until the train arrived, I got the impression he is quite lonely and it was Hard to get away from him. I am also worried he may have misconstrued things and thought it was a date (even though his gran came along for part of lunch) or he has developed feelings for me.

I wasn't in this position before - since my older brother was their 'star child' where they gave him all the attention and care in the world, while for me, I was the 'backup' plan in case my brother fails, my parents can resort their hopes and pressures on to me. And so, my brother did fail, and my parents have been building the pressure and hopes upon me.

&amp;#x200B;

I love the freedom of living alone. I've been living alone for about 3 years, returning home when my apartment lease ends for the school year, to live with my parents while I'm not attending school. I feel so liberated and free to do anything and go anywhere I want - unlike back at home, my parents would yell at me for staying at home all day, yet when I do go out, they interrogate me on every single details and tell me to come home before 6pm. One time, they even stalked me to test to see if I was telling the truth. Even just things like staying up late at night 2am-ish to work on my assignments or watching videos or whatever, they'll get extremely angry and tell me to sleep and yell at me if I refuse to listen to them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm taking the semester off looking for an internship, that may require me to relocate to other places within the country. I live in a very small town with not many opportunities. But my parents keep restricting certain areas within the country (the most populated / popular places) because its 'too dangerous,' or other areas because my ex lives in the city.

I'd be paying all the rent myself, and they technically don't have any 'control' over me in that sense, but they threaten to not pay for my rent when I do return to school, or tells me they're going to disown me and never want to see me ever again, if I'm such a daughter who can't listen to her own parents.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also Asian, so the whole culture of 'respect the elders and do everything they say' rule is extremely strict.

I feel so frustrated, since they're not letting me go to the popular cities with the most opportunities (there are literally no open opportunities in my area, and I'd have to commute 3-4 hours with public transportation for the closest places) - and those popular places are the places I truly can see myself living in in the future. The reasons for the restrictions are just ridiculous to me. My parents are the same ignorant type of people who tell me I'm not allowed to go to the U.S. because people carry guns and I'll get shot and die.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just so upset they're literally ruining my future and not even letting me spend my semester off the way I want to (it's not like I'm fooling around - I'm looking for an internship because they didn't even let me get jobs while growing up too; saying a 'students duty is to study,' so I'm a 21 year old with ZERO job experience). They're telling me unless I get hired at Google or Microsoft, I should go work at McDonalds instead, rather than working at a 'no-named' company. Their failure to understand the importance of internships or experience working in a professional setting - how much it'll benefit me after I graduate, makes me so baffled. Even if I try to explain, they refuse to listen to what I say, thinking their way of thinking is correct.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Controlling parents won't let me (21/F) relocate to more populated areas to get internships. They tell me to work at fast food near home instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I convince them? What should I do? Should I just listen to whatever they say? I just feel so stuck.",11Dec2018,1
237,My entire life I have been a heavy sleeper. Every single night I would sleep for 9 hours without waking up once. And if cut my sleep by an hour I would need a 2 hour nap during the day. The past 4 days however I have only been able to sleep 5 hours a night. I’m energized during the day and sleepy at night but my body refuses to fall asleep until about 5am every morning. I am only able to sleep half of what I normally sleep and it’s throwing me off. Could something be wrong? I used to be able to nap on command but now I lay awake in bed for hours.,11Dec2018,1
238,"For those of you who have been through a divorce, how are some ways you were able to cope with it? I absolutely dont want it and am still madly in love with my wife. We have a 2yr old and a 9yr old. (9yr old is hers from a previous marriage.) We currently live together for financial reasons, will be moving in a month for my job (military). It is all tearing me apart. All day I am around our family and I'm constantly reminded of what we have built together and knowing that it's never going to be the same. She wants to move with me and to live together until she is stable all while being able to do whatever she wants while still being married on paper so she can also benefit from being a military spouse. Once she is stable, most likely months from now. I then am expected to move out. And find my own place. I love my children and cherish every second I get with them, but living with someone who I'm madly in love with who wants nothing to do with me is literally making me go insane. I am starting to not respond to situations rationally and I've noticed the emotional tole is becoming a physical burden on me. I'm losing motivation, sleep, and other aspects of who I am are deteriorating. I dont know what to do. Do I sacrifice my sanity and keep close to them or do I cut ties and have to deal with a custody issue?

 Here are some details. Moving from texas to florida. I'm 28m she is 30. Reason for divorce, I am no longer the man she loves. She would rather get attention from multiple men then hear the same compliment from me. She wears her wedding ring when we go out together, but takes it off in any solo pictures of herself. I pretty much dont exist on any social media of hers. I think she is also having a midlife crisis and that is partly influencing her rationality on our situation. ",11Dec2018,1

240,"A couples of weeks ago, I arrived at my hostel where I'm staying for two months. When my colleagues and me arrive, we signed a contract and received 3 keys per person. I received 2 keys but I didn't realised until a couple of days after.

The contract stated that a lost key costs 90€ and I have the feeling that maybe the receptionist wanted to rip me off to pay that fee (or maybe she forgot). 

It's impossible to lost one of the keys because it is fitted in a key ring, so if I had lost one key, I would have lost all of them.

What could it happen to me if she wants me to pay? Can I deny to pay? Should I do a copy of the key?

 We were best friends IRL since elementary school or so until he moved away due to various reasons.
 We stayed connected online and spent on average 6 or so hours a day gaming and talking and whatnot.
A little while I saw a post that had a screenshot with my character in it so I clicked on it and scrolled through the post history and stuff and I'm 100% certain its him. 
I was reading a couple comments he posted and noticed that he mentioned that he didn't really like his best friend (me) either. 
Now I dont know what I'm supposed to do or feel 
I thought we were best friends. 
We talked about everything all the time and had fun online even though we couldn't meet again IRL.
 Now I find out that for the past 4 months maybe longer he was just..pretending? 
I dont know if I'm just clueless and I completely missed all the signs or something but I guess the person i viewed as my best and only friend didn't see me that way.
 Now that I think of it I appreciate the fact that he didn't just completely ghost me or something. 
Reddit people please help me. 
I dont know what to do.

242,"We work in a small room with one other guy and we have a weird set up where two guys sit on one side of the room while another sits alone on the other side next to the bathroom and the microwave. The bathroom is shared. 

Issue #1:


Every day, he will take a really smelly 30-45 dump, which the solo man has to sit within six feet of for the duration with only a vented door between them. When I sit on the solo side, I get really pissed because I think it's rude on two levels:

1.) That is a shared bathroom. One of us might need to use it while you're in there dicking around on Tinder.

2.) I get it. Shit stinks, but to make me smell your's for more than ten minutes is really inconsiderate.

Sometimes, I'll be eating and he will just go in there and take a dump, and I have to pack my food up and wait for him to finish and for my appetite to return. I have tried to subtly communicate to him that I think it's rude by knocking on the door after 20 minutes or so and telling him that I need to use it, hoping it will occur to him that he isn't at his house. It never seems to land. I know that I'm not the only one annoyed by this as the others and I have discussed it before, but I'm the only one who get's REALLY angry about it.

Issue #2-

He likes to sometimes take his shoes and socks off at work and even when he doesn't, he has really smelly feet/shoes. In fact, he literally *just* inspired this post by propping his feet up on a chair right next to me and I had to ask him to put them down because the odor was KILLING me. He acted like I was an asshole for asking.

Issue #3- We used to have lockers but they were removed last year. He made a huge stink (pun intended) about it. We were all offered small plastic containers to keep on a single book shelf, which was fine for the rest of us. He decided that he deserved an entire shelf to himself so he just comandeered the shelf, *in addition to his container*, plus some storage space in the back room that we aren't supposed to use fornpersonal storage. When I decide to leave something overnight, he gets pissy if I try to put it on **his** shelf. I thinks he's super entitled and bratty about this.

Issue #4-

He insists on eating once an hour, so he spends a lot of time in the solo man's cramped space, hovering right on top of him, preparing these over-elaborate time-consuming microwaved meals. It gets so that the poor sap on that side of the room barely gets any peace, factoring in his prestige shits.

Conclusion:

As a person, I like him. He's a good guy, butnhe's really immature and entitled. How can I make him realize that he behaves like a really weird gross child at our big-boy job without hurting his very sensitive feelings or coming off as a total jerk?

243,So I met this girl we have been talking for roughly 3 weeks and things are going good overall. (I’m 20 and she’s 19) and things seem a bit strange as far as romance and she claims that I am the first nice guy she’s dated in a long time and that she isn’t used to it which I understand. My problem lies in the fact that she talks a lot. I’ll get off work after a long day and she will go on for an hour about stuff that either isn’t necessary for me to listen to or things that could have been said in way less time. I know I sounds like an asshole but I’m just trying to speak my mind so I can get some accurate advice. She’s also super hard on herself I’ll tell her she’s beautiful then she will turn around and say that she’s a piece of shit and that she’s ugly and it’s hard to listen to because I don’t want to hear someone talk about themselves like that. Other than those two major problems it’s good talking to her when I get a chance to talk is nice. We make each other laugh and she makes me happy. I just don’t know if these two problems are bad enough for me to need to rethink this relationship with her. I’m honestly not sure what to do or what to think at this point. If anyone has any ideas or had a similar situation I’d appreciate any words of wisdom. ,11Dec2018,1
244,"Hello,

Three days ago I postet something on r/offmychest
One point of the post was, that I proposed to a women and she rejected me in a very calm and nice way. I hoped (was half a year ago) that this friendship might transform into a relationship between her and me. I know her from the gym (she works there) and that’s the place where I usually see her, that’s where our friendship startet. - since today she’s my good friend for two years now

After the rejection (was two months ago), I got “mad”, frustrated and I panicked off in in my mind in every direction.

Until today I play with the thought to change the gym “because of her”
But the point is - I’m the only one there which she knows so well, I know every secret of her life, things which ended out bad/good etc.
Guess I’m a kind of soulmate or best friend for her...I’m a person who worship good friendships

Staying at this place hurts myself not much, but it hurts in a constant way - I want to stay friended with her, because she’s a really good friend, but I can’t really get over my feelings after the rejection

But I know, when I leave the gym, she would immediately know that it’s because of her, I know that she would feel herself very bad and sad because of it and i might would made her cry with this step - and i don’t want this...

I don’t want to hurt her, but either i want to hurt myself

She would think I would just be so nice to her, because “I want something from her” - and yes (at a certain point) there is a little bit truth in this...

Oh, and please don’t tell me about “nice guy” things, I know I have those tensions...

What would you do in my situation? I can’t force myself talking to her about my feelings again, but maybe doing it would solve most of the problems here...

Pls help",11Dec2018,1
245,"So like the title says, pretty much. I’m on mobile, so I apologize if there’s any errors.

So my friend is a young single mother, who has had some rough times in her life. She was dumped by her child’s father this summer and then lost her dad 2 months ago (she found the body). On top of that, she had anorexia as a teenager.

So i’ve been trying to be a good friend and have been there for her ever since the break up. But soon it turned into me and another one of her friends full time job. She’d either come to me with her issues or her other friend. And whatever advice we’d give her, she wouldn’t listen and then return with the same questions the next day. It got exhausting really fast..

Then whenever I couldn’t answer straight away or was short with my answers, she’d start saying how I didn’t care and how she was a burden. So of course I’d try and reassure her that no, i’m here for you but I just can’t answer all the time etc etc

So I think what escalated it was that she needed a place to stay for uni on the weekends (she lives in another town) so me and my family agreed. So the first weekend she stayed over, me and my friends had a trip planned and I wasn’t home, so my friend stayed with my parents and younger brother. During that weekend she got close to my mom and also asked for her number to text if she needs help. My mom is someone who tries to help everyone, so she agreed. Now instead of just having two friends to constantly text about her issues, she also had my mom.

And this has been getting worse and worse with each weekend and the last straw was yesterday. Pretty much the whole weekend my mom and I had to talk her out of suicide constantly. When we even so much as hinted that we can’t do this anymore or that we’re tired or that we have jobs (i had to take a day off yesterday to look after her) she started saying how nobody needs her and she should just go and kill herself to the point where we would have to even physically stop her from running outside. The whole weekend just babysitting and talking her through her problems and not having her listen. So yesterday was the final straw for me and my mom. She started talking about how she’d go home and if it’s bad there, she’ll come stay with us again. HELL NO!
So I took her to the psych hospital (where we had been to twice before already during this weekend) and got her admitted. Today was the first day I slept more calmly. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired. My moms tired. But I feel like I can’t even cut her off because what if she really kills herself and it’s my fault. I’ve dealt with suicidal friends before, but it’s never been like this.

So just a bit of backstory about myself: I have mental health issues myself (ocd is the main culprit). And went through depression as a teen, so i’m familiar with being suicidal as well. My mental health is doing better nowadays, but this whole ordeal just has destroyed me and my mom. I haven’t been this stressed in a looong time and i’m worried about relapsing.

Also, I skipped over some details, because the story would be too long otherwise.",11Dec2018,1
246,"I'm not having a crisis or anything, but is there a site I can just talk at another person about something and have some kind of human response?

247,"Any time I ask my little brother how he is doing he also tells me what drugs he has done or what he has smoked and I get really uncomfortable. He is an adult but I helped raise him and it makes my heart sad to know that he replies so heavily on external substances that it's what he feels the need to talk about any time he is asked how he is doing. I know that he knows how I feel about it and I think he wants to normalize it to me but I can't help but feel sad and uncomfortable. 

When I have attempted to broach the topic with him he declares that he uses (shrooms, tabacco and weed primarily) daily for depression. I don't think he is lying-but it doesn't make it any better for me. There is a reason we have doctos who prescribe medical treatment for depression and he lacks the oversight of a third party and seems to be high a good percentage of the time. 

He is convinced that he is schizophrenic and I stopped smoking weed specifically because it deepend my paranoia and depression when I used it regularly and I have seen research that both weed and shrooms can 'unlock' disorders for some people. 

I don't know what I should do if anything at all. He is in school and seems to be doing ok there, and is interested in working with psychedelics as a future career. He constantly is trying to convert me to what feels like his religion and I am starting to worry a bit more as I am pregnant and don't really want him spouting this to my kid when he returns from college. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? Am I just being the paranoid? I have always been pretty straightedge but not by creed, just fear of addiction (runs in the family) combined with a waning desire as I have gotten older and settled down.

The only place that I don't avoid going to alone is Petco or Petsmart, since I know I can take my dog with me and feel safer.

It would be great if the service animal could be trained to provide a barrier between me and other people- even though its mere presence would be very helpful already.

250,"Hi. So I am heavily considering dropping out of college. I like my major (Architecture) but I cannot for the life of me want to continue on. One reason being that I can't see a way to justify going into so much debt just to go to college. Right now I'm in $32,000 in debt and by the time I finish my bachelors, plus masters (cause it is required to have one so one can work in the field)  I'll be in more than $152,000 in student debt and I do not want to go and have that. Its like you graduate to work JUST so you can pay off the debt. I've seen other careers as options and seeing that Real Estate has all the things I like about architecture and buildings and it seems much better to go into that than graduating with such huge amount of debt.

251,"Quick context: We've been dating for a month and a half, and we are both happy. We met as I started volunteering at the local library she works at. Our first date went wonderfully, and she seemed very happy with how it went, so she invited me to go to her ""evening youth group"" the next week. I thought it was a local group I knew about, but she told me the day of the event that it was located at her church. Now, I'm not religious, but that does not mean I hold religious people in a lower regard. They can believe what they want, and I'm not about to stop them or tell them no. But as someone who hadn't been to a church in almost 6 years, and even then it was a non-denominational one, I was scared. I went with an open mind, and was impressed by the place and the service they put on. I watched in silence, trying to observe and learn. In the end, it was a nice event and I'm glad I went, but I was uncomfortable by the end of it.

Fast foward to a week ago, in which I was invited to meet her sister and mother for lunch. She invited me to a sunday service that morning and I agreed, thinking nothing of it. But again, I became uncomfortable by the end, feeling as though I didn't belong. It was a nice service, don't get me wrong, just not something I'm used to.

I’ve recently developed some form of social anxiety and it’s super frustrating and starting to have a very negative impact on my life

When I’m in public/talking to someone I start thinking VERY internally, all these negative things like ppl are judging me, what I’m saying is lame, everyone is watching me etc etc 
^^ which then causes me to blush making things MUCH worse bc then I’m thinking “ Oh crap ! I hope they don’t see me blush.” 

It’s just super annoying and stupid- and like I said it came out of nowhere. I used to be very comfortable and confident- I could talk to anyone, (I’m an ENFP for Christ sake!) Now I internalize basically everything and get stuck in these bad thought patterns.

I just watch YouTube or play games all day, and I know I should be doing productive things, trying to practice on writing or actually doing my fuckin homework, but I never do it. I have been feeling sad or annoyed the past few months, and while I've been feeling abit better the past week, I felt especially sad and down and absolute terrible during Summer. I could barely sleep at night and usually felt like this most days. I just don't have motivation to do anything. Anything that requires alot of effort, and I need to change this, but I don't know what's wrong. I don't know what's wrong with me over this, whether it's some mental illness problem I'm not aware of or I just put effort into doing effort and somehow make myself work, but that feels mentally and physically impossible. I'm posting here cause I don't know where else to turn at this point. Looking for answers that probably wont satisfy me and I'll just go back into moping over this endlessly and probably wont get anymore in life. I don't know.",11Dec2018,1
261,"Basically we were just having an online conversation when we started talking about drinking and how I drank the night before. He didn’t like that I drank because I was still underage, but it was only a few occurrences that it happened, and I never got out of control. I still wanted to tell him about my night in general because we were still friends and on decent terms even after we broke up. During the conversation, he started replying with really dry messages as I was telling my story. I got the hint that he was getting upset so I stopped and was about to send an apology message, but then it said that he blocked me. I didn’t know what to do, but later saw that he blocked me from every social media. It really hurt and I thought that he would reach out to me sometime but now it’s been years and I don’t know if I should reach out to him. Did he have the right to be mad? I guess he was concerned for my wellbeing, but I just wish that he spoke about how he didn’t want me to talk about it anymore, instead of fully ghosting me. I really miss being friends with him and and have been thinking about contacting him again. What do you guys think? Thanks!",11Dec2018,1
262,"I'm 17, I live in Australia and I finished grade 12 in November. I've been accepted into the university course I want to do next year in a different city. I currently have a job that doesn't give me very many shifts. 

The illogical part:

Because I'm not working and I'm often the only one home I have to do all of the house work because I'm not contributing in any way. At first this makes sense. Then you add my 2 sisters into the equation. They both work so they are contributing apparently, even though they don't pay for anything at all. One of them is 18 for Christ's sake. 

Next they tell me to get a job. I've been spending 80% of the time I'm not being forced to do house work looking for jobs online. It's hard to find work, Ive applied at tons of places and got nothing back. Most of my friends have the same luck as me. I was told today that I should print off resumes and drive around and go to businesses because I recently got my license and I have a car. Only problem is that there is enough fuel in the tank to get to the gas station and not much further. And I can't afford to fill it. And the last tank that I payed for was 90% used when I was forced to drive in the city for practice while picking up my sister. 

There is no logic to any of it and it frustrates the hell out of me. 


The controlling part:

As I said at the beginning of the post, Ive been accepted into the university course I want to do. Its my dream career. My parents are trying to make me do an apprenticeship. Trying to make me spend 4 year of my life doing something I don't want to do. Because they think it's a good idea. 

Getting a trade is not something I'm interested in. They believe it's a good idea because you can make good money if you manage to run your own successful business. They also think I should do it and then do what I want to do. I got into the course now, I'll get into it again in 4 years. Not only am I not garurenteed to get into the course again, this idea of doing it after an apprenticeship also negates the idea of starting my own business with the trade. More lack of logic. 

It really irks me that I've finally found something I want to do in life, something I enjoy and can make a career out of and my parents are trying to shut it down. I don't want to end up like my dad, working a job he hates, waking up at 5am and getting home at 6pm because it's work and ""work always sucks"". I'm a firm believer that if you enjoy your work enough, it's not really work. I'd rather work and live on less money but not hate my job and be so worn out after a work week that I only have enough energy to sit around and be angry on the weekends. ",11Dec2018,1

269,"Ok so a little background info on me and my experiences, this might be a little long so bear(bare?) with me.

So when I started high school I was a very shy and fragile person, insecure about MANY things. Around half the year in I realized how my closest friend was changing(in a good way, maturing) and I also wanted to change myself up and basically “fix” myself. I started going to the gym and I changed my sense of style, started really taking care of myself and my hygiene. It obviously didn’t completely show until a year and a half in when I was almost finished grade 11. I’m telling you this because this was all because of my closest friend who i consider to be the yin to my yang. Also it’s an added bonus that we’re both super different in skin tone so the yin yang thing makes a lot of sense there too haha.

Anyways, everything felt so clear and exceptional, it almost felt like I was living in a utopia in a sense. I was a lot more confident with my appearance and so was he, there wasn’t a day where I wasn’t with him or he wasn’t with me, and we never got annoyed of each other. 

One day he said his family might move away to a whole different city and I took it as a joke since he is a very humorous person at times. I ended up texting him asking if he was serious and he said yes, they were already planning on packing up everything. At that time I was just confused, I don’t know why he hid this from me and told me so late and I didn’t get upset or anything because part of me still doubted this whole thing.

Then came his last week before moving, he told me that he was moving and so he wanted to hang out one last time and we did. We went to a restaurant and just talked about everything, reminiscing, it was really fun at the moment. 

As a going away present I gave him this super old trading card(Pokémon) that I really liked and he did the same. I know it sounds geeky but we were both really into Pokémon when we were younger and that’s what really initiated our friendship in the first place.

Anyways we hung out for maybe 7+ hours and he eventually had to go home to get ready. I said my final goodbyes and I just felt happy even though I knew I wouldn’t see him until god knows when. When I finally was alone, taking a bus back home it hit me, my heart started to ache and everything just felt heavy, I felt like I was staring into nothing and it was a terrible feeling. 

I felt broken, I tried my best to bottle up these feelings around everyone but whenever I was alone I just let everything out. 

It’s been I think 6 months since he left and I was able to pick myself up for the first few months but now just recently, I’ve been letting myself go and nothing feels fulfilling anymore. School is my top priority, I’ve stopped working out, I have an irregular sleep schedule, and none of the friends who I consider close share the same connection I did with the one that moved away. I feel like if I cut them off I seriously wouldn’t feel any different and that there just people who keep me occupied from being stressed. I hate feeling this way and I wanna start this rebuilding cycle again but I just can’t bring myself to do it anymore :/

That’s all I wanna say, I had a lot of things bottled up and it feels pretty nice to let it out right now, especially since I can hide myself behind a screen. 

TL;DR: closest friend moved away now I can’t motivate myself to do anything and my friends now just feel like peers who occupy me from stress.",11Dec2018,1
270,"Hello boys and gals,

Been working seven years in kitchens now, worked fine dining for the past fojr and got into some very nice places. So I feel like I'm ready and capable of a step up.

 So I applied for a few Michelin kitchens, in lower positions and with advertising my CV online I also got a couple offers from some fantastic places too. One is actually a spot on what I was looking for, so I accepted the interview and upon chatting I find out it's for their other kitchen (they have 8 within the club),which is pretty much a big step down from my current job and I'd be a host/chef 70/30 split. Which just I can't see myself doing. 

So the interview finished 10 minutes later as we discussed the job as I didn't want to seem rude, the jobs a no go for me.

Should I let them know I'm declining the job and try and haggle another postion/ should I just ask them what the deal is? Just seems strange for me to apply for a certain position in a certain kitchen and for them to offer (albiet a  well paid offer) a different postion in a different style kitchen.


Tl;Dr offered an interview for a certain position and kitchen, offered different an entirely different position in a different kitchen.

271,"Here's the lowdown. Me and my ex boyfriend have very little in common. We've tried dating (long-distance, only seeing each other in person like a total of 3 or 4 times during the 2 times we dated). It didn't work. I wanted him to be very romantic and talkative-he's not.  Our messaging conversations would go in circles and it would piss me off because I wanted to be like a normal couple and we weren't so I'd take it out on him. Anyways, we broke up for the second time about a year or so ago, I think. It was right after a con we went to in December 2017 where we hung out, went to dinner, it was awkward and I went back to the hotel and cried. 

After our second break up, we didn't talk much at all. Very casual conversation at the most. I tried to keep my distance because I know we would totally go for a third try. 

Anyways, tonight he messaged me and somehow he managed to break through my metaphorical wall. I'm really tired and needed to talk to stay awake, and he asked me a specific question about myself, one of my weaknesses. The topic shifted to our past two relationships and I said something like 

""yeah maybe if you moved closer we could try again, I'm not sure what I want in a relationship, we could just be roommates who mess around and stuff"" and he was like ""yeah maybe, that'd be fun"".

I don't want to go through this again though! I can't believe I said that! Why can't I just say ""I don't want to interact with you unless it is VERY platonic, because I don't want to catch feels or whatever again""? 

I don't even know if what I feel for him is love. I'm just a lonely person and the idea of someone wanting to spend time with me...I can't just abandon that. My ideal relationship with him would be.....very casual friends, I guess? I don't know. I'm so mad at myself. I spilled my guts to my friend and she's gonna wake up and think I'm weak. Everyone is gonna think I'm weak because of this on-again, off-again bullshit. Why can't I just say no to him?

274,"So to me,

&amp;#x200B;

I was never sure what I should do in my future, I only knew that I like to play games on PC and I had general interest in PC such as programming etc.

So I figured might aswell study that then, because there is nothing really else where I could tell, yes that´s whats I like to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am 21 studying my first semester informatic, at first all went well, it wasn´t too difficult, even rather easy, but now very sudden it got so difficult that I can´t do any exercise which I need to do by myself and need to somehow find a guy who can give me the programm so I don´t get kicked out of my class.

&amp;#x200B;

It´s to the point where I am not sure anymore about myself if I can actually do it, maybe I am just too stupid?

What if I stop studying in university? I am already 21 without anything to show, how will my future look like?

All that questions come in my mind and it´s giving me heavy pressure and instead of trying to do more I get depressed and get myself into a circle.

&amp;#x200B;

I don´t know where to start learning and I don´t know  whom I could ask for help to  help me improve.

The other students are busy themselves and I am also not very close to someone that I would be comfortable enough to ask him if he has time after uni to help me.

I am afraid of my future and it feels as my future is slipping already out of my hand.

I understand all from the lecture and it makes me feel confident, but every time we get our new exercises which have way more difficult programming exercises than we discussed in lecture throws me every time back to the floor and makes me wonder if I am really just that stupid.

Currently we're speaking constantly and it's starting to tear me apart. I've had this crush on her on and off, and right now it's worse than it's ever been. I try to play it cool while she talks about guys.

I only really ever hear about adult bullying in the workplace, hate crimes by randoms in the street, or abuse from significant others, but this problem doesn’t really fall into any of these. The people who are causing my mum hell are living in the flat above ours (we live in a house converted into two flats).
Right from the very beginning they seemed to take offense at the fact that she was the freeholder (there’s a lot of complicated property dispute mixed up in this whole situation) and it’s obvious to us that it’s motivated by the fact that my mum is an older, South-Asian woman. 
To give some examples: several times they have shouted abuse at us in the shared corridor, sometimes banging through our door (I have some of this on video). Yesterday, the property owner’s sister pushed my mum really hard and hurt her arm. It just seems to keep escalating. 
I want you guys to be aware that we have gone to the police, and we are still in the process of various legal proceedings due to the property-related stuff.
It’s absolutely fucking awful and it’s made our life hell, but what also feels awful is the fact that it doesn’t seem to be getting anywhere. Every time we involve the police they file a report but nothing happens, and the lawyer is quite weak, and every five seconds they stop for mum to throw money at them. The court stuff has been dragging out for I think two years now, and we know it’s still going to be dragging on until March because that’s when the next court date is set.
Oh yeah, did I mention, at one point they actually went to a newspaper with an extremely one-sided part of the story, and we had to temporarily move out, and my mum had to take a month off work because the newspaper published my mums full name, and a picture of the front of our house, and my mum’s work email became flooded with hate-mail from some TRULY RACIST shit heads, with comments such as ‘horse-whip the dirty migrant’? I hope this gives you a flavour of what we’ve been going through.
Anyway, the details of the situation I could honestly write an entire novel on but what I’m asking is if anyone knows of a support group, online or IRL (it’s got to be in the UK, we are in London) that my mum can turn to, of people who are in a similar situation? i.e. people in horrible, extended property disputes, victims of adult bullying, people who have encountered abuse due to their age/race/sex…
The problem we’ve had while looking is that in all the details of these circumstances she falls just under the gap of qualifying for a lot of official support groups? She’s not being abused by a partner, people are committing hate crimes but they aren’t explicitly shouting slurs at us (it’s the kind of aggression that only another person of colour could really identify, but anyone else would just dismiss). Which is why I’m turning to reddit for help.
PS: I’m really not here to debate whether or not you agree this is a hate crime. I’m here to advice for support groups. Believe me when I say this is a tiny fraction of what we’ve been going through and I’m not looking for judgement on the internet.

TL;DR: Help! Need support group for my mum who is an older, Asian women being subject to harassment, adult bullying, hate crimes etc, during a property dispute.

The site’s FAQs say your shipment is on it’s way generally within 48 hours of payment received and I am pretty sure I saw “4 days” in the text while I was filling out the order form regarding shipping but I didn’t screen shot so I cannot be sure.

About 2 weeks go by and I log in with my order number and my order is still showing as processing.  My credit card had already been charged the day I made the order.  So I email the site asking when I can expect my order.  The reply just mentioned they are super busy and it will ship in a few days.  That was Thursday last week.

285,"Okay, this is a really hard one for me, so I'd appreciate any kind of help A LOT...just to clear my mind or to understand what's going on.

 I am in my early 20s and I haven't had lots of relationships, in fact only 2. Why? Because I was scared to trust people, I just wanted to go with it slowly and wait for the right girl before engaging anything serious. This is why many girls turned away from me. However that was not a problem for me, I knew the girl I wanted would have understood me. 

One month ago I met this girl in a random lecture both of us aren't registered to. Pretty random, huh? Hell yeah. But she was just perfect for me. I can not say that I fell in love with her right away but I definitely knew she might be the one. So we start to chat, I get her number, we meet up a lot, I even invite her to parties I am attending, which is a pretty rare thing, in fact a first time for me; the first time I have ever brought a girl I was dating to a party or whatever. So everybody knew; oh shoot, he thinks he has finally found the one.

Well, I don't want to spam you with the whole story so I am just going to mention the important stuff (which might end up long too, I am sorry): we held hands, we kissed, made out, hung up a lot together, spend A LOT of time together. It is very important to mention here, that she initiated everything: she made the obvious signal that I should hold her hand. She made the obvious signal that I should kiss her. She made the obvious signal that I should stay for the night at her place. 

However after one certain meet up I knew something was up...she behaved slightly differently.  Yesterday she opened up: She said that she wasn't able to do it, because she doesn't think that she is ready to have a boyfriend in her life because she had broke up with her boyfriend earlier this year (2 year long relationship). She says that she needs to spend time working on herself. She wants to do things that make her happy since she had been neglecting these desires for the past 2 years. Now I totally understand that. She also told me that she absolutely wanted to like me. She asked friends (even my friends) if she should just go for it. She decided against it because it didn't feel right. ""If we were meant to be together, we would have already been.""

Her main ""argument"" is that she doesn't feel emotionally stable enough to have a boyfriend again. She even told me that she was pretty sure our first proper meet up would just be on a friendly basis since she already knew back then, that she wasn't ready for a relationship. But she liked me, so she tried and tried. 

She told me that I don't deserve someone who plays with my feelings. That I don't deserve someone who isn't ready to ""feel love"" again. She said that she would love to stay in touch with me, however only as friends. She also mentioned that as of right now, she can't even imagine to pursue something like a relationship. 

Now...I am devastated, I am really really sad. For the past weeks I was the happiest guy on this planet. I have had a pretty shitty year at university because of certain exams and somehow everything was worth it because I got to meet her. I totally understand her, I totally do. Before you can be happy with somebody else, you have to be happy with yourself. And I would love to stay as friends for the moment and just see how things evolve. Maybe we remain friends, maybe we end up in a relationship in a couple of months, maybe in a year. However the way she said those things, it somehow feels like she has totally given up the hope that things between us could work out in the future. It feels like she only wants to remain friends and doesn't think we could be more than that. 

This may sound pretty stupid to some of you but I only want her. I enjoyed, I loved every second we spend with each other. I can't imagine that I am going to be this happy ever again with somebody else. I just felt right. The thought that I could just ""forget"" her and just date another girl disgusts me. I really want to keep meeting up with her and just hope for the best, even if it would take months for her to overcome her mental obstacles. However there is this fear inside of me: what if it doesn't work out? It just cripples me.

287,"Backstory: 
Ever since I was 9 years old, all I wanted was financial freedom which would allow me to just be able to dive head first learn anything I wanted. If I need tutors I can hire them. If I need books i could buy them. I loved to learn and apply what I learned. Esicaplly, since I grew up relatively poor and my dad not willing to buy/spend any money on me or my older brother(let’s call him S). Whereas my oldest brother, A, was the prized jewel of the family and my dad gave him everything.. I think the last time he bought me something was 5th grade. Ever since then, I always saved my money and never told anyone how much I had. To put into perspective, I had around $13k saved up in 8th grade. I flipped electronics via craigslist; mostly gaming consoles. Also, I began importing fake beats and fake expensive brands and sold them in school as fakes. People didn’t care since they were the highest quality fakes, therefore no one could really tell their fakes when they wore the clothes. 
Later on that year, S left high school years to go to CC against my dad wishes and my dad turned his back on him. Me being his brother he asked if he could borrow some money from me. I gave it to him since he’s my brother and I wanted a better relationship with my bro. He needed it more than I did. 

Then in 10th grade (2014), the family found that when A was not in uni. Even though for the past 3 years, he was telling us that he was and showing my dad fake transcripts and having my parents drove 100+ miles to his dorm every weekend just to bring him food. Once A told my family about his uni situation, he went crazy, became a horrible person, and got a huge amount of credit card debt. Let’s just say looking back on how he is, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried selling our mother or something. This destroyed my dad. He has never been the same and took his hatred for my brother out on the rest of the family. Later on that year, A calmed down and began acting somewhat normal. My dad paid off all of A’s credit card debt. 

During this time(2014-2016), S and I grew a small e-commerce business to 0-300k+ in gross monthly revenue and pretty health net margins of around 43%. We reinvested every dollar. At the time I wasn’t 18, therefore S was on all the legal paperwork. In the business, I was obsessed; it was like playing my favorite MMORPG all over again. There would be days where I wouldn’t sleep just so I could work because I loved it so much it didn't feel like work. When classmates were studying for AP exams. I was closing $10K+ worth of orders weekly from suppliers in China. (which is pretty cool in hindsight, never thought anything of it at the moment) Some of these suppliers became really good friends of mine. After high school(2017), I even went to one of their weddings, it was insane (they spent $1mil on the wedding) and was my first time in China. I met so many of the suppliers I had been talking to for years. They all thought I was in my 30s. I have deep voice lol. I put the business in front of school went from having a GPA of 4.83 to 3.6. At the time, my dad made some bad investments, lost all his savings, and lost his job for a year and a half. Therefore, the business was keeping the family afloat.  We had expenses of 6k a month. Therefore, the salary we pulled out of the company was pretty much covering 100% of the families expenses. 

After high school, I was supposed to go UCLA for bioengineering but withdrew since I didn't really want to do it and did mostly for my Dad to show him we are not like my A. I wanted to work on the business but S didn’t want me to and wanted me to go to college. So when the time came to have my name on the company legal documents, he didn’t allow it. He forced me to sell my equity for 57k( he would pay after 6 years) and leave the business or I would get nothing and still be forced out. The betrayal really hurt. I hate leaving things unfinished there was much more to do and we could’ve sold for at least 3mil. Earlier this year the business fell apart due to mismanagement and S is in 25k in debt. He still tries to be my brother and get me to help him since we still live in our parents house. 

At the time(2015) I had learned about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, I bought 8 BTC  at around $300 ish and 2k ether for around .7ish cents each since it was cheap. I told A about crypto and him being a tech nerd; he fell in love instantly and wanted to be a part of it. He wanted to learn to trade cryptos and he didn’t have any money forthem. So he asked if he could use my wallet to trade. I thought he was back to being my oldest bro again. So I said why not you manage my crypto wallet and especially it meant getting my brother back. I would have never guessed in 10 trillion years how big cryptos were gonna get. I never really thought about the wallet again and A would give me quarterly updates on it.  Then last November/December(2017) when cryptos had a huge bull run. When BTC hit 13k and ether hit 1k.  I told A it’s time to sell everything since that would a life-changing amount of money. He said know let’s wait its gonna go higher and he told me he had been managing it great so far so why was I not listening to his advice. Me being a bit naive and greedy; I agreed. When ether hit 1400,  I told him now its time to sell no matter what. I came to find out he had lost all the ether in some scam a couple months before the bull run and sold the BTC without telling me. Then went AWOL and blew $100k+ and got two misdemeanors and felony and racked $40k in credit card debt. At the time, I wasn’t bummed out too much about the money. (was like winning the lottery; can’t really replicate it) I was 10x more pissed off that he went crazy again. And blamed myself for being blind and naive.

I think I’ve been severely depressed for the last year and a half. I don’t like to do doing anything (even though I want to), I don’t wanna talk to anyone, I have no energy, and I’ve been sleeping way too much. Today I’m 20 years old, I'm in a worse position from when I was 13. I have 2k left. The mental pain of knowing that everything I had to go through ended up being for nothing and if I had not let it slip through my hands, my life would be so much better kills me everyday.

Trying to look at the bright side. Currently, I’ve been enrolled in a community college for 3 semesters and have half-assing my way to A’s. I’m majoring in computer science and I’ll be  transferring next year to some UC, most likely. When I started the business (2015) I had $20 prepaid flip phone from Walmart and all my classmates had smartphones (super embarrassing at the time) and used a old Fujitsu laptop I got from a garage sale for $25 and no car. Now I had an iPhone X and a $2k MacBook Pro and a great and efficient car, Prius.  Downgraded the iPhone to iPhone 7 and laptop to a great cheaper windows machine since I got a great offer flip those for a couple 100 bucks more. I’ll use the extra money to grow capital.Curretly am looking for a part-time job to further grow capital. Let me know if you have any ideas :)

How do I not let what happening/happened to my family affect me? How can I just focus and forget about the past or not let past experiences/hardships hover in the back of my head all the time? 

Thank you so much for reading!

288,"So this guy is an asshole, he was a dick to my best friend and they finally broke up last week. Now this guy also happens to be one of my best friends too because we work together all the time. He is like my brother, we've been told we look and act like siblings. So before they broke up he was planning on taking her with him to see the wizard of oz on broadway. He asked me if I wanted to go with him and I said maybe. He said he needed an answer soon because he'd have to figure out what to do with the ticket. I said yes. Now this seems very date like. I should mention that I would never date him. It would be like dating my brother, it's just weird. I also have a girlfriend. I also really want to see this show, I really love theatre and I've only seen one other show on broadway. Now if I go with him will this be weird or am I over thinking it because he was originally going to take his girlfriend? ",11Dec2018,1
289,"First and foremost, I have to explain that I’ve been living with my foster parents for the last 7+ years of my life. I won’t go into details about my case and background. That being said, living and growing up in their house was unpleasant  and traumatizing. The relationship between me and them has always been strained. I never came to look at them as parents, and still call them by their first names, never “mom” or “dad”. For years they made me believe I was just as useless and annoying as they said I was. That I was ungrateful and deserved to be treated less than their own children. I don’t think I’ve really fully explained to what extent these people put me through, and I can’t find the right words to explain it right now as I’m typing this. But just know that they made me question if being alive was even worth anything anymore. By the time I realized we’d never get along, it had already been a few years, and I was old enough to realize (thanks to my social worker and the internet) I was lucky in that I wasn’t constantly getting moved around like so many foster youth are. I was extremely lucky. I couldn’t emotionally handle having to start all over again in a new environment, in a new house, new school, and different foster parents. So I stayed and never complained about the constant fighting and arguing to my social worker. They collect their check every month, and I live in my room. It’s the agreement never spoken between us that that was the way it will always be. 

I rambled on about the details, but what I really want to ask advice on, is what to do about my graduation and life after high school. I don’t want these people at my graduation, and I never want to have any form of contact between us when I go to college in the fall. If I tell them I don’t want them at my graduation, they’ll look at it as a way of me dismissing them giving me a place to live. I am fully aware that these people gave me a life in a stable community, they had spared me the trauma of being up-rooted and moved from foster home to foster home. I’m grateful, I really am, but these people made me contemplate killing my self for years. They’ll think I’m ungrateful, but I really need the memory of graduating and accepting my diploma to me mine. I need that day to be something I remember fondly. And them being their would ruin that memory for me. It’s true that they’ve had an impact in my life and me in theirs, but trust me when I say this, they’d only be going to keep up appearances. They’d only be going to make sure that when I’m reporting to my social worker, I say they went. They didn’t want to adopt me after all these years of fostering me, they feel like they’ve done a good deed in letting me live with them all this time. But my high school graduation is my achievement. I did that on my own. Don’t I deserve to have that day to myself? 

I didn’t explain every detail about my life and my relationship with them, but I hope I got the point across and my question is understandable. I just really don’t want to have an argument with them over this. I’m honestly contemplating not even going to my graduation ceremony to avoid any complications with them at all...
But this is important to me, I don’t want to sacrifice this just because I’m afraid of their reactions if I tell them I don’t want them there...

(I won’t be 18 until after graduation, so I can’t cut them off before graduation. And it’s too late to explain my entire trauma with my social worker, what’s the point when I’m already 17 and have one more year in foster care left. I don’t want to spend my last year in foster care having to go to counseling and therapy sessions with them to “fix” our issues, or even worse, being sent to another foster home.)",11Dec2018,1
290,"About 4 months ago, I [F16] was sexually assaulted at a party of a then boyfriend of mine [M16]. I thought I loved him but he just took advantage of me. After the event, which took place in the summer, I spent the rest of the summer in a deep state of depression, worse than it’s ever been before. He goes to school across town so I don’t have to see him there, but I’ve had to adjust my life so I don’t run into him at any supermarkets/shopping centers/etc. I still have nightmares about him coming into my house and killing/raping me. I’ve blocked him on everything and broke up with him shortly after the event. But my main problem is this: the smallest and most random things will “trigger” a memory or idea of him. Example: I’ll be passing a sushi restaurant while I’m driving and my mind will instantly connect that he likes sushi and wanted to take me out for dinner at a sushi place. These random “triggers” or “flashbacks” have been ruining my life. If they happen, for example, in the beginning of the day, I can’t continue the rest of my day. I just get into this deep state of depression and can’t function. I just don’t know what to do about this anymore. ",11Dec2018,1

I’ve had the same group of friends since I can remember. All the way the through school to sophomore year we’ve been pretty close. You see I live fairly close to the campus, and during off-periods and lunch breaks, we would usually chill at my place. However recently things have been different. Nobody seems to respect the home, things have been broken and stolen, and nobody owns up to it. If I ever make a big deal about it nobody really believes that it really matters what happens. For instance, if I complain about blank being damaged, they say “it was just a blank anyway, who cares?” I’m tired of constantly getting in trouble with my parents over stuff that isn’t my fault because I can’t control what happens when I have people over at the house. So I try to put my foot down and say we’re not going to head to my house today. Nobody cares, people still go, lie that nothing will happen again, spoiler alert: it happens again, and the cycle continues. If I refuse to let them in the overpower me to take my keys from me to let themselves in. I can’t do anything. Sometimes I just hang out by myself at lunch so I won’t have to deal with them but I don’t like being lonely and I’m afraid when I return to school I won’t have my friends anymore. They will not want to hang out with me, I only get used for access to my house outside off school

307,"Everyone says life is short.

I'm 19 years old and in college and I feel like a lot has happened in those 19 years, and another 19 years seems like a pretty long time. A lot of things are going to happen in the next 19 years that will double my life span and even then I will be less than half my dying age.

How long is life really? What do people mean by saying life is short? How much time do I really have? I live a very healthy lifestyle and predict I will live to be at least 90. That means I have about 70 years left of my life to live. Why does so much have to happen within the first 20 years? School, growth, maturity, development, and then you hit 22-23 and then its career and family stuff for 40 years until 65ish, and then retire that will give me about 25 years of retirement before dying. Considering I'm only 19 and seem to have been pretty busy up until now, 25 years of retirement sounds like a very long time in itself, with 40 years of career and development on top of that, and 2.5-3 more years of college I have left to do. The rest of my college seems like a pretty long time but is it really? This first semester FLEW! How is life short? Why is life short? Why do people say life is short? When you are 30,40,50,60,70,80,90 does life feel shorter because all that time is already gone? Is life really short or do the previous years lived just feel like they flew by because they are gone? What am I supposed to do? 

I'm getting stressed just thinking about all of this. Thinking that I only have 70 years left of my life is making me tear up as I'm writing this. Which doesn't even make any sense because I already said life doesn't seem that short. However 70 years seems like not enough time as well, but to do what? When I'm 90 years old and dying what am I going to think about life then? What will I think about my life? What am I going to regret? What am I going to wish I had done? Am I going to think life was short then? Or will I think it was long enough? Will I be proud of the life I lived? Will I wish I'd have played less video games or be glad I spent time doing something I enjoyed? Will I be proud of the man I became? Will I ever be satisfied with my achievements or will my desire never end? What are the most important things in life? What is important right now? Why am I afraid to talk to my crush? What do I have to lose? In 70-80 years I'll be dead anyway. What is stopping me from putting myself out there more? Why do I have social anxiety when I'm going to die eventually? Why do I even care what anyone could possibly think of me when we are all going to die? I'm in winter break right now with too much time on my hands. What am I supposed to do? When I'm dying what am I going to wish I had done during this winter break? What will I think about in the moments leading up to my death? Does any of this stuff even matter anyway? Everything I do in life is going to end. Does my life actually matter considering that it ends? What is the point of it all anyway? Everything I create for myself ends. The man I create ends. I guess the only things that matter in life are the babies that I make? Because when I die, they stick around. What kind of parent am I going to be?

People say having kids is stressful. Why is creating the only thing in life that matters and will stay on this planet after you die, stressful. Why do so many parents get bothered annoyed and frustrated by their children when their children are the only things that truly matter in their life. Children are the only things that stay when we die. I'm excited for when I meet my kids. I'm excited to meet my wife. I'm excited to meet my grand kids.

I have worked there for over 6 yrs and never had my bonus reduced. This year, and under a brand new Commander of the Hospital, the mid-level providers took a 5% bonus paycut. Now to some, that may not sound like a lot, but it comes out to roughly almost $200 per paycheck every two weeks. 

This has hit me hard. Not just as a financial burden, but like a knife in my heart. It feels like a big punch in the gut of devaluation, avoidance of respect, and a personal injury to my children. 
I have 4 beautiful children 3 girls and a boy, (23,20,16,11) Two of my girls are in college, both graduate this Spring, one with her Masters and the other her Bachelors. I have raised my girls almost as a single mom. I got through my undergrad and my medical school as a single mom.. minus some help feom my husband,(who at this time is a whole other story in itself).

I am festering in no acceptance of this paycut. And I’m not the only one...
My question in all of this....I really feel compelled to write a personal letter to the Commander of my hospital expressing how distraught and dumbfounded I am of this cut. I feel like I need to be momma bear and completely wipe this in her face on a personal level! She is taking from my well being, my livelihood, and from the mouths of my children.
I have some of the highest positive feedback numbers in the hospital ! I bring in more than the average billing money for the hospital too! Im mot the only one that was cut, but dang it none of us deserved it. We all work in fast paced and demanding positions, we take a lot of abuse by patients of the system. We work overtime with no pay just to get all our work done that they throw at us in an 8hr work day. 
We rarely even see the supervisory staff face to face...

I have taken this very personal as no other Commander has ever lowered us before. I’m a current furotious Momma Bear out for justice... I want to send this Commander a personal Christmas card with a nice little note in it thanking her (condescendingly) for taking food feom the mouths of babes, but more literally obviously,... taking from my livelihood that supports my family and pays my bills and own student loans..  **most likely to make herself look good on her OER ( a biannual assessment of officers) ** at the expense of her “work horses” her staff! 

To caveat, we already take home less than professionals in our field on the outside. Granted we get a pension in the end (if we make it)... but we do it mainly because we have a yearning for civil service and serving our country. 

I guess by only being able to give short examples and not a lot of history, I may be coming across as a whiney baby... but for anyone who can respect the fact and understanding of what it takes to be in civil service I know you will get me...

I am on the verge of failing the year and not being able to graduate on time. I have no problem learning the material, but I have a lot of trouble completing classwork and homework. I've had a very, *very* bad history with this for the past nine years of my life, including bitter hatred towards the American education system and what is (debatably) emotional abuse from a parent and I'd rather not elaborate on it if I don't need to.

Things I've tried:

\-Medication (Several different types of ""focus"" medicines that I've been prescribed before, at different times, since age 11, as well as one antidepressant). It felt horrible and I couldn't bring myself to keep taking it after long enough.

\-Talking to my parents. Unfortunately, they don't understand very well, and often are little to no help. There's also the bad relations with the one parent.

\-Talking to a counselor. I saw a therapist/counselor back when I was 11 or 12. I never could explain to her what was going on, and the sessions were more focused on dealing with social issues that I had at the time than schoolwork (I was being bullied).

\-Just toughening up and doing the work. I feel scared to even look at my grades and I get a panic attack upon just viewing the contents of my backpack, which are severely disorganized. Either that, or I feel so much rage and hatred that I need to scream and destroy my surroundings but can't because I live with other people in a house that I don't own.

319,"Hi, I'll try to make this short,

We got our dog about six months ago from a breeder near us. He was returned by the original owner for ""various reason"" I won't get into. Anyway, we fell in love, got him, and everything is great now. There were a few bumps in the road, ex: when we first got him, the breeder said that, at the owner's request, we keep the name for him. His name is kind of dumb, but I couldn't go against my husband and the breeder AND everyone telling me ""I should, I should."", so I caved and said ""Fine, whatever."" The thing is, I could never shake the feeling that I've done wrong here, and now since I've bottled up my feelings, I feel me taking it out on my husband, asking why the hell we can't change it? It doesn't help that, the longer we've had him, the more problems I discovered that came as a result from lack of caring from the previous owner. I had originally thought her intentions were pure, but since bringing him to the vet, getting him fixed and ALL up to date on his shots (he was missing quite a few), training him and working with him, I began to resent the previous owner and the fact that we had to keep his dumb name at her request.


Anyway, I guess I need advice on how to let go of this dumb anger that keeps resurfacing for some reason. I know it's not fair to anyone, but at the same time, I can't help but feel I got shafted by them at the same time.. ",11Dec2018,1
320,"Hi. 

So, I’m in a bit of an odd situation (at least for me). 

Both are for the same job title / responsibilities, just with different companies. Both would be about the same pay (all considered). These are both Canadian jobs. 

Job 1: 1 year contract, offer extended. Hourly rate, which means I would forgo health benefits, vacation and paid leave of any kind. With that in mind, the hourly rate is a decent rate. 

Job 2: full time, permanent. Offer deferred due to budgetary restraints. Basically, I was told verbatim: “once we update our budget, we can extend an offer”. The timeline they gave me was end of January 2019 to have the budget updated. 

In general I’m more interested in Job 2. It has a more interesting team, work and being salaried is preferred (for me) over hourly/contract. 

I’m also currently working full time, salaried with benefits, but for less than what these two positions offer. 

I’m just seeking some input/advice on what any of you fine people would do. My primary concern is that I reject the contract and, for whatever reason, the FT job falls through. 

Thoughts?

321,"Hi, I am looking for advice that anyone may have for staying single, and/or not letting relationships get way too serious, way too fast.

I come from a totally broken, dysfunctional family- specifically a god awful parental marriage/divorce- and consequently, both my parents had left before I was a teenager. After that I became stubbornly independent, pretty much living as a full adult while still in high school. But I was doing everything right on paper and was very successful as an individual despite the odds. Then my first serious relationship came at 15 years old, and we (15F,18M) basically moved in together after a couple months. I became extremely dependent on him in every emotional way. After being together for a year, I finally recognized that our relationship was moving way too fast for me (like, actual engagement as a 16 year old), so I decided to end our relationship and try to figure out who the f I was without it.

Well, being single didn’t last long. After a few months of trying to be single, I found myself in yet another extremely serious relationship. I was 17, basically moved in with my partner (17M), and once again had engagement plans.

At 18, I went to university and immediately panicked when I realized AGAIN that my relationship was far more than I was ready to commit to. So I ended it and, again, tried to figure out how to live without a partner.

I’m sure you can guess how this story continues.

It happened again.
Then again.

And now I am 22 years old, I have been in 5 serious relationships that all have lasted about 1 year each, and I have no idea how to stop getting into such serious relationships. Also, all of my relationships have been with incredible individuals who I have had amazing experiences with. The relationships have all been nothing but positive and fulfilling, but after about a year I begin to fear any kind of long term commitment even though the relationship is great and I am fully invested up to that point. I just all of a sudden stop being capable of staying present in the relationship, and become intensely fearful of continuing it that way. 

The relationships always end either because I have severe panic attacks or because I fall into a deep depression. I have hurt so many people’s hearts, and I struggle to not hate myself for that. I have also hurt my own heart over and over, and having this continual pattern in my life causes me to feel unworthy of any relationship, incapable of staying happy or stable, and scared both of being alone and of being committed.

Believe me, I go to therapy and a psychiatrist- so I know I have depression, anxiety, and clinical mommy &amp; daddy issues- but nothing helpful has ever been suggested for me to not fall into this over and over again. I really want to be single, for a while, but I don’t know how to not develop crushes on people and my desire to get to know another person in such an intimate way keeps getting me into more serious relationships (well that, and my deep rooted fears of being alone, probably).

I fall in love with people way too easily, and for some reason both me and my partner end up falling for each other super hard. For a while I stay super genuinely happy and love it so much. I keep believing myself when I think “this time I will be different, there’s no way I could ruin this one!”. But of course I do.

I just ended my most recent serious relationship because I was getting severely depressed about not being able to stay present in my relationship any longer. I just started thinking about how once again it felt like my life didn’t belong to only me and that I had basically spent the last 7 years in relationships. There was nothing wrong with the relationship, I just was feeling suffocated or something. Every great thing in my adult life so far (graduations, traveling the world, etc.) has happened while I’ve been in a relationship, and I resent that for some reason. 

I normally stay single for just a brief period before another person stumbles into my world that I fall in love with and subsequently date. I am not the type who is lining the next relationship up before the current one is ended, but immediately upon the other relationship ending I accidentally end up getting involved with others.

So my loaded, probably unanswerable, questions are: 
1. How can I stop myself from falling for people?
2. How do I handle falling for someone when I am not hoping to get into another relationship?
3. What are things I can do to make my time outside of a relationship as fulfilling and beautiful as being in a relationship?
4. What are your favorite parts about being single?
5. And how, if I do find myself in another relationship, can I not be as dependent?... and how can I handle my fear of longer term commitment?

Thank you for reading this NOVEL if you did.

TL;DR: I keep getting into really serious year long relationships and they always end because I suddenly feel fearful of committing any longer. I don’t know how to stop this pattern pls help!

He is mostly happy and relaxed, in company with my mother. He cannot walk much since he is somewhat weak, and he can barely speak since his throat is affected. He enjoys watching some TV and listening to classical music, which he often does. He used to like hiking and hunting, but he cannot do any of those now. He used to read a lot, but he is not reading at the moment, probably because his sight not being too good anymore and also feeling a bit weak and tired.

I read previous recommendations and about a year ago I recorded a few videos of my parents speaking. That will be something nice to keep (especially once I get to edit them, since they need some cropping and stabilisation, which I want to do as good as possible).

336,"Hello everyone!

I am sixteen years old and around a year away from finishing my A-Levels, but at the moment I have absolutely no motivation for school at all. I am sure that everyone has phases like this occasionally, but I personally don't know what to do, since for me, this lack of motivation does not seem to improve. 

Let me explain the situation: First of all, I always have been receiving very good marks in almost every subject and would describe myself as someone who usually gets an A for most of their work. I don't have any trouble during classes and find most of the things we learn very easy and self-explanatory, and even when I was missing for several weeks a while ago due to illness, I never felt overwhelmed by the work and could still very easily follow everything that was being said once I was back, despite having missed multiple lessons in a row. 

The fact that I'm usually bored during classes and only participate to keep up my good marks really makes me feel like attending is unnecessary, and that sitting in a classroom just to be bored while I could use the time I spend at school for something I actually enjoy, left me feeling utterly demotivated. At the moment, going to school just feels like wasting time, as ridiculous as it sounds.

I know that I can easily maintain my marks even if I stayed at home and the things I actually do have to learn are so easy to me that I can understand them without the help of a teacher. Of course I'm aware that school not only is a place to learn but also to engage in social activities, but this just does not help me with my current lack of motivation. I also tried to talk about the situation with my parents and explained my feelings to them, but they don't seem to know any solution for my lack of motivation either. 

Please don't understand this post as a form of bragging, as this is in no way my intention. Thank you for understanding, as well as your advice.",11Dec2018,1

He's now probably in his room, two floors away from me. I don't understand what's happening. I'm not looking for answers, I just wanna talk about it.

When I first came to this student dormitory, I knew no one. I made friends with my roommates, some cute and friendly girls, but I felt fake around them. We have totally different views about absolutely everything.

I was staying in a room on the 2nd floor. There was this guy I saw often hanging around. The first time we met on the stairway he greated me like we knew each other. He was so friendly. We had some many things in common, including the short blonde reddish curly hair. Everyone compares us. 

After a while we became friends. He was living on the 4th floor. Sometimes I'd sneak out of my room in the middle of the night to go to his room and smoke together. There is no romantic interest (I'm not even into boys and he has a girlfriend). It's friendship.

I know that he ran away from home because of his father. He hasn't talked to him since June and has been rejecting his calls. 

Today I arrived in the dormitory. My roommates, who believes my friend and I share a secret romantic adventure or some shit and we don't want anyone else know about it, told me that his father came here today and brought his son food. And today he disappeared from Instagram and Messenger (he is a photographer and has a IG account where he posts his amazing work). I don't even know what's going on anymore.

340,"Well, for you to understand my problem, we need a little bit of context.

In my country, we have 2 types of Universities. Private and Traditional Universities. Private ones are as the name implies, they are private corporations that follow the ministry of education regulation in order to make education a business. Usually, their tuitions are cheap but their programs lack the accreditation necessary to be part of the government financial aid. They have their own financial aid but this is mainly based on loans. The requirements for enrolling in one of these programs are far lower than the traditional one.

On the other hand, Traditional universities are trying to mimic the university feel of the American universities. The tuition is more expensive than the private one, but they can be part of the government financial aid. The requirements for enrolling are far superior to the average private university, this is why they boast about being the best. Traditional universities are public entities that must follow every regulation set by the Ministry of education and they are tied to every political change in the country. Prone to strike too.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok. Now my story. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 27 I enrolled in a new program from a Traditional university. Prior to my enrollment I went to two private universities and had to abandon both due to financial problems (I did not have the money to pay the tuition). My previous programs were related to programming and IT, this new program was Pedagogy.

To be honest, this was my last chance, I was getting older and I wanted a real job. I'm not a social person, in fact, I am an introvert, but up to this point, I managed to have a successful (yet tiring) social life. I mentioned before that this was a ""New"" program, I tough that it was going to be like every other pedagogy program out there, oh boy that I was wrong. 

This new program was created by a Canadian lady, and in its core, it was a social program. Every single assignment was a group project, every single class, was a peer work activity. Introvert hell. I took it as a personal challenge and I stick with it. Alongside the road, I meet some amazing people that are my closest friends now.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem started at the end of the fourth year of the program. The program has several early practicums, unlike the rest of the program where is just one final practicum (paid one). During my first practicum, the teacher who was paired with had a huge grudge against the Uni and I was in the middle of it. He did not let me teach and I needed to fill a quota in order to pass. At the end of the semester, I fell short. I was transferred to a special program of the university. I had to teach a bunch of high school student who willingly went to the University to be present in a workshop. The kids were great, but the workload was bigger than I could chew and I failed that practicum. I had to re-do that module. The second time I was paired with a teacher who didn't care about my practicum and it didn't let me teach (again). This time I kept the university informed about it. A few weeks ago I had to make my last class, it was supervised by one of my Uni teachers. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong. Since I had so little interaction with the students, they did not know me nor my approach and I did not have the courage to keep the discipline. My resulting grade was horrible. At that moment I felt like a soldier that returned from war. All the bad experiences from my previous practicum came rushing to my mind in a series of flashbacks. I felt sick, I was dizzy and finally... I fainted. I was diagnosed with tachycardia and high blood pressure. I had to make another class, this time was orientation. Again, the class went poorly. During the class I started to had the same flashbacks, my chest hurt like being stabbed, I managed to finish the class, but the grade was horrible. I went home and slept for an eternity.

The week next to the incident, I had to attend the feedback from my last class. During the reading of the notes, the symptoms were present, plus a choking sensation. I had to ask the teacher to stop, the words were hurting me and I was a nervous mess. I excuse myself and went outside.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not an emotional guy. I rarely cry. I don't believe in stress, especially University stress. I was in a programming program and the academic load was far greater than my current one... but I feel sick now. I cry everytime something bad happens to me. I'm starting to have petty arguments with my Gf that escalate in huge fights. I'm grumpy all the time, and when I'm alone I feel sad. 

I started to love the program, maybe pedagogy is not one of my strengths but I like it. I'm starting to feel that I'm a worthless piece of trash that was overwhelmed by something he was not meant to do. I'm at the edge building, thinking about dropping the program and do something else instead but something deep down tells me to fight. I don't want to feel this miserable anymore. I don't want to think I'm a piece of trash. I want to be happy but I can't. I don't want to be mad at my family, my GF nor my son, but every time something happens I snap at them. I'm not an aggressive guy but I've become a monster in the past few weeks.

What shall I do?

341,"Apologies for the length of this post.

I have 4 older siblings that I used to be very close to growing up but for the past 4/5 years I feel they have left me out and I don't really know what to do about it or if I'm being over-dramatic. Either way it hurts my feelings and that's why I'm asking for some advice. 

They all go on holiday together once a year. I have never been invited to go along. They book it in advance so when I find out when they are going it's too late for me to join them even if I was asked too. 

There is also incidences of them getting together at each other's houses and me not being invited. 

They also have a Brother &amp; Sister group chat on whatsapp that I am not involved in.....

My Sister visited a couple of weeks ago &amp; it was really hard to get hold of her or see her.  She stayed at my Brothers house and I managed to see her for all of 15 minutes before I was told they were going to a restaurant for dinner that had already been booked so I couldn't go along (apparently). 

It's my Brother's birthday next week. I was told by my Mom that my siblings were getting together for it. It was the first I had heard of it. So I thought fuck it, I'm going to invite myself along. Text my Brother asking dates &amp; times etc etc. Only to be completely ignored. 

Most of the times when they've booked things in advance I'm normally met with you can come next time! I really am starting to feel that they maybe don't like me. I am the youngest at 26, they are 28, 29, 32 &amp; 37.  I've been wondering if there's something wrong with me or something I do that irritates them &amp; maybe that's why they don't invite me. I'm far from perfect but I'm a pretty normal person &amp; not overbearing. I've never had someone tell me I act a certain way that's off putting or irritating.

I don't really make my feelings known about it all &amp; if I'm ever in contact with them and they say they did this or that or they're doing this I normally just wish them a good time &amp; say I hope you all enjoy yourselves etc etc or I'll say 'invite me next time!' to which they never do..... 

When I am with them all on the odd occasion or at family gatherings they all act how they've always acted with me, laughing, joking etc etc but I just feel kind of alone when I'm there &amp; if I wasn't there then it wouldn't really matter. I normally leave family gatherings feeling a bit deflated/sad if I'm honest. 

I have spoken to my Mum about it and she has told me on numerous occasions that they all love me to bits &amp; they would hate to think that I feel excluded but obviously not as they exclude me ALL the time.

If I do confront them I feel like they will start inviting me out of pity and not for really wanting me there &amp; that wont make me feel good either. So do I confront them? or do I just let it go and distance myself from them? If someone could give me some advice on how to handle this I'd be very grateful! 

Thanks!

345,"Over the years I found that if I use enough Cannabis I am able to nullify any dreams. However there has been some relatively drastic changes lately with a new job and dating someone new and amazing. Thanks to these changes(leaving a job I hated and being in a terrible relationship, then single for a while) my daily depression and anxiety levels have gone way down. During the day I feel good, happy and confident. Unfortunately every night for the last 2 weeks, I have had worse and worse dreams whenever I sleep. They’re extremely vivid and violent, they replay the things I’ve seen, and they create new terrifying experiences. Tonight was the worst so far, I woke up sweating, my whole body was shaking violently. I eventually got up and went to the bathroom to throw up. Now I’m here an hour or so later I am afraid to go back to sleep. I have smoked marijuana for several years, I found it treated my depression and night terrors and it made me feel happy. However using less Cannabis to medicate, I was starting to be even happier on my own. I like being completely sober for once. I’m not sure what to do.",11Dec2018,1
347,"So  currently i am studying Biotechnology in Germany (i also am from germany btw) at college. I currently still am a freshman. In the last weeks i got more and more frustrated with my course of study, espescially chemistry, which i loved in highschool (to be precise Fachhochschule in germany), but now it has kinda losed it's apeal to me. And Biology, which i also loved, is now just okay and not very exciting. But IT is the thing that excites the most currently in my course of study. And i know it is freshman year and it is supposed to be hard, but the problem is not that it's hard (which it really is), but that i can't see myself anymore in those topics. 

I know am considering to maybe change my course of study, to Electrotechnology/Informationtechnology (it's a sort fo combi course at the same college). But i am afraid of making a bad devision and choosing something, that will come out as even worse. I am not a big fan of maths, but i always have been fascinated by technology. (I work on a small raspberry pi project in my free time). And i think that i can work my ass off to understand the math part of all of this. 

I am planning on talking wih my parents about this, when i see them around christmas. They live in another country, so i couldn't really talk with them personally beforehand. I have very supportive parents, so they will probablly support me. Still i am kinda afraid and don't know how to talk with them about it.

I also don't know, what i should do in general about this, i don't want to be failure. I don't want to have given up to easily. Yet, i feel uncomfortable with my course of study, i don't want to pull through it just to be in a job that i won't like in the end. I will also need to do a work placement for eight weeks, so i kinda have set it as my last straw for this, because if i don't like the sort of job, that i would be doing after graduating, why should i continue studying. What would you advice me to do?

All in all it's just so frustrating currently and i am really afraid of ruining my future. All of this has also been though on my mental state ( i am not depressed, but my mood has just been not that good for most of the time since i've started studying)

348,"Hello everyone,

I'm just a young University Graduate. Just starting off my career in tech. I'm dark skinned (Indian descent)

I have been working in corporate for almost 1 year. 

But, i have been dealing with bullies. They are the older generation that are about to retire. They do not like me because they feel threaten by my young age and cheaper income. 

One of these bullies is this Old Lady in her 60s. She's Jewish. And is so racist towards immigrants. I would always have to listen to her negative comments when the news is on. 

One day, she wanted to bully me. I was gone to the bathroom for 10mins. I came back, she started screaming at me . Telling me that I should stay in my workstation. She just wanted to get off by feeling superior. She has no authority.

Her position is just a senior. Our supervisor is our boss. I listen to my supervisor. 

So, as she was screaming, I raised my voice to her saying all I did was go to the bathroom. 

She was quiet to me now. But my black friend at work over heard her say to the other seniors saying that she feels like her life is in danger when I'm there and she will go to HR.

My black friend warned that being dark skin, if a white woman goes to HR or the police, they usually side with white than me being dark skinned. 

So he advice to just stay away from her and be quiet with her until she retires

She plans to get the back up of the other older gentlemens by saying they also feel threatened. Those 2 other guys tried to bully me all I did was raise my voice so they won't bully me. That's what lions do.

Please help me. I don't want to lose my job .

351,"So this is my situation (there is also a TL;DR at the end)

I am about to turn 25 and I currently work online as an English teacher. My pay fluctuates, but I make between $15-20 an hour. I don’t mind this job, but I feel like it offers me no opportunity for growth and I don’t think I want to teach English forever. However, a remote job is ideal for me because my wife lives in Poland and she is unable to come to the US very easily. I am hoping that I will eventually be able to bring her to the US, but we are not sure if this is possible or desirable.

Anyway, the bigger problem is that I do not know what to do with my life. I majored in History and got into debt, which was very stupid, and I did not develop many skills during college except for maybe writing and public speaking. The first job that I had outside of college was a lead generation job, which I liked and did well in, but I left because they were doing sketchy things. I am currently doing my MA in Technical Writing online at a cheap and somewhat respected university in my state, but I am not learning much from my classes and I think I would need to learn some hard skills on my own before I pursued a job in Tech Comm. I am very interested in many subjects and I think that I enjoy and excel in synthesizing information, but I don’t really know where I can go from there knowing this.

I had considered going back to school for a new Bachelor’s, but 3-5 is a long commitment and I wouldn’t know what to study anyway. I need to be careful because I am already 25 and I do not have much time to waste.

I guess what I am asking is: what should I do if I am lost and want a change, but don’t know how? What strategies did you use to find out what you want to do?

TL;DR: I do not have many marketable skills, I am in debt, and I need a new career, but I am not sure what to pursue. How can I find my path in life?",11Dec2018,1

The console is mine, I've paid it by myself and with the help of a dear online friend, and he's been playing with it for a few hours a week since I got it 1 year ago. The problem is that I recently started my last year of high school (after dropping out for some shit including game addiction, which luckily doesn't regard me anymore ) and since then I decided to move the ps4 into the living room where my brother could play in peace and so I could focus on getting back to school.  


But now he's playing it 3 hours a day with his online school friends and I can't really play anymore, since he's either doing homework, playing or family is watching tv. I don't do anything besides studying, going to the gym and going out on Saturday evening, and I really miss my 30mins of daily play. Moving the ps4 back to my room would mean having to hear him playing online which is not really reasonable while I study.   


What if his friends can only play at an uber uncomfortable time for me? What should I do? I don't want to give up the countless games I still have to play for an act of generosity that feels so forced on me

And I haven't been able to hold down my stomach each day from stressing out. I have other things going on but I should conclude.

I own a 2005 Toyota Tacoma (double cab, 6ft bed), over 216k miles and some decent cosmetic damage (roof, body damage \~$500) and general wear that you expect in a 13 y/o truck.  Mechanically it is OK; I have kept up to date on various things but the check engine/maintenance required lights are on.  My dog also chewed through a rear seat belt, so will need to be replaced.

374,"I work in a campus library and us pages share a computer. We use Messages during the day to talk between the two desks. When I come in to open in the morning I can see what yesterdays messages were, not on purpose they just still show up. This morning I came across a conversation of two pages who are in an online class with me talking about our latest assignment that we posted. I don't know whether they knew they were talking about my group's project but they were very gossipy and critical of the work and specifically the video portion I made. I recorded my voice over a powerpoint because of my severe asthma. It would be very noticeable if I cut myself in and out between my lines so I opted for audio only. I'm contemplating leaving a note at the desk saying ""Please be mindful of the conversations you have over the computer we share, other people can read these messages.""

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that not everyone will like my groups work but I also feel that I shouldn't have to read gossip about my project at work either. Should I just ignore this and toughen up or should I leave a note? Or address these girls directly?",11Dec2018,1
375,"I am 28 years old and am married. My husband is 33. We have been married for 5 years and together for 7. I am so frustrated in my life and can’t figure out if it’s him, me, or something situational, but I’m very unhappy. 

I have a bachelors degree from a very good liberal arts college but do not work outside the home. I have two kids, age 1 and 4. I have been staying home with them since they were born (my older daughter is now in ‘school’ during the day) while my husband is a public school teacher. 

We live in a beautiful but isolated and economically depressed part of northern New York in a cool house on lots of land. But I am so bored. I have depression and anxiety and health fixations and I spend a lot of time on my phone just trying to numb out. 

I have artistic ambitions and a hunger for life and am, against the odds, signed to a record label in California (after a Herculean effort). My husband is involved in the music projects we do as a co-member with me (kind of against my will- we worked on everything out of necessity because of our limitations but I never wanted to share the project with him because it felt like my only outlet as an independent human). 

I feel like I’m loving a double life. My record label BELIEVES in me and wants me to succeed but I feel chained to my husband, our town, his ability to support us financially. I’m not making much money from music but I feel like that’s in part because we don’t live in a place with a ‘scene.’ I want to feel alive and right now I feel dead all the time. I have no real work experience. I feel I’ll-equipped to exist as an adult. 

I grew up with very rich parents who gave me everything and then took it all away when I graduated from college. I’m saddled with responsibilities. I feel desperate and claustrophobic. Trapped. My relationship is suffering with my husband. I feel like it’s up to him to move us somewhere else but he doesn’t want to start over. We live close to his family and they’re a huge help with the kids. He thinks I should get a job in our town to build my independence but I don’t want to put down roots somewhere I don’t want to stay. And I don’t want to feel chained to a job that’s not my passion (not that I even know what that is). He doesn’t want to move because it would mean lots of uncertainty and less money + more expenses. He thinks I’d be unhappy anywhere.

Tldr; my husband resents me for being dependent, I resent him for being the one with the income power, I feel trapped and stuck and overburdened and I don’t know what to do to make it better. I’m just waiting for something to change and nothing does. What do I need to do?",11Dec2018,1

377,"Hello Redditers,

&amp;#x200B;

I hope some of you can shine some light on my current situation. A little backstory for you;

I have been working at my current company for 4 years, started off with a 1 year apprenticeship and then they took me on full time. They were really good to me in the first year or so, and very accommodating however it has gone drastically down hill. My boss is constantly homophobic and I am afraid to say anything out of fear he will dismiss me. (I am M20, Gay with a partner of 2 years - we live together).  


I've been having interviews recently and hope to get a new job soon. My plan is to hand in my full 3 months notice, and then on the last day of the month I plan to circulate an Email saying that I will no longer be in. (Perhaps 2-3 Weeks into my notice period). This will undoubtedly leave them in a difficult situation however my mental health is currently more important to me. This past year I have contemplated committing suicide multiple times on my drive to work, and if it was not for my partner I wouldn't have survive.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Can I get some advice on how I should handle this whole situation, and your general thoughts on it?

378,"**TL;DR: Male, 22, Canada. Long standing depression, been travelling and trying new places and jobs for years. Depression got so bad, moved home, now clueless on where to begin to fix things, pretty hopeless on if I will ever feel good or have a fulfulling job again**

For almost a decade, after some mild trauma, I have been depressed, off and on in different severity. The main issue being extreme self hatred and isolation from never having had friends. The worse was age 15, i drank a lot, took drugs once, suicide attempt, hospitalized for a month, ran away from home, parents divorce, almost failed school etc. 

I ended up getting my degree in aquaculture, travelling the country, no longer wanted to do aquaculture after my first job in it. Tried different jobs that interested me, far from home or any friends and family or support. Worked in rural mining operations in the north, weeks at a time, 12hour days, never in my own bed. Isolated, miserable, unhealthy. Took drugs for the second time in my life and it was very traumatic, likely made things worse. I became so close to suicide, I had plans to shoot myself that weekend and I was serious.

Finally called family after 7 years not discussing my mental health with them ever. Told them everything except my suicidal thoughts. They encouraged me to get home to get better, I quit my job and drove 4 days to get home. 

I am home now, no friends (At least had drinking buddies in previous town), hate the big city here. All my hobbies are outdoors and I'm stuck in my parents city home. Good to have the support but at this point, I am so hopeless, what do i do. I genuinely think that I have blown my chances at having a good paying and fulfilling job, blown my chances at making good friends and I am scared I will never be happy or be able to leave my parents home again. 

I spoke to a doctor, wants me on antidepressents but I have read so much about how they mess you up, make you an empty zombie, permanently changing your brain. Really dont want to take them, just for the sake of feeling a bit better but sacrificing everything about who you are and all the side effects and theres a good chance youd have to spend a year or more trying different ones like a guinea pig. 

But since arriving home unemployed, my anxiety is so bad, I cant stay still, in so much pain its causing headaches, diarrhea, I am at times screaming outloud, cant sleep well. Dont know what to do. I want therapy but the earliest I can get is 1.5months from now at 200$ per session wow. So i am just waiting, waiting, in pain. 

**What do i do now?**

**Short term:** Need to fix self esteem hopefully for good, find a way to be happy which likely requires friends. But i dont intend to be in my parents  town forever so why make friends just to leave them in a few months. Dont know if i want antidepressents, I really dont but im going insane. What do i do with all this time when i feel like shit and am just waiting 1.5 months for a 1hour therapy session and then waiting every two weeks just for another 1 hour therapy session after that. 

**Long term:** Need to find a job that leads to a fulfilling career. I just genuinely feel stupid and like the only jobs I could do are labour for minimum wage. Need to find a town to settle down in (Lived in 5 different towns in the last 4 years). Again need a way to love myself and have friends. I feel as though if I can find a town I like (I have one in mind only 3.5hrs from family) and can begin to start a career I enjoy there (no idea if theres a suitable career for me), then after that I could begin to settle down and join clubs, make friends etc. But I am so reluctant to be social in my parents town and I still hate myself.

I have no idea where to begin both short and long term. So emberrased and ashamed of feeling this way, being unemployed and running back to live with parents. All my life until now I have had goals and plans and it had been what has kept me going. Now I am so clueless on what to do, if I just have a plan then I might be ok. But feeling so hopeless, at my worst moments I genuinely fully believe that suicide is my only choice and I am scared I might actually shoot myself in a few months if this doesnt improve. I really dont want to do that to my family though. 

Where to begin? Also no idea what to do for career is a major part of my hopelessness.

Thanks",11Dec2018,1
379,"So long story short. I liked this colleague from another department and tried to pick her up like 4 months ago. I tried to use facebook as a means to approach her kinda indirectly. She stopped replying after 2 messages, so I was like, okay then, see you around. I didn't talk to her after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like 2 months later she started trying to be nice, and find every excuse to talk to me whenever I go to her department for some work. She asked questions, tried to involve me in conversations and what not. She even started coming to the place I took my break to speak to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I basically never ""helped"" in the conversation. I just replied to what she asked and stopped there. I ignored her talking to me in my break and she would have to just go sit somewhere else. She kept trying for like 3 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I did this was because I genuinely believed she was trying to manipulate me someway to get me interested again. One day I decided to tell her to meet me in my usual time and spot on my break to talk. I ended up being rude and aggressive and using words you should never use :( . I told her what's the point of us having conversations if we both know you have zero interest? 

&amp;#x200B;

(Now I NEVER EVER do this to anyone, as I am friendly and respectful to everyone)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway she left and nothing was said again. 3 weeks later I realised that she unfriended me on facebook. (I don't know the exact date, but during those 3 weeks for sure.) This got me thinking about what I said and I felt super bad. I sent her an apology on facebook without justifying what I did and what not. I even told her that I am not doing this to get her to friend me again or messing with her head. I told her I want to apologize face to face again if she allows me to.

&amp;#x200B;

She read the messages I sent and didn't give any reply.

380,"I'll try not to make this too long. 

Ok I'm 15 and I live alone with my mom (my dad left when I was in 6th grade). I love my mom but she's constantly suffocating me. It doesn't seem like she really has her ""own"" life and spends her time orbiting around me or whatever I'm doing. Here's a few of the things she does.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Whenever we go out in public she tries to hold my hand or randomly kiss me on the cheek, then makes jokes about how red my face is getting and asks why holding her hand is such a big deal

&amp;#x200B;

\- She calls me ""her baby boy"" and pet names like ""cutie pie."" I hear these more than my real name

&amp;#x200B;

\- Always wants me to hang out with her. Nearly everyday she asks me if I want to go out to eat dinner with her, go ice skating, see a movie, go bowling, play a board game, etc. If I want to go out with friends she acts sad and said she wanted me to spend time with her, she even cried once when I went to a movie with a girl from my class instead of her

&amp;#x200B;

\- When she sees me texting she'll interrogate me about who I'm talking to. One time I said ""it's really none of your business"" and she got PISSED

&amp;#x200B;

\- I strongly suspect she snoops in my room. I keep my room organized but a few times I've come home from school and found my dresser or nightstand open and some of my clothes or other belongings tossed on the floor like she was looking for something

&amp;#x200B;

\- Keeps asking me if there are any girls at school that I like, I always just say no

&amp;#x200B;

\- Always wants me to ""snuggle"" with her on the couch and watch movies with her. We'll share a blanket she'll have me lean my head on her shoulder. Sometimes she'll stroke my hair and if it's late and I start dozing off she'll start humming to me

&amp;#x200B;

\- At least once a week she comes into my room at night and she'll softly rub my cheek with her hand or gently squeeze my earlobe. I always pretend to be asleep

&amp;#x200B;

\- Whenever I leave the house for anything she calls or texts me the whole time, sometimes multiple times an hour, asking if everything is ok, if she needs to come pick me up, when I'll be back, and so on

&amp;#x200B;

\- Last Friday she asked me if I wanted to come to her room to watch TV/chat and sleep in her bed for the night, which to me sounded weird as fuck. I've never seen my mom drunk before but she was talking very loudly and walking funny and mispronouncing words. I said no thanks and she got upset and said ""fine, I guess you don't love me""

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm going to go insane and I've been so tempted to tell her to fuck off. I mean I've tried telling her a few times that she needs to leave me alone for just a little bit but then it turns into an argument because she accuses me of hating her even though I insist that I don't. I appreciate her caring about me but she makes me feel immature and smothered.

Over the past few months, our industry has faced liquidity and investor confidence issues due to which we have stopped doing further business. Our company is channel partners for various kinds of insurance companies )health, accident, medical, vehicle and property insurance). They now want my department employees to sell insurance (the company will get some premium portion from the insurance company to sustain itself) but this is completely unrelated to my job profile (I have a prestigious degree but joined the company for some exposure to various kinds of profiles and departments at a single place).



Boss is forcing me to buy insurance policy in my name or family. I don't know any people to whom I can sell insurance. Can you guys help me in this situation (avenues to sell insurance) or come up with some brilliant excuse to not buy in my name because the policies are a bit expensive as compared to third-party policies. At the moment, it doesn't seem that we will get any commission for selling such policies which is another slap on a face.



Our family is soon going to face some massive expense due to some personal reason which can be a good excuse but who knows whether they will accept this excuse. (they won't as all employees are surprisingly on-board to buy insurance for themselves or their families).

I use Tumblr mainly to look at all of the amazing fan art for shows/ movies I like. I love how tight knit and personable the community of artists is as well. That, and the art just seems *better* on Tumblr. 

Now that Tumblr is dying, I want to try and find a new website that has the same feel that Tumblr does as far as accessibility to fandoms and fan art go. I’ve been playing around on Deviantart, but the app is clunky and the art isn’t exactly what I’m after. I guess I *could* stay on Tumblr, but the shift to move on feels pretty strong and I don’t want to be left behind. 

Also, does anyone know of any Tumblr host apps that I can download? I deleted my app not knowing about its ban from the App Store, and accessing the website is a pain. I know it sounds contradictory, but damn, I miss my good old fashion art. ",11Dec2018,1

Also noticed him staring at my boobs once but I blew that off as him being a dude but then this year things changed a little imo.

I think he knows its a little weird because when he comes by and I dont notice that he is there... he will like whisper my name to get my attention and wave hi (why would he be whispering if it was normal?)

392,"Met this guy about 6 weeks ago and it’s crazy how similar our personalities and senses of humor are. One of us usually says what the other one is thinking without even realizing it and we tell each other stories from the past only to realize that the other person either has or would have done the same thing! It’s great and we’re vibing really well.
Although we have so much in common, we also have a lot of separate interests. We’re both analytical with a mind for numbers as I’m in business and he’s an engineer, but he’s very into electronics and cars while I gravitate to more creative things like photography and art. Regardless of that, I guess you could say we’re in that awkward “talking” phase that often happens before people decide to date. A few days ago I made it pretty clear that I wanted to date and he essentially agreed but hinted that he was waiting for a special occasion to ask me (so sweet!).

Anyway, things have been going really great and I feel like our relationship is a good mix of lighthearted fun and deep, important conversations. Once he asked me about my goals in life and seemed impressed when I pulled up a graphic on my phone that I designed (I work in digital marketing) to list all of my goals and have as a reminder. (The last few years have been tough for me and shortly before we met, I began making a more conscious effort to focus on what I want in life.)

One of my goals is to share my witting with the world. This goal seemed to catch his eye and he asked me more about it. I explained that I wrote everything from political and opinion articles to short stories and that I’m working on what might turn into a book and that at some point in my life I really want to get something (anything) published. He seemed to think that was really cool and even asked if I had anything he could read. I told him yes but neither of us really ever brought it up again.

Fast forward 3-4 weeks to yesterday when I found out I was getting an article published (I’M FREAKING STOKED) and he was the first person I wanted to tell! We were both at work when I got the news but he sent me a snapchat on his lunch and I replied with details about my exciting morning. He sent back an excited face but no words and then I didn’t really hear from him until we were both home. I told him how excited I was to which he responded confused as he forgot what we were talking about so I reminded him and he kind of dismissed it and changed the subject to letting me know he needed to travel for work the next day, changing our plans for hanging out the next night. When I went over to see him that night instead, I asked about his day and listened to what he shared and then he just turned on a movie and didn’t really make any other conversation. I worked in one more time how damn excited I am and he definitely didn’t make as big of a deal about it as I had hoped. He kind of said it was cool and mostly kept his attention on the TV. I was so disappointed that I wanted to leave. I just kind of sat there and thought about whether or not to do something. I think he noticed that the comedy wasn’t eliciting any laughter from me and after about an hour, he paused it at a lighthearted part and made a comment about the plot that lead to a lot of enjoyable conversation that took my mind off my disappointment. We can talk for days and not get bored and I really enjoy spending time with him but I can’t help worrying that my interests are never going to be as important to him as I’d like them to be. I may be reading way to far into this but I don’t want to start a relationship if this is a red flag. I truly care about him and enjoy being around him and he always says the same things but I am uneasy because I’ve genuinely taken much more interest in cars and video games than I ever would have had he not been in my life so it feels like he should want to be excited and talk about my achievements. The article is about a somewhat controversial issue that we’ve joked about previously and are definitely on the same page with so I thought that at least that would get him talking but he didn’t. Am I overthinking this and being dramatic? Or is it better to just back this off before it officially starts?",11Dec2018,1

- I had a lady on the phone asking where her money has went, and why we asked for evidence of identity for a certain kid, that’s it... and I thought she was querying about 3 kids but it turns out it was 2 kids she brought a product for and 1 she was wondering about and at the end it was just a mess because I got so confused I’m surprised I remember my own name.

398,"Basically I'm worried about my future.
I'm a first year doing business, but I have failed all my financial units (e.g Accounting, Microeconomics) My parents recommended me to apply for Education in 2019. I received an offer but I haven't accepted it yet. Right now I'm feeling scared for my future and am unsure what to do.

I googled job security for primary school teachers and have found that there is a shortage and very low job security. 

I would like to get advice about the following:

1. Has anyone failed university units and had to repeat them? Did you pass the second time round?

2. For those who work in the business sector, is it a stable environment? I've heard teaching is based on contracts and temporary placement. Is it the same in business? 

Thank you!

399,"So I (m, teen) was friends with this one guy  when we were kids (from \~5 year olds to \~11 year olds) we didn\`t really talk to each other anymore and haven\`t talked for years. He is the only one that says hi to me (we still dont talk at all and i dont have friends).

The thing thats really bugging me is that I feel like my old ""friends"" are conspiring against me. And I know it sounds stupid but I had only three people I saw as my friends and the others were just suspicious. They were friends with a dude that had bullied me before and he fucking hated me for sure. (Slapped my phone outta my hand and said it was an accident, laughed at me for small mistakes etc.)  I know this whole thing sounds like I\`m really paranoid and that may be true. 

This person hangs out with those people and I think they are gathering information about me or something...asked me if I would like to take part in a hobby we all shared a common interest in, I took this as them seeing if i think of them as   
my friends and i think the guy who has been saying hi to me is a part of it. Also they might think im gay and that i like the guy this is because they used a similar trick when we were younger (the guy walked past me, other guy looking at me to see if i looked at the guy going past me, i didnt but the guy said i did, i could hear them clearly because they were just around the corner, I didnt stand up for myself because it would\`ve been futile and im shy. Also im not gay.

Questions: Are they conspiring against me or am I paranoid? The dude said hi to me and I didn\`t say hi back. I thought he said it so someone else because no one talks to me but no one was around so I look like an asshole. is that right?",11Dec2018,1
400,"I need some advice! 
My situation is that I have been living with my friend while at college since August. The situation is that the community only allows one parking spot per bedroom so I do not get a parking spot nor am I considered a resident because I am not on the lease. I parked across the street all semester and walked in which was fine. Recentlysecurity has gotten stricter with installing a finger print scanner at the gate for walkers and requiring a pass be called in for every guest(im considered a guest). As you can imagine this has become very stressful especially since the complex limits guest passes per household. My roommate always told me we would figure it out but she is not helpful with getting me from where I park or anything. Sometimes I’m worried I won’t be able to get to my home because of the possibility of not being let in if my roommate doesn’t answer the phone when the gate calls. 
I pay 275 plus utilities. The room is 550, so my roommate pays the same amount for the luxury of parking in our home garage and never having an issue of making it home. I know I went into the situation knowing about the parking issue, but I was also told it would be much easier than it is. 
Another friend has an entire bedroom open for 400 a month. I would have my own parking spot. It is a 20 minute drive from campus and work whereas my current house is 5 minutes. I really want to move out because my whole situation is stressful. When I brought it up to my roommate the first thing she said was that I would still have to pay her rent. I am not legally obligated to since I never signed a lease, in fact I am illegally renting from her. I was planning on giving her 200 a month as a compromise if I move out because paying more than 600 a month is pretty much the most I can afford. Since the first thing she said is that I’ll still have to pay rent and doesnt even care how stressful my situation is I feel less inclined to pay her, but I also know that would be so messed up. What should I do? If I move out should I still pay her the full rent? Should I be responsible for utilities? I don’t think I should if I’m not living there and I don’t think I should even have the same rent to begin with since she gets to park there and I don’t. But I am obviously biased to my situation. Some people have told me just to move out and not pay her any more rent because I’m not obligated to and others have said I should give her a portion but no one has told me I should continue to pay full rent because I was never obligated to to begin with and my situation is unfair.",11Dec2018,1
401,"Bit of background:

-met this woman (25) on a dating app nearly a year ago. 
- she was incredibly shy and nervous on our first date (but obviously wanted to see me again)
- she doesn’t like PDAs and we didn’t kiss until about 4 months into dating
- we message each other several times a day, every day and see each other minimum once a week but can see each other 2/3 times per week. 
-started doing sexual stuff/heavy petting after 6 months 
-she will go down on me, let me do hotdogging, will get almost completely naked but never takes her pants off (will pull back of her pants down but never show off her vagina)
- doesn’t like/want guys to go down on her and doesn’t like being touched there (unless she is wearing pants and I am very gentle and even then she’s not 100% keen on it)
-she told me there’s a serious reason why she doesn’t want to have sex (not fear of pregnancy, or because her number would go up, etc)
-have stayed at hers a few times
- I’ve met her sister and some of her friends
- she’s met some of my family

I’ve mentioned this woman before on Reddit and some other Redditors have suggested that she could have been sexually assaulted at some point. I feel as if she has as I’ve suggested so many reasons why she doesn’t want to have sex and she said it’s none of them and says it’s a very serious reason. I’ve asked her about it quite a few times now and she keeps saying “I’ll tell you about it later”. 

I don’t want to push her too much but I feel that she’s just trying to put off telling me for some reason. 

She always is “up for sex” when she’s on her period but then says “oh I’m on my period, I can’t have sex just now but I really wish I could”. Which is fair enough but when she’s not on her period she still isn’t keen for sex. 

The lack of sex itself doesn’t really bother me, what bothers me is that this is affecting the potential for us to be in a relationship. We have been mutually exclusive for about 6 months now and I fully trust her on that. However when I mention about her becoming my girlfriend she gets really nervous and says she doesn’t know if she wants a relationship. I asked her if that’s the same reason why she doesn’t want to have sex and she said yes. 

So, any tips on how to get her to open up about her past and if she has indeed been sexually assaulted? I kind of feel as if it has to be when she is ready to tell me, but considering we’ve been together almost a year, I don’t see how much more time could change that. 

Any questions that I should/shouldn’t ask her?

404,"My original post on here from about a week ago: “This is going to be... confusing to say the least. I(17M) and my best friend (17F) have been best friends since our sophomore year of high school. She has been dating a guy since the second semester of that year, but recently that had a fight and it was believed that they broke up. So over Thanksgiving break, I decided to ask her out and she said yes. I was overjoyed, so when we got back to school I had quite a shock. They were still together. Before you guys say “maybe she thought of it as a friend thing” no, she and I both said we had feelings for each other. So I’m thoroughly worried out by this, but I thought I’d just let what happens happen. So she eventually tells her bf that we were going out on a date... and he was fine with it. So we go out and have a lot of fun, and we eventually confess how we both feel about each other and we honestly both kinda cried because we finally got it out. The next day, she asked me to hang out again, and I said sure. So after hanging out for a while, she vents to me about her boyfriend. She says that he isn’t the guy she fell in love with, and that she doesn’t know how much longer they will be together. After about 20 minutes of letting it kinda cool off, I asked her this. “So... if you and (bf) do eventually break up... would you want to go out with me?” To which she replies yes, absolutely. I just... I don’t know how to handle this. I feel like an asshole, but simultaneously I feel incredibly overjoyed that she feels the same about me.” 

So after that, I took the advice I was given and asked her if she was using me. I’m incredibly self-doubting, so I made sure it didn’t sound like I was blaming her for anything. However, she said she got so upset that I thought that that she threw her pillow and almost broke her TV. She said she “needed time to get over it”. Fast forward to now, over a week later, and she still tries to dodge talking to me. Whenever I try to text her, I’ll get a response like this : “Hey, she’s got some family stuff going on and she doesn’t want to talk to anyone right now.” Then, when I try to talk to her in person, she seems disinterested and it’s like she tries to avoid me. What the fuck do I have to do to earn her respect? Why is she avoiding me? What the hell?",11Dec2018,1

However, last night me and my girlfriend came home and before entering our apartment, noticed our bathroom light was on (its visible from stairs) and heard water running. I, naturally, believed we were being robbed or some homeless person broke in to use our shower. Of course I have a permit to carry concealed weapons and was ready to do what I had to do. As I walk inside, I notice our front door was unlocked and a worker was in our living room. I didn't have my weapon out, so that isn't the issue, but we told us that the apartment should have called to give us a heads up that someone would be inside. They did not call, and this could have gone bad.

411,"I’m apologize in advance for the long post. A lot has happened in the past week and a half and I really need some advice because I am worried for my mother’s safety. 

A couple of weeks ago my boyfriend, sister, and I went to a town about an hour away to stay at a casino hotel because my mother and her boyfriend (D) invited us to a really nice dinner and gave us some money to play on. It was a wonderful time and because she lives a few hours away from me in Florida it was nice to see her and catch up. 

Her boyfriend is considerably older than her (in his late 70s) and my mother is in her late 40s. He was a marine for several years and had taught my mom and me defense tactics in case we were ever attacked, nearly every time we would see him. 

Two days after the trip my sister called me bawling saying that D had tried to kill my mother. My mom had caught him on his phone trying to pay for sex from other women. An argument ensued, at which point she broke his phone. He beat her viciously. He tried to crush her windpipe, snap her neck, beat his fists on her chest where her heart is, slammed her head repeatedly into the ground and furniture, ripped chunks of her hair out, and broke her arm. My mother was thankfully able to call 911 and threw her phone kind of far away from him so he would not be able to find it, but the dispatcher heard him say several times that he was going to kill her. 

D was arrested and spent approximately 2 days in jail. During that time she was unable to press charges formally because she was in the hospital, so he got out on bond for $20,000. My mother is working on getting a restraining order, but he won’t even be arraigned for it until January. Right now it’s simply a no-contact order, which means he can be 5 feet away from her if he wanted to be, but can’t speak to her. 

In the past two days my mom has found him parked right outside of her RV, at which point he promptly took off and she called the police. They spoke with him and he admitted he had been there, but claimed he was “trying to see if he could park his RV” in the same park. That’s bullshit. Not only does he not own one, but he was parked directly outside of her RV. 

This morning my mother stepped outside and a decapitated, disemboweled rat had been strategically placed on her front step right outside of her door, which she is also going to notify police about. 

I am incredibly scared for my mother’s life and have no doubt in my mind that he would kill my mother and then himself if he were able. I desperately need advice as to what she can do. She lives in a part of Florida that was absolutely decimated by the hurricane so she doesn’t have any friends she can stay with, and the only battered women’s shelter is hours away and she has a barely functioning car and no money. If any of you can tell me how I can help make her safe, I would be eternally grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

Some years ago, my ""friend"" at the time, sexually harassed me in my sleep. No penetration, but other stuff until I woke up. I was 17 at the time and not great at standing up for myself. I cut him out for quite a few months but he worked his way back in through mutual friends and other means. I (stupidly) accepted him back. So about 5 years after that he did the exact same thing. I was suuuuuper wasted and couldn't make my way home so I asked could I sleep in his bed (yes, stupidly again but I was so pissed). I shouted at him that he was to not sleep near me or touch me in my sleep, but he fucking did it. I was utterly shocked and disgusted, and in complete disbelief. I feel that deep down I didn't want to believe it because it was a hard thing to process and he had been a really good friend to me (Obviously apart from the unforgivable things he did- I was going through some super tough times, and valued all the support I had). So I made up a fake report saying I had turned him in and that he would be summoned to court. I was trying to make him see the wrong he had committed and the possible consequences of his actions, but when I served him with it I watched him crumble and had a flash of him committing suicide (also because his life is pretty awful as it is, albeit most of that is self-inflicted) and I couldn't bare to have that on my conscience. So after a while, I just ignored it. I stupidly ignored it because I couldn't bare to feel the pain that came with it. I also moved from where I was living so wasn't confronted with it as much as I barely saw him. So here I am, 4 years later, i've moved back to where he is living. And he started to become part of my life again (but again, didn't see him much). But then I finally woke up, or else I got to a point where I felt strong enough to process all this shit and the emotions that came with it. So I cut him out, for good this time, because now even hearing his name makes me feel sick to my stomach. So finally, heres the advice i'm looking for...

&amp;#x200B;

How to I proceed? I had put it out of my mind for quite some time but now it's slowly making its way back in. I would say this is due to us still having some mutual friends. 

I've thought about reporting it, mainly because I don't want this to happen to anyone else, but in this weird way I wouldn't want to put him away or do that to his family. I've warned him that if he was do ever do anything remotely like this again, I would report it straight away. But I just don't feel like justice has been served in anyway, sure he lost a close friend, one that did A LOT for him, but I just don't feel this enough. He needs to be punished so he knows never to do this again. But I feel our judicial system sucks. So vigilant advice is mainly what i'm after.. 

&amp;#x200B;

So regarding the mutual friends thing, the more and more I think about it, the more I feel that those people who are remaining to be his friend are standing on the wrong side of justice, and I wonder if I can stay friends with people who could be friends with someone who is capable of doing something like that. Advice on that would be appreciated too. A lot of friends have also cut him out, but some close ones remain, people that i've known all my life and I highly value. So i'm so baffled as to how those people could remain friends with him, but I guess I blocked it out for years too. ",11Dec2018,1

Where to start...

&amp;#x200B;

***Personal Social... area?:***

I've graduated from high school in '11 but have been going to University  for almost 8 years and always been mooching off my parents.

I have not held actual ""real job"", only temporarily filled in for people in few stores when they couldn't find a replacement in time but haven't worked for long.

I'm socially awkward... I do ""weird"" thing sometimes, people tell me but its not like I do it on purpose.

 I've been single since high school, and used to avoid people by hiding under a rock. Only went out at dark, like 9 pm or so to avoid people as much as possible. I've had times where if someone spoke to me and I jumped in surprise because I went many days without uttering a single word... I even tried to avoid my parents and family. I know they are supportive, but I am afraid and ashamed that I can't even manage my own life. 

 My anti social behavior got better. Oh yes, I have friends now LOL. I have been regularly attending classes. It may sound simple thing to do but I used to have.. hard time... getting out of my room. Used to be game addict too. I've used to log in 60 \~ 70 hrs a week around '11 \~ ' 14... So I am getting better. Never seen a quack though. Didn't think i needed one since I've decided to change, although slowly I am becoming more.. Sociable.. well more than before anyways. Tends to be grouchy sometimes though. Also I can actually forgo games for days if I have something else that needs my attention. People tell me I am nice but no one here of importance. Only a gaming nerd stepping out of my cave time to time...

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is... although I've been going for university since '11 I've fucked up this time around hard core...

I felt like I've been stuck in this loop for so long, I felt entrapped. To escape from this ""prison"" I took 6 classes this semester... I had only few more classes remaining... 

And I've fucked up hard core... I just failed 3/6 classes I took... My GPA is going to be way lower than 2.. which means I can no longer attend university most likely.

I need to get a job, a life any better than what I am doing right now. Some where I can stay away from my family and friend and can afford to pay for my own damn rent...

**But where do I start?? I've never worked, nothing to put on application or resume. WHERE do I go to apply for a job? LOL..**

&amp;#x200B;

***Family Situation:***

I can't rely on family anymore... well I can but... current family situation looks like...

My mom's out for 2nd cancer surgery and trying to recoup, any type of ""news"" will make her get worse. She never recovered from tumor removal surgery back in '11. She can't even feel half of her face. Doctors told us they have no idea why my moms not recovering from that first surgery. I cried when my mom told that she was upset that she couldn't even feel that fly was sticking to her eyeball. She only noticed it when she saw in the mirror Now she just went through 2nd surgery in different place.

My dad is extremely hard working. He haven't had vacation time since whenever California's real estate bubble popped back in... can't remember... 2005,6,7???? and have been working ever since. He's been getting sick at least  three times each year for past 3 years. So now when he started to visit doctors but his muscles are so... I don't know the what the description was but stuck? that needle can't go through some spots. Needled actually bent in many occasions some doctors gave up.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so lost...  I know should have acted like grown man of my own age but I don't know what to do...

I don't have anyone like me around to ask advice from... If there was, it would be a disaster for the society Hehehe

So only place I could find to ask advice is r/Advice... Not sure if this is right section for this type of thing. I've never visited here.

419,"I am an older college student and not my first time in college.  I have developed pretty good study habits and have been making good grades.  I also had worked in the auto industry.  The major I am in is a 2 year Robotics/Maintenance program.  Another student has been getting on my nerves a bit.  He started in engineering; while he had the appetite for it he didn't have the capability.  Some of the students he knew during his engineering classes have had auto industry internships.

Since I have done well so far and worked in an industry he is interested in, he has attempted repeated befriend me.  My immediate read was that his interests are very self serving.  I don't initiate any convo and just one word any questions he has, I don't see how he can't tell the hint I give.   He likely sees I could be an ""in"".  He is very ""put on"" friendly, I would describe like a car salesman.  He has tried different tactics such as asking questions he already knew the answer.  To other students he seems to try to befriend based on if a person is an advantage to know; and at the same time ignores the ones that don't do so well.

I know my schedule is different than his next semester, so I won't have him for class after this one.  Can anybody define his personality or maybe mental state?  I find very peculiar how he doesn't want to give up.",11Dec2018,1

422,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I'm grasping at straws. 

My life is a mess and broken into so many pieces I don't know where to start picking them up or how.

I have many injuries to my legs and feet from a car wreck, nerve damage to my feet and legs, broken bones, rods and plates. I also have bipolar, border line personality disorder, ptsd from various childhood things and a lot from my ex husband. I'm applying for disability and I've been rejected the first time so I'm in the appeal process. It's been a year now that I've been applying. I have no source of income and I don't know where to start to try to get one. I tried to get some online work from things like raterlabs and transcribe me but I never hear back from anything I apply for. I wanted to try to start taking care of people's children while they where at work but my SO didn't take to the idea. He said our house was supposed to be a sanctuary and he didn't want other people invading it and things about zoning laws and the landlord finding out and wanting a cut. I've worked in restaurants all my working life so I'm not really sure what to do about non physical work. I don't have a car because it was totaled in my wreck. I live 20 minutes outside a smaller metropolitan area but there's no public transportation and walking is not impossible for me but it's hard to do for long periods of time.

I have a five year old that lives with his dad three hours away from me. He meets me half way but it's still a three hour drive round trip. I rely on family and friends to give me rides to get him every other weekend but I don't know how long that will last and I have no money to give them for gas. My SO doesn't take me to get him because he says that he works and pays the bills and he can't do everything.

I'm supposed to get my ex fingernail drug tested and he's been pulling some shady shit and sending me emails and texts about how I'm a bad mother but I owe my lawyer something around 1200$ so he's not advising me on anything. I take very good care of my son. We play together constantly when he's here. Do educational things like put together states puzzles, spell, read, go outside. He doesn't like to eat vegetables because all his dad feeds him is fast food so I found some chicken nuggets made out of vegetables that taste like chicken nuggets to make sure he gets some vegetables. I know I'm rambling, sorry, I'm just so stressed out all the time.

I put up the Christmas tree with my son and he said there's no presents and there won't be any presents and it breaks my heart.

I'm thirty years old with no prospects, no skills, and no idea what to do.

Sometimes I want to cook food, like today evening I wanted to fry an egg.

Then she comes there, asking me how would I do one. 

Then I gave him a answer, and started breaking the eggs into a cup. Then she starts to say she wants one too and then she would start breaking and mixing the eggs inside the cup before putting them on the cooker.

How I would let him now that I dont need her help, and that I can do it myself.

I've completed home economics inside my school, and do it alongside as a course in the school. So I know a few things about cooking

425,"The other day, my female co-worker yelled a word you would address gay people in my country and my dumbass just happened to turn around as if you just called my name. Her face turned all freaking red. I’m extremely socially awkward, but I tried to amplify the joke by saying I am gay. She actually gets shocked as though I just came out. 

To begin with, people probably find it suspicious that I’m really handsome but have no girlfriend and extremely quiet at times.

But this sucks, because I am not gay. I love girls and have never had sexual thoughts for the same sex. Now, everyone is so fucking awkward towards me. Every single girl who I thought had crush on me can’t even look. 

Worst thing is that, there’s this girl I’m really starting to like and feel like I have a connection with. But I fear she might have been turned off by me as well.

The student it happened with is on a sports team I participate in. I don’t know her beyond the team, but my friends that know her and dated her said she’s got some serious mental problems. She would threaten to harm herself over being broken up with and bragged about being with the teacher after he was arrested. 

Obviously I’m angry at the teacher (if it even really happened because maybe she just made it up I don’t know) but it’s also hard to be around her.

428," 

Apologies  for the length, I'll try to keep this as short as possible and relevant  to the question: I have chased after my mother's approval my whole life  and never really gotten it. I am her only child (daughter). Our  relationship used to be somewhat better but has been on a pretty steady  decline for a decade or more. She makes constant belittling or mean  comments and just generally doesn't seem to like me much (e.g. she made  fun of my child's ears and mine, then tried to make it sound like a joke  ""just tell people you can hear better""). I think she feels disappointed  by my life choices, even though by most standards I am a positive,  contributing member of society. (I have a master's degree, a  professional job, a husband/family, etc.)

We  had an especially difficult incident a few years ago when my husband  and I tried to buy her business and she accused my husband and I of  trying to take advantage of her (even though her CPA was the one who  drew up the deal). I have been trying to make things better since then. I  try to send her pictures of the kids, and ask about her interests and  what she's up to. I phone her on occasion, but she NEVER calls me. I run  the website for her company, and if she needs my help with something,  she will ask me, but she seems completely uninterested in me personally  or our family. She has never even met our youngest child, nor expressed  any interest in doing so. She asks what we do, but never seems to want  to reveal ANYTHING about herself, even the most mundane of things. When I  have called her for holidays, she either ignores my calls or has said  things like ""I have a friend over,"" which is bizarre because I have  never known her to have friends my entire life. Work is her life.

In  the past she has given me money and/or expensive gifts, though I have  never asked her for either and feel pretty uncomfortable accepting them.  I figure this might just be how she shows love. I have pretty much  resigned myself to the fact that my mom will never love me the way I  want to be loved, and we will probably never have a great relationship,  and that's fine. I honestly care more about the relationship for the  sake of my kids than I do for my own sake.

Recently,  my husband and I had been revisiting the idea of buying her business  since she still hasn't sold it. It didn't work out again because the  person we were going to hire to manage it declined the position and we  don't want to uproot and move out of state at this point. I spoke to her  a few weeks ago prior to Thanksgiving, and was simply trying to inquire  what she would be doing for the holiday. She grudgingly revealed she  has bought a house across the country. I thought it was bizarre but  didn't make too much of it, other than to be upset that she'd clearly  chosen to never live near me or my family (which I didn't express to  her).

I called her yesterday and she let  slip a man's name. I asked if this man was her boyfriend, and she said,  in an irritated tone, ""are we writing a book?"" I was stunned into  silence. She said this is her boyfriend, and when I asked how long they  had been together she just said ""over a year."" I suspect she has been  hiding things from me for MUCH longer (several years), however. She  asked if I was okay with that, but quickly said ""you don't have to be."" I  said I was. She bizarrely told me that the reason she hadn't told me  about him was so that I didn't have to lie to my dad about things (even  they divorced when I was a baby). Apparently she and her boyfriend have  this house together out of state and are planning on moving in together  when she sells her business. (FYI: Google informs me that the average  home price there is nearly 500k).

I have a few questions:

1. Should  I be concerned about this ""boyfriend?"" My initial thought was that  perhaps he knows she is about to come into money by selling her business  and he might stand to profit from that. I don't know him from Adam and  don't even know his last name or anything about him, which she obviously  doesn't want to share. I have NEVER known her to have a boyfriend my  entire life since her divorce from my dad (although my husband pointed  out that perhaps her secret life has gone on much longer than I  thought).
2. My  husband wants nothing to do with her at this point, citing the fact  that she's been hiding significant details of her life from us for a  year (and likely longer). He rightly points out that when we were going  to buy the business a second time and move to be near her, she never  even mentioned that she had a boyfriend and was about to move out of the  state (kind of a crucial point!). He doesn't want her influence around  our home or our kids.
3. My  husband says that, as her daughter, I am entitled to know such  significant information about her. Am I? Or is she entitled to keep  anything she wants private from me?
4. Any  insight into WHY she would hide such big aspects of her life from me?  (I really don't buy the reason she gave about protecting me so I didn't  have to lie to my dad).
5. My  husband thinks it is time to cut off my relationship with her. This is  my biggest question. Is that the right thing to do? I want to teach my  kids that it's important to do the right thing even when other people  don't, but is it healthy for me to try to continue a relationship with  her? Is there any reason to try to do so?

TLDR:  My mom and I have a very difficult relationship and she's been actively  hiding significant parts of her life from me (including a secret  boyfriend and house out of state) for a year or more. Do I give up on  ever trying to have a relationship and move on without her in my life at  all?

431,"Ok, I’ll need to give a bit of background before I get into what happened:
My “friend” (I’ll call him daniel) was getting close/getting with one of my best friends (who I’ll call Rachel), and Rachel is reallllyyy close mates with one of my close mates (who’ll be called Alex). Also, Rachel and Alex we’re together for maybe a few days once in the past and they’ve been really good mates for ages so people tease them saying that Alex really likes rachel when to be honest, he’s just really good mates.


Right, with that out of the way, here’s what happened. Daniel was sat next to me at a lunch table, Rachel and Alex were sat across from us and there were a few others there (but they’re irrelevant to the story). Daniel whispered to me saying that they were trying to make him jealous and that he “overheard” them talking about it, which made me confused because I know Rachel and know she wouldn’t do anything like that but I didn’t think anything of it. Daniel kept pointing out little things they did and how that was meant to be targeting him and I started to notice, but they could easily have just been friendly/not trying to make him jealous at all (eg “flirty” hitting each other (not flirty but I don’t know how else to describe it) and just generally talking to each other). Now I wanted to tell those two about it but didn’t because Daniel said he’d message Rachel about what he thought was happening (who he’s, again, getting together with her), and later on when it was just me, Daniel Rachel and another friend he didn’t bring it up. 

The reason I didn’t tell either of them was because I thought Daniel could talk to Rachel about what happened and then I could help the two of them if they argued about it. Buuuut, he never actually messaged her as I later found out.

So, Rachel messaged me because she knew something was up at lunch and I told her about it, and said she hadn’t had any messages from Daniel. Alex brought it up in the group chat and I explained what happened and yeah this was wrong as fuck to do to just let daniel slag those two off in front of them but at the time I thought everything would work out. That led to me, Rachel , Alex and a couple other people have just had a massive argument about what happened in a group chat. I explained the whole situation as well as my POV of the story, they explained theirs, I owned up to everything and said that I should have told them and how much of a twat i was that I tried to keep Daniel (someone who I’ve only just got quite close to) happy over two mates I’d had for fucking ages. I told them that they could be mad at me for as long as they wanted but I wanted to sort shit out with them and they seemed ok with that and just said to talk to them when they weren’t as pissed off, which was fine.

But then came Daniel. OOOHHH BOY did he make this interesting. Instead of apologising and trying to sort it out, this cunt says “I wasn’t slagging you off Rachel, I was actually taking the piss out of Alex” and when me and then both told him that that didn’t make it any better, probably worse, he told Alex to fuck off or fight him. Jesus Christ did he make that worse.

So now I’ve lost pretty much all of my closest friends for now or at least until I can sort it.

Any advice on how to sort things out or how to try and calm the situation/not make the two lads fight and have everyone at least be mates again? Also thank you for taking the time to read this, I appreciate it :)

tl;dr Me and a few close friends are now fucking pissed off because one of them slagged the other two off to me whilst they were there, and because I didn’t say anything to them because the guy said he’d sort it with them but didn’t, I’ve indirectly started ww3 between us.

No issues whatsoever.

Recently, this coach was removed from their current program abruptly.  This school program was very successful under this coach.

Looking for answers I had a person in power reach out to this school to inform and was told that they will not discuss it. 


Now, here i am fearful that this coach that i employ may have down something truly awful to justify this move. 

My question is this - would it be wrong for me to approach the school myself, showing his employment, and ask for some reason?

Currently my dogs have free reign of the house, which works great for all of us (no accidents, etc.)

If we did get a roommate, no matter how much we vetted them, there would always be the fear that they would harm my dogs because they got annoyed with them or were just plain sick.  Probably not the most rational fear, but its there nonetheless.

439,"Examples:

&gt; Live every day likes it’s your last!

That’s just an idealistic quote made up by someone. Ideally it’s great, in practice it doesn’t work. If my friends are I are working to get money, and lets say I die tomorrow, worst case. I spend my last day working, or doing whatever I didn’t want to do, so that’s sad.

It’s also disheartening to see unaccountability. This dude with his say 5 year old daughter came into our work bathroom. Not only did the bathroom have toilet paper strewn about on the floor, there was feces in the toilet? I figured a few things may have happened.

* The man simply forgot he was in a bathroom, which seems difficult... yet possible I suppose.
* He didn’t care about flushing the toilet, which seems weird and strange. If that’s the case, he also didn’t care about picking up after himself.

Once, all I wanted to do was use a public restroom. So I tell the associate at the register. There wasn’t a line behind me, to clarify.

&gt; Excuse me... I was hoping to use the restroom and there was no toilet paper...

&gt; Thank you for telling me.

I said “thanks” and waked away. I was disappointed to see that the associate’s response didn’t address the situation, and neither confirmed nor denied help. In fact, I didn’t really know what ‘thanks’ meant in that situation. 

Asking another worker at that place, while she promised to find a manager, unfortunately that yielded no results. Going back to the restroom around 15 minutes later to see no toilet paper was disappointing, so I left.


My family is very compassionate and caring. By compassionate and caring, I mean judgmental and critical. 

&gt; Get a fucking job!

Or basically:

&gt; These are my standards. If you can’t meet my standards then you must be ‘whatever’.

‘Whatever’ is an insult they want to throw at me, at the time. Say lazy, or depressed, or both. Ive actually been called depressed as an insult, strangely enough.

Ironically enough, I’ve been criticized for addressing my family’s criticisms, which makes perfect sense! Not only do I deserve to be criticized, it’s my family’s business what I do, as in judging someone is a good use of your time, as in sarcasm.

Here’s a pretty good example of my brother judging me:

We were carrying loads of bricks to into a truck/trailer, and he was arranging them into piles to load. I’d bring 6 per his request, then after so long of brining bricks, I got upset we randomly didn’t have any water, on a hot summer day. Asking the seller for a glass of water, since we were  at their house, apparently made too much sense. 

&gt; Oh, we can’t do that!

Baffled, I kept working. Though I noticed I was getting tired, so I brought 5, then 4 bricks per load.

&gt; Oh, I need 6 bricks per load!

I respond with:

&gt; Wait, what? I’m getting tired, we have no water, it’s like 70-80 degrees out... I mean of course I’m getting tired.

&gt; Not my fucking problem, quit bitching and bring 6 bricks per load!

I respond with:

&gt; What’s going to happen if I come with 4 or 5 bricks per load? Is the world going to explode?

I got a lot of my sarcastic vibes from my chronically depressed friend, who I typically consider one of the most realistic people I know. He’s never physically witnessed my family criticizing me, but if he did I say to him that *he’d* say something like:

&gt; Not only does he deserve to be criticized by us,  we do it because we love him, and it’s also our responsibility to judge people!

That’s all done in sarcasm. I don’t know if this is good, but I find comfort in his sardonic nature, and I’ve seemed to have adopted more sarcasm than before I met him.

I obviously struggle with depression and anxiety. Sometimes I really hate my family, and I feel like I’d have a better time only associating with the ones I’m closest to. I haven’t mentioned my parents yet, not only are they very accountable for their actions, uhh never mind no sarcasm needed. They aren’t accountable at all. There have been times where I told my mom I would more than happy to verify her seemingly impossible or unfounded claims with a mental health professional, and get their statement in writing.

Gosh, writing all this really reminded me of a lot of memories. All very irritating unfortunately. I’ve just been dealt and shitty hand, and it’s not my fault.

440,"basically i'm 21/f living in nyc and i need to make a decision that i've been putting off for a while. i've always been a responsible student with impressive grades that came easily to me and have always loved learning. after high school i had no idea what i wanted to do but i thought that going to college was the only sensical option i had. i knew that i was really interested in the human psyche so i figured i'd go for majoring in psychology like my mom. i ended up dorming for a year at a school that i ended up absolutely loathing (this was also around the time my mental health got really bad and i was just going through a terrible time in general), then i went back home, transferred to a community college and got my associates degree in liberal arts at the end of 2017. after that i was stuck and didn't know what i wanted so i decided i'd take a break which was supposed to only be a semester long break but lasted all of 2018.

during that break i ended up moving out of my moms and into my dads, then moving out of my dads and into a 3 bedroom apartment with some roommates. i worked at as an assistant manager at an ice cream shop this year but i felt really unfulfilled and unchallenged whilst working there so i recently applied as a supervisor for a coffee shop and got the job, which is what i'm training for right now. i still don't know what i want to do with my life professionally but i know a few things that i want in the short term: to travel *a lot*, to have a cozy apartment in the city to myself, to be happy with what i'm doing, and to not make so little that i have to work every day to pay off expenses.

the issue is, i blindly and half-assedly applied for john jay to major in forensic psychology in september because i felt like time was ticking and my parents were seeing me more and more as a failure who didn't know what she wanted and would amount to nothing without a college degree (mostly my father, whose stepson is going to med school to be a ""dermatologist's assistant"" and who i know he compares me to). anyway i didn't pay much attention to the application process and my mom actually did all the financial aid stuff for me because i couldn't be bothered and really didn't care enough, and i told her that. i didn't think about getting accepted and what i'd do if i did, but today i got an admission invitation in the mail saying i got accepted and now i'm anxious and stuck. 

honestly most of it is about the money for me. i already owe like $11k in loans for my first year and it makes me passionately angry. if i could go for learn free i would, but to do what i really ""want"" to do with psychology i couldn't just live off of a bachelors. i'd have to get a masters and a doctorate too and i just am not sure enough about it/love it enough to be that much in debt in the end and dedicate that much time to it when i could be doing things or discovering things that i actually love doing. i don't need to be rich and would rather live my life super happily/making just enough than to owe my life in funds and be barely content. i would love to be one of those people that believes that money doesn't matter but money unfortunately is a big part of everything, especially in new york.

i guess in the end i know what i want to do but i don't have faith that i could make it. i know that i will hit some bumps along the road to being where i want to be financially (especially since i won't have anything but an associates degree under my belt) and i'm prepared for that, but i fear that the people around me will just be saying ""i told you you wouldn't amount to anything without a degree"" instead of supporting me until i do get to where i want to be and i don't want to deal with that. i feel so much pressure from my elders (mostly dad) and all my friends have/are working toward their degrees or know what they want to do with their lives and it makes me feel like i'm less than them.

people keep telling me ""just enroll, maybe you'll figure it out along the road. at least you'll be getting college credits and not wasting time,"" but that doesn't appeal to me at all, it just sounds like a waste of time and effort.

tl:dr; got my associates, didn't know if i college was for me so i took a gap year, got my own place and am making enough to be comfortable, lazily reapplied to a pretty good college a few months ago because i wanted to get my peers/parents off of my back and stall them for a while but i just got an acceptance letter this morning and i now feel stuck.

i guess i just want to know if anyone has been in a similar situation and how it played out for them. thanks for reading if you did and i'm sorry it was so long!!",11Dec2018,1

After talking a bit to the other girl in class, my friend turned her back to me and would not make eye contact with me even when I tried speaking with her.

Anyway, there was this guy we work with and I was attracted to. I would see him often and we would take our breaks together. I told my best friend I was interested in him and she tried to investigate and confirm if he was single. There were instances in which she would make it obvious in which I would feel uncomfortable because I wanted to maintain professional and I told her to stop. Then when I would get the courage to go up to him and talk to him, she would follow and would then join us for breaks. She would make it a point to have his attention and would interrupt my conversations with him. Then she got his phone number and would text him. I eventually found out he wasnt single so I backed off and so did she. 
Now there is this guy that she and I went to HS with and he and I recently reconnected. We talk almost daily and we have hung out. Recently, he responded to a post she made by giving a (thumbs up) and she engaged in a conversation with him and even tried to invite him to hangout.

458," My (F27) parents (M60, F60) are causing me emotional distress. While we’re able to have pleasant interactions sometimes, more often than not our interactions end with them throwing tantrums. I’ve been in therapy for nearly a decade now to try and deal with it and to learn how to set boundaries with them. I thought we were doing relatively well, but now I have my doubts. Now they’re angry that my husband and I are only coming to their house for 2 days during the holidays (xmas eve and xmas day) because my husband has to work up until then. They asked me to come down to them on Friday the 21st (when my workplace closes) and just tell my husband to drive himself down on Christmas eve when he gets off work. I thanked them for the offer but told them “no,” and explained that I’d rather come down with my husband as planned, as I think it wouldn't be fair to ask him to travel alone on the holidays and I’d like to stay with him. They then went on a rampage of telling me how ungrateful/inconsiderate I am, how I don’t care about family or their feelings, and how my mom always left my dad for the holidays to spend more time with her family so I should, too. I again calmly explained that I didn’t feel right doing that, but am happy we still get to spend Christmas with them. Their aggression and accusations just increased from there, so I left, affirming we would see them Christmas eve. Ever since they’ve been passive aggressive.

They've been doing this my entire life; my decisions/obligations don’t align with my parents’ ideal reality, and they pull the “you don’t care about us, you’re selfish, you’re messed up” card to try and make me out to be the bad guy and the reason our family isn’t functioning. I hate to completely sever the relationship, but I kind of feel like I’ve tried every tactic in the book to have a healthy parent-child relationship and nothing has worked, including setting boundaries, limiting contact, not letting them get an emotional rise out of me, calmly pointing out when I am feeling disrespected, and sticking to my decisions. I really don’t know what to do anymore. I might also add that I just recently found out they’d been lying to me about my birth mother for 27 years (post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adopted/comments/9urykd/my_parents_lied_for_27_years_about_birth_moms/)), which I went back to therapy about and have been working through. Even after that, I still wanted to spend Christmas with my family, but they're making it so hard to continue having a relationship.

**TL;DR**: My parents (M60, F60) constantly gaslight me (F27) and throw tantrums when I don’t do what they want/don’t follow through with their suggestions. I’ve gone to therapy about it for years, tried setting boundaries, stopped letting them get a rise out of me emotionally, and limited contact, but none works. I’m tired of the stress and dealing with them is exhausting. **Should I just cut them out of my life completely? Does anyone have suggestions for tactics that have worked for them**?",11Dec2018,1

462,"So I recently ended a friendship with a female “friend” let’s call her jasmine, I met her at the start of uni, she seemed so unbelievably nice at the start, she was literally my best friend over my other best friend. I don’t really have many friends anyway only a couple, as I grew older I realised less is more. Anyway, I started to realise the friendship with jasmine became more flawed as it went on. At the start she’d tell me she would argue with people but I always thought it must have been other people’s faults and not hers. But then she began to argue with me, over literally nothing, and soon I started to think maybe it wasn’t the other friends she had who tried to argue, it was her. 

She would be ruthless with them, one felt suicidal, and she told them well if you were going to commit suicide you would. You wouldn’t tell everyone about it. Which really started to trigger me, as it’s unsupportive. She then argued with her so called “best friend” from home, and while arguing with her she sent me a pic of her and said “doesn’t she look weird here” like I just felt really uncomfortable and I made that clear as to me I don’t think putting anyone down is needed, we all have our own demons. She also commented on her friends depression, saying it’s not going to be a valid excuse in future.

To add to this she used to leave me abandoned on nights out with her other friends, to go and speak to her boyfriend, as much as I knew them and liked them, I always thought if you invite a mate out you shouldn’t really just abandon them for a guy. Another thing she did was I suffer from anxiety attacks, and I called her saying I felt like I had chest pains and was scared, and she literally lived 10 minutes away from me and said oh you should call 999, she wasn’t even there to support me once. 

So as time went on she then struck up an argument with me, which really I saw coming, after a series of petty arguments with me, and it came on after she invited me for dinner, and well as usual it was she chose where we all ate, some other friends of hers came along which I didn’t really know massively well. We got to dessert and her friend made an off the cuff joke about a ring her on/off boyfriend gave her which obviously annoyed her, and she ordered an Uber went, didn’t tell any of us. Or even me her female friend who she’s known the longest, I said to her oh hold on I’ll pay and we can go together, she said oh nope my ibs is flaring up I need to run now, when she sat there for ages complaining and we mentioned there was a toilet next to us.  She just left me, alone as a female with her male friends and didn’t even ask me if I got home safe or anything. I just felt fed up at this point and even her friends agreed it was out of order and rude she left. She had it out with me and I decided to walk away from the friendship.

470,"So, there is a lot to this simple question. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me go from here- I am a 24/M married and my wife is pregnant (super exciting!) I have been at my current job for almost 2 years. The more I have been in the position I have been and working I have noticed some things about my company that I really do not like. But there are some good things about the job too. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my job right now is the Marketing Director for a few health clinics in my area. I oversee the marketing of 5 clinics- an urgent care, a primary care, a chiropractor, a pediatrician, and a medical spa. The only people ""over me"" is the owners of the company, a partner of the medical spa and then the clinic manager. So overall I really do my own thing and as long as I get my stuff done the clinic manager and the owner leaves me alone. But I have had time after time with butting heads with the partner of the medical spa. They are the type of person who needs everything rushed for the next day or the day of, they have me do projects and once I spend time working on projects they end up pulling the project and canceling it. Which overall I am an easy going guy and most of the time I can just brush it off, even when I spend a few hours working on an ad or some other project instead of other work I need to do. What really gets me angry about her is that on the days she gives me a project that she wants out like an email blast and wants it to be sent out in a short period of time and then it isn't exactly how she wants it, when I send her the proof she gets upset and calls me to yell at me and then tells me she has to get off the phone with me before she ""says mean things to me"" lol. Overall I am very tired of it and how unprofessional she is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is that I haven't been given my raise they were supposed to give me about 6 months ago and that is with me continuously asking since.

My main boss who is the clinic manager is awesome other than that. There are times where she will give me the day off, she has just given me random gifts for both me and my wife. She is someone who has actually has really help me grow in my personal life as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also love all my coworkers. 99% of them are amazing. They really have grown on me like family.

Overall I know this job is fun but I know it is more of a stepping stone for jobs. That is where I am having a hard time with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

After one experience where the Partner of the med spa lied and tried putting blame on me for a situation even though we have proof of her signing off on a project and having an external company working on a project, when she got the bill she refused to pay it and made me look really bad in front of a company that I have used for the other clinics and have grown a close relationship with, and then happened again with another company who was working on our new websites, I knew it was time to start looking for another job.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad just started a franchise in the area and told me he would love for me to work with him. My dad and I work well together always have since I was a kid. But the issue with it is that the job is in a completely different field of work. His company does resurface of bathrooms and kitchens (basically like remodeling) He would want me to spend one year being a technician so I can learn the ropes and then start working in the office to manage the other technicians. After about 7-8 years he would then step down and hand me over the keys. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have worked multiple jobs where I have had to work with my hands and I do love it. But I also love doing things like marketing.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that I have had to keep in mind is that I do have a new baby coming soon. My dad has told me that he could promise at least the same compensation as my current job, plus some more depending on how I do while I am working as a technician (depending on how many appointments I can get done). But the job is about 40 minutes away and it is more physical labor compared to working at the front desk. At least for the first year. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I would love to work for my dad but I also know it will be hard to leave my current job because I love the people who I work with.  ",11Dec2018,1

A close friend of mine recently shared with me that his teenage daughter told her mother that he molested her in bed. When he told me, he seemed upset that she would accuse him of something like that, but what is troubling me is he’s not adamantly denying it. It apparently happened during his “rock bottom” moment in life and he later confessed to me that he wasn’t entirely sure it didn’t happen because he doesn’t remember much of that time period. Her mother hasn’t done much about it and seems to not believe it. His daughter has been acting out pretty badly in all ways a teenage girl can, tenfold and I’m very concerned. They’ve always been very low effort parents so it’s not surprising to me that they aren’t trying to get her help, but I’m shocked at how nonchalant they’ve been about this particular incident. They’ve narrowed down to speculating if it’s a false story for attention instead. 

A friend of mine told me to call CPS and have them get involved (wouldn’t be the first time they were) but I’m unsure if I should try and talk to their daughter (were close, I’ve been a part of her life since birth and consider her my niece/me her aunt) and try and get the full story before I make any decisions. I don’t want to cause any more trouble in her life, as it’s been a reoccurring theme. A victim of sexual abuse myself, my heart breaks for her and I’m sick over this.

This morning I emailed the professor regarding an extra credit assignment that she forgot to put in my grades. This was her response:

""The 3 points for answering the surveys will not help you in anyway. You missed so many classes this semester and I’m going to take 5 points for each class missed after the 3 allowed. So what ever grade you have right now, is not your actual grade. Check the syllabus for more information on missed classes.""

I said no that I want to try again in the future. My family has a rare blood type and there's a good possibility I do too.

My biggest worry is that I genuinely suck at algebra. Anything beyond the basic algebra that I know is incredibly boring and tedious. I am taking arithmetic algebra on my first year, and I want to make sure my GPA is high so I can in the long term have the option to join the military or get into law enforcement for a bit. In high school, I did average in algebra, did super amazing in geometry, and did horribly in algebra 2, but it was due to my teacher teaching a completely new subject everyday, thus not giving me time to process everything correctly. Not only that but I never took calculus nor statistics in high school. My solution is starting to learn through khan academy, but it seems futile.

So my question still stands, knowing I have a horrible foundation in algebra, should I really continue with my minor in computer science, knowing well of the risk of me sucking at math? I especially want a high GPA so I can apply to become a military officer.

489,"So, quickly, for context,

My mom was constantly in and out of homelessness, drugs, and really scary shitty situations. She's literally a genius(literally), but has made such incredibly poor choices in life that everyone around her has had to live with. Being incredibly smart, she has been able to pull herself (but then go right back in, but then pull out again) crazy situations. She's pretty good at keeping up appearances and making people believe she's only aloof. My early twenties was spent bailing her out of jail, her living with me, dealing with insane tweaker men, and making sure her animals and my younger siblings were decently okay. I was stupid, I have a lot of resentment.. blahblahblah. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 4 years ago. Her tweaker boyfriend gets her a gift, a puppy. A rottweiler/pitbull mix puppy that his (also a tweaker) son got from a homeless couple. She doesn't really want it, but tweaker boyfriend is insistent she needs a puppy. They neglect the puppy, like she's an object they got tired of.

I am still very present in her life and take care of the puppy. I have many crazy, blown up fights with all of them about keeping said puppy, but ultimately, they are adults and can make these decisions. Makes me so sad. She also has, at this point, 2 other very old dogs she has kept through her shenanigans. I, reluctantly and stupidly, decide to do as much as I can for the dog, without being the owner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 4 years later. This dog and I have bonded so much. I used to take her everywhere with me, feed her, sleep with her, then return her home or stay there to cuddle.

I am not and never was in a position to take care of a dog, but I loved her and did everything I could for her. She is now a huge dog and overly excited. She started to get lumps. I took her to the vet and they would not test her because she's ""reactive"". Took her to another vet that said the same thing, but that they are very likely cancer. We had an appointment with a 'special vet' two months out, but before then, she ends up biting 2 adults after being stepped on.  My theory is that she is in so much pain, she lashed out. But she also started to get food aggressive suddenly with the other dogs as well. My mom decides she needs to be put down ASAP. The vet, again, will not do it without testing her aggressiveness or lumps...but refuses to test her. They recommended bringing her to said special vet, but my mom would not wait the month out because there are always people and kids in and out of the house. I understand her, but I am still conflicted about the dog being put down.

Also, my mom would not put up any money for her cancer. Let alone pay for behavioral classes. I don't have the money either. My anger towards my mom and her tweaker boyfriend are indescribable, but this isn't about that.

The next suggestion the vet had was taking her to the shelter and surrendering her. The vet said that this particular shelter would test her, treat her, and then adopt her out if possible. They could also put her down if she does not pass a series of tests. :(

After talking to so many people, I figured this was the best option and her best chance at a good rest of her life. My boyfriend helped me spoil the shit out of her, and then we brought her in. The volunteers were incredibly sweet and she seemed calm around them. 

It's been about 4 days since then and I am still a mess. I am so depressed about it and not knowing what is happening with her. There is no way to call to get updates. The worst part is the uncertainty of her future. I do not want to let this dog down.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm asking if I did the right thing. Was there something different I could have done for her? I just know she is so confused right now.

Should I have put her down and then been there with her when it was done? The pain is unbearable knowing how she is probably feeling right now and I feel so heartbroken about letting her down.

490,"Hey, guy English is not my first language, so I might make some grammar mistake.  I need some advice and find out what my brother is up to.  Please be kind to me. Oh just to let you know, he is my twin brother.

The first problem, My brother was very paranoid about everything. He can't let me leave my room without telling him first. He feared me would standing outside his room to peeking in or spying on him. In reality, I don't have time to do such childish thing but he kept paranoid about that. Now I'm already in college, he forced me to take classes that have similar time to his schedule. He feared that if I leave first, I might somehow go home and invaded his room. Not to mention that he already installed the second lock for his room so no one has the key for the second lock and yet he still fears that I somehow teleport to his room.  His class always ended first before me 3hours and he often goes to the library to study. However, sometimes my professor didn't come to work and I have no class that day; he would be forcing me to go to campus with him. Somehow he is still insecure, he forced me to come with him into his class and when I refused he get mad. 

Second, he often did bad things that I didn't like. When I confront him that I didn't like what he did, he blamed me that I was the person who did it not him. I know it sounded stupid but this guy actually did things like this. He obviously did something and somehow forget what he did.  He forgot what he did and blamed it on others. I once time caught he staring at me while in my parent's car. I asked him why he's staring at me and he replied: "" what you're was the one who staring at me first."" I did not stare at him. I was feeling like being watched and glance over my shoulder's few times and caught he was staring at me. Not just that this guy never taking ""accidentally"" kindly. I once accidentally stepping and on his foot's. He stepped my foot's back and accuse I'm trying to hurt him. For some reason, this guy refused to wear any kind of shoes inside the house and get mad when people accidentally stepping on him.  He once accidentally tore out a large piece of my mouth gum with the shovel while we're cleaning up the snow. Me being me, I forgive him. However, I knew if I was the one who accidentally did that to him, in act of revenge he would hit me in the face with the shovel in his hand. 

third, this guy is a narcissistic person and a very controlled person. He likes to control what I should wear and what I should eat. I once change my style's of clothing and dressed up a little bit. I would suspect that I was secretly dating someone or liking some girls. In fact, I'm not. I just want to self to looking good to boost my confidence a little bit. He didn't like that Ideas and often bullying me by calling name or calling me a "" man-whore"" for some reason. Ironically, he says I wanting to boost my confidence because I somehow want to harm him by being "" charismatic?????"". I understand this is my life and I have the control over my life. However, whenever I disobeying him, he would be making me look bad in front of my parent and would mocking me constantly.  

   What should I do ? and what is wrong with him?

511,"So background is that we met while I was broken up with my then boyfriend because he was not trying to get married, so I left him. Met this 'gawgeous' marine, fun convo for a few weeks, and one night of mind blowing sex. 

Of course my ex's Spidey senses must have been tingling so he came back into my life with a proposal and I accepted and RELUCTANTLY told young Marine what was going on and blocked him. 

Young Marine has no social media and no mutual friends, he just happened to be stationed in my city when we met. Fast forward to now, I'm divorced for some months now and I get a FB messenger notification that young marine has added me via my phone number. This is a phone number I got a year after I cut off all communications with him, and my old phone number has been removed from my Facebook account LONG ago. 

Our conversations are mostly sexual, which I'm cool with now, he says he couldn't forget that one night and it was the best. I'm honestly flattered and creeped out at the same time lol, mostly because he's such a stud; flattered because he's this younghearted sweety, tall, handsome, and has the body of gladiator, and I assume after three years he'd have moved way on by now and forgot about that little fling with me. Then I'm creeped out because I'm wondering WTF he did to find my number and even if the sex was that great it's been three years! How could he still be thinking about it ?? 

Should I keep talking to him and slowly try to get to the bottom of all my questions? Is it creepy? Can this really just be about the sex after so long?

512,"I'm in a tricky situation. The receptionist at my doctor's office is a pathological liar who, also, doesn't do her job. Her derelictions &amp; deceptions have caused a lot of problems for me.

\-------------- skip this section if you have a short attention span -------------

I live in a relatively small city, which does not attract the best &amp; brightest young graduates looking to open a private practice and finding another doctor who has the experience and ability to treat my illness would probably involve driving five hours to the next big city.

I was repeatedly told/warned by my previous pharmacist that the receptionist was lying to me about sending in refills and authorizations and whatever else. I did not believe him. I believed her, that he was the problem.

I switched pharmacies in September. It's become glaringly obvious that she was the one who was lying. She caused an insurance reauthorization fiasco, due to non-response, that lasted, effectively, from October 18th - December 2nd -- though, technically, it's still ongoing because the new pharmacy has yet to receive the customary doc office courtesy call to inform them that the reauth was finally submitted. Problematically, neither of the companies involved have records of the myriad requests made (and not responded to) saved or available through any normal process.

\---------------------- resume-------------

So, now, this lying receptionist, who is the gatekeeper to my doctor, has convinced my doctor that I'm the one who is lying. During this time period she also failed to pass along to my doctor 10 messages I left with her about an injury I sustained in October.

My first idea was to simply present, to my doctor directly, phone records with my unreturned calls in to the doc's office highlighted and to get supporting documents from insurance/pharmacy, the latter of which seem to be impossible to get.

My next idea was to call the first pharmacy, record the call and apologize to the pharmacist for not believing him while explicitly stating what it is that he was telling the truth about. I live in a one-party notification of recording state so it would be legal for me to record that call without informing him. It seems ethically kind of icky and that it might present as me only apologizing to expose the receptionist as opposed to \*also\* apologizing because I was wrong. What do you think?

If you had a small business, worked closely with someone you trusted, that trusted person told you one of your clients was lying about them and the client approached you with evidence to the contrary, how would you respond?

518,"Hi reddit,  

I started my first “real” job as a consultant at a software company a few months ago.    


I’m having quite a hard time balancing work with household chores (the other starters still live at home) and I’m also scared I’m not really qualified for the job I was hired for. I have some very basic knowledge of programming and a high IQ (for whatever that’s worth). However, my job requires more than that and knowledge of accounting which I also don’t have. I honestly don’t know how I got in but I’m glad I did because I love the job, company and colleagues. That’s why I don’t want to lose it.


I haven’t gotten any bad feedback yet but I feel like I’m not learning enough, that is, I’m forgetting a lot. There’s a lot of variety so someone might explain something to me and 2 weeks(days) later it’s honestly gone from my memory. 


I feel a bit overwhelmed too. I work at different locations, some of which require me to drive 3-4 hours a day and I’m still on a learners permit. Often that makes me feel extra tired and ready to leave instead of wanting to put in extra effort because I still have to cook, clean, do laundry etc when I get home.  I already had to stay home with a fever 3 days and even though we’re 2 weeks further I’m still not completely healed.


What I’m asking is this. How do I perform better/remember more of what I learned without sacrificing sleep, diet or hygiene? I thought of keeping a journal of sorts, I try to take notes during the day but often things are going so fast or seem too stupid to write down. I know it sounds like self deprecation but I’m really stupid in some areas. I used to teach statistics but today someone had to explain how I put a filter in excel (even though I once knew how to do that). It’s really hard not to feel like I’m an absolute moron sometimes. I sleep relatively well, eat healthy, although I do drink often and since I started this job, haven’t found the energy/time to exercise.


Please help. I have a habit of quitting/stop putting in effort when things get too hard/stressful but this is too important to me.",11Dec2018,1

520,"tl;dr: my little brother is out of control and my mom is sick and struggling to keep him in line, and I don't know how to help without taking him in, across the country

the long version:

hey all.

this situation is a very complicated one but I'll try to stick to what's pertinent. I live on the west coast, my mom and brother in the southeast. about a year and a half ago my mother's husband, my brother's father, died suddenly. My mother is a fibro patient on disability who is struggling so much with her health that it frightens me deeply.

on top of her health struggles, my brother is out of control. despite a relatively permissive environment, he does nothing. his room is trashed, he leaves messes everywhere, he refuses to go to school. mom is already struggling with her health, and she can't control him. the state they live in won't allow for him to drop out and get his GED. my mom is struggling with her very deep grief for her husband and the fact that my brother has changed and refuses to do anything. he treats her like shit when he thinks I'm not watching, I've heard the things he says to her when he believes I'm out of earshot, and I can't even imagine what he's like when I'm here.

I don't even know what my options are. I need to help, somehow. this is killing my mom, I'm watching it happen.

521,"I moved out for college and recently stayed a couple of days home. I was shocked how things have changed or rather my mother:

My mother has changed completly. She always was a woman who was proud of being independent and though, now she clings to my stepfather and whines at every scratch she takes. She seems rather helpless most of the time and I feel like she kind of ""dumbed down"". Say she used to read books, now she hangs in front of the TV all day and cheerfully comments on how much better she is than the people in TV - no difference made between politicians (""her hair is ugly, if she doesn't care about herself how could she be a good politician?"") or reality TV actors.
I see that it's fun for a while but she has no hobbies! None at all; that's basically everything she does besides sleeping and occasionally meeting friends. She called in sick (shoulder pain, yet we doubt it) and has been staying at home for two months now but complains how the household and everything is too much for her, there's simply not enough time. They own roombas, my stepfather walks the dog and they mostly have ready to eat microwave food. HOW? So every day she stays at home, watches TV, sleeps and does nothing.
When I try to have a talk with her it seems she can't focus often just repeats it or saying ""yes, yes"" so it's not really talking anymore. Hard to explain but it leaves you very frustrated, not only my opinion. When we discuss something as a family she's mostly sitting aside and listening, if she adds something there is mostly a huge logical flaw in it. Sometimes she downplays it, says it can happen but we think she notices herself but not enough to care anymore afterwards. Formerly she needed to be in control, used to have the last word, now my stepfather can do whatever he wants to. He often rolls his eyes at her and instead of fighting back my mother lets it happen.

Just so completly different.

It's not just my opinion, my brother noticed these changes too. It's been slowly going on for years but because I stayed for a couple of days it was impossible to unsee.
I don't want to badmouth my mother but I had a long talk with my brother about this and we just feel helpless. She clearly isn't healthy in a way but we don't know what to do and it hurts to see her detoriating like this. ",11Dec2018,1

She told me she found that concerning, that I should know the job without having to ask questions or take notes, and wanted to see me in her office the following Monday. 

&amp;#x200B;

We had that meeting, where she went into more detail about not liking that scenario as well as noticing that I ""distracted"" the kids during a lesson (i.e. quietly and quickly telling some to sit and listen when they were being loud/disruptive/distracting others) the teacher was giving. She then gave me a chance to switch classes or resign (which she strongly hinted I should do). I did not so I went into a new class today. I saw her in the halls and wished her a good morning and then was followed by a scowl and quick ""morning"" back.

I always loved anything related to airplanes and i aspired to be a pilot, but my family isnt that rich and we cant afford me being in a pilot school, so i just forgot about it, and didnt even tell my parents about it because i ddint want to make them sad that they cant afford my dream job. So basically now im stuck at being an engineer, and the problem is, i have so little motivation to study, i keep asking myself ""why am i doing this? for who? i dont even like engineering"". I dont spend much time studying, so far in my first year i passed with , abit more than decent grades, but i dont think ill be able to pass in future years with the same amount of time i spend  studying right now, and i dont think i can spend more time studying without motivation. I really dont know what to do, i feel like im stuck and dont belong here, but i have no other option. My parents dont know about this because i dont want to make them sad.

529,"To start off I don't know if this is the right place to put this but since I am seeking advice I thought I might as well.                       
 To put it simply I have a very dull mind. I think my past is kind of important because it is how I got here so in the next paragraph I'm gonna dive into the past. It might help you answer the question and might not so it is gonna be a large paragraph and you can skip it if you want.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, from an early age, I was constantly being hyped up by my parents. Most parents think their children are special but mine really took that to the next level. I could hardly go a day without hearing a story about me as an infant that supposedly was proof to my parents that I was ""Really Smart"" as mom put it. This basically created huge expectations for me and even as a young child I quickly realized I wasn't nearly as smart as my parents thought I was. You would think that this would have pushed me to try hard in school but I actually took the opposite direction. I NEVER studied all throughout schooling on a regular basis and always did my homework on the bus. Despite the lack of effort I still managed to keep A's and B's because what I lacked in logic I made up for in a really good short-term memory.  All the way through middle and high school I developed a knack out of memorizing the entire course the night before the final exam (I would often sneak the textbook home and read it cover to cover) and then go in the next day and get an A. This, of course, was great for grades but all the information I learned for the exam would just get dumped because I already had passed the exam so why would I ever need it again? In 10th grade, I actually had brain surgery and was out of school for half the year. I remember my math teacher being stunned because I learned the whole course overnight when I got back and got the best grade on the test in the class.(I guess I get it. Went from this kid who didn't give a fuck to not even being there and all of a sudden I'm an A student)  I ended up going to college employing the same technique and I can look at every class I've ever taken and I MIGHT be able to tell you one thing that I learned that stuck with me. (Good example: I was trying to do math today and had to relearn how to add and subject negative numbers because I didn't know how to do it) 

 \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Important to the question** 

 I think this severely impacted my logical thinking skills as a whole. Give me any logic question and I'll most likely bomb it because it isn't something that can be memorized. I learn languages as a hobby but to me, that is mostly just memorizing large amounts of info and since I care about them I actually study the new info.  To put it simply I have never in my life attempted to use logic or learn it. (Unless you count beating my Husband at Chess lol) Is it too late for me to sharpen my mind and practice logic? I mean from a biological sense. My mind has been weak my entire life and I don't know how to change 24 years of me not even trying to use it. If you don't think it is too late; what should I do? Should I go back to square one and learn basic logic skills? ( I don't even know where I would start) Should I just accept the impact of my life choices? This is really something that has kept me down lately as there are things I want to do. (For example, I'd like to learn more about the technical world and engineering from a hobby point of view but I had to go back and try to learn about ""Slope"" again because I don't remember shit from school and realized I'd have to do miles of basic stuff before I could even start learning the cool tech stuff I want to do)                      I feel like this turned into a rant... I'll post it anyway and hope maybe someone can pick through it and give me advice. ",11Dec2018,1

531,"I’m pretty trash at college and always have been.

Background before my problem: 

 I dropped out of high school after going to a few of them, got sick of it. I never learned how to study. However, for some reason i really wanted to go to college. I read Cosmos and loved the idea of studying physics so I got my GED and went to community college. 
My first semester math classes were a reminder that I never learned any math and truly believed that I couldn’t do math. So I failed some basic math class but then tested out of it to the next level. In order to prep myself for the next level math I used an online tool to teach myself algebra and such. So I take preclac 1 and 2 and get a C and D respectively. Great. This is just reinforcing the idea that I can’t do math. I realize that in order to graduate community college with a physics associates I would have to stay and extra year or something. Not wanting to do that I switched to English and graduated on time. I was accepted to a four year. At this point I’m in fucking awe because I never thought I’d make it this far. Problem is now I still and always have wanted to study physics but I was accepted as an English major. So I switch to physics again in some academic Trojan horse type shit. 

I fail calc 1 right off the bat. Retake it. C- this time. Okay fine. Calc 2: C +. Fine. Not the A’s that I want but I’m getting through. Come this semester. I’m in calc three and some advanced physics courses. Electrodynamics, modern physics etc.

Here’s the problem: 
I can’t seem to get better than a god damn C in anything. At this point I have the will and discipline to truly study for things. I’m pulling hours, REAL hours studying for even just quizzes. All C’s or lower. I mean I get that this stuff isn’t easy but really? I study for a week for a quiz and get a damn C or a D? Same with the midterm for modern physics lecture. C? Really? I study for calc 3 so god damn hard. I master the practice test (which isn’t even similar to the real thing at all, I found out on today’s test), I’m working on the YouTube tutorials. It just isn’t enough. It really makes me feel innately inferior to everyone in my major. How do I get better than a C in math and physics if I’m trying really hard already? Idk man. I’m going to be a senior next year. I want to go to grad school but with a C average it’s probably out of the question. I’ll probably fail calc 3 this year and that will make me stay another extra semester due to prerequisites. 

TLDR: I truly try really hard but only get C’s or fail things. Its making me feel like a failure. How to get better grades? ",11Dec2018,1
532,"Well let me start at the top. I purchased an item on October 31 off of etsy. After about a week or so of nothing I figured maybe the seller was on backlog of items so I waited. After a while I honestly forgot about the item. When I remembered again, I contacted them about the situation. That was about a month after buying the item. They told me it should have arrived by now and that it should have taken long at all. They also said that they will look into it.

After a few days of nothing, I contacted them back again. Asked them if they found out anything about the item. They told me that it was delivered and showed me pictures of the receipt. I live in an apartment complex, so I figured it was stolen. After some digging I found out that it was stolen. So I messaged them back about it and told them thanks anyways. They messaged me back saying that if I played for $20 shipping cost, they would resend me the items.

This doesn't sit well with me because I've spent $70 for these items. And in the past I spent $110 on their shop. I know it doesn't cost $20 for shipping. On the receipt, it said $4.45 for Express shipping. I was fine with just biting the $70 and moving on. But I felt like they were trying to take advantage me. The items were 1 poster and 4 stickers.

**For any newcomers, my prior post was as follows (edited to clarify prior misunderstandings). If there's any constructive feedback, I'd love to hear.**  
**\~**  
About a year ago, boyfriend and I matched on Bumble. We talked for a week, met for dinner, and started dating shortly after. From the beginning he was laying it on thick - incredibly flirty and way over the top forward (almost too forward) about us getting together, dating, etc.

We've been together a year now and it's been the most fulfilling (least drama filled) relationship I've had. He drives 2 hours to see me every weekend and gets a hotel with no complaints and regularly tells me he can't wait to start a family and build a life together.

Recently, he applied for a job out closer to me and in anticipation of an interview follow up email we're extra excited about, we've been checking his emails frantically (we have an open phone policy). At one point I googled some keywords to see if maybe it'd gone to junk/spam and while searching stumbled across an email he sent to his ex (girl he dated right before me) the day right after we matched on Bumble:  
""I miss you and think of you every single day. I love you with all my heart. My heart belongs to you. I hope you and the kids are doing great. I truly miss you all. I love you.""

He sent this to her 11/11/17. We matched on 11/10/17. Earlier in the day 11/11/17 he wrote \*\*me\*\*:  
 ""I want you to know if you end up wanting to be together, I am going to delete these accounts in a heartbeat! Because I want you and only you! There is no need to ever talk to anyone else. I am very old school in the sense that I talk to one woman and never would even begin to talk to someone else while I'm talking to someone."" 

So I'm like what the heck? How could you be messaging me you want only me and are willing to delete your online dating profiles - then hours later that day send such an affectionate letter to your ex?  Like, I realize it was a year ago. And I realize I have no right to feel this way considering technically we weren't exclusive at this point and hadn't even met face to face. Again, my concern isn’t even him messaging someone else before we met (that’s to be expected with online dating, nothing’s real til you meet in person) but rather the message he sent specifying he’s all about me alone and despite that, still sending a very affectionate letter to his ex.

(Some facts to consider about their prior relationship - they dated 2 months, she was pursuer, told him she wanted to marry and wanted him to move in with her and her 3 kids right away while she was moving her prior boyfriend out (her neighbor said she was like Baskin Robbins with a new flavor every week LOL). So he gets a job lined up and starts slowly moving his stuff in - she lived an hour away so he had to up and relocate. The week before he's due to move in, she suddenly starts picking fights over the littlest things.   
The days before he's due to move in, she starts saying they should see less of each other, maybe every other weekend, he starts questioning what's changed? She then breaks it off altogether. He kept contacting her asking what happened? How'd this go from 100 to zero suddenly overnight? He then gets a call from the cops telling him she has requested he no longer contact her and if he does, a restraining order will be filed. This came totally out of left field with zero explanation from her.  
MY THEORY: she was on a ""break"" with the previous guy (who never knew her dating someone new - she hid it saying he was just a coworker and never introduced them), re-made up with him, and wanted to avoid the confrontation of having to explain things/be the bad guy. I'll also add boyfriend isn't the most experienced at dating as he married his first serious girlfriend, was cheated on after a decade, divorced, and this was his first serious relationship since that.)  


He says he swears on his mother's life that when he sent this message he had zero intent on winning this girl back. But rather he was so desperate for answers, as  to why she would've just up and left him out of nowhere with zero explanation. I said ""Soooo...why not ask why she ended things instead of telling her you love her?"" 

He said, ""Remember? I did that already and she had the cops call me. If I did that again she'd have me arrested."" He said maybe if he sent an email tugging at her heartstrings, maybe that would prompt her to reply something that would clue him in on why she ended things (met someone else, you weren't abc enough, etc.).

It seems weird to me and every time I get down about it, he sees it and reminds me ""Remember that I told you I swore on my mother's life. Let my mother go to hell when she dies if I'm lying about my intent. You know I would never say that if I was lying.""

(I'll add I'm in therapy for relationship anxiety and past sabotaging tendencies - been going about 5 years now.)

Does anyone have any constructive insight on this? Or been in a similar situation and have advice? Am I the backup here?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR boyfriend messaged his ex the day after matching online with me (before meeting officially) right after telling me he's only interested me. I have self sabotaging tendencies and anxiety. I now feel like I was Plan B in that moment.",11Dec2018,1

The problem is I'm a light sleeper and my boyfriend snores heavily. We live in a studio apartment with a bed and a small 2 seater sofa.

I already sleep with a sleeping mask and ear buds  because none of the ear plugs i've used have ever worked. The sofa causes me back pain which in return still stops me from sleeping. I also dont have the money to move out.

Sometimes i think about making myself deaf by force but most of the time i just wake up, try and fall back asleep, fail and then cry.

536,"Ok, this has a bit of backstory. Please excuse the length.

My friend Nick* lives at home with his parents. He's 22. He works full time, and is a student part time. He hasn't always gotten along with his parents, the relationship with the mother is much better than the relationship with the father. 

Recently, he was told his mother has cancer. He cried for days. It was a lie. Apparently his father came up with it to ""set him straight"" whatever that means, and talking to Nick, he's told me his father has made up things in the past to try and manipulate him.

Nick does not do drugs. He gets decent grades in school. He doesn't act out or curse or anything, he's quite timid and shy because his parents are extremely controlling and he's never managed to really grow up.

I told him the fake cancer story was textbook abusive relationship, and that he should really distance himself from both parents, so here's where the advice comes in:

I told him to stop driving his car, his father's name is on the title.
He needs his own cell and service so he's not in his parents plan.
He's looking into paying rent with a friend to get out of their house.

Is there anything I'm forgetting? He's never lived on his own and he's unsure of how to distance himself fully. He doesn't have a Reddit and I'm still in shock from the fake cancer thing which is just...horrid. I figured more minds on the details might help him. He was cool with me posting this, he just asked me to change the name, thus the asterisk.

Any advice on details that might help him cut ties more quickly would be welcome, thank you.",11Dec2018,1
537,"Hello! I'm 24 and currently live with my parents. Recently I was given the chance to move in with some friends in a neighboring city and so I will soon be moving for the first time in my life.

My parents are toxic and, because I have several disabilities making it difficult for me to get a job, I haven't had the chance to move out of my childhood home until now. The problem here is that I have quite a bit of stuff--mostly hobby-related--and I don't know what to take with me.

Packing is difficult because I don't know what's worth taking and what should be thrown away or donated. I can't take too much with me because my friends live in a smallish apartment, but anything I leave behind will be basically forfeit, since I don't plan on coming back for any reason if I can help it.

540,"For context, I am a pretty good looking 20 year old male who lives in a heavily populated Asian area (just like me). I’ve never had a gf, been on a date and am still a virgin. I choose to be like that because I don’t want to rush losing it mostly due to doubts how I’ll react it to mentally after it is done and am waiting for the “right” girl. 

I am a pretty awkward person to talk too especially around females due to not having much experience talking to them and doubting myself. These doubts are usually scared of being placed in the friendzone (based on previous experience with a girl online I think due to my inexperience with not having “game” with girls).

I’ve been trying to focus on myself alot lately and feel like I should give dating a try. I do have mental battles I face like talking to girls, confidence issues, fear of seeing people who know me on dating apps. However, I have been working out 5-6 days a week to improve my body and overall feel.

I feel like online dating might be easier for me because I would rather talk online and test the waters with girls than have to cold approach a girl in person even though that is more beneficial for me and my confidence. Finding potential fits at school has not worked out for me yet again mostly due to my shyness around girls.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about trying out Tinder. I have read reviews about it and how the app can be frustrating at times. Most of the possible Tinder profile pictures I have cropped because I would not want to include others in it. but am unsure if it is the right place to find a girlfriend and not a hook up?Is the app worth it? If yes, what are some tips you can give that will help me?

549,"2 years ago my husband of 10 years (no kids) had an affair with a co-worker. He came clean and did not want to abandon our marriage - we've been on a great reconciliation path for a year and a half now. Couples therapy, individual therapy, weekly relationship check-ins, lots of communication - in many ways our marriage is even better than before and we went through a honeymoon period all over again.

While things between us are now really good (including our sex life), I have found a shift in my own views of sexuality. I used to thrive on being a sexual person, enjoyed attention I got from men in general, and I often felt quite sexy even outside of the context of sex.

I now find myself feeling more reserved. I know my self-esteem took a hit from the affair, but I've been in therapy and actively working on it. Physically, I'm in the best shape of my life, and although I'm getting older (I'm 40) and feeling self-conscious about natural aging issues, most people think I'm in my early 30s.

Yet...I've lost that feeling. That sexual power and dominance I feel I used to have. I'm trying to find it without resorting to outside validation (i.e. posting a picture to gonewild for reactions) but it's really hard. I'm not really approached by random men anymore and even male friends don't really hit on me because by now, they all know and like my husband so they're respectful. But it's starting to make me feel really self-conscious.

Have I lost my sexiness? How do I get it back? My husband insists that I'm hot and compliments me generously but I do feel his words have lost weight since well, someone else won out over me.

I miss feeling sexually dominant and being able to mesmerize men with my little tricks in bed. Being able to get a guy to say, ""oh my god, what are you doing to me?""

How do I get that spice back?",11Dec2018,1

552,"Hi guys, this is my first time posting here so I’m not entirely sure on how to format but I’ll give it my best, at the moment I’m just scared for tomorrow. 

Sorry for the wall of text 

So this has all happened today and I’m just worried and want to know what I should do. 

Some context: The last week or so I’ve been giving my troubled neighbor a ride to school so he doesn’t have to take the bus. He’s a sophomore and I’m a senior. The reason I say troubled is because he’s always getting in trouble for stupid things but I love this kid because he has a rough home life and I just want to help. His dad is abusive and used to beat him pretty severely (as well as other cruel and unusual punishments) but since my neighbor called the cops on him and the dad got sent to jail for a little while he’s stopped with the beating (what he’s told me).  My neighbor is pretty involved with drugs and alcohol but I guess he says he uses it to cope with his rough home life. 

Now to today: This morning he came over as usual and we got into my car to leave for school. I had alcohol in my car from the weekend before which I should of taken out and this wouldn’t of been a problem. I understand I’m too young to drink but who hasn’t while underage? I’m not trying to justify it but it’s basically a once a month thing with some friends. Anyways, he knew it was in my car and asked if he could drink some. I made a very stupid decision and said yes and completely regret it. We get to school and he said he’s buzzed and I’m like okay let’s put it away man and he takes another sip and is drunk. He’s 125lbs. I said hey man sober up it’s not even 8am and you’re drunk you can’t be going into school. He goes into school pretty drunk and a few minutes later I go in too. On my way to first period I saw him with his gf and asked if he was okay/going to be okay. He said “yeah” with a grin on his face.  His girlfriend looked at me concerned and shook her head as in saying “no he’s is definitely not”. 


With about 10 minutes left in class I get a text from my friend who was also in my car this morning saying “bro there’s nurses and shit outside his room. The deans there too. He’s stuttering and slurring” I started freaking out and asked what’s going on he said “they’re taking him down to the nurses office”. I immediately knew I fucked up. I started panicking because I still had the alcohol in my trunk and didn’t want my friend to say anything about it and then then search my car.  

After 1st ended I asked to go to my car to get a notebook I forgot for class. I get out there and get in my car, drive to a cornfield behind the school and off school property and bury it in snow. I drive back and am a few minutes late to 2nd. 

In second I texted my brother on what I should do because I was so scared on how much trouble I could get in or how this could affect my future with college coming soon and scholarships. He advises me to leave so I text my mom and get called out because I’m “sick”. She thinks I’m sick. 

I’ve been home for about 6 hours now and can’t stop thinking about it. What should I do? What if he said I gave him the alcohol? How much trouble could I get in here? There’s no proof of me giving it to him or anything at all just what a drunk sophomore said to the school staff if he said anything about me at all. His dad doesn’t let him have a phone so I have no way of contacting him. I hope he comes over again tmw morning so we can talk about it. If I get asked by the school should I lie? Should I say I have no idea? Should I tell the truth and take the punishment? I know fully how stupid of a decision I made and I wish I could take it back but I can’t.  If an outsiders view can tell me what they think on the subject that would be great. Also, is there any way me posting this could get me in trouble too? ",11Dec2018,1

So I am currently in university and on student loans. I really just.... hate my city.

It's sort of dishonest yes, but then I'll be back in repayment assistance until I go back to my original school in September, which is only usually $100 a month and manageable.

Then the next semester, aka now, was a complete shit show I got diagnosed with a skin disease called pitaryisis  rosea which basically looks like herpes  and it covered my whole body but mainly my chest, back and arms and I have mild body dysmorphia and it was the only thing on my mind.(dont worry it’s finally gone after 2.5 months)  but I could not study at all and I would spent all the time in my classes  Google searching treatments, cures and if it was permanent or scarring. Luckily it doesn’t scar and magically disappears without a trace or I probably would’ve committed suicide. I also had a job  to pay rent for my apartment, had a dog to take care of  and I was in the hardest major at my college. Then my dog transferred a tape worm to me and the tapeworm ended up activating dormant chlamydia that I had treated and cured months before then I had to get on medication and antibiotics which caused brain fog and weakness and at this point I was weeks behind and was never able to  catch up and even during thanksgiving break I had some weird crazy shit happen that prevented me from even opening my book for example I was heading to the library and I stopped at Walmart to pick up some stuff and my car keys fell down the storm drain. Almost as if God  himself did everything possible was to tell me nursing isn’t for me not super religious here, I  used to be Catholic but I have my disbelief till now even though I personally think we live in a simulation.. anyway being the in the hardest major wit ADHD didnt help. My classes were so hard that the class average for my exam grades were 55% and i got 52% . Now at the end of the semester and all my grades are the same at 67% . I don’t know if I should withdraw and lose my spot in nursing or retake the classes and get better grades and then the previous bad grades get dropped or switch majors and yes my grades bother me very much because I’ve never gotten anything lower than a B in my entire life. And the reason its a big issue is because I’m broke and since I’ve been transferring I only have a year left now on my financial aid and I still have two years of school for nursing And if I switch  majors maybe more years since all my credits are basically health science ones and I have no money and my family is poor.

Any advice on changing up my style/maybe a comedian to watch to see how he handles it is welcomed. I'm also not saying I'm a comedian or anything or that my jokes are even good but everyone seems to think I'm so serious all the time and it's frustrating. 

TL:DR my serious voice makes pretty much every joke I tell go flat and people take me too seriously in general",11Dec2018,1
561,"Hi, I'm a guy who's stuck in the mindset that women don't trust men and dislike them and don't want anything to do with them, and as a result I don't express any interest to any women I like for fear that I will make them uncomfortable and that they will think that I'm a creep or a weirdo.

I'm 18 and I've never had anything with a woman before, and I feel embarrassed about it. I'm sure there are many women that would like to go out with me, but I still have this ideology rooted in me that tells me otherwise. I feel like this came from my mother's strong disliking of men (and her lack of affection toward my father).

How do I snap out of this mindset so that I won't worry about making women uncomfortable and not overthink everything?

562,"Hi!

I've joined a student exchange program in my country. If I get accepted, I'll go to high school in the US. I passed the first round and the second one consists of a written exam (which I already took) and two interviews (one in groups and one in particular). I'm really nervous about the interviews, not because they're in English, but because I'm very, very shy. Anyway, that's not the problem, but rather what I should say in order to seem worthy of being accepted into the program.

Do you know what kind of questions I could be asked and how I should respond to them? Do you have any ”psychological” tips and tricks? Do you know what interviewers could be looking for in students for this kind of program?",11Dec2018,1

I think it's bullshit that I can't ever be who I want to without people trying to fit me into what I'm 'supposed' to be and being shunned or villainized for trying to break it.

This is fucking retarted. Am I selfish for expecting too much from this world? I'm short and look very young and awkward. I'm not physically attractive at all, I still get laughed at on the street.

While here I've been able to see my little furry devils but I'm quite worried about Mylo.

He has always been a little weird, noting too major just the odd thing, we often thought he may have a cat variety of autism (if it is a thing I'm not sure. I don't mean it offensively&lt;3) but he seems to have gotten a lot worse. Some of the things I've noticed are;

* Lazy eye
* His eyes no longer dilate (they did when he was younger)
* he always gets gunky eyes and has to have them cleaned about 3/4 times a day
* His eyes also cry? may be related to the volume of gunky stuff
* he has licked off the fur near his tail/end of back
* he acts very strange, my family have always owned cats and while we have had.. 'quirky' cats before, its very different
* this isn't overly related but his nails on his feet are quite disfigured, there are a couple that are just out of place and always extended.

again I don't know if this is the right community but I'm really worried about him and I want my mum to sorta understand why, and for her to get an outside POV.

So far we have given both to the main office at our apartment complex. The previous tenants have contacted the leasing office twice now about having us contact them when a package arrives. Now they have come to the door and asked my SO to contact them personally to let them know when a package arrives.


We have been living at this address for about a month now and the last package came about a week ago. I know for a fact this apartment was vacant for months before we moved in, so it’s not like they haven’t had enough time to switch mailing addresses.

I passed on entering straight after high school because I wanted time to really think about what to study, as well as stabilize myself before committing to a course. Right now I'm taking two math classes online (for high school credit), because I didn't take them during high school. The reason is, I've always been quite below average when it came to mathematics (I've gotten abysmal grades and almost failed during my junior year). Even now when that's the only subject I'm studying, I'm only getting averages of about 70% (whereas other classes like history and English are around 80-90% average). 

I was planning on studying computer science because I'm tech savvy and adept at using computers, and even coded a couple of games and programs during my free time, but I feel as though, despite this, I'll still struggle to keep up because of my math skills.

On the other hand, I excel when it comes to linguistics, history, and planning/management. During my free time I study languages, read up on history, and play a bunch of management/grand strategy games, so the interest is really split between the two categories.

My question is, should I keep trying and practicing math until I improve and try to catch up to everyone else, or would it be more wise to jump ship and improve what I'm already good at?

588,"This might be really long but this has been an ongoing problem and it is really emotionally bothering me and many of my friends and I really need advice. I’m worried about ruining my friendship but I’m honestly more worried about this dogs well being. 

So I was roommates with one of my friends for two years. Last year, she decided to get a puppy which to start was a terrible idea because she was a full time college student who was also working two jobs. Of course he was a super cute puppy and she got a ton of attention for it which honestly I think is the main reason she got him. At this point he was getting so much attention constantly from her and others so there wasn’t much cause for concern yet. 

Fast forward a few months and the attention starts dying off. I didn’t want to say anything about how she was training him because she is the type of person who gets mad when you want to give constructive criticism. He would be in his crate most of the day. When I say most of the day I mean probably 23 hours of the day. He wouldn’t be allowed to sleep in bed with her. When he was in his crate, there was no bed, no food, no water, nothing. Her excuse was that he’d chew it up if stuff was in there. But this dog was sleeping on a hard crate floor. He had no training either. If he misbehaved she wouldn’t be strict with him because she was worried “he’d grow up to be too aggressive”. Keep in mind he’s a mix of two breeds that are known to be big and very energetic dogs, one of which that tends to have a bad reputation as a dog anyways. But that being said, this is a dog that needs to be outside multiple times a day with a lot of exercise. He’s also very small and skinny for his age now, which honestly I’m not even surprised.

Anyways, to make things worse, I’d see her take him out maybe once a day. She’d be at class then work, get home, and not take him out, then be mad and confused why he shit in his crate. Then she would punish him by keeping him in there. Cause that makes so much sense right ? I remember a specific time she went away for the day, probably from 10 AM to 6 PM and she told my roommates and I a friend was watching him. It gets to be about 5, she’s still gone and we hear him crying in his crate. The poor dog was locked in his crate ALL day and she lied about it. Then was mad he was out of his crate when she got back home. I was infuriated. It got to a point where I was so mad and I had a talk with her about everything she was doing and how it wasn’t right. I was nice about it but she freaked out and got mad and started talking shit to all my friends even though they all agreed.

After that, not much changed. This year I moved a couple hours away, but when I go and visit, it’s still the same shit. He’s never taken out, crate is bare, food and water always empty, never see him taken out. He is constantly peeing and pooping inside and she gets upset about it. Whenever I visit I make sure I give him food and water and take him out multiple times. Her roommates now are mad but no one will say anything. I tried and she got mad. I’ve been told to call animal control and I’m at the end of my rope with it and about to. Im just scared she’ll  know it’s me cause I’m the only one who’s actually previously said something about it. I do not get why no one else will say anything to her when we all agree how fucked up it is. I’m so upset and angry and she doesn’t listen and I resent her now because of it.

Sorry this is so long and I’m sure there’s so much I am missing, but I need to know what people think the best way to go about this is, since clearly just me saying something doesn’t work and my friends are too scared to say anything.

590,"TL;DR I may have a job opportunity that will pay more than my current one, but I'm not super excited about it. Do I take the new job if I get the offer?

I've been working at the same job for 10 years. Pay is not great but my infant gets to come with me for free and I can take time off whenever I need. (Appts, sicknesses, snow days for the older kid, etc.) I also work with my friends (which can be good and bad) and I basically do whatever I want as long as my work gets done.

Recently I started to get frustrated with my employer so I started applying for jobs. I've been on a few interviews, but nothing really came to fruition. Well, today I had a second interview and I genuinely believe I may get a job offer.

However, I'm not super into the job. It's in an office setting that is MUCH different and way less appealing than my current one. However, I would get 401K and health insurance, plus paid holidays and would accumulate vacation time. Currently I get paid days off and holidays but no insurance or 401K. Insurance isn't too much of an issue because we get it through my husband's work, but it would be cheaper if I got it through this job. However I would have to pay for childcare for my infant and aftercare for my older son. This would definitely cut into any extra money that I would be bringing in because childcare is INSANELY expensive.

Would a pay raise be great? Sure. Do I NEED it? No. Any extra helps a middle income family, but we are doing fine. This job would allow us to put a little more into our 2 kids' college funds and more cushion for family trips. On the flip side, my infant has some developmental delays and his therapy sessions are only available during working hours, so I would have to stop those in order to take this job. Which is a huge downside for me.

I'm not super excited about this job and I don't see myself staying in it for very long before wanting to move on. It's a union job in a school district and there is availability for some movement, but not much for advancement.

So, do I quit a job where I have 10 years of seniority and tons of flexibility for a job that I don't think I will stay at for very long, but has 401K and benefits? I'm not in a hurry. I don't need to leave my current job. But the pay raise and better insurance rates sound soooooo appealing.

I looked at him and i really liked him! we had bumped into each other once and just awkwardly stared but went off our own ways.then  maybe a couple times i saw him look at me when i walked into class but in a good way as well as a good glare. the teacher let everyone pick there seats one day so another girls sat next to him and liked him and she ended trying to get his attention . He talked to her played with her emotions but his friend did the same, he knew the girl liked him but he didn't like her back because he had told his friend she wasn't his [type.](https://type.So) so this is where the confusion comes, i requested to follow him on instagram because i though that maybe if he liked me he would follow me back,so he ends up accepting the request but does not follow me back so i assumed he didn't like me.yes, i never spoke to him i know but I'm pretty sure if a guy liked a girl he would at least request to follow her [back.so](https://back.so) i ended up unfollowing him because i didn't want to follow someone who didn't follow me back.the teacher moved seats again and this time i was not facing him at all so i didn't notice much.

Even if he was to notice me he would still at least request to follow me on instagram don't you think? or maybe he doesn't like me and he just looks at every one i truly promise all of you whom read this i don't know . i don't understand men. i really like this guy but i took all my hopes towards him away and i don't know if I'm doing wrong.

I have have received a job offer in NY with the federal government. It starts out at a GS5 ($38,000) and goes up to a GS12 ($85,000) and $90,000 after my 7th year.

Also, I want my own place within a few years and I prefer not to rent but I know housing in NY is extremely expensive. Down the road, I'll be able to put in for transfer to other airports/seaports. I could either stay in NY, try to come back to where I am now, which can take a while since there's not a big airport by me, or go to the Miami area which is somewhere I've wanted to try living for a little while.

However, the reasons why I want to stay here is cause I've been here almost 10 years and my parents and now grandparents just moved here. More of my family is thinking of moving here within the next few years. But the few friends I do hang out with is very rare on occasion. One only hangs out for maybe two hours when they're back in town from college but I have known him for years. The other who has been a pretty good friend to me hangs out maybe once a month but she works a lot. And I know they're busy with work/school but so was I and I managed to hang out with people so idk. As for my other friends, even though I haven't really hung out with any of them for a while, I'm hoping once they graduate, they'll be able to hang out more but I'm not 100% sure this will be the case as some of them don't even tell me when there back in town on break or something. Now I've started a new part-time job with my town recently (was laid off from my previous one) and my coworkers seem okay, just probably not the kind of people I'll hang out with outside of work. I'm just bored out of my mind here. Maybe I don't look hard enough to find friends or stuff to do but maybe it's just me idk.

If I do stay here I'll have to look for a full time job again in the career field I want. Luckily I know people in the career field I want but I would still have to go through the employment process again. Or I can try to find another federal job, unrelated to the career I want, that will give me the opportunity to move around.

With all of this said, I really am not sure what to do, I'm not 100% on either of these options. Would I be an idiot for not taking this job? I appreciate any advice you guys have. Also, if there is anywhere else I should post this, let me know.

Thanks",11Dec2018,1

601,"Hello /r/Advice, I've been a bit confused about a mood/attitude swing lately that I have been noticing in myself and I figured I'd reach out to see if others have had something similar or some sort of lead on what's going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've noticed lately that my attitude towards mostly anything has been gradually descending into more and more negative thoughts and feelings. It would be important to note that I am a generally pretty cheery guy. I'm 23, married and overall live a pretty decent life. Finances are a bit tight, but who doesn't have that issue, right? I'd also like to point out that I am still conscious of how I present myself towards others (i.e. smile, jokes, happy attitude) because I generally do not want to bring the atmosphere of any place I'm at down, I like to see others happy and enjoying themselves. I make it especially important to be cheery around the wife since she struggles with anxiety and depression and I know how hard it is for her, so I'd rather her find a way to calm down after the everyday stresses life brings. That being said, I've been having a lot of internal issues and thoughts on just about anything. It could be something relating to politics and no matter which way I look the future feels pointless. I don't see myself ever really obtaining financial freedom or owning any major assets such as a house, nor do I see myself having an opportunity to immerse myself in school without major debt since I support my wife with my income (Due to bills and debt, she can only contribute about $200/mo. at most, I spend generally \~$1,400 on bills monthly and the rest on debt payments for us). I just do not see any possible way for me to advance further in life financially and nothing will change that, so I prefer to avoid the subject and politics altogether lately. Next, I find myself making snap judgments on little things with little to no background information on them when I used to never do that. One example was seeing a post on the front page of just a dude with his dog and girl and for some reason it just made me very, very angry. I rushed to think about how much of a tool that person much be to post a picture like that online (despite the hypocrisy of me posting my own dog on here before). Anything from comments, to posts, to anything shared, I just have an immediate negative thought jump into my mind. Just really how much life sucks in general from the smallest details to the largest aspects of everyone's' lives.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately these ideas of life's looming despair have been growing stronger and louder everyday, sometimes even making me think I've heard someone say it to me in the room. Anything from an insult or just a negative comment on something I've seen/heard it must manifest itself. I've honestly been having much more macabre and unsettling thoughts lately too, such as running away from everything. From society, from bills, from stresses of life and trying to live as simple as possible. I caught myself looking at registration information for the French Foreign Legion lately (an army in France solely comprised of foreigners who have their identities wiped and replaced). I estimate that is because of an issue I faced some years ago in my past where I was given a general discharge in basic training due to a broken wrist and going home, despite being 2 weeks away from graduation at the time, but that is just a guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anybody has struggled with anything similar? Some days the negativity is so bad that my eyes physically feel as though they would droop off my face and my muscles ache. I find myself eating less and less because i get bloated so easily an just generally feel sluggish and terrible if I'm not ready to exercise at any moment (despite me not having a regular exercise routine). This kind of really is a last resort plea, as I usually just brush this kind of stuff off and move forward, but for some reason can't. I don't want to talk to my wife because I KNOW it will stress her out and I cannot speak to my family because I know I will get scoffed at. Is there any ideas on how to combat this new behavior (it has been growing for the past 3-4 months or so)?",11Dec2018,1

611,"I apologize in advance for any narcissistic sounding remarks.

My situation seems not so bad. Three years ago I left my hometown to go to college exactly where I wanted to go to college.  I'm somewhat estranged from my family (super rough divorce) which was a big reason I wanted to get as far away as possible. I loved school and tried really hard and ended up being able to finish in three years. Now I live exactly where I've always wanted to live with a great job doing (almost) exactly what I want to do, if that means anything.

Thing is, when I left my home state, I left behind two incredibly close friends and amazing romantic relationship. The relationships I made in college simply do not compare. The friends I do have are incredibly flakey, I love them but I never feel like I am a priority in their eyes. I live alone. 

Every day I wake up alone, go to work, come home, and remain alone. I have put so much effort into trying to make new reliable friends. My primary hobby is singing and I have joined quite a good auditioned choir, I like everyone in it, but they are simply to much my senior to be close friends. The same goes for work. So I feel totally isolated. I do everything alone. I train for marathons alone. I eat alone. I watch sports alone. Every now and then I might see my friends from college, but they have rejected my requests to hang out so many times that I have almost stopped asking. It's gotten to a point where even when they do say yes they end up flaking at the last moment and my day is ruined.

 I still talk to my closest three friends from home, but texting is unfulfilling. It's depressing hearing about how they have real sustainable social lives. I feel like every morning I wake up and make a conscious decision not to move back to my home state and see them and live with people that I know care about me. That feels like giving up. I genuinely thought after college I would be fine. But every day feels more and more hopeless. I've had only depressing experiences dating, and making friends after college seems like a near sisyphean task. I cry myself to sleep every night. I feel totally defeated. I feel like I cannot share my life with anyone. I feel torn between to geographical locations. I miss how happy I used to be. I hate how hard it is to meet people my age. I hate pretending I'm fine when people ask. I hate doing everything alone. And I hate getting used to, and getting good at being alone.

I don't know what I'm asking for. This is the first time I'm putting these thoughts I've had for months into words.",11Dec2018,1

615,"About a year ago my grandmother's health declined and it seemed like she didn't have much time left. I've always loved my grandmother and was saddened by (what seemed like) the end; but I made my peace with it. But the doctors were able to turn her health around.

In order to keep her health up my family tried to get some help from the hospital, but the first day that someone visited her my grandmother began throwing stuff at them and eventually had to be carried away. This made the hospitality people not want to return (can't blame them) so my father has had to take over doling out my grandmother's medications every 3 days, because any more and she'll take a full week's worth of medication in 2-3 days. 

I have always been the computer guy in my family and have been fixing my grandmother's tablet for years, but recently she has been contacting me every few days claiming something new on her tablet is broken and I need to fix it. Because of the commute, this takes a significant amount of my time and the only thing that keeps me going back is that I love her and want her to be happy.

But I can't help but feel like I wish she would have died a year ago, since then she has almost completely stopped leaving her house and has become a burden to everyone who is helping her (I've left out my cousin and uncle handling her finances and canceling the new credit cards she orders because she keeps giving her info to phone scammers). I feel like an awful person, but I can't ever imagine myself getting to the point where she is now; I would rather die. And all this scares me because I know some day my parents will begin to lose their minds and require my help, and I don't know how I'll manage. 

If I don't visit my grandmother every few days she will call and message me, which will include her guilt tripping me by talking about how she doesn't get out anymore and needs me. With her constantly taking my time I've barely been able to keep relations with my friends and haven't had much time to have or try for a romantic life. All this is mostly because I work night shift and can't keep a normal daylight sleep schedule, but I don't want to leave my job just because my grandmother needs me to explain that her headphone jack does not mean her ipad is broken every week. But with my current schedule she takes all my daylight on one of my days off every week.

She broke up with her boyfriend of 2 years in September, had a ‘one night stand’ in October, got pregnant and is now planning their wedding in December. He’s an army lad, and she says if they get married she’s entitled to a big house and she won’t have to struggle for money or even work anymore.

Maybe even the only one) dreams I have just didn’t happen for me and it was my fault. I’m currently taking independent lessons for Japanese but it extremely slow.

625,"This isn’t my call for advice, but a friend. Told from her perspective. 

Begin story:

So I currently live in a 6-person suite on my college campus with 5 other girls. I like 4/5 of them, and I desire to maintain a relationship with them throughout this year and the next. We have options so we can live together next year, on campus. However, all of it options are limited to four people, two bedrooms where we double up. 

I like all of them and wouldn’t have a problem living with them either, except for one. I like her but she isn’t clean, and doesn’t have nice living standards. I’d be okay with not inviting her to live with us, but still talking to her through other means. 

The problem arises when her mom is very high up in a company that is relevant to my major. I’m good friends with her and I talked to her mom and she had agreed to help me get an internship at that company. She is in the process of doing so. I am *terrified* that if I don’t ask her to live with me/is, she’ll tell her mom and subsequently rescind my application and blacklist me. I know this is almost guaranteed because both her and her mom are very close with each other and extremely petty and spiteful. 

So my options are to either drop her for the four person housing and risk losing a very good job opportunity, or I can just bite the bullet and live with her next year. The only problem with that, however, is nobody else wants to live with her, I’m the only one who wants to live with her, but I don’t wanna *room* with her. I’d much rather make someone else live in the same room as her, I can handle the same apartment.

630,"This is going to sound weird but I think my teacher might be into me (hes 37 and married)... I'm in grade 12 and I get along with a teacher at my school. He was one of my high school track coaches but not a class teacher of mine. Anyway, last year we got to know each other better and developed a nice rapport and I noticed he would favor me over other students, always come talk to me, and just sorta treat me differently. Also noticed him staring at my boobs once but I blew that off as him being a dude but then this year things changed a little imo. I dont have him as classroom teacher but when he found out that I had class with another teacher (his bff in real life) he keeps coming by to talk to me and say hi everyday... which I thought was weird.  I think he knows its a little weird because when he comes by and I dont notice that he is there... he will like whisper my name to get my attention and wave hi (why would he be whispering if it was normal?) Idk...maybe im crazy. Maybe its just because its usually the student who does it? ...not the teacher?

TL;DR My teacher might be into me. He leaves his class right in the middle of it to come talk to me and say hi. He treats me very differently than other students. He's a nice guy (I dont think he would ever go there) but I think might have developed little more than friendly feelings and isnt thinking straight.",11Dec2018,1
631,"Hi. I’m currently homebound. I’m afraid of people. That being said I have no friends, very distant with my parents. I met someone online, have been messaging for like 2 or so weeks now. They recognize my issues. We can meet if or when I am ready. That’s all fine and well. My family on the other hand... they “feel bad” I don’t have any friends, but I can’t meet people from online. I mean I can, but it’ll be ugly. My mom just wants me to start applying at all these highly populated places (Walmart for example) like yesterday and have my coworkers be my bffs. My future spouse will be there, too. I think it would be good if I met this person I’ve be talking to because exposure therapy, but I don’t really know how to bring it up? I am epileptic, I can’t just get in my car and drive and meet them somewhere. They need to pick me up, or my mom needs to drop me off. I just don’t know. Is it a bad idea to meet them at all? Should I grow a pair, speak to my family, and try to meet somewhere local?

632,"I have been living in my apartment for about 6 months now (my lease is 12 months) and my upstairs neighbours have become irritating over the last couple months. They are very loud walkers especially late at night. I have trouble sleeping and even wearing earplugs I can still hear their walking. I found out after a moved in that the building is wood structure which would have been nice to know because I probably would have lived somewhere different. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sent in a complaint to management about the loud walking at night and they talked to them and they apologized and said that they would keep quiet at night. It got a little better for a bit but that didn't last long. Another thing I should mention is that I work during the day and my roommate is usually home and she said that they yell and argue about every second day in late afternoon. A couple months ago I came home from work around 6 and they were yelling at each for about an hour and a half and so I got fed up and decided to stay with some family members that night because I wanted to make sure I had a good sleep and I have anxiety and yelling makes me feel very anxious. I got a text from my roommate a couple hours after I left and she said that she phoned the police on them because there was so much yelling for so long and she was screaming like she was in distress and the man wouldn't do anything and they kept yelling. The police mentioned that someone else in the building had phoned as well. The police took quite a while to get there and by the time they did the yelling had stopped. Anyways two days later I decided to not stay at the apartment again because I was anxious about it and my roommate said that they were yelling and screaming through most of the night. We told management about the whole police situation and so that is complaint #2, if they get another they are evicted. After all this it stopped and so I thought maybe one of them left or something. Last night there was yelling again but not loud enough for me to take action. I was just starting to get comfortable there and then that happened last night so I am back to where I was a couple months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice on what to do. I am so anxious there all the time and do not want to be around there at all. I barely spend time there and so it is almost a waste of my money to be there. I have epilepsy as well so sleep is very essential to prevent seizures. The problem with my rental company that I rent through is that it is really difficult to put in that last complaint to get them evicted. I just know that I am not gonna be comfortable there until I know they are gone. Any suggestions? Thanks! ",11Dec2018,1
633,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with another girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing/giggling . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting and one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and pressed her lips together in a polite/pleasant way and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whispered excitedly to her friend the brunette girl 'eh that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table nearby  (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and it went quiet and then it went like:

Brunette: “excuse  me...excuse me” 

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here?” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) i walked over t their table and I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well just by sight and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me. She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went quiet again: 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously and politely) 

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it really pleasantly )

Me: ***ignored her because I didn’t know what to think of it***

Blonde: *watching the whole thing and after a pause between anyone talking again*  “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has” (probably has a gf) (she said it out loud while looking over at me like as if she made sure I heard her idk)

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” (Pleasantly in a wanted to know way)

Me: *ignored again wiping the table looking annoyed because I didn’t know how else to act*

Blonde: laughs a bit  and says ‘aww leave it, he’s fuming now’ laughing a bit (I wasn’t fuming it was the coffee stain on the table I was wiping was not coming out lol) 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk walking out with her hand on her head and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me and went out of her way a little to say ‘byyyeee’ loudly smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

637,"I met a guy in an app 5 months ago, we identified a lot, we had a lot in common. At the first meeting he said he didn't know how he never met me before, and that he was so lucky to meet me and that he wanted to introduce me to his mother on the second date, but warned me that she never like any of his girlfriends. 
At the second date, he introduced me to her, and apparently she liked me, so all his friends, and it was amazing. So he said he'd like to meet my family, and we started dating after one week we met, and he said he loved me. I thought it was kind of weird, but I didn't want to be hesitant, so I let things happen. 
The first two weeks were absolutely perfect, he said lovely things to me all day, he was very attentive, we went to shows and we did some really nice things. After that, apparently his mother started bothering about our courtship, and he started to stop dating me, and started go out with her or his gay friend, saying it was to make his mom ""calmer."" 
So they started going to the movies together, to shows, trips, restaurants, and I stayed at home. I started to get annoyed with this situation, because he apparently didn't mind, he said he was doing ""everything"" to improve the situation, but I realized that wasn't true. 
So we started to fight a lot about it, I started to get down and anxious, he proposed ""pretend we broke up for his mother"" and I didn't agree, so he broke up with me after almost 2 months of dating, close to my birthday. 
I agreed to the ending, and hea asked to continue the friendship. At first I hesitated, but since I was very fond of talking to him, and he was my best friend, I accepted. But he continued to treat me like I was still his girlfriend, talking to me every day, saying that he loved me, but he didn't want to come back, not even meet me for a  coffee as friends. 
He always wanted to know everything about my life, and it started to bother me. I shared all my problems with him, he was always a good listener and a good friend, but I often felt that it was bothering him. I started to feel very sad, because he kept talking about the places that went out with his mother or his gay friend to me, while I stayed at home regretting that I was no longer with him. 
I was waiting at any moment for him to come and tell me that he found someone else. I got worn out, depressed, anxious, and I said we'd better not talk to each other anymore. He agreed and sent me a text saying that I needed professional help and that he wasn't a psychologist to help me. I found it very rude, and said that I never forced him to help me, that for him it was very easy to move on after everything he did, but not for me. 
And I told him not to call me any more, and never do that to anyone else, and I blocked him. So he blocked me too. We have not spoken since.

638,"I posted this in r/moraldilemmas but I only got 2 opinions. Hoping I might get a few more here for me to consider. 

I had a situation unfold yesterday that I wanted to get different opinions on/get discussions going. Apologies for the long text. Just wanting to make the situation clear to get good opinions on.

I was dropping off my girlfriend at her apartment building and there is a bay that you pull into in front of the main entrance. The space is not that big but it’s wide enough to comfortably fit a car and still have plenty of space for people to stand in front of the entrance.

I was pulling in to drop her off as I usually do and there were 3 white guys there standing around the front door and taking up a lot of room in the bay. I wasn’t going fast (as you can’t because you need to turn) and they saw me coming for about 5 seconds. I drove past them, quite close to one of them, and then pulled up. I immediately saw they were staring at my car with “you endangered his life” looks. I honestly don’t think I was even close to him, but cannot say 100%. Either way, he did not get hit.

After saying goodbye to my girlfriend for about 10 seconds in the car, they were still standing around talking loudly about what had happened. As my girlfriend opened the car door, I could hear them saying “oh yes she’s Asian” and it was at this point I could tell they were gay by the tone of their voices. Immediately I could tell that they were stereotyping me as a bad Asian driver, because they perceived I had nearly hit that guy.

Admittedly I was kinda tired, but not in any insane mindset. But as soon as I heard that, I snapped and got out to confront them, purely because they were talking crap behind my back. He also said it loud enough as if he wanted us to hear it but was doing it from afar.

As I went up to the 3, I asked them to “say that again to my face”. It was here that I could smell a lot of alcohol in their breath. It went on for a little bit and they were just telling me that I was being aggressive and I was saying, don’t imply racist things like that behind my back, man up and say it to my face.

Eventually it got to the point where one of them shoved me for no apparent reason. We were close but I wouldn’t say I was invading personal space. I started to tell him “don’t lay your hands on me unless you want to start something”. This went on for a bit again until they started to go inside and I kept saying “come outside and be a man if you want to act like that”. The same guy shoved me again and his two friends got him and pushed him into the elevator. One of the other guys then yelled “you’re a cocksucker” to me and I replied “pretty ironic you gay f\*\*k since you’re gonna suck their cocks tonight”. It ended and I went off after making sure my girlfriend got in a separate elevator.

Now, I want to make it clear that I don’t have anything against the LGBTQ community and I am a very tolerant or open-minded person. I thought it was necessary information for you to understand the level of the situation and for you to understand that I didn’t confront them only because they sounded gay. This was not a situation where I was being homophobic. My purpose for confronting them was that I wanted to let them know that it wasn't ok for them to make these types of comments and think they could get away with it.

From my point of view, no one got hit initially, so they could have just gone inside and let it go. Instead, they stood around for 10 seconds and then when my girlfriend opened the door, made a “racist” insinuation. It feels like borderline bullying by them and you should stand up to bullies to ensure they don't repeat the behaviour going forward.

I could have ignored this and driven off, but I didn’t. Admittedly I was quite aggressive towards them but I was standing up to them because they were making jokes about Asians, which is still fairly common in New Zealand, despite it being a very multicultural country. I made no suggestion during any of this that I was going to get violent with them, even after their physical contact with me. I would say it was more pseudo-violence from my end by confronting them angrily.

I'm in a weird spot where I did something bad, but don't necessarily feel bad about it. I feel good that I stood up for myself rather than let it slide as I have in the past (underhanded comments or comments with racial undertones have been something I've experienced a lot in the past).

My main purposes for posting this are, I want to get outside opinions on this matter, I want closure on the issue so that I don't obsess over it and I want to think about my future conduct facing a similar situation.

639,"So I've had a crush on a kid named Charlie. I've liked him since 2015 (about 3 years) and a lot has happened since then. I think at one point or another he may have OR MAY HAVE NOT, started to have a small crush on me as well. He started to talk to me a lot, and we began to get closer. Then I did a few creepy things (not going to name) and he stopped talking to me. So 2 years pass (now 2018) and I make a new friend at school, Isabella. I knew her prior to the year, (2017) but we weren't very close. We were just mutuals from another friend we both so happened to have. After gaining a common interest we got to know each other better, and since we have been inseparable, I treat her like a sister (I also call her sister). We do absolutely everything together if we get a chance, we sit next to each other in class, eat together at lunch, go to the bathroom to gossip, etc. Eventually we get to the subject about boys, and I tell her about my crush, Charlie. She tells me she has a few classes with him, and will try to talk to him a bit for me. So they talk and stuff and each day she tells me all about what they talked about, and how he bothered the crap out of her. In the beginning it was just ""Oh, he was listening to baby shark, it was sOoO annoying"", then it turned into ""He asked me to call him daddy today!"". I don't think she is purposely flirting with him, but ITS HAPPENING. Whenever were at lunch together he'll pass by and say something sweet, or give her a heart with his fingers. They talk in the halls, and he gives her a certain smile that he doesn't do for just anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the problem. 1, I like him quite a lot, so when he's flirting with her in front of me and Isabella says ""Omg did you see that?!?"" I have to fake smile and act like I'm not jealous. 2, if he were to tell her ""I like you"", I'm afraid Isabella will say yes, and betray me as a friend. But I'm also afraid she'll say ""I'm sorry no, Emily likes you too much, and I couldn't do that to her"". The reason I'm afraid of that is because I don't want to break Charlie's heart, and at the end of the day I want him to be happy. I want Charlie to be happy, but I still want Isabella to be my one and only friend forever/sister.

640,My teacher was really mean to me and called me the worst names possible. He also hacked me and I don’t have any proof of that besides his word; or proof of either of those things.

641,"If there were type 'A' people and type 'B' people, my sister would be type 'A' and I'd be type 'B'. We're very, very different. We share common interests thanks to our parents raising us on Star Trek, and old TV shows like Magnum P.I, The Incredible Hulk, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and so on. Other than enjoying similar media, we have nothing in common. Our senses of humor are polar opposite, our sense of fashion is wildly different, our creative outlets, emotional expressions, taste in music, food preferences, ideals, political views, all of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say out of the two of us, my sister got the shorter end of the stick. She could never nail down what she wanted as a child, skipping around from ballet, to piano, to crafting, to horses, to cooking, and so on. My parents got fed up with her calling it quits on so many groups, classes, and clubs, that they all but stopped taking her out and letting her explore her interests. Me on the other hand, I played sports, stuck it out the whole season, even if I sucked, and managed to be good at like, one of them. When I was older I took on speech &amp; debate, and writing. I stuck to that as well all through high school. My parents saw her as flighty and unreliable, and to be fair, she was. As we became adults, the trend continued. My parents weren't well off, but could afford to put a kid through college. Singular. My sister was older, so she got dibs. She bounced around from major to major, never settling on one, and eventually dropped out halfway through her senior year in a lot of debt that her and my parents (but mostly my parents) are still paying off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, by this time, the spats between her and I became legendary. She was the aggressor, and I was the desperate one. She would hit me when our parents weren't home, which would cause me to retaliate in craftier and often cruel fashions when they were. She would tell me lies about our parents, and leave me in agony for days before I told our parents and they set the records straight. She once lied to my father about something I did, and he kicked me out of the house for a day. I went to my mother, sides were taken, it wasn't good. We eventually went to family therapy, and things got better for a time. 

&amp;#x200B;

During childhood, we didn't play together. We barely spoke to each other. My sister stayed in her room, and without a play mate, I did too. This became the norm throughout our teenage years. My sister and I in our rooms, and my parents in the family room, being each other's family. When we were in school together, my sister told her friends that she was an only child, and wouldn't talk to me in the halls, even when I would go up to her and tug on her sleeve, she ignored me. 

My sister and I were both bullied in school. She was verbally abused by some really nasty young women, and had panic attacks in school often. I was beaten physically, once to the point where my teacher saw my bruises, cuts, and scrapes, and wept, begging the other boys in the class to stop hurting me. We both came home with stories of bullying woes, but my parents focused on mine because I was in physical danger. They regret not paying more attention to my sister's stories in hindsight. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously my parents tried many different ways to get us to become friends, none of which worked. I was more than eager to make friends with her, but she refused. Later in life I found out that I wasn't the only one who felt the cold shoulder. My mom and dad both told me that my sister showed them nothing by way of affection, love, or admiration. She told my dad that he worked too much and didn't care about the family. She told my mom that she was a blind fool who needed too much validation. My mother and father are amazing people, and never did anything to her that warranted those words. My father worked so hard because he wanted his wife and kids to live comfortably. My mother suffered terrible things as a young woman, and overcame a lot to be the loving mother bear I grew up with.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm making her out to be a monster, and I don't really mean to. My sister is a kind, happy, talented, caring person. Just not with me. Never with me. My parents know this, and feel now that they gave it their best shot to get us to be good siblings when we were kids, but now we're adults, and they want us to take care of it. I've extended more than a few olive branches in our adult years, and all of them have been turned away. The straw that broke my back was when she didn't come to my wedding. My wife was especially disheartened, as she saw it as my sister not approving of her as my wife. I've assured her that that's not the case. My sister didn't even look her in the eyes when I first introduced her to my family as my girlfriend a few years back. They've barely said two words since, even though my wife has reached out in the nicest ways. My mother took my wife aside after the wedding reception and told her ""You want to know how many times my daughter has told me that she loves me? Four. Four times. You want to know how many times my daughter has let me hug her since she was a toddler? Twice. You and I have only been related for a few hours, and You've said 'I love you' and hugged me more than my daughter has in twenty-six years."" My wife and my mother sat in a bathroom and cried together; because of my sister. Just a super-duper way to kick off a marriage. When my mom asked my sister why she didn't attend, she said ""I didn't want to go."" That was that. 

&amp;#x200B;

When my wife and I were dating, I saw her and her sister taking pictures together. They were posing in goofy ways, making fun of each other, and at the end of it, they said they loved each other. I walked into her family's garage and cried for a long time. I wanted what she had with her siblings so much, and I never even got to know how much I missed it. Her and her brother still wrestle together, cook together, play board games together, and sometimes it rips my heart to shreds to watch it. I admire what they have, and I love my brother in law and sister in law dearly, but their bond with my wife has always been bittersweet to me, and I feel guilty for feeling that. 

Which brings me to my point. Now that I'm married, my in laws are commanding more and more of my time because they are all so close and spend so much time together. I love it, but I feel like if I don't do something, I might lose my sister for good. I know my mom and dad will always be there, and I visit them once every couple of months now, but I can't bear to lose my sister. She was a stone cold bitch to me, and not in a cool way, for so many years, but she's still my family. My blood. I'm at a loss as to what to do and how to do it, but I know I need to do it soon. I'm afraid it might already be too late. So, what do you guys think I should do?

642,"Met this guy about 6 weeks ago and it’s crazy how similar our personalities and senses of humor are. One of us usually says what the other one is thinking without even realizing it and we tell each other stories from the past only to realize that the other person either has or would have done the same thing! It’s great and we’re vibing really well.
Although we have so much in common, we also have a lot of separate interests. We’re both analytical with a mind for numbers as I’m in business and he’s an engineer, but he’s very into electronics and cars while I gravitate to more creative things like photography and art. Regardless of that, I guess you could say we’re in that awkward “talking” phase that often happens before people decide to date. A few days ago I made it pretty clear that I wanted to date and he essentially agreed but hinted that he was waiting for a special occasion to ask me (so sweet!).

Anyway, things have been going really great and I feel like our relationship is a good mix of lighthearted fun and deep, important conversations. Once he asked me about my goals in life and seemed impressed when I pulled up a graphic on my phone that I designed (I work in digital marketing) to list all of my goals and have as a reminder. (The last few years have been tough for me and shortly before we met, I began making a more conscious effort to focus on what I want in life.)

One of my goals is to share my witting with the world. This goal seemed to catch his eye and he asked me more about it. I explained that I wrote everything from political and opinion articles to short stories and that I’m working on what might turn into a book and that at some point in my life I really want to get something (anything) published. He seemed to think that was really cool and even asked if I had anything he could read. I told him yes but neither of us really ever brought it up again.

Fast forward 3-4 weeks to yesterday when I found out I was getting an article published (I’M FREAKING STOKED) and he was the first person I wanted to tell! We were both at work when I got the news but he sent me a snapchat on his lunch and I replied with details about my exciting morning. He sent back an excited face but no words and then I didn’t really hear from him until we were both home. I told him how excited I was to which he responded confused as he forgot what we were talking about so I reminded him and he kind of dismissed it and changed the subject to letting me know he needed to travel for work the next day, changing our plans for hanging out the next night. When I went over to see him that night instead, I asked about his day and listened to what he shared and then he just turned on a movie and didn’t really make any other conversation. I worked in one more time how damn excited I am and he definitely didn’t make as big of a deal about it as I had hoped. He kind of said it was cool and mostly kept his attention on the TV. I was so disappointed that I wanted to leave. I just kind of sat there and thought about whether or not to do something. I think he noticed that the comedy wasn’t eliciting any laughter from me and after about an hour, he paused it at a lighthearted part and made a comment about the plot that lead to a lot of enjoyable conversation that took my mind off my disappointment. We can talk for days and not get bored and I really enjoy spending time with him but I can’t help worrying that my interests are never going to be as important to him as I’d like them to be. I may be reading way to far into this but I don’t want to start a relationship if this is a red flag. I truly care about him and enjoy being around him and he always says the same things but I am uneasy because I’ve genuinely taken much more interest in cars and video games than I ever would have had he not been in my life so it feels like he should want to be excited and talk about my achievements. The article is about a somewhat controversial issue that we’ve joked about previously and are definitely on the same page with so I thought that at least that would get him talking but he didn’t.

644,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with another girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing/giggling . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting and one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and pressed her lips together in a polite/pleasant way and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whispered excitedly to her friend the brunette girl 'eh that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table nearby (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and it went quiet and then it went like:
Brunette: “excuse me...excuse me”
Me: stops to look over
Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here?”
Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”
Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) i walked over t their table and I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well just by sight and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me. She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went quiet again:
Brunette: “excuse me”
Me: looked over
Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously and politely)
Me: “yeah”
Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it really pleasantly )
Me: ignored her because I didn’t know what to think of it
Blonde: watching the whole thing and after a pause between anyone talking again “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has” (probably has a gf) (she said it out loud while looking over at me like as if she made sure I heard her idk)
Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” (Pleasantly in a wanted to know way)
Me: ignored again wiping the table looking annoyed because I didn’t know how else to act
Blonde: laughs a bit and says ‘aww leave it, he’s fuming now’ laughing a bit (I wasn’t fuming it was the coffee stain on the table I was wiping was not coming out lol)
. On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk walking out with her hand on her head and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me and went out of her way a little to say ‘byyyeee’ loudly smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk gi",11Dec2018,1
645,"Sorry this is long. I suck at summarizing. 

I just started working as an admin assistant at a university. It's been 2 months. The work I'm doing doesn't interest me at all, I have a lot of down time, etc. It's also far from my house and I don't have a license, so I carpool with a friend. This results in 2 hours of waiting for carpool time and me having almost no time to unwind after dinner/making lunch/dishes/etc. 

I've only been here 2 months. I've been adjusting more and more to accepting this is what working feels like. 

But i checked job postings for the same university. A new job opened. An academic advisor. It's next to my house. I could walk to work and home for lunch! No more wasted time. It pays a bit better too. More time for myself, more money for my loans. 

I think I have a strong chance of getting it. I did 3+ years of student support and recruitment, the experience the job listing lists. The only thing is that I don't have a license, but it doesn't say I need one? I got the admin job which probably involves a lot more commuting (granted they didn't know i was licenseless but not my problem)

The one thing holding me back from applying ks my current position. Its the same university so I'm sure my current boss would find out I applied to a different job. I don't want to have this hurt me if I end up staying where I'm at. Do I talk to her and indicate my interest in applying and get her blessing first? Do i go for it? Should I just stay put?

Some things to mention, I think I'm technically on a year probation since I'm new, but have no clue what that means. I also get evaluated in increments, and even though the first one isn't for a month I'm fairly certain the work I've done so far has exceeded all expectations. 

What would you advice me to do?",11Dec2018,1
647,"While it is not certain, I am pretty sure I am disqualified from joining the military due to a childhood injury.

I was crazy about joining the military for many reasons. The main one being that i’d have a few years to decide what I want to do with myself while also learning skills, networking, and making money.

I already have all my basic classes from college completed but I don’t want to continue because well I don’t really know what I want to do, and I cannot afford it.

Not really depressed or upset I just feel so emotionless at the thought that I have no idea how to continue my life or how to get out of my hometown.

648,"My original post on here from about a week ago: “This is going to be... confusing to say the least. I(17M) and my best friend (17F) have been best friends since our sophomore year of high school. She has been dating a guy since the second semester of that year, but recently that had a fight and it was believed that they broke up. So over Thanksgiving break, I decided to ask her out and she said yes. I was overjoyed, so when we got back to school I had quite a shock. They were still together. Before you guys say “maybe she thought of it as a friend thing” no, she and I both said we had feelings for each other. So I’m thoroughly worried out by this, but I thought I’d just let what happens happen. So she eventually tells her bf that we were going out on a date... and he was fine with it. So we go out and have a lot of fun, and we eventually confess how we both feel about each other and we honestly both kinda cried because we finally got it out. The next day, she asked me to hang out again, and I said sure. So after hanging out for a while, she vents to me about her boyfriend. She says that he isn’t the guy she fell in love with, and that she doesn’t know how much longer they will be together. After about 20 minutes of letting it kinda cool off, I asked her this. “So... if you and (bf) do eventually break up... would you want to go out with me?” To which she replies yes, absolutely. I just... I don’t know how to handle this. I feel like an asshole, but simultaneously I feel incredibly overjoyed that she feels the same about me.” 

So after that, I took the advice I was given and asked her if she was using me. I’m incredibly self-doubting, so I made sure it didn’t sound like I was blaming her for anything. However, she said she got so upset that I thought that that she threw her pillow and almost broke her TV. She said she “needed time to get over it”. Fast forward to now, over a week later, and she still tries to dodge talking to me. Whenever I try to text her, I’ll get a response like this : “Hey, she’s got some family stuff going on and she doesn’t want to talk to anyone right now.” Then, when I try to talk to her in person, she seems disinterested and it’s like she tries to avoid me. What the fuck do I have to do to get her to talk to me? Why is she avoiding me? What the hell?",11Dec2018,1

650,"Hey guys, I’m kind of at the end of my rope right now. I don’t know what to do..

Currently I have my 15yr old brother staying at my house with no where to go. Originally I was just suppose to be a means of transportation from his abusive fathers house to a woman who was said to have “partial custody” of him. 

Now I have had him for 4 days and although the woman told me she is trying to figure something out, I’m being told that she has already decided she won’t take him by our sister. I don’t know what happened for them to get mad at him in the first place. I really can’t take care of him myself and now I don’t really see any other option.

Going back to his father’s is obviously not an option..

Is there anyone I can go to for help? Our family isn’t really an option unfortunately. Is there any other ideas or options anyone has? 

Thanks in advance.  ",11Dec2018,1
651,"I was impulsive and I regret it. I'm okay now, but I realize that time moves forward, and my papers are still overdue. It's been a few days since the deadline and their grading policy is usually -1 letter grade each day late. 

I know it's my own fault, so I'm not looking for sympathy, but I don't want to fail. I'm not great at communication. Is there a way to get out of this situation still passing my classes?

652,"My brother has really bad anger issues. He’s a spoiled brat because of my mom and so when he comes back to my dad who can’t afford to buy all the things my mom can, be throws a temper tantrum. I used to have horrible anger issues but after years of therapy I got better, and that’s what I think my brother needs. He’s an 11 year old kid acting like a 2 year old. Every time I try to talk at ALL he just screams “shut up” and continues to throw tantrums. He’s always so energetic so when he comes to our shitty apartment with thin as paper walls and runs around to toss the football and make a ruckus I want to slap him to make him be quiet. It’s a god damn miracle we haven’t been evicted yet. I want him in therapy so he’ll stop being such a bitch who throws temper tantrums because he didn’t get an Xbox gift card. 


TL;DR My brother is spoiled and makes a ruckus and has anger issues and my parents aren’t doing anything. I want him in therapy but I can’t force him there. How can I deal with such an annoyance without pulling out my hair?",11Dec2018,1

I lost a good pair of headphones, a vape, and my chain recently, and I know I left the chain and I think the vape at my friend's house. We regularly hang out and they said that their other friend that I don't know took the vape. I don't really feel like they like me, but they're my only friends. What should I do??? I know they took them but I can't possibly imagine giving up our friendship.",11Dec2018,1
