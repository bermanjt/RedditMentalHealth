0,"I have a close friend, it's obvious that he has feelings for me and wants to be in a relationship but I like someone else and don't want to be rude.

&amp;#x200B;

He waits for me everyday at my bus stop no matter what the weather's like or if he has to wait 3 hours for me to leave after-school and he doesn't even live near me.

People of Reddit, how do I let this friend know that I don't like him and don't want him walking me home every day of the month without being rude?",20Sep2018,1

2,"i am 18 years old and a freshman in college and my parents still treat me like i am 14. they do not let me go out or like be outside of my dorm past 9pm and they also track my location which is so irritating because it’s not even just for them to know i’m safe, it’s for them to be able to control me and tell me what to do and where to go and when to do it. i would understand them acting like this if i was a bad kid or if i was in like 8th grade but i’m literally 18 years old and don’t get any of the freedoms a regular 18 year old has. so anyways because they’re so strict about everything i put my location tracker on my old phone and leave it in my dorm when i go out and stuff so they think i never left the dorm. there’s been a few close calls where they have called me and i was somewhere i was not supposed to be but other than that this method works pretty well except i feel guilty all the time for lying but i cannot just sit in my dorm and miss out on the entire college experience because my parents want to treat me like i’m 12 years old. am i a bad person for lying? like i understand lying isn’t good at all but there is absolutely no way in hell i can be honest w my parents like the options are either lie and have fun or actually just sit in my dorm while all my friends go out and have fun.",20Sep2018,1
3,"I have had a somewhat humiliating video of me that’d hurt my reputation posted by my (now ex) “best friend” on his WhatsApp story and I have his Facebook profile and just basically all the power to humiliate him and completely destroy his life. He kept teasing me and telling that i’m a faggot who needs to kill himself, that my dad left me to starve and just really mopped the floor with me. I told him that I hope he’s just joking and trying to pull some kind of prank on me but he kept telling me that our friendship is done because of how much of a faggot I am, that I can’t do anything to hurt him, that he’d beat me up, etc...

I’m really trying not to do anything because my heart just doesn’t let me even if he has completely destroyed my social life. He blocked me now and it’s 1:04AM and i have school tomorrow (where i’ll go to have other people talk about the video and bully me), I just wanna know what’s the most logical and right thing to do, please try to explain why your advice is the best.",20Sep2018,1
4,"Going to try to keep this short. 

Back story: My step brother has been addicted to several drugs for roughly twenty years of his life, the worst being methamphetamines. He has been in and out of inpatient and outpatient programs for just as long. He has relapsed several times. More than I can count on both hands. He has lived with several people including ex girlfriends, his brother, friends, and my parents. 
He also screwed all of those people over by either destroying property, stealing personal items or straight up taking money from them. He also has two kids which he hasn't seen for years.

Anyway,

He relapsed about a month ago and moved away (3 hours away) to a friend's house to get clean. He ended up destroying a brand new mattress, breaking a tablet, taking gas out of the lawnmower for his car, and also stealing money from his buddies piggy bank. Long story short my step brother is a piece of shit, but I still love him. We've had great, intelligent conversations. He is actually very smart. BUT he can't seem to get out of this hole. No matter how hard he tries. No one in my family knows what to do now, we feel like we've tried everything. 

I appreciate any help you have to offer.
Thanks.",20Sep2018,1

Today he sent me a text mentioning he has friends that are successful and asked if I want to meet them aswell.

But she's not one of those people who does it for attention. When people point out when she says negative things about herself, she assures that everything she says about herself is true and wants to change the subject immediately, but is completely calm about it. She constantly harms herself by scratching and cutting at herself. But it seems like to her its just an everyday mundane thing, like taking out the trash or brushing your teeth in the morning. She's only eighteen and has seemingly given up on herself long ago and refuses to change. She says she doesn't love herself, she refuses to, and it seems like she's okay with it.

14,"I’ve literally had to ask my mom to let me be a grown up. I’m in my mid 30s but am still slightly dependent on my parents after allowing an ex to destroy me financially. So I do appreciate their help. 
My dad stays out of it unless he sees something drastically wrong. That’s happened twice because of my ex.
But I’ve asked my mom to not be at my house all the time telling me what’s wrong with my house, my parenting and me in general.
She thinks I’m trying to keep her away from her grandchild. I’ve told her that’s not the case but that I am the parent and want to raise my own child. I asked her if her mom was around all the time telling her how to raise me. (My grandparents would visit a few times a year but were not there to help raise me). She said no because my grandma knew my mom was doing everything she was supposed to. 
She said to me once a few years ago that she was proud of me for doing so well so far as she wasn’t really sure I’d be a good parent. 
Comforting. Thanks Mom.
So, is there a better way to tell my mom to butt out? My child loves my parents. I love that they all get along really well. I would never try to stop any of them from seeing each other. I just don’t want my mom raising my child. That’s what I’m here for, right? 
We do just fine when she stays out of our daily routine (which she says we don’t even have). When she’s here all the time we are rushed and she tries to do everything for me, then uses that as a way to guilt me. “Well, I did your dishes/made school lunch/folded your laundry/etc and you act like I’m the bad guy. I know you think I’m stupid!”
I’ve never nor WOULD I ever say that! I appreciate her help, though I’ve rarely, if ever, asked for it.
I’ve told her if I need her help I promise I’ll ask. But I never get the opportunity. 
Is there a better way to ask her to let me “be a grown up” and raise my daughter without offending her so much?",20Sep2018,3
15,"This is half of an off my chest post, but I wanted to share here too. Let me start off by saying my day genuinely was a never ending convenience. 

I had no breakfast, I stained my jacket, my hat got dirty, I left my headphones at home, I had major anxiety at random parts of the day, I failed a quiz, my hair looked gross and SO ON. Not the worst thing in the world, I know worse can happen, but it was overall an irritating day for me.

My breaking point was when my dad (who has been divorced from my mom since I was a baby) called me on the phone and started shouting at me because I haven’t called him all week when we literally spoke 3 days ago. He said, “MilkAndJelly, you know I’m sick right? You wouldn’t know because you never call me.” It made me so upset that I actually talked back and told him I didn’t have time for this and hung up because he ALWAYS puts the blame on me!!! 

I am a full time college student who has been busy ALL WEEK with SCHOOL WORK, CLUB MEETINGS, CLUB DINNERS, ALSO HELPING MY MOM OUT WITH MY YOUNGER SIBLING WHILE SHE TAKES CARE OF MY STEPDAD WHO IS IN THE HOSPITAL. 

IT HAS BEEN SUCH A STRESSFUL WEEK AND MY DAD IS BLAMING ME FOR NOT CALLING WHEN IVE TOLD HIM MANY TIMES HOW BUSY COLLEGE IS. I UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED COLLEGE LIFE BUT TODAY HE REMINDED ME OF THE TIMES WHEN I WAS GROWING UP HOW EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE HE WAS.

-he would take 6-12 year old me with him to his drug dealer’s house to buy weed
-he would angrily scream at me (at 7 years old LITERALLY AT LIKE 7 AM WHEN IM NOT EVEN AWAKE YET) when I didn’t call him on his birthday once
-he had discreet sex with his then-girlfriend with me in the sheets with them watching tv 
-he would scream at me for explaining facts about a tv show he was watching while he watched it (I’m not even kidding you it was ZOEY 101)
-he would sneak on my phone and add my stepdad as a contact on his phone and scream at him behind my back
-he would get drunk A LOT 
-he would keep his pornography magazines/website bookmarks visible whenever I visited him, telling me to just avoid looking because it was only for adults
-he would watch Girls Gone Wild/porn in front of (8 year old me) thinking he was getting away with me not noticing
-bring me (5 years old) to bars with him

There are definitely more instances but it makes me so upset and sad that this is how I grew up (whenever I would visit him every 2 months as a kid). I’ve never told my mother about any of this and it seriously makes me tear just thinking that I had to go through with that because after writing that all out makes me understand how toxic he was. 

Growing up, I would ALWAYS be so anxious, not even realizing it was anxiety, and I think it’s all because of him. I just wish there was a way to reverse time, I know therapy would help, but what would you do if you were me right now?",20Sep2018,2
16,"Hey guys!

&amp;#x200B;

I was sitting in the library today and I got a text from my coworker. He asked me about my availability from now on. Mind you, we've been discussing this as a whole team for about two weeks now. Basically, I reiterated to him what I've been saying for the past two weeks. I can't work Thursdays. So he responded and sent me a long winded text that basically says they might not be able to keep me employed if I can't work Thursdays. I was obviously shocked so I asked him who was telling him all of this, and he said the manager and our district manager. I'm just slightly offended that they couldn't tell me this... Why would they have him tell me that? Our manager is new, and he doesn't exactly know what he's doing when it comes to certain things. But anyways... What do I do now? I can't change my schedule because I'm a transfer student, I have a scholarship that required me to fulfill a certain amount of credits AND community service, keep my GPA up, etc... I scheduled an appointment with my advisor tomorrow and I'm also going to try and speak to the lady who is charge of work-study at our school.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm very upset about this because I actually really like my job and my coworkers. My mom told me not to quit, and wait for them to get rid of me so I can collect unemployment. I'm not sure that will happen though because we follow a hired ""at-will"" policy. Also I don't know the ins and outs of unemployment, nor do I desire to be unemployed. :(

18,"I (28F) am the youngest of 4. My brothers O (42M) M (37M) and Y (30M) are all older than me, and I know my mom loves them more.

Back story:  I was bullied badly, both physically and mentally by M and Y when I was younger.  When I was 17, my parents decided to move 200 miles to another country, dragging me away from all of my friends, just because my mom wanted to.  My mom said either I move or I end up homeless.  Me, mom, dad, Y and Y's girlfriend moved too.  O and M stayed behind.  I had no choice.  A few years later, Y and his girlfriend decided to move back, as there were better opportunities for them.  Since the move, mom has gone on and on about how she wants to move back to be closer to her boys.  Dad doesn't want to move, and I have made a life here with my now husband.  Mom says she wishes she never moved here.

I am chronically ill, and have spent a lot of time in and out of hospital.  Y is also chronically ill and has spent a lot of time in and out of hospital.  I asked mom to drive 10 miles to pick me up and take me to a hospital appointment and she refused to do so.  No reason, she just didn't want to.  Y asked her to drive 200 miles to pick him up and take him to an appointment and she did just that, and stayed with him for a week.  She left me to care for my dying dad, even though I can barely care for myself at the moment.  She speaks to my brothers every day, and yet she won't reply to my messages for days.

I genuinely feel unloved and unwanted, and I can tell I'm the least favourite child.  I'm not expecting her to mother me, I am a grown woman.  But I still need my mom.  She only ever speaks to me when she wants something, and she gets all huffy if I refuse to care for my dad so she can go away.

Tonight, he told me he has a crush on me and now I'm kinda regretting lying to him because he said it doesn't matter if he has a crush on me because I'm seeing someone. I'm starting to regret lying.

This Monday he left me a voice mail in an obviously disturbed state, panicking/crying. I called him back to see what the problem was. He had told me his girlfriend of 5 years gave him Chlamydia. I had to hold my tongue untill I could really think it over and hear what he had to say. I guess her version of the story is as such, she smoked a little weed when she went back to California to visit family and she was ""taken advantage of"". This throws up a huge red flag in my mind. It sounds like she just got high and fucked some random guy, then brought the STD back to her BF, and the only reason he found out was because he contracted it. He is a very naive individual and I feel like he will justify her behavior just to prevent a conflict. I think he should get rid of the girl to be honest.

28," This guy in class kept looking at me and then when he passed by my desk he slipped his number to me. What I don't understand is why he didn't even say hi or talk to me at all during the exchange. He didn't even introduce himself so I don't know what his name is. I don't know him at all so I don't really feel comfortable texting him but if I don't I'm worried it will make things awkward in class around him.. Why didn't he just talk to me if he was going over to my desk to give me his number anyway?

He didn't say hi, tell me his name or ask for my name so it just feels weird and awkward. I don't want to start texting someone that I've never spoken to in person, and it's not as if he didn't have a chance to talk to me either because we've been in the same class for months. I haven't texted him yet because I don't know him at all and since he gave me his number he won't even look at me and he still hasn't tried to talk to me. I feel guilty for not texting him yet but I don't know him at all so I don't even know if I want to be friends with him. What are his intentions? I think he's a player but I don't know, should I just text him or talk to him in person first? 

It's pretty awkward being around him in class now, and I'm a shy person so I'm scared to just go up and start talking to him randomly especially when I haven't texted him yet. I think he hates me now or something because I overheard him in class telling his friends that I haven't texted him and how mad he is about it.

30,"So as the title says, my mother will always be kind to my brother [M16] while mocking and embarrasing me [M18] whenever she can. My brother also knows this well and has used this to make me feel like I can't do anything on my own while my mother doesnt bat an eye. If I dare stand up to myself when my brother tries this, my mother would come up and straight up shout the most hateful things to me. This behavior has made me develop a very weak self esteem over time. 

For example, I can do the slightiest mistake during the day and my Mother would just drag that across the day to make me feel miserable while her and my brother make me feel like nothing.

So far, I thought of my father as the only hope I have. He is a great man that's kind to the whole familly. I could try to talk to him about my mother but I cant see how I could bring it up without him telling me Im exageratting things. My brother takes caution and always acts kind when he's around. 

And if I stand up to my mother? She plays the victim to my father strengthening the idea that Im the bad guy in everthing. I dont want to keep living like this.

This has also caused my father and the rest of my family to not take me seriously whenever I talk. They now have the idea that Im an immature guy that will cause up a stir from time to time.

Not to long ago, I told my father everything about my brother and how I felt towards him. I just couldnt keep my anger inside anymore. I never mentioned my mother though. After this my brother has been controlling himself but has already started to start his normam behavior again.

So I just moved into a new house where there’s many many cats outside, although they all seem to have homes as they are not too skinny. talking to the old lady next door, I now know where most live. That said, there’s one cat that comes by that is obviously a stray. He is very friendly and I have taken to feeding and petting him nightly. I think he’s a stray at least as he’s so full of those plants that stick and become matted in the fur and just general matted fur. So if he has a home, it’s not very good. I’m very concerned about the poor cat in the coming winter. I’m located in northern Canada where it’s gets very cold.

He used to be so compassionate and caring like asking me how my day went or how I'm feeling or how work went etc etc. Now I'm lucky if I get a sentence out of him when I message him. And I'm always the one messaging him first. The only way he texts me first is if I don't say anything for 3-4 days, then he'll shoot me a ""Miss you"". And that's it. I'm also always the one making the plans for dates and whatnot. He used to always want me over at his place. Now I have to practically invite myself. .

To give some context, ever since summer 2017 when I would fly 2 times a week (sometimes more) for my summer job, it sparked an interest in aviation. It’s even gotten to the point where I’m preparing to get my FAA Part 107 license for my drone and possibly a private pilots license after I graduate. Something in particular I’m really interested in, as mentioned before, is ATC.

a few weeks ago, i found out i was shadowing a new student (they follow me around my classes for a day, i introduce them to teachers, etc.). i don’t have many friends to begin with, so i jump at the opportunity to meet someone new. she’s super nice, cool, and we’re really similar. she ends up coming to my school &amp; my friends instantly let her in like we’ve known her for years. she fits in perfectly. 

on monday, she admits to us that she already really likes someone @ the school. like, a lot. i’ve kinda been getting a feeling from her that she might not be straight (whether she knew it or not). i, of course, didn’t say this. she brought it up when another friend of mine suspected that she liked a guy in our grade. according to her, she’s a lesbian and has known it before she even knew there was a word for it. im not homophobic; no one i associate with is. (in fact, i’ve kinda been questioning my sexuality too. when she came out, i told her this. does she think im leading her on?) everyone starts guessing girls that she may have a massive crush on. i really didn’t believe that it could be me. 

its me. i shouldn’t know, and im pretending that i don’t. honestly, it’s not hard to pretend. she’s kinda flirting with me but just enough for me to notice. it’s cute actually lol

the thing is, as soon as i found out she was gay, i felt like i could like her romantically. before i even knew that she felt that way about me. the problem HERE is: i have a “boyfriend.” whatever that means as a young teenager. he knows about the gay girl liking me, but not about my confusing feelings.

honestly, i just don’t know how to move forward from here. i want to be the girls friend, but what if she kicks up the flirting a few notches? what do i do if i find myself actually catching feelings for her? i know questioning sexuality is normal for teens,  but this is really confusing.

[ TL;DR ] the new girl at my school likes me romantically. im trying to be her friend, though. im not supposed to know that she likes me. ive been questioning whether im lgbt for a while. i have a boyfriend and she knows. im finding myself having slight feelings for her, are they real? what do i do? does she think im leading her on? 

side note; with the increasing number of youths identifying as lgbtq+, i really just want to quickly state im not putting this out here for attention. it’s uncomfortable &amp; id rather not have to question anything at all. 💞

39,"I've been depressed my whole life and recently sought out counseling. I found a local practice through psychologytoday.com that seemed promising and booked an appointment. Over the course of about a week and a half I spoke with two counselors at this place, had numerous conversations about what specifically was bothering me, provided them with personal information including a credit card to keep on file, and booked an appointment at the address listed on their company website, facebook page, and google maps. 

I show up on the scheduled date 15 minutes early and wait for half and hour when I get a call from the counselor I was supposed to see wondering where I am and whether or not I'm coming. I tell her I'm already here at the adress they provided. She informs me they are no longer at that location. At no point during the week of phone calls did they bother to mention this. I get frustrated and hang up and leave a one star review on their google review profile (the only one they have). 

4 hours go by and I get a text from the main counselor who owns the practice apologizing and saying he saw the 1 star review I left begging me to delete it since it would destroy his small business and that helping people is his passion. I've been struggling pretty heavily lately so opening up to this guy on even a basic level the way I did was difficult, and it seems pretty obvious he was only trying to sucker me in for the money and that he really didnt give a shit at all.

He gave me this whole sob story in a long text saying that my bad review will jeopardize potential future patients of his that need his help, and that I'd be scaring them off. He's requesting I delete it. This struck me as incredibly self serving and manipulative. 

Should I just delete it and move on or tell him to fuck off? I feel like if he was genuinely concerned he'd have contacted me as soon as i got off the phone with his colleague, but it seems he just saw the bad review I left and went into panic mode.

41,"I am a 22F who graduated last december and immediately jumped into a convenient job near school. Although the job pays well, its not what or where I want. I am thinking about moving to the city and persuing a career in GIS. I took an introductory class in college and then worked as a TA for the same class for 2 semesters. I know mapinfo very well and am acquanted with arcgis. The class did touch on a lot of mapmaking skills (joining and appending datasets, writing reports,etc) I even have a portfolio to show to employers my work.

Applying for jobs is intimidating. A lot of jobs these days require atleast 1 to 3 years of prior experience. I took a class, but I majored in natural  resources, so that was the only GIS class I took. I do have some of the skills required, but I am lacking the confidence to go with it.

Things that she doesn’t tell anyone else. I want to take it further but I can’t tell if she sees me as a really good friend or if she’s into me too. I don’t want to just ask her out and get rejected because I don’t want to lose what I already have with her.

48,"Hi everyone, I am in a bit of a dilemma at the moment. I'm gonna make this short and to the point. So I am a freelancer. About 8 months ago, I was offered a contract with a company and I accepted. Problem is: I was underage (17) when I accepted the contract. I faked my date of birth on the contract and so far, I have been raking in THOUSANDS with this contract. I make so much money for so little work it is incredible! 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been building such good relations with my clients and cannot believe how far I've come in only 8 months. I turned 18 about 4 months after I was contracted. Here's my concern: Tax time is approaching. Even though we're only in September, January will be here before we know it! I of course am gonna file my taxes but I am so worried about my date of birth on the 10-99 not matching my real date of birth and will get in trouble with the IRS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention, I would probably lose my contract as well which would make me go absolutely insane. Do you think I need to worry about this? Also, do you think I should tell my company I ""accidentally"" entered my date of birth wrong on the contract before tax time and give them my real date of birth or do you think this would be a bad idea since I technically entered the contract when I was still a minor? Do you think they'd terminate my contract or just brush it off as a mistake? I am so unsure of what to do. Thanks for your help!",20Sep2018,1

50,"I’m in my mid twenties and had pretty average credit prior to this. I didn’t have a lot of money and had moderate utilization on my credit cards, but I made all of my payments on time and hadn’t missed a payment in maybe ten years since I opened my first credit card account. 

In the last yearish, I really screwed it up. My ex killed himself, left himself for me to find and I was suppose to clear up his estate and stuff. It was a pretty rough relationship and it took me a long time to finally leave him. At first I handled things as best I could, but at some point I think I just got mentally exhausted and completely shut down. 

There were so many things to keep track of and so many things that just sunk money. I felt like I was drowning and just stopped doing things. I ended up falling behind on most of my payments. 

I just got an email from Credit Karma that says I’ve missed 30 payments lately. I even defaulted on my school and had my degree held because I hadn’t paid them (I just paid them, actually... but I still have to fill out a request to graduate in order to receive my diploma and I just haven’t mustered the energy to do that either). I’ve defaulted on my student loans for like 3 months now, I had the money for it but I couldn’t remember my password one month and I just didn’t have the energy to try and recover it. I KNOW that sounds stupid. 

I have enough money to catch up on most of my stuff. But will that be enough to start digging myself out of this hole? And the more payments I miss the more money it’s going to cost so the more I drag my feet and try to ignore it all. I think all of my credit cards have been closed and some have probably been sent to collections. I think the utilities at my old place are still connected and I just never turned them off. 

I really don’t know what’s wrong and why I just gave up so hard, but it’s giving me real anxiety and I know I can’t just keep ignoring these things. I want to have a life and move past things. So, yeah, how do I start fixing things? 

I want to reach out to my best friend and tell her how bad things have gotten, she has an idea and has offered to help me set up a calendar/alert system. But she doesn’t know quite how bad it is. 

Anyway, I know this is all my fault and I’ve really mucked things up for myself. I know my reasons are trash, that I was exhausted or whatever. Idk. I just kind of gave up. But I really want to fix it. Idk if I feel like I’m finally feeling like I have the energy for it or if my anxiety over how bad everything has gotten is what’s got me wanting to work on it now.

61,"**tl;dr** My new roommates have been running the A/C constantly for the past two months, despite most of us being gone during the day and our rooms having fans. I'm concerned the electric bill will be too high. I know what I used to pay and am willing to pay double that. Problem is that our electric bill is pre-split.

Context:

I've lived in this unit for about 5 months now. In August I got all new roommates, 3 in total, whereas before I only had 2.

My old roommates and I never ran the A/C. We were very energy-conscious-- shutting off lights and fans when we left or weren't in a room, turning the A/C off unless we were really hot.

My new roommates and I got off to a less-than-pleasant start, mainly due to one of them. At our roommate meeting, I mentioned turning off the A/C, to which two of them immediately freaked out and said no way (We're in the Southwest U.S. so it does get pretty hot).

So the A/C has been running constantly for the past two months. In late August, I upped the temperature to 77 from 10am to 6pm and 78 at other times. 

None of us, except maybe one, are home a lot. I believe 3 of us get home in the evening or at night.

We also have fans in our rooms with 3 settings. There is no need to run the A/C all the time.

Today I got home in the evening and the schedule was changed to all 74. It was 77 outside.

I definitely need to talk about this. Though people are present a similar amount as my last roommates, and though there's only one more person, I'm willing to pay double what I used to, but no more. 

Problem: Our electric bill is pre-split.

Since I’ve started working, multiple food runners(my job position) have left for college. This wasn’t a problem until school started, because I am in multiple AP classes. On my availability sheet, I put down for 12 hours a week, but left individual days open for flexibility. I got scheduled for 24 hours the next week. I went and talked to one of my bosses, and told him that I cannot work that many hours, and asked if I could get some days off, due to the fact that he didn’t listen to my requests for hours. He also didn’t let me fill out a new availability sheet that just had 2 days available. I talked to my parents and they told me I should put in my two weeks because of this. The next day, I told my other boss that I was putting in my two weeks notice for above reasons. He then told me that he would get me a new availability sheet, and let me take a few of these days off. He did that, and last week I was only scheduled for 2 days. (We also only have 4 bussers. One can only work sundays, one can work Wednesday and Monday. One can work everyday but Sunday). I put on my new availability sheet to only work Tuesday and Sunday, and I was scheduled that.

It’s been less than two weeks and they have already broken the agreement. Not only that, but I am scheduled to work on Friday, the second busiest night of the week, by myself. This means I will be doing 3 times as much work as normal, as they normally schedule 3-4 bussers for Friday.

68,"So a family who lived down the street from me almost my entire life had a son who was about a year younger than me and a daughter about six years younger than me. We grew up together. We spent many days and summer nights running around the neighborhood together, having movie days on rainy days, and having snowball fights when it snowed. The daughter and I were so close we were practically sisters. About four years ago, their parents separated in a really terrible and traumatic way, and their mom moved to the neighborhood right next to ours. My mom was good friends with their mom so she kept in contact, but after they moved, the daughter all of a sudden did not really want anything to do with me. She began to spend all of her time with the daughters of her overbearing friend, and essentially cut me out of her life. Two years ago, nine days after her brother moved into college, he found out he had a very rare brain tumor. He was friends with everyone and the entire community loved him, so everyone was coming to visit him in the hospital the first several days. He was in and out of chemo and radiation, saw several different doctors all who had different treatment ideas. Eventually it looked like he was going to beat the cancer, then about a month ago they found out cancer had spread to his spinal cord and he was paralyzed from the waist down. He passed away in his home yesterday morning with his loving family by his side. I am very sad by this news, even though I haven't been close to him in years. All I want to do is hug his sister and never let her go and tell her everything is going to be okay, but I can't because I don't even really know her anymore. 

His service is on saturday and I will be attending with my family, but all I can think about is how many people will be there who never even knew him, and how I was replaced in his sisters heart by her brothers girlfriend who is now the one who calls her sis. I know this is not about me and there are people who actually knew him exponentially better than I did. People who went to visit him and spent time with him. But I just keep getting annoyed whenever anyone who I think barely knew him posts something on the internet about how he will be missed, or when another person comments on his sisters instagram post offering a shoulder to cry on.  They are just trying to be respectful ad supportive, I should be glad that his sister has people she can go to, but instead i'm jealous and angry. How do I stop making this about me? ",20Sep2018,1
69,"Hi,

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask.

I'm a 23 yo M student, currently in college.

Let me explain my problem :

In few words : I have concentration and memorization problem, and I can't really learn, and if I do, I can't use the informations I learn to solve problems or anything (I'm just memorizing...).

&amp;#x200B;

I can't really learn, doesn't matter how hard I try, I can't understand what being explained, whether I'm reading or watching/listening, I probably won't get even 10% of the information, even with movies, I can't understand without subtitles (and even with them, I miss a lot of things)

When it comes to problem solving, I can't solve anything, and I REALLY MEAN ANYTHING, doesn't matter if it's the simplest mathematics problem, or a real life problem, like learning gym moves, it takes me forever to learn a new move, and maybe forget it just later, or finding my way to somewhere, I always forget the way...

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I'm taking a mathematics course (basic statistics/probability), that everyone in the class find so easy, except me, I can't follow, I can't really understand, I feel like I'm so stupid, and I can't ask questions, because it's not t that I'm not understanding a part of it, but I'm not understanding the whole thing!  When I go back home and try to read the course, I find that I'm just wasting my time, it doesn't matter if I take notes, highlight or just read nothing changes... I took this course as a challenge, because I was always taking the easy way, and now I'm regretting it...

&amp;#x200B;

I can't understand what other people understand by reading the same thing, and it's not just with the maths, I always don't understand what is meant without having someone to explain it to me (several times, and I will probably forget it later)

71,"I've been on a quest to master following my intuition. I even read a book about it and I'm still confused. I'm supposed to have an astrological sign that is super intuitive, yet I'm clueless on what my intuition is exactly. 

That book said you can sometimes feel your intuition in your gut, that's why it was also nicknamed ""gut instinct"". 

It had multiple stories of people who learned to follow their intuition, and some of those people felt it like a ""burning desire to do something"" while others felt it as a ""deep inner knowing"". 

I sometimes feel this anxiety feeling, and I'm wondering if if maybe it's not anxiety and it's actually my ""gut instinct"". Because the last time I felt this anxiety, it was before something negative happened, and the time before that, it was after I read an emails someone sent me and it was followed by a feeling of no longer trusting them or feeling comfortable with them, when previously I had felt comfortable with them.

And I'm pretty oblivious you know, so at first I didn't make the connection and think maybe my anxiety was related to something they said, but now I look back at the email and think there could be some things I was picking up on, like maybe unknowingly reading between the lines.

Maybe I've been too quick to just blame these feelings as anxiety, and trying to brush them under the rug, when maybe those are my intuition? 

Because last time I tried to test my intuition, I felt that ""anxiety"" feeling. 

And the truth is I don't know if it's actually anxiety. But it does seem to originate in my gut. 

And when I was reading my astrological chart with Human Design, it said people of my type, when they don't follow their intuition and are about to do things that they aren't supposed to, they get these intense feelings, feeling like they are about to collapse, it's like their body is literally telling them it doesn't want to go through with those actions. And I do feel that way sometimes, but I always just dismissed it as anxiety or some weird mental issue lol.

Also, I have a pretty intolerant view of my so called ""anxiety"" especially when it's about to prevent me from doing something I have convinced myself that I need to do, even though I don't want to do it. 

I was really against getting my drivers licence for a really long time. I just got it last year at the age of 29. But I had this really intense desire to do it all of a sudden, like I was being called to do it suddenly. And it didn't make sense since I had put it off for so long, but I followed this ""intuition"". And I wasn't actually anxious. 

But then I started getting the same ""anxiety"" feelings on the day of my exam. I literally thought it was just because I had exam phobia. But as soon as I walked outside to greet my driving instructor he was in a very foul mood, told me I was going to fail (have no idea why he did that) and his bad mood really effected me and increased my negative feeling so much that I failed. 

So then, had to wait a couple weeks to redo the test, and had agreed to take his car again. But then my anxiety feelings were SO BAD AGAIN, and I just ignored it. When we got down to the access center, it was closed because the power had gone out all over town, so we had to reschedule my exam again. My instructor told me the soonest he could get me in was another 2 weeks away, and I didn't want to wait that long again, because I didn't want to be anxious any longer. 

I really wanted to take my own car, you see. I felt like I would be more comfortable and confident and happy driving it. But my driving instructor was being a douche and telling me, I would fail in my own car, because the examiner wouldn't have the controls to hit the brakes if I made a mistake and (insert many other reasons here). 

And when I got home I was really upset, and tried to ask my intuition, and my higher self, WTF the deal was!!! I felt in all my being that getting my licence was the right thing to do, so why did it feel like the universe was preventing me from taking that exam? I mean, it's so weird that there was a black out at that exact moment stopping me from doing it. And I sort of meditated on it, and the answer I got back was taking the test is the right thing to do, but I was going about it in the wrong way, and that I had to ask myself what I really wanted. And when I did ask myself what i really wanted, the answer was that I wanted to do the exam in my own car. 

And my instructor had told me it was impossible for me to schedule the exam myself because it would take them up to a year as there was a long waitlist, and he was the only one who could get me in sooner, but I went down to the access centre right that moment, and the lady at the front told me they had just got a cancelation for the very next morning!!!!! 

I got my dad to drive me to the access center in my car and when I took my exam the next morning and I was not anxious. I didn't have that terrible feeling. Sure I was sort of nervous, but I didn't have that ""anxiety"" feeling and I was confident, happy and really comfortable in my own and I passed. Plus everything my driving instructor had said was wrong. My examiner was very content and at ease in my car. 

So this was literally like my only experience with my intuition, and ever since I have been so confused and trying to figure it out more, but I'm starting to wonder if that ""anxiety"" feeling is my intuition.

I would be very interested to hear your personal experiences with your intuition or gut instincts, whatever you call it.

73,"It sucks cause I work as an analytical chemist. 

I’ll give two examples. But this happens all the time. 

I was walking with a pippette to make some solutions when someone asked me to go over results with them. I look at what they’re doing and talk about it for about 5 minutes. When all of the sudden my pippette completely disappears. I look for 5 minutes only to realize that I put it on the table mid conversation. 

This happens all the time. 

Second story is I was entering results into a paper when I missed a major error that could of been fixed super easily. I sent out wrong results to a customer and they sent them back explaining that we might have a mistake. This is major.

My parents unfortunately weren’t able to afford for me to finish my degree so I dropped out and moved back home. Without a degree it has been difficult to find jobs, right now I’m working at a cool historic independent movie theater, but I’m only making $10 an hour.
My parents want me to get a degree at a cheaper Florida school, and study something more practical like business, but I’m not really that interested in the subject matter, and it would take me three years to finish General Education classes and all the major classes.
What I want to do is save up my money for a year or two, move back to LA, and try to find work as a set PA or an office PA. I know that it’s risky, and I don’t have a completed degree, but I want to follow my passion.
What I’m wondering is how realistic would it be for me to get a film job? How hard is it to get these jobs? Be honest with me. I really don’t want to try to pursue film, not find any work, have to move back home, and be stuck working in low paying retail/food jobs.

80,"I don't know if this is the subreddit for this but I am just looking for advice and also maybe to vent a bit. I, first of all, understand it is annoying for someone to vent/somewhat complain about having too much money but I have such a massive negative impact on my mental health and social functions that I would like some advice/input on my life. I am sure there are more relevant subreddits to post this too but I find this is a problem that comes up for me frequently when forming new relationships. If you have a better idea of where to post this pls lmk!

Anyway in past year or so this has been weighing heavily on me. I come from a family that where my father was able to do quite well for himself and this has led to me inheriting a large sum of money (high 7 figure range). I suffer a great deal of guilt having this money that I did nothing to earn. I appreciate that it gives me peace of mind knowing I will not ever be homeless but it makes me feel so alienated from my peers. I do not discuss this with anyone openly of course but I seem to create barriers in my own head, getting super embarrassed and anxious about people finding out. I had a fulltime job up until a few years ago when I decided to go back to school full time. Ever since then I have become much more anxious and preoccupied thinking about money. It did not help that I made a windfall of cash on crypto in january and just feel even more guilty about this. My close friends that know about my family I am very generous with and straight up give them cash and take them on trips helping them pay for it, I donate money to people directly on gofundme and other platforms. I am just constantly preoccupied with this guilt. I find myself not wanting to put myself in social situations because I am worried about people asking me how I go to school full time and have my own apartment and car etc. I do not live a lavish lifestyle relative to my net worth, I am not friends with anyone else that has money like myself. Most of my friends are quite broke and some live in abject poverty. I apologize for being kinda all over the place. I really have no idea the point of this post but I guess venting a bit helped. Does anyone have any idea on how to help this not affect me in such a negative way? I do have a therapist I see and talk about this stuff with but I feel like it just keeps dominating all of my thoughts. What should I say to people when I meet them to try to feel less awkward and anxious. I have considered moving out of my apartment to live with roommates as that is more the norm for people my age, especially the ones going to school.

81,"TLDR at the bottom

Backstory:
Basically I’ve had a lot of issues with my school. I started high school back in 2016 and choose welding as my class. I enjoyed welding, it’s some of the most fun i’ve ever had in school. So i was having a great time, until the teachers started being really pissy towards me. They’d mark me as abscent, when im clearly there, they would mock me and my long hair (Im a male). The only motivation i had left was the sweet studentgrant (yes in Sweden high school students get paid to go to school) after a few weeks of my only being abscent 4% of my classes they removed it, when they’re actually supposed to remove it if i miss 25% of my classes. I ended up quitting that class at the end of 2016 and later i heard that my teacher got fired. I started taking a new class in 2017, and doing so i had to start from square 1, i choose to go electrican education. It all started fine but after a while i really got lost, i didn’t know anything of what we were doing and i understood almost nothing. Im horrible at math, so i dont understand why i choose to take the electrician class. I slipped behind on alot of the projects, and at the end of the year i got through that class with 4 F.

My current problem:
Today was my first school day... well not actually.. i didn’t show up the first day, or even the next week.. or the week after that.. School was supposed to start late august but i never went, today i did however, and i got pulled into a meeting with the principal and a few other teachers. We looked through my grades from last year and they suggested that if everything doesn’t work out i might have to go ANOTHER year. That’ll be 5 years of what was originally going to be 3 years. I feel super lost and don’t know what to do or where to turn. My grades are horrible. I don’t wanna quit school, i’d feel as i let my parents down. I don’t feel comfortable in my current class or my classmates. I hate all of this and i just wish it all would fix itself.

Im feeling really down after the hard news, my parents know nothing about this, im the only one that knows. Im scared of them finding out that i haven’t been to school the first month and that my grades are terrible!

TLDR: school is rough, i’ve got bad grades and might have to go another year which would mean that i would be 5 years in school instead of 3. My parents don’t know im failing school, and im scared that they’ll find out.

Is there any way to take lessons at home? 
I understand that it might not be possible for an electrician class, but maybe i can study subjects such as History &amp; Religion at home and come to school to do the more practical subjects.

They want to meet me again on Friday, what should i ask about / Tell Them?

I'm struggling to stay motivated and the class is so boring to the point where I can't stay focused. I find myself counting down the minutes until the class ends instead of doing work. 

Our work isn't grading nightly. We do something  called a ""folder quiz"" where the teacher selects problems off each assignment at the end of the unit and their worth a lot. I end up procrastinating. These are worth more than tests and quizzes.

89,"I currently work for a fairly large company, about 18,000 employees, and I really enjoy what I do. Based on high turnover in my department though, I've had a fairly stressful few years and have had no work/life balance since I'm at work for about 12 hours a day, 5 days a week, and really don't do anything outside of work any longer. I spend the extra time at work because I want to help the others that work with me and try to keep them from leaving as though our department was a revolving door. They're underpaid and have terrible benefits because they're contracted and don't work for the company directly. Though I've been fighting for them to be brought in to the company as well, the most that's really happened is they received an increase in pay that is overall a good increase percentage wise, but is still not enough for the cost to live in the area that we live in.

I make a wage that is sufficient for my lifestyle and, though it doesn't mean I can have everything I could possibly want, I'm able to live without having to worry about paying bills or eating. As I stated originally, I enjoy the work that I do and I'm also OK with making as much as I do since I get by just fine. Recently, I've received some offers to interview for positions with other companies, some of which has a very significant increase in pay (40%).

I'd like to speak to my manager about the offers and discuss if anything is really being done about assisting my colleagues with their situation but I'm not sure where to start.

I don't want to leave where I am and feel like I've given up on everything I've worked towards, just to feel like I never had anything improve. At the same time, I know that the manner in which I am currently working is not healthy for me and preventing me from growing myself. A pay increase like one that I was offered would allow me to completely change my lifestyle, especially since I have no problems where I'm currently at ($0 in any debt).

However, my parents (mainly my father) talked me out of going saying I wasn’t ready to go, I was too young, too small, and that going to college in NYC is too expensive and that I’d have debt for the rest of my life. I was offered an 18,000 dollar scholarship for each year I attended (9,000 a semester) but of course that wasn’t enough (at least for him). 

I let him talk me out of my dream school. 
I’ve been in college here in my home town in Texas for almost a month and I hate it. I’ve broken down crying in my car on the way home from classes. I feel like I’ve made the biggest mistake of my life and I’ve been so sad and depressed. I’ve been dreaming of going to college in NYC for years and I feel like I’ve let my dream slip through my fingers. 

So this past week I decided to take my future into my own hands. I told my mother how I’m planning to reapply as a transfer student to my college in NYC in the hopes that they re-accept me. I also dropped one of the classes I was taking in my hometown that I wouldn’t need for the major I want to be taking in NYC. My father wants me to become a nurse or something similar to a doctor without having to go to medical school and spend all the extra money to be a doctor. I personally, want to do radiation therapy and help cancer patients. 

My father found out today that I dropped one of my classes since most of the classes I’m taking in my home town won’t transfer over in the major I actually want to do. While studying, I overheard him in the room with my mother telling her that I’m making the biggest mistake of my life by leaving and going to college in NYC. He says he’s already been down that road and he knows what he’s talking about and how he won’t help me at all. I don’t know what to do. 

Am I really making the biggest mistake of my life? Should I just do what he wants or listen to what he says to and give up on my dream? Is life even worth living if I don’t have any support from the people that are supposed to support me and my dreams?

99,"We’ve been dating for almost 9 years now, this October. We’ve been dating since we were sophomores in high school, we were 16 years old. We’ve seen each other grow; but we’ve never actually experienced growing up on our own. So 2 days ago, he broke up with me. He said that he needs his time to grow and experience things without me, his safety net. I understand. But I’m curious, is this the end end? Can you date somebody for that long, share unforgettable memories and not come back? I’m not going to hold my breath, but there’s a part of me that hopes he comes back to me, once he’s done growing on his own. ",20Sep2018,7

In it there was a Manila envelope which contained at least 20+ letters from my biological mother. I knew I was adopted, but I never knew about these or anything other than her name. The most recent letters are from 2007, but that’s also when we moved into a new house so I don’t know if she stopped sending them or just never got the new address. In any case should I contact her?

101,"I started talking to this girl in the middle of June. We were kinda of dating, not really sure what was happening. Anyways, she left in late June for Veterinarian school in another state. Since she left, we have been texting every single day.


However, the texts have started to feel like a chore, and I'm not really feeling our vibe. We aren't dating as far as I know, but we are talking I guess? Anyways, I am going to see her in early October with our mutual friends. And then a week or two after that, she is coming down for her aunt's wedding which she asked me to be her date for it.

I'm not really sure what to do in this situation. Should I see how it goes in October, and base it off of that. Should I straight up tell her now before the trip? What's my best option here?

At this point, I didn't want to respond because he was keeping me from being calm and I didn't want to look or act rudely so I just stayed silent. Eventually he left and came back so I made a single joke to my other friend on the call about what he thought I was doing and he came back. He then stated that since I wasn't talking in his presence he was going to stay there so I just couldn't talk. At this point I just muted my microphone so I could play the game and he has a normal conversation (if you don't count him accusing me of trash talking him while he was gone) with my other friend.

After the game finished I calmed down and DMed him (discord) my reasoning for not talking. We had a conversation that ended poorly and I'm left wondering if I was ""playing the victim card"". 

(Note: This isn't the first time this has happened. There have been him and one other kid who have done things like this before.

110,"I was in an accident Monday that I was deemed to have no fault in. The other woman admitted totally to hitting me and received the citation. Today I got a call from her insurance company  who asked the condition of myself and the car. My car is an old beater Ford Focus and was hit at roughly 25 mph along the drivers side front and back doors as well as rear quarter panel. They’re damaged and may be totaled (will know tomorrow) but it’s drivable. I’m mostly fine, with a sore shoulder and mild back and neck pain. I told the insurance woman I was sore but hadn’t gotten checked out yet. She said they could “take care of me” with a massage or if necessary ongoing treatment or if not I could accept a “small settlement”. 

I’m a broke college student and I would like a new car but I need more than the $1400 I’ll get for the focus if it gets totaled. I don’t want to commit insurance fraud or come across as the person milking an accident but I would like to get the most out of this settlement the legal way so that if my car is totaled I can afford a new one. How should I go about handling everything. Would it be better to simply avoid racking up unnecessary medical bills to receive a full settlement that I’ll lose most of my money on or receive a small settlement (not sure how much that entails) for simply stating I was sore for a week or two at most? Also I’m in GA if that matters.

111,"long story short, i talked to this girl for a span of several weeks over the summer, and feelings were mutual, however, she had to leave for college shortly after we began talking. it transpired months ago and we were really vibing with one another, but ultimately things did end up becoming complicated. she kind of backed off a little bit before she left, and we ended up not really communicating much during that stretch of time. a few days later she reached out and explained that she wasn’t looking for anything at the moment, and she just wanted to spend her final days in the state with her closest friends before leaving for college across the country. i understood and respected her decision, but i did feel a bit shitty about the situation. i think it was the sense of unfulfillment, and the fact that it all happened so fast. i suppose i never got closure, it just ended, and we just stopped directly communicating. i texted her once around a month ago about school, and got no response. to be completely honest, it was just a friendly gesture. we have each other added on social media, and she’s been active on mine, which i kind of don’t understand. it’s indirect communication i guess. whether it be through voting on an instagram poll i put up or viewing stories, etc. things like that just kind of remind me of her and what had happened between us. i don’t want to associate her with a negative experience, and i’ve really never had bad relations with anyone in my life, so i reached out to her; to clear things up, to communicate what i had been feeling. i don’t know if it was the right thing to do. i do genuinely think i needed to get something off of my chest, but maybe the timing was off. she’s doing her thing in another state, and deep down i feel like me reaching out is almost burdensome.

113,"In freshman year of high school I was a real dick head. I can admit I did really shitty things and I didn't care about other people. The summer of freshman year a lot of conflict arose with my already problematic family. My mother is an uptight religious woman, 58 years old. My dad is more easy going, bike mechanic, 60 years old. They haven't gotten along well in about 6 years, but in the middle of freshman year everyone found out my dad was cheating and it didn't hurt my mom, it hurt everyone else. My mother has never cared about many people, me included. My father, isn't a great parent. He's a cool guy but he doesn't know how to raise kids. Which says a lot considering he's had 6. Oldest being 36 now. 

I had to get in the middle of their fighting and split them up. My parents refused to divorce, but my dad moved out, leaving me and my youngest brother, 20, with my mom. My mother and I never really got along so this was a frightening thought. Over a summer I developed really bad anxiety and every time I cried out for help I got everything I've done wrong shoved down my throat of my mom. It got really bad, I couldn't eat, social situations scared me, I couldn't even see my girlfriend without being worried that I was going to be hurt. My mother had no remorse and refused to see my side when I begged for her help, or any parenting.

Again with the summer of freshman year, I didn't stay home at all. I was always getting blasted and crashing in random houses, people I knew and people I didn't. But during the time of my family literally tearing at the seams, everyone fighting one another and me blaming myself for it all, I realized that the way I treated other people was wrong. I reached out to those I truly hurt and got things cleared but I've noticed that in school, 2 years later, I still don't have friends. I don't know how to express that I'm not the same person that I was. I get written off by everyone and I am very lonely. 

I want to look more approachable, I feel like I've tried everything. I smile often, I try to compliment people, I don't cause problems, and yet I still have a hard time getting to know anyone. No one wants to connect with me and the people that I go out of my way to talk to eventually blow me off. I want people in my life but I don't know how to get them. Am I too open? Am I too caring? Am I too nice? ",20Sep2018,1
114,"hey Guys, 
so I've been dating online for about a year now, I never had any problems getting a date because I'm nice and not pushy. its just that It always ends up the same way, even if we end up seeing each other for a while or even get sexually involved,  the girl will either ghost me, tell me its not clicking or go back with her ex. 
This whole situation had me pretty depressed and bitter which is not who I want to be. I don't want to turn out like those internet ""nice guys"" that blame women for everything. so I got off my dating app and decided to become the best me I can be. 
I've already started kickboxing class, I'm spending more time with my friends and I overall go out more often to enjoy the city.
I was wondering if you guys had any other suggestions, I'm also looking to get some therapy because I know the hospital I work for could pay for some but other but I don't know what the first step should be.

115,"So I recently met someone off of Bumble which, for those who haven't heard of it before, is a dating app similar to Tinder with the added twist that only women can message guys first. For all intensive purposes, we'll call her Ash. 

Anyways, we went on our second date last night and everything went great. Conversation flowed freely and naturally and we laughed our asses off most of the night. I actually had a really stellar time and could honestly see myself being with this person in the near future. We have similar interests, are studying the same degree and are both pretty extroverted and outgoing people. We're planning on going on a third date next week and I'm actually super excited to see her again. 

However, I feel really stuck right now. 

Prior to meeting Ash on Bumble, I reconnected with an old friend that I hadn't seen in over a year, who I'll call Nicole. 

We always got on extremely well and almost slept together back in 2016 when we both lived at university, after drinking wine and talking for what seemed like hours. She decided that it was best we didn't, as she was just starting to see someone else. She ended up dating this person for over a year and recently broke up with him, which bring us to the current day. 

Nicole and I caught up for coffee a week before I met Ash on Bumble. We had a great time and it was so good to see her again. On top of that, there was some slight sexual tension between us. Hands on the inside of thighs, talking close to each other, that kinda thing. I told her that I was house sitting for a friend on the 24th of September and that she should come down and stay a night or two, and she was quite keen on the idea. 

But now I don't know what to do. 

Is it bad of me to sleep with Nicole if she were to come down on the 24th of September after I've now met Ash? 

I mean, Ash and I aren't actually going out yet, hell I've only met her twice! 

But at the same time, how would she feel if she knew I slept with someone when we've just started to date? 

I'm so confused! Am I being too moralistic, or should I follow my conscience and cancel my plans with Nicole?

116,"Recently I met this girl who I was pretty sure was into me. She was way too pretty for me and seemed like an amazing person, i could not ask for much better although maybe it was the rose tinted goggles. The problem was i never took it the extra step. We would say hi, smile, have very brief exchanges but it ended there. I have serious trouble initiating conversations because i was homeschooled for 3 years and that seemed to have put a social delay on me. Worse is that my social anxiety keeps worsening to the point where i get nauseous sometimes. I always wanted to approach her after school and talk to her but could never get myself to do it and end up kicking myself as I sat waiting for the bus. Eventually she probably thought i wasn't interested and now we won't even say Hi to each other, it's back to being stangers. I don't blame her, it was all my fault for not carrying on but my anxiety was too much to be able to talk to her. I felt a punch in the gut the other day when I found out she has a boyfriend. I am over her by now but it is just the feeling of I fucked up and that could've been me if I just went to therapy for longer. Cherry on the top is that I think this cycle is going to be repeated again with another girl and that is the last thing I want happening.

I made a friend at work I play a computer game with quite frequently, and I small talk with one of my managers there. I'm a junior in high school, and so is the friend that I play games with. My manager just graduated from highschool. One time we all hung out together and I was still pretty awkward just because I've never talked with them in a GROUP setting, but only personally. Fast forward 1 month we have a new worker who is in my grade as well, we talk a lot and we're close acquaintances.. I posted to my Snapchat a photo of fright fest six flags and asked who wanted to go. (None of them replied.)
Fast forward another few weeks.. my manager was nonchalantly talking to me last night about how she's going to six flags with them on Friday and how they have a group chat about it. None of them EVER invited me and completely left me out of it.
I've felt depressed, lonely, and ignored ever since I heard that yesterday. 
I talk to one of them A LOT and play computer games with the person EVERY night, and is 3 have hung out in a group before.. and the other worker they're going with gets along with me very well.

123,"I feel like the obvious answer is no but I dunno... I’d never let my kid get away with this. Anyway. I’m 23. I’ve been staying with my Aunty and Uncle (who are like parents to me) for the past 3 months. Over the duration of my stay I’ve picked up on 3 things without even really trying:

1) My 14 year old cousin is vaping and I believe maybe selling vapes at school. 
2) She is catfishing girls with fake instagrams and sexting on kik
3) My cousin is probably gay or bi but acts and jokes like she isn’t 

Now, the third point I have no problem with nor is it something I’m concerned about in terms of wanting to maybe let her parents know as that’s her own thing to work out in life, however the first two are concerning for obvious reasons, the second thing mostly concerning because a couple years ago my cousin got her phone taken away for an entire year because she was doing “stuff” on kik. I never got the full story, all I know is she was in big trouble and every time I stay with my Aunty and uncle they’ll sometimes ask what my cousin is doing on her phone all the time (I just say on instagram, because she is on instagram all day long) 

I’ve only recently noticed the vape thing because of the smell in her room which she says is lotion or tries to spray her perfumes over and nobody questions how strange that is lol, and then she has been keeping them in her desk. I’ve been storing my stuff in her room and was sharing it with her up until last week, so I have free reign to come in to the room and also she lets me use her desk to do my work. She’s allowed me to go in her desk whenever I want to use pens or paper, and I’ve never noticed anything until now. 3 different capes on 3 different occasions.

Lately she’s been talking about how some punk owes her $100 at school. I don’t even know why she is rambling about it anyway, considering her parents ask what for and she says “8ball and food”... sure. Idk why they’re being so clueless. Hell, it’s their credit card on her iTunes account. Surely there are no changes for 8ball. 

Anyway... I don’t want to rat on her but her behaviour is concerning especially paired with her horrible attitude and her parents lack of insight even though they seem to want to know what’s going on

Here we go, I'm 16 so I live with my mother, I love my mother to death and would do any for her, she is my best friend and the only parent that is still alive. So yeah we are very close. Over the last few year our relationship has been a little rocky, nothing I really blame her for, she is human after all. But recently she has done something that really disgusted me, something not so normal, something I really don't want to say. Not anything to me if that is what you are thinking... But I can't be around her anymore, whenever I see or hear her I feel sick, disgusted, I can't stand it, if she touches me or my stuff I feel sick. She did something that goes against any moral or values that I have and I have to find a way out. I still love her but I can't control the nausea I have, this is something I can't forgive. But at the same time I just want to forget about it and just stay with her like normal.  


What should I do? Should I find a way to get out as fast as possible? or should I try to forget about it? should I just try to forgive her?

126,"About 5 months ago, I ordered a post-paid phone plan that includes a phone and 100GB of data for $125/month and it said it would show up in 3-5 working days. 3 weeks later, still no phone, so I enquired about it and they said there was a problem transferring my old number to the new phone since it was with a different provider, so they asked if I’d like to just get a new number. I said yes, they said it’d be here in 3-5 working days again.

Another couple of weeks pass, my tracking code isn’t working and there’s still no phone, so I enquire again. They assure me it’s on its way and will be 3-5 working days yet again. Another week, and I enquire again, only this time they tell me they have no record of my order. 

I give every possible detail I can until they eventually find my order, they say it has been cancelled. I ask if they’re certain and that there are definitely no other orders at all and it’s definitely cancelled and they confirm and suggest I just put in a new order, so I do. The phone arrives in 3 days. This is fine with me, and it’s finally all over with. Until 2 days later.

A SECOND phone arrives, I leave it unopened and untouched until I can get a satchel from the phone company to send it back. Since the phone took about a month to get here in the first place, my first monthly bill arrives before I can send it back. I send back the unopened phone and sim regardless and don’t pay the bill.

The next month I get another phone bill for the phone I sent back. I call to enquire and ask them if they received the phone, they say yes. I ask them to cancel the phone service for that phone, they say they will, but then the next month another phone bill arrives, only this time it’s asking for $1029.

I call again to get this all sorted out, and again, they say they’ll cancel it, they even send me a confirmation text that it is done, but I still get another $1029 overdue bill the next month. I call again and ask about it, they tell me the service is still active. I get my dad up in this because he knows how to get shiz done, we end up talking to the supervisor who assures me the service is now definitely cancelled.

I got confirmation of the cancellation today, along with my final bill. The cancellation letter says I owe them $1053 for my overdue payments of the phone that I never used.

I’ve been paying off the phone that I kept on time every month, it’s even in a bit of credit because they gave me a $108 credit to make up for all the screwing around (though they initially applied it to the phone I sent back which was another muck around trying to get that sorted in itself).

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, I shouldn’t have to pay them anything because I never even opened the phone OR the sim they sent, I sent them all back as soon as I could. My dad has suggested going to the ombudsman with my overdue bills and/or even suing the service provider. I don’t know what else I can do outside of that other than pay the bill, which I shouldn’t have to do.

TL;DR Ordered a phone + plan about 5 months ago, after a month and a half of making calls enquiring why the phone didn’t arrive was told it was cancelled and to re-order, then 2 phones arrived. Sent one back completely intact only to keep receiving bills for it for the next 4 months which turned into overdue bills of $1029, called multiple times to cancel service, now they want $1053 even though I never used the service and sent the phone and sim back in brand new, unopened condition.

I don't really trust this person because I feel like they love hearing about other people's gossip (or sadness) and then they feel more powerful because they didn't share anything. But otherwise they're a fun person and we have a lot in common, so I don't want to break off contact over this.

Is there a word to describe this kind of person? How would you deal with it?",20Sep2018,3
128,"Hi guys! I'm an 11 grader, and I started online schooling in 8th grade. Due to this, I naturally stopped talking to everyone, and become very lonely and depressed. Whenever I made efforts to go to football games, or school events to get out and make social efforts I ended up feeling extremely depressed. People made new friends, and new groups. I was always ignored.

Fast forward a few years later I have started making very strong attempts again. I have become older and take better care of my appearance but I can still be a bit awkward and shy. I make a lot of attempts at creating friendships.. but I can never get past being acquaintances. I talk with people a lot in person, ask for their Snapchat, maybe even talk outside of work or wherever we see each other. But I can never become solid friends with them and hangout frequently. I'm ALWAYS stuck at acquaintances.

I think this is because while I've been alone for years, they've gone through many people and have formed friendgroups.. they are so invested in them and just can't be bothered to get to know me. I don't blame them for this because it could naturally happen. 

Any advice on how to make solid friend(s)?? ",20Sep2018,1

However, this computer is in the same room as the little prayer place my parents have. they 24/7 burn incense and it causes me to sneeze a bunch and may be causing my exzema(?) not sure if it does, but there is a study which says that incense smoke can cause exzema. when i brought this up with my parents they literally said that this is christian propaganda to make you quit your religion and join theirs.(also a slight issue cause im not super religous and dont really see a point but my parents are VERY traditional and love religion) any way to get my laptop moved to a different room away from smoke (doesnt even have to be in my room i just wanna put a wall b/t me and the smoke to minimize the amount of sneezing i have to deal with)",20Sep2018,1
130,"Honestly, I'm already largely thinking I want to take the opportunity, but I can't decide 100%.

Tl;dr is that my old roommates want me to move back in with them for relatively cheap rent (~$500 a month which is cheap here). Short pros is that it's more fun/exciting/liberating. Short cons is that home is easy/parents are fine/don't pay rent at home. Can't decide.

Financially I can afford it, I have a job, but it is taking money from my future condo/car fund.

Longer pros and cons below.

Skip this paragraph to skip backstory:
My old roommates want me to move back in with them (I lived with them for a year 2 years ago). They're great guys and that year I moved out was great. But the reason I moved back home with my parents after was because I finished school, got a job and wanted to save up money. I was initially thinking of saving money to buy a place, but since I'm in my low 20s, that tying myself down like that isn't ideal right now per say. I do have a lot of savings for my age, but the mortgage would still be a drag and I'm not certain where I want to live long term.

Pros of moving out:
- closer to downtown
- living with friends who I get along with well (and lived with before)
- possibly more freedom bringing girls over (I'm not holding my breath here, just a nice option)
- pretty cheap rent since I'd have roommates
- more social
- slightly closer to my job (very slightly, fairly negligible)
- general freedom
- more interesting lifestyle
- can unwind at the place with a drink with friends (don't drink around my parents)

Pros of living at home/cons of moving out:
- free food/rent at home
- get along well with parents
- comfortable and easy lifestyle
- simple
- still see other friends often
- bigger room/more personal space",20Sep2018,1

Their current job has them constantly depressed at the end of the day and the constant reminder that they're worthless because of their status as a dropout doesn't help with that.

He dumped me, and said it was never going to work and that he still 'loved' me. I walked home. Since then he never bothered to contact me. I feel like after spending that much time together, he should have at least checked in with me - as he saw how hurt I was and how bad I must have been feeling? Maybe its not a common thing for people to contact their exes afterwards, but when you know how much you would have hurt someone...I thought they would have made contact to make sure I was okay. I'm glad I never caved him and contacted first. About a month after I decided to delete him as a friend on facebook, then i noticed a day later he had blocked me. I found it funny.

144,"I realized I can explain basically everything I do in terms of trying to win attention from someone (generally my dad or my SO, but anyone will do).

My therapist pointed out to me a few weeks ago that I exhibit many attention-seeking behaviors, citing how I default to saying ""no"" or correcting people, and that I break rules just because they are rules, how I show up late to everything because I unconsciously value my own time over anyone else's. He suggested I ""misbehave"" now because as a kid I felt like I only got attention from my parents when I was a spectacular failure or spectacular success and it's a hell of a lot easier to fail (though I keep trying my hand at success every so often).

Ever since that therapy session I've been noticing more and more things I do that can be explained by my seeking attention. Like how I dye my hair purple and have an ""odd"" (and often ""slutty"") fashion sense (I made a plastic bag into a shirt once). I do a lot of things that are contrary to expectations (I failed math in 6th grade despite getting the highest score on the placement test, I look really ""alt/punk/metal"" but am a competitive figure skater, in high school I had a 3.9 gpa and my best friend was a dropout, etc.) and I wonder if I only do them because being a collection of contradictions makes me ""interesting"". I am diagnosed with two mental illnesses and I wonder if I'm subconsciously just faking it to get sympathy from people. It's gotten to the point that I'm questioning why my passions in life are what they are.

My two biggest passions are engineering (where being a pretty woman who knows stuff gets me noticed) and music (I'm mainly a vocalist and performing front and center on stage....this one should be obvious). I guess I just want to be looked at.

Now, this all is relatively harmless attention whoring I guess. Where it gets yucky is when you look at the fact that I've cheated in my 3 longest relationships (which of course includes my current and possibly dead marriage) because I struggle to turn down flattery and praise. Or that I have lied so much and been so selfish a friend that I only have 1 left (well I have another, but I'm not allowed to talk to him).

I think my whole personality, good and bad, exists because I desperately want attention and I don't care how shallow or deep it is. I give off a ""I don't give a fuck what you think about me"" vibe when it's really the opposite, I see now. I care so much that I don't know if I am who I am because it's actually what I want or if it's because it's what I think other people will find interesting (sorry I couldn't come up with a less confusing way to phrase that).

How do I \*actually\* stop needing attention/validation/approval/disapproval from others to feel good about myself? How do I figure out who ""the real me"" is, if not the person I've crafted to weave in and out of expectations who is now caught in her own web of contradictions and lies?

My parents kicked me out and I have a few days to pack and find a place to stay. My parents say that since “I’m a slut, i should stay with my guys” but the thing is, i don’t have “guys” or anyone to stay with.

My parents don’t work, never worked, and all my life they have been using their “disabilities” to leech into free housing. They’ve been abusive all my life. Both physically and mentally. 

 I have a bachelors degree in business, and it’s the only hope I have. The only reason why I have a college degree is because my high school helped me apply to college and guided me with financial aid. Once I got in a 4-year university, I almost failed many times because of the toxic household I live in, but last month I finally made it through all 120 credits with some kind of divine intervention somehow. My diploma will be mailed next month. 

I have considered myself an homeless orphan all my life, because my family was never there for me. The were never role models. All my siblings dropped out of high school at this point and some are incarcerated. One of them also disappeared. It goes to show how abusive my household was, that even being homeless on the streets would have been better. The only thing that is different is that I have a floor to sleep on that is covered with rain. I never had clothes because my parents couldn’t afford them and I have been wearing the same few outfits for the last 4 years. I am also severely underweight.

I have asked a few people if they could mentor me but they have ended up wanting sex in return. I can’t do that anymore. I want an organization that can care about me and guide me where to take my life from here, without giving them my body in return.

150,"For reasons I’ll explain below, the mother of my oldest friend entered my life with some regularity about a year ago. She’s a woman in her mid 70s, divorced (and her ex is dead). She has a history of alcoholism, and her two adult children, who had similar drinking problems, have died in the past two years. Her only blood relatives are a brother and a granddaughter, and she is not on speaking terms with either of them. Last week she took a bunch of pills in an apparent failed suicide attempt. 

Her downward spiral started two years ago, when her younger son died of cirrhosis at the age of 41. That death also hit her older son hard — my best friend of 28 years. He had been in bad health, with two heart attacks and having been grossly overweight for years. He stopped taking care of himself, slipped back into his own alcoholism, and wound up having a fatal heart attack at age 48 last October. 

Here’s the harsh reality: their whole family was a mess. The father of the family had dragged them to a half-dozen different cities while the boys were growing up, always with the promise of some big payday that never came. He and the mother divorced once the children were adults, and then later he was convicted on some kind of child porn possession charge. (So far as I know, he never abused his boys.) He died about five years ago. 

Both sons were fun, smart and charming, but also impulsive and self-sabotaging. They both managed to find wives who I thought were good matches, but ruined their marriages through infidelity. Both were college graduates, but often had money problems because they tended to spend as fast as they earned and bounced from job to job. Substance abuse caught up hard and fast on them, ultimately contributing to both their deaths. The younger son left behind a preteen daughter. 

So that brings me back to the only one left alive, the mother. I had known her for years, as I had stayed a loyal friend to her son, although I certainly wouldn’t say I was close with her. She was naturally a mess after he died, and she depended on a very small circle to keep her going; her brother, her two ex-daughters-in-law, and me. Admittedly, I played the smallest role, just being someone she would call or text to cry about her horrible fate. 

The rub? While I feel terrible for her, and can’t fathom her pain, she’s also been a thoroughly disagreeable person for years. She’s narcissistic, and far more interested in being vicious toward perceived enemies than cultivating friends. I think she gave her sons a bad upbringing, and while I don’t think she’s responsible for their choices, neither is she completely innocent. 

Since my friend died, she’s been basically howling in despair. She stopped talking with her brother over perceived slights, and the ex of her younger son has restricted access to her granddaughter because she’s been brutally nasty over the years. She now idolizes her sons as saintly types, ignoring their failings. She’s probably closest now to my friend’s ex, although at times she rips into her. 

She reaches out to me every few weeks, and it’s like staring into a black hole of misery. I’ve tried to encourage her to appreciate the little things over the past year, like the sun on your face on a lovely day, telling her that’s what her boys would want. She’ll agree, settle down, and a few weeks later the process repeats. She’s said repeatedly she hopes to go to bed and not wake up. And as I said at the top, last week brought on an apparent suicide attempt. Neighbors found her and called 911. 

I have no idea what to say to her anymore. Her situation is one of the saddest I’ve ever known. It’s partially cruel fate, and partially self-imposed. Years of being a pill to people have left her isolated. She finds no joy in anything. She’s gone to therapists and takes medicines, but nothing helps. I can’t pretend she has anything to live for, but neither could I ever tell her to just give up. 

tl;dr — my late friend’s mother’s life is a disaster, and shows no prospect of improving. I don’t know what to tell her.

Not that this has anything to do with what I'm about to say, I'm just giving small background info to put emphasis on the emotional trauma I'm experiencing right now

Years and years ago when my lifelong best friend (practically sister) and I were 12, she pretty much looked at him the same as a brother and we always tried to hang out with him, prank him, be his friend, all that. This unfortunately also included being annoying rats that snuck into his bedroom while he wasn't home to entertain ourselves and/or search for weed. On one of these occasions, we found our way into his ipod (I happened to guess the pass code because he doesn't bother to secure his stuff very well) and instead of finding some funny stuff, we found a gallery full of photos of young girls, early teens I think. I don't remember fine details because it was so long ago and I felt too weird to give it more than a glance, so I can't say definitively whether or not they were 12 year olds or maybe 16 year olds. The photos were not pornographic, just regular photos of people that could be considered provocative if you're creepy. Regardless, it made me feel uncomfortable so I ended up bringing it up to our mom... Of course he denied having anything to do with it and he blamed it on his friend, which didn't make much sense obviously, but I let it go and hadn't really thought about it since for the sake of my sanity.

Just about a half an hour ago I decided to Google the only username he goes by out of curiosity because he hasn't had any social media accounts in years and I was wondering if that had changed. It's a name that no one else would use and it only turned up half a page of results. The first result was a YouTube playlist from his account... And it was nothing but 10 videos of some 10-14 year old girls in their bedrooms dancing in front of their phone cameras, probably with innocent intent. The playlist was last updated on July 29th of this year. I'm absolutely positive it is his account as it uses the same profile photo I have seen him use elsewhere. 

I feel sick to my stomach, I'm shaking and I'm totally disgusted. How should I be feeling about this? Do I tell someone? Do I keep it to myself? Do I try to forget? What do I do? ",20Sep2018,13

Hello r/advice! 

So, I have been dating my awesome girlfriend for  about a year. We met as friends last school year, as she offered to help me out with English.  To be honest, I always thought she was gorgeous to me. 

But I was scared to say, because I had thought that she wouldn’t like a weird guy like me with an ugly accent and bad teeth, and she is not of my race. 

She’s smart, funny, and beautiful. But, there is one issue. My parents do not like our relationship, and are very close minded.

They are of the previous generation. When I tried to introduce her to them at first, they told us both to leave for the afternoon. 

We went to the movie instead, had a great time and I went home late. My parents got angry with me, but said if I wanted to ruin my blood, it was my problem. I ignored them. 

They call her bad things because of her race when I am with them 

I try to tell them that here in America, it is not acceptable to make such comments. But they say, I am just dumb and young. 

I help at my family’s restaurant a few days a week after school. My parents dislike my girlfriend coming to visit sometimes and call her nasty things to my face, but they don’t do anything. It’s started to anger me. I tried to tell them she was just a friend but they know the truth. They believe that races, should not mix, despite living in a very diverse area of a fairly large city. 

I feel like it’s embarrassing my parents are like this, and it hurts my feelings that they’ve been so close minded. 

Yesterday, i was talking to my dad. He said he was embarrassed of me, and that I betrayed my family. He said he was very disappointed and angered by my ways and that he’d send me to live with my very religious uncle (who lives in another state) if I didn’t change my ways. I’m not sure if he’d actually do that logically. But it’s scary. 

TL;DR:

My parents don’t approve of my relationship because of my girlfriend’s race and are threatening to send me off to live with my very religious uncle. Also I’m sorry if my English is bad. Any advice would be good! ",20Sep2018,1

They are at his house spending the night and having a sleepover and it is really difficult for me. I trust him inplicitly but i have serious control problems. I was told i text him too much while he is with his friends; he wants to actually spend time with them and not have his nose burried in his phone the entire time. So through this entire evening i have received very few texts from him and he is reluctant to actually talk to me about the things they are doing. 

I have had extreme issues with control and manipulation in the past and my qualms with the current situation are being attributed to me being uncomfortable because im not in control. 

Am i in a bad situation? What should i do? How do i talk to him and let him know just how upset this has made me? I just need an unbiased answer please.

Thank you",20Sep2018,1
158,"Sortive a gross tooth story. You've been warned. I had all of my wisdom teeth removed at the same time. Things went great, I had no problems the first two days. Very little pain. The third day I woke up and my right lower gums and cheek were massive and swollen and hurt. Swelling on day three is expected, it should have gone away by now though. I'm on day nine and I still look like I'm sucking on one of those massive jawbreaker candies. I spoke to my surgeon about it and he said to massage my cheek and gums gently with something warm. I have been doing this periodically since day three and today my gums began oozing old blood when I massage them. Eww. Like brownish purpleish red old nasty blood. I don't think that is a normal thing. I think the swelling should have just gone down. I don't think my gums should ooze like a popped zit. They didn't pop. I haven't pressed way hard, just a gentle push and rub. No puss nasty. My gums ooze salty coagulated OLD blood though. I'm calling in the morning but I'm worried.",20Sep2018,2
159,"Getting Grindr a week ago was like opening Pandora’s box ... 


To start off I’m close to 17 ( yes I know I shouldn’t have Grindr but I wanted to look at the gay people in the area ) 

And it’s been pretty cool ( no I have not sent nudes or hooked up with anyone ) 


**anyways** everything was going good 

UNTIL I SAW MY MOMS BOYFRIEND THERE!!!! 


Omg, first couple times I saw it I didn’t want to believe it, I was like nah can’t be. I was scared to look at it. But guys, I keep seeing it in the area , and I’m 95% sure it’s him. 

His profile is about wanting to get fucked or blown. 

First of all, I’m not really out, I mean they suspect but I wasn’t ready to come out yet. 


My concerns are 

1.	**We depend on him for a lot of finances. Ex bills, car insurance, cable etc. without him idk how we’d do....**
2.	**I am only 16 (close to 17), if they found out that I downloaded Grindr they will be really mad.** 
3.	**They will suspect i met up with a guy around my age a couple days ago from the app which i did ( we didnt even kiss or hold hands ) and be mad.**
4.	**They will now know for certain that I like guys**
3.	**Guy kind of has anger issues and his family is homophobic, what if he tries to kill or hurt one of us to cover up for him possibly liking guys??**



The worst part is, I was the reason they almost broke up before.... 


**Years age, I found him on another dating website 😔😔😔 by sesrching his name on this website called pipl, i had just found the website and thoitjt it was cool. He was active on multiple sites**


I know for certain my mom has no idea ( she is very jealous/ said shed nevet be able to share her man) 

Please help, I don’t know what to do

160,"I've been the manager for about a year now. It's kind of an odd situation. I was a regular employee for years, then one of my co-workers got bumped up to supervisor over me. That was cool and all, I didn't mind, we got along just fine and I never showed any signs of insubordination. Then our manager quit and a power vacuum was created as everybody speculated who was going to get the big title.

This guy really thought it was going to be him, made a real effort to step up and lead the place. But alas the fates were not kind to him, and to everybody's disbelief, I was given supervisor and then manager over the course of two months.

The roles of our relationship were reversed, and he was just as good to me about it as I was to him in the past. I've always liked him, so I feel conflicted about withholding information from him. There are things about his personal life the owner does not approve of, it doesn't matter how hard he tries, he will never advance any further.

I want him to leave too and just find something better as well. Just I know there are so many ways this could go wrong. Telling somebody their employer detests them and will never give him a chance isn't likely to motivate somebody all that much.",20Sep2018,1

170,"I have followed my moms instruction since I was a kid, trying not to disappoint her or let her down. When I graduated high school, she pushed me into college to get my Bachelors before I even got to decide what I wanted to do in life. She even gave me her 2004 BMW for my first car to avoid paying a car note. I went through the first two years of school separated from my fiancé because my mom wanted me to focus on my work. At this time my fiancé joined the military and was stationed in Georgia, while I was stuck at home in Maryland, sadly, focusing on work. After I did my first two years, I convinced my mom that I could finish my Bachelors degree closer to my fiancé by digging up some scholarships at a particular school in Florida. She allowed me to go! So, I enjoyed my time closer to my fiancé while going to school in FL and working part time. The BMW my mom gave me began to break down too often that I ended up spending at least $8k getting it repaired over the five years that I had it. As time flew by, I finally received my Bachelors degree, got a job in the field I went to school for, got my own place, and shortly after a new car! Life was great. I was playing house with the love of my life and we were financially stable and truly happy. 
Afterwards, my mom pushed me to get my Masters degree the upcoming semester, which I fought her on. I wanted a break, I hated the stressful feeling of maintaining school, work, and life balance. However, she bribed me with money. She told me that if I was to get my Masters I would get my investment funds plus she would give me an additional 35% of funds on top of that. So, shoot, I was like heck yeah! So I enrolled in another year in college to receive my Masters degree. Unfortunately, I received terrible news that my fiancé was PCSing to California. My heart dropped. I would now be alone in FL fending for myself. I wanted to drop out of the masters program so bad and move with him but my mom said NO and that I needed to worry about getting my education in FL. I was trying to convince her I could get my degree in CA but she wasn’t having it. So I stayed in FL to finish my Masters degree, I extended my lease, and I lived alone for the duration of the time. A year alone...yeah, I had friends at work and school, but nothing was like being with my soulmate. 
After I finished my Masters, I was so excited to walk the stage and move on with my life. I quit my job which turned out to be a place I didn’t see a future with and started living off of saved funds and money my fiancé would give me for rent. For graduation, my mom, her boyfriend, my brother, fiancé, and many other family members came down to FL to celebrate. Then, my fiancé and I told my mom that we would finally marry, but in a courthouse. This way we can save money on unnecessary wedding expenses, make extra cash from the military, and avoid traveling back home to MD. She then told us NO that we needed a wedding and that I was her only daughter. She didn’t want us to take this precious moment from her by getting married in the courthouse. She said that we could come home in two months and we could get married there. She told us she would pay for it and it would be a small family wedding. My fiancé was telling me not to give into her manipulation and that I have listened to her all the time in the past. He said I never make my own decisions, and now I know that he was right. 
I gave into my mom anyway and said okay let’s do it.

Next thing I knew, she has a huge wedding venue and starts a guest list of 100 people! What? And 50% of the people on the list, I didn’t even know. There were people from her job and her friends. I asked her about the size of the wedding. I thought it was too big and I didn’t even get to pick the venue. At this time, I’m in FL while she is planning the wedding for MD. She literally chose EVERYTHING. She chose decorations, cake, venue, dress, shoes, guest list, and the bridal party. I didn’t want a bridal party and she forced me to get one. So I have to be responsible for all these people and I don’t like dealing with people because they don’t communicate well and they’re unorganized. After a while of planning, the costs of the wedding started to rise and my mom was pissed that no one was helping her with the bill, hence my fiancé’s parents. Well, my outlook on this is that the wedding was her idea and everyone else knew we wanted to get married in the courthouse, so how could she mad if no one has the money available for the wedding bill. So she takes her anger out on me because she claims I don’t appreciate her and all the money she put into the wedding. This pisses me off because she put herself in this position, not me. 
And remember that additional 35% of savings she promised me? Well I never got it. So asked politely, in the nicest way possible, was she able to still gift me the funds promised. She said NO because the wedding is getting expensive. First off I know how much the wedding costs. If you are claiming you spent the money you promised me on the wedding that means I paid for almost 70% of the wedding that I did Not want in the damn first place! I didn’t even get any say on the wedding at all! I was livid but kept my cool.
My fiancé agreed that it was f’ed up how everything went down too. We are one week away from the wedding and my mom literally only paid for my dress and told me to fend for myself on makeup, jewelry, hair, nails, and shoes. This is not what I wanted. I do not feel like a bride. I feel like a pun, I feel like she is living her life through me, and I think she needs help. I will be so glad when this wedding is over.
She keeps telling me how I’m overweight and I need to take weight loss pills, she took in my homeless 22 yr cousin which she makes me clean up after while I’m here in MD visiting, and she gets mood swings and takes it out on me. She talks about how she feel unappreciated, well, I feel used and I feel like what I want doesn’t matter anymore.
I wish that I could go back to my young self and say that there’s a breaking point called a limit. Don’t give up your free will because your mom may be disappointed in you. Do what’s best for you and what will truly make you happy. LIVE. I will follow my own advice after this is over, I owe it to myself. It’s long overdue. There’s so much more I can add but it’s too much. What should I really do to cope with this issue? It’s giving me unnecessary anxiety.",20Sep2018,2

174,"Hey everyone

To start off with please excuse any ignorance that may show in this post

So there was this children’s book from the 1800s that got passed down generations of my family called Little Black sambo. Basically about this boy who encounters some tigers and they steal his clothes and umbrella and eventually even gets them back. Anyway the visual of the tiger with the umbrella I fucking love and I think it’s cool quirky and cute. Here’s a few examples from a couple of different illustrated versions - https://imgur.com/a/sgIDteE

But the issue is that in recent times the book has been called out for having racist connotations towards Indian people particularly, for some of the terms used in the book and also the way the boy and his family were depicted in the earlier illustrations. 

The book has since been rewritten and illustrated to basically not be racist and the tiger with the umbrella is still there. 

Anyway I just really like the idea of the umbrella tiger as a tattoo and would get it redrawn in a different style to all of the illustrations, but would it be deemed racist if I did? Because I’m sort of getting a tattoo derived from what was originally a racially stereotyped children’s book?

The main reason I want it is purely because I just like the idea of a tiger with an umbrella but I suppose it is special in a sense that it was a book that I loved as a child (obviously not knowing it was racist then). But mostly just because of the tiger with an umbrella I think it looks cool. 

To give some background I am a white person. I am completely against racism (as everyone should be) and the last thing I want to do is cause offence to anyone by getting this tattoo but I’m genuinely not sure on whether this could be deemed as racist so I figured to ask a community where people are educated and interested in the topic. If I wasn’t so obsessed with the idea I would have probably just forgotten about it and moved on but I’ve never been so keen on a tattoo idea this much in my life. 

Thank you!!!",20Sep2018,14
175,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

This is a bit of a different problem (and admittedly less serious) than the ones posted on this sub, but I am in a bit of a pickle here. I have asked my family for their opinions on this but wanted to see what advice others may have for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am signed up for an Anatomy &amp; Physiology class that begins next week. About 2-3 months ago, my family planned a vacation/cruise for November 4th through November 11th. This would cause me to miss 4 classes total-- two of them being lab days (15 points/day for a total of 30 points/lab), and two of them being in-class days, in which I would be missing in class activities. I received the syllabus from the professor today and you cannot make up her labs. If you miss a lab day, you miss the points for that lab. She has two slips to excuse the in-class days, so I would likely not be deducted points for that, but I would be missing the points for that lab.

&amp;#x200B;

This is one of the last classes I have to complete in order to apply for a program that I am extremely interested in. I want to get the highest grade possible and learn as much information as possible. This class is known for being quite difficult and I know that missing even on week would likely mess me up and I would be behind. I do care about the points, but I also genuinely want to learn about this subject so I want to be on top of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have two options here: I either go on the cruise and miss a week of class, resulting in a worse grade, or, I don't go on the cruise and attend every single class and lab, but lose $1500. My ticket for the cruise is $1000, and cancelling now would mean I would have to pay 50% of that as a fee, for a total of $1500. While that is a lot of money, I am thinking my education is more important, but I just don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I have contacted the professor and asked if there is anything I can do to get ahead to lose as little points as possible, but I totally understand and respect her policies. I do not expect her to make an exception for me but I wanted to contact her and see if she has any suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate any advice on this.

183,"TL; DR: can’t save money, have no free time, no peace of mind at home. Feel obligated to take on the burden of everyone else in family with no support of my own. 

My parents are now at the age where they can’t take care of themselves (retirement age) and my older siblings aren’t helping either. I’ll try to keep this short and summarize my situation. 

My father is an alcoholic who has either 3 or 4 DUI’s he obviously has legal issues. Since he lost his license I have been forced to drive him everywhere including to and from his work everyday including my mother who never learned how to drive. This drastically cuts into my availability of my day for my own work and school. 

My mother is a very wonderful and kind woman but she’s too nice to the point other people take advantage of her including my brother. Her debt is crazy high and I help her out financially whenever I can but it’s never enough. She’s always asking me to max my credit card or overdraft myself for her which I no longer can do anymore. I can’t save money when she’s constantly asking for my help with no repayment back from her. 

My first older brother has Schizophrenia and I have to stay home to always babysit his behavior to make sure he doesn’t go off on a tirade and drink his medication. So our neighbor don’t complain to the landlord. We been forced to move before because of him. On top of that he smokes and drinks alcohol every week making it even harder to relax at home when he does have his moments. 

And finally the bane of my existence my second older brother. My moms personal favorite. She got him a 2010 Mercedes Benz in her name which he was supposed to pay off. The problem? 

My brother can never hold down a job of his own and wants to live the luxurious life! So whenever he has a major payment due: like his court fees, car payments, insurance, plates, bridge tolls, when his car gets towed or fights with his wife... HE ALWAYS RUNS TO OUR MOM!!! Who can’t always help him financially or emotionally most of the time who then turns to me. 

My family don’t  bothers to understand me anymore and lash out at me for resisting this burden of 4 other people on me. I feel defeated because of my lack of independence of being held finically and emotionally held hostage.

184,"Throw away account due to fear I suppose of it being attached to my actual account.

Basically, I’m coming to the internet and this community of reddit specifically in hope of finding some kind of guidance or help. I’m in and have been in a bad place for a long time now. Without going into too much detail, I’ve been dealing with and trying to overcome depression for a long time now, but I feel more now than ever at my age current age of 24, I need to get my shit together. I dropped out of high school with only 6 months left to graduation, in doing so losing a few scholarships I had lined up and throwing away a college fund my grandparents had set up for me. The plan was to save up enough for a car and “move to Alaska to live off the grid” when in reality all I had in mind was snow and a shotgun. While I know suicide is the ultimate selfish act I wanted to do as much as I could to prevent causing too much pain to my family. Obviously, that didn’t work out and while I’ve had suicidal thoughts I’ve never actually attempted suicide. Since then I’ve gotten my GED and worked a trade job for a bit until a former coworker introduced me to my new job doing inspections for power plants. The job itself pays well but requires me to be away from home often, I have a girlfriend of 4 years and a dog, which is difficult for me. I guess the point of this post is that I feel like what I need out of life is a career that will provide me fulfillment and give me what I consider a live worth living. What that means to me is a job that involves helping people and making a genuine difference. The hope is that finding this will fill that void in me. I simply just don’t know what to do though, I’m not in a situation where I can afford to go to school and cover living expenses, I have no family to live with, so I must support myself and my girlfriend. However, I am currently paying for her to go to school full time to become a nurse. When she’s done with school we’ve talked about trading places and letting her be the breadwinner while I pursue my education. While I don’t fear the time of going to school I do have a fear of the debt involved. The internet does a wonderful job of showcasing how screwed over some people get and while money isn’t the endgame for me, there’s no denying the stress involved when you’re struggling. I’ve looked through various articles and plenty of lists of what are considered fulfilling careers and ones in which you’re helping others. Teachers, Doctors, Veterinarians, Cops, but I’ve yet to find “that one”. Given, I don’t even know if such a thing exists.. It seems like I’m trying to rely on finding a job that’s going to fix me and that one day I’ll be a happy person. I just don’t know if that’s even going to solve my problems, but I do know that it won’t make things worse.

186,"I honestly am not sure if posting here will help... this kinda feels like an impulse but I suppose it couldn't hurt to post. My father died a couple of months ago from liver cancer. I still remember it vividly. I had been taking care of him that day (The nurses weren't in his room all the time and my dad would try to get up to do things rather than use the buzzer so thats why i needed to be there the whole day) and he seemed as he was for the last couple of weeks... 

I had taken him out for a few smokes, taken him up to the garden area and he even asked if I could take him for laps up and down the path outside in his wheelchair (Which were some of his last words that day). Around 2 pm a nurse came in when he was asleep and said his condition had gotten worse since the morning (somehow i didn't even realise) and that I should call my family to come say goodbye.

At 8:30 pm he passed away in his sleep. Since then I haven't even had the will to go on with studying or doing things I would generally do... I quit my course... I asked a social worker for different options and hopefully that works out well but overall i still feel empty... how can I move on from his death and get to the stage where I can have the will to move forward in life? 

Any advice would really help... thankyou for reading",20Sep2018,1
187,"Backstory: this guy is someone I've talked to online for about a decade and have come to love as a friend. Recently met in person when I flew out to where he lives for a week to visit (I'm in the US, he's in Europe).

For the past few months we've been dating and I truly love him and he makes me incredibly happy, even tho our relationship is long distance. But, I also have some concerns......
Right now, I'm not really affected by the fact that he doesn't work since there's an ocean between us, but I'm worried. He hasn't worked in 5+ years now due to being a full time college student that whole time, but unfortunately he didn't pass this past year and has had to drop out of school rather than go more into debt. This was about 4months ago and he's still barely searched for a job. 
I've tried to be supportive in my advice but he doesn't seem to listen to it. Like, he wants to get into a labor field like construction and has basically refused to consider applying for anything else (like food service/ retail) even if it's just to get the job experience until something better comes along. I ask him what he's doing just as a conversation starter like on the phone, but my answers are usually just ""watching _____"" ""playing _____"" and it doesn't seem like he's being proactive in finding a job.....

** I should say too that I work a very demanding full time job as a truck driver. I work upwards of 14hrs a day, stay out on the road for weeks at a time, and last year I brought in over $52k. I'm a hard worker and have a good work ethic, so the fact that he's unemployed and doesn't seem to have any ambition is starting to eat at me.  There are things later in life that I want (like kids, stability, etc.) that I can't have with someone who doesn't work and isn't ambitious to do so. Those things are a ways off, but him and I are pretty serious already and it's something I need to consider I feel before I get in much deeper.

After the night, my best friend and I didn’t get along well for 2 days, until he told me something’s wrong. He told me I hurt his feelings when on the drunken night, I told him I didn’t care about him. 

I don’t really remember everything I said that night. I know I really hurt him because he went out for a drink the other night with two of our coworkers, who also our friends. They got really drunk, even cut his own hair, which his girlfriend told me as his way of moving on. He was throwing up when he got home. 

The next day, I apologized to him. I told him I shouldn’t have said that, and I acknowledged my fault. I also told him that I care and value our friendship.

191,"So, my fiancé and brother in law (bil) knew this girl, [], way before I came into the picture. Anyway, she popped up, homeless and living in the park. So , my bil, out of the goodness of his heart, opened our home to her. She's okay at first, pitching in for housework and all that jazz. Thing is, she's a bad drunk. She dented my wall and spilled her nasty beer all over my side of the bed. She said she liked my fiancé when they were younger because he never tried to touch her, then turns around and tries to tell him that they slept together at his apartment. But they didn't because she's describing living room of his apartment, and she's a ho. My fiancé didn't want any of that. One night while I'm at work, she gets drunk and decides she going to crawl into my mother in laws bed while my 13 year old brother in law is in there too, without any pants or underwear, because she didn't notice that they had fallen off! Then comes the day my bil kicked [] out. Unbeknownst to me at the time, before she came back here, she had been down at my in laws, had called my Mema a cunt and tried to hit her after my Mema slapped her for calling her that. Mema HATES that word. But anyway, my brother in law comes home and asks [] to move a little because it's his bed and he wants to sleep. She gets violent, and punches him in the face. He doesn't touch her, but he does break her phone. Then he has to break down his own door to physically carry her out of our house. Then she tried to fight my mother in law. At this point, me and my fiancé have come outside, and []s hand is in my mother in laws bun, so my fiancé throws her down the drive way. She gets in the car that came to pick her up, but she's still talking shit, when she mentions our animals getting hit. We'd lost two babies a few weeks prior, and my dog had got hit by a car a few years before. It's a sensitive topic for me, so I lost my shit, and blacked out on her. I remember screaming ""Do you know when to shut the fuck up!!?"" and shaking her by her hair. And thats it. 
Somehow, my uncle in law is infatuated with her. So she's been down there a while. First, she steals twice from my Pepa, but I'm guessing my uncle in law whined enough for Mema to let [] come back. 
This second time however, she told my bil that he was going to die alone and by killing himself. So mema threw coffee on her, and then [] tried to hit her, again. A 70 year old woman who has had open hear surgery :))
So now she's gone from the surrounding property. But then she posts a comment on Facebook saying ""(Bils name) is a big man who hits women."" I have screenshots of her agreeing with me about the truth. I told her ""You and I both know that his uncle would have tried to knock the shit out of him if he had laid a finger on you."" And she says ""Right."" Meaning, it didn't happen because Mema would have told me, and my bil would probably have a few bruises from that, if he had laid a finger on her. I requested an audience to speak to her because I have so much to say. I told my uncle in law ""I'm this close to exploding."" And he replied with ""You explode, I explode."" And he had previously called me a ""Fat ugly bitch"" Because I asked her to bring the puppies back down. My brother in law works in a town of people who'd be dumb enough to attack him without getting the whole story.  I know you don't know my brother in law, but if he was violent towards women, he'd have hit [] when she punched him in the face. She told him to watch his back the next few weeks, and I am so angry with her about a lot of things, but that takes the cake. We opened our house to her, and she shit all over us. She abandoned her child, basically, when her sisters kicked her out. Her family is more capable of forgiving her than we are. If my brother in law gets hurt because of her, I will lose my shit. Probably worse than when she got kicked out, because I'll keep a clear mind this time. I really want to call her out on all this shit, but the title to my car is under my uncle in laws name, and I can't transfer the title until I get a current vehicle inspection report, and the car needs repair. The only mechanal savvy person around us is my uncle in law :)) So I have to sit here and stew in this anger because I can't let [] get away with all this, but I have no choice really right now, because I can't afford everything I need for the car all at once, and I need to be aware of any retaliation she might try to do to us. It's just so stressful and angering. Now people from their past have messaged my fiancé about what Chrissy posted and that is so worriesome. I talked to her through my coworkers Facebook, because I'm waiting until I can make my move, so she has no idea who my coworker is, or on whose behalf my coworker is speaking. Shows how dumb she is though, because my co-workers page says where we work as her workplace. She's out here telling complete strangers to her that my brother in law slapped her. So who else has heard this? Who is gonna be a dumb and come attack my brother in law on her behalf? I just feel like the world would be a bit better if she wasnt even in it. I've never felt like this about anyone and I hate that I'm so mad about it, but this is my family you're threatening, and that doesn't sit right with me :( I don't even want to call him my uncle in law anymore because once I get what I need from him I don't want anything to do with him. He basically said ""Fuck you"" to all of us when he chose her over his FAMILY.  He chose to hang out with her instead of celebrating my fiancés  birthday with us. He can go with her for all I care. It was fine anyway though, we didn't want him there in the first place, but you didn't have to say that. He said and I quote ""No disrespect, but I made plans with [].""

193,"Was hoping to get some opinions on this. My now ex broke up with me 4 months ago suddenly. To give detail, he told me we needed to talk, he picked me up and parked a bit up my street. He dumped me, and said it was never going to work and that he still 'loved' me. I walked home. Since then he never bothered to contact me. I feel like after spending that much time together, he should have at least checked in with me - as he saw how hurt I was and how bad I must have been feeling? Maybe its not a common thing for people to contact their exes afterwards, but when you know how much you would have hurt someone...I thought they would have made contact to make sure I was okay. I'm glad I never caved him and contacted first. About a month after I decided to delete him as a friend on facebook, then i noticed a day later he had blocked me. I found it funny. Then around a week ago, I saw that he had unblocked me...what does that even mean? Was he trying to check up on me - thoughts? Thank you, just wondering others thoughts :)

194,"Please excuse the crude title, but it’s literally my question. Also please excuse me if the story is a ramble because I am very upset and I feel so traumatized and anxious right now. I just need help sorting this out. 

Background: 

I am married. I am barely 120 pounds and I’m weak as heck. I have a history of issues with dissociation and anxiety, there’s schizophrenia in my family etc... I am susceptible to feeling adverse effects of everything from alcohol to Benadryl. Anything mind altering is dangerous for me. 

TL;DR at the bottom 

So with that being said, I had weed and watched a movie with a mutual friend me and my husband have. My husband was gone all night for work. Me and the friend were watching a movie and I got high on weed, he was 100% sober. After the movie ended I ended up slipping out of reality like I’ve never felt before. No I am sure I was no roofied by the friend. But i literally lost my mind, it wasn’t me anymore. There isn’t much I remember. Anyhow this friend tried comforting me but was fucking with me on purpose at the beginning which made the trip worse I think. Late in the night we ended up having sex, and apparently I was instigating all of it. The next morning I asked the friend if my husband came home in the middle of the night. He said no. I figured I must have had a weird sex dream, but I could have sworn I had sex with my husband or something. 

Anyhow, I wanted to ask the friend how bad I got last night but he wanted to tell me in person. He picks me up and we drive around and I’m asking questions and he’s answering them, I was very surprised because I didn’t remember so much of how I was being. I ended up asking him again if he was sure my husband didn’t come home in the night. He said he didn’t. I asked him if me and him did anything. He said that I tried to kiss him a lot but he stopped me. I was apologizing so much and I was very embarrassed. I ended up asking if it went further than that and he said no. I was relieved until I said “I’m glad because I’d want to know if you used protection or not so I could get a plan b pill. That would have all been a nightmare!” But he got quiet and then admitted that we did have sex. I won’t bother describing the shock I felt. I got the pill. I cried a lot. He was very upset and felt guilty too, clearly. 

I ended up coming home and collapsing and telling my husband everything I knew. I never accused the friend of raping me, I was just so shocked and scared. My husband was very upset and after all day of trying to help me he ended up sending a text to the friend saying something to the effect off “you didn’t just have sex with your best friends wife, you raped your best friends wife” etc... 

Well anyhow, the friend ends up sending a long message describing to me how he was really scared of me the whole night and that he was wondering all day if he was raped by me. He even threw in the fact that guys can get erections if they don’t want to. He said he felt too ashamed to tell Ian because ya know “guys can’t be raped” which is bullshit because they can but he’s implying that he was raped and nobody will ever believe him. He told me I took off my pants and I was trying to take his pants off. He said he was frozen in shock and he was crying and he said my eyes were closed the whole time. He was making me sound like a demon monster, which in his defense I was probably being really weird and stuff. He was a Virgin before all of this and has had no experience with girls whatsoever and he says that he has issues with physical stuff because he was bullied as a kid for his appearance (he’s a good looking guy, but he has really low self esteem). 

I know he was on top of me the whole time we had sex, but he implied that I was on top of him. I know for a fact I wasn’t. He said that I was trying to rip his pants down but all I remember is fiddling with the buckle. 

I was already traumatized enough by knowing he had sex with me and I thought it was my husband, but now he’s accusing me of rape basically which is even worse and completely invalidates how I feel. He was 100% sober and I was the one who was impaired and couldn’t make decisions. But he sounded like he was genuinely terrified or something, is it possible that I literally raped him?? He claimed he didn’t move for an hour after we had sex and that he buried his face in the couch and was crying, etc... it literally kills me to think I could have hurt him but at the same time I feel like some things don’t add up. 

TL;DR 
I was dangerously high and out of my mind and very impaired and still don’t remember much, friend was 100% sober and tried helping me. In the middle of the night we had sex apparently but I thought it was my husband. I do remember instigating it with kissing, I thought it was my husband after all and would never cheat on him. Turns out it was the friend who was there the whole time. He says he was terrified of me and feels like he was raped, but only said that after my husband accused him of raping me. But he did sound like he was genuinely paralyzed with fear. I am afraid that I am the one who raped him, and if not, then I’m severely upset knowing that he really seems to think I raped him even though I didn’t. ",20Sep2018,2

Wont let me do anything when she is angry, doesnt sign school paperwork and wants me to fail in school although she pretends that she wants me to succeed. Shes 10000x worse than any bully i have ever had, no jokes, I seem and probably am quite social, mature n tough, based on others n my own opinion, but only my mother.can make me depressed or even sob tears.

Another thing she keeps insulting is that i dont have friends n call my existing friends fake and that they hate me.


My dad doesnt help because he claims that his new wife hates me, but i doubt thats the whole story why a ""father"" would let his son to die and rot away.

207,"Said friend and I met on a writing platform and our friendship formed through that hobby. Ever since we’ve met a couple of times in real life, but nothing too spectacular. Half a year ago she quit the hobby. Our friendship might have formed through this platform, but it didn’t limit itself to it. We love the same tv shows, love the same video games, talk about hiking and generally share lots of interests together. Now she is still there, but I feel like chatting has lessened ever since which she often puts aside due to the fact that she is busy. While we often had the weekends for chatting these now are sometimes even worse than weekdays. This wouldn’t be a problem and totally understandable, because everyone gets busy. Though her being busy is going grocery shopping, not meeting friends irl because she doesn’t really have them. I’ve tried to encourage her to find new friends in the new town she moved to, but nada (she does occasionally meet old friends from across the country every other month or so). 

In a way though, I feel like I’ve lost a connection to her as well through the topics we talk about. Whenever we do talk it is often about trivialities instead of really talking. When we do get to converse and actually chat it is about shows that she loves and I dislike, video games that she is playing, etc. And this is in between days in which she solely complains to me about her day. I always feel like an asshole for feeling the way I do, but our friendship used to be on more mutual terms – in which we talk about things that interest us both. Nowadays I feel more like a listener to her problems and her hobbies. She does try to connect, though, but it still does feel like a five minute conversation, oftentimes about the same aspect over and over again (her love for one dog in the one tv show I currently enjoy). We used to try and start video gaming together which lasted for two sessions before she got busy again.

At the end of the day some days have become very draining to be the listener in our friendship. I have pretty bad family relations as well, things which I used to mention to her, but stopped with them altogether. In a way I can emphasise with her, but the complaints she got are often shortlived issues with her mum about discussing dog training. She’s in her mid-twenties btw – if any of you are surprised by the family issues she got – aka she is still living at her parents. 

There is so much about our friendship that I used to like and adore, but I don’t really feel like it anymore. Whenever there are great news in my life she used to hear about them first (or was among the first people that I wanted to tell) but nowadays I noticed there are other people I want to tell rather than her, which often happened due to her completely ignoring what I was talking about in the first place.

It’s difficult to say the least, **but I want this friendship still**. While I’ve got great friends irl I do have (or used to have) a pretty good relationship with her. We used to be really excited getting to chat with one another, but especially her leaving the platform became a problem. Now there is a lot of empty room that isn’t really getting filled again anymore. And that empty room either is left out entirely or filled with something about tv shows I dislike and cannot stand hearing of anymore. I’ve been trying to listen and have avoided any kind of confrontation because she means a lot to me, but I feel exhausted and tired whenever talking about herself. Whenever she does mention topics (especially these about the old platform we used to be on) I am not really sure on how to react anymore: I know she tries to find a connection between us and wants to talk about it, but I don’t really see it anymore. Recently, she tried to re-enact stories we’ve written together on in sims, which, tbh, I super didn’t understand. Like, I rather she would talk about this with me instead of sit in front of a computer screen, but ya know. Today I saw her talking about wanting to write again, but not on that platform anymore. Instead it’s going to be fanfiction, which, to be honest – it’s her decision and it’s great she is writing again. But then again, it will be about the tv show I dislike and I will sit through two full weeks of hearing about this ship here and this character that she would love to fuck there (I am not even kidding on that one). I want to be a good friend and listen to the things that she is interested in as well (this is such a bad sentence coming right after the fucking one, but let’s not connect that) but if it takes up too much space (which it does) then I don’t really know anymore.

The mutual connection we might have established with the gaming doesn’t happen anymore apart of the fact she does got time to play every other game on earth. Neither do we really talk about many mutual interests anymore and when we do it feels half-hearted. Point is, I know her well enough to know she isn’t doing this “I am busy” statement out of spite or on purpose. I think she is really that bad when it comes to timing things. But I have no idea how to talk with her about it, because whenever we do it ends up in a huge argument. I get to 180 real quick and she twists things – long story short, we both don’t do us any good in that matter. 

It’s just … we are best friends. I do care about her, otherwise I wouldn’t think about it and otherwise I wouldn’t even bother writing something up here. But I have no idea on how to approach this anymore – I feel like the distance that has grown ever since her leaving that platform, the amount of times I’ve become the listener and the issues with schedule that surely on the weekends don’t have anything to do with time zones? I don’t know how to fix this again anymore, and honestly, fixing has always been my part in this.",20Sep2018,3

210,"Well it all started with meeting a girl and sooner or later we hung out everyday for hours on end. She spent more time with me than with her boyfriend. 

We really got along great and I thought how great of a friend I found. 

I wasn't too sure about my feelings for her. We didn't do anything just were really great friends I thought, and I never thought about doing anything with her because of her boyfriend. 

I didn't get her signals and at one night I just told her how I feel about her. But that was too late, she already met a new guy and at that point she said we should stay friends there shouldn't be anything between us and that she doesn't feel the same way as I do - and then she kissed me and we made out for some minutes. Totally perplexed about what happened this was the beginning of a monthlong break between us.

Then we met again and I thought, fine I can live with that rejection, still have my best girl friend and still enjoy her company and so did she!

Then there were two experiences which are now (months later) replaying in my head and that fucks me up for good.

Well the first one was that we were partying, she and I and some other guys went to someone's place.
I notice how she and that one guy are under one blanket and getting fingered by him.
Shortly after she asked one guy if they could use one room I left.

The second one was similar but this time they went in the bathroom and went full-on.
I heard his and her moaning...I left after the came back out of the bathroom.

Some months later we met again and at this point I felt that we lost our friendship, that fact devastated me. I was trying to fix it and end up with my best friend again. 

I talked with her again about our time we shared, everyday doing something fun or just sitting somewhere and talking about life and everything.
I asked her, if she ever thought about having something with me. She did and said I never gave her the feeling that I wanted something from her - still she was with her boyfriend.
She confessed to me that she even cheated on her boyfriend and that was the guy who spent time with her after we fell apart. I somehow felt that if I had done anything she would have cheated with me on her boyfriend. Whatever I didn't take the shot and I can live with that. Would have been nice with her to loose my virginity. But I don't mind could have been nice but there will be many more and better options in my future I know that.

Unbeknownst to me these two experiences fucked me up for good.
I now really struggle to see her, but the future results will be that we grow more and more apart if I don't do something about it. I really like her as a person, there are no romantic feelings for her. 
I want to have her as a friend back and not be paralysed by my past.

This all happened in the first three months of this year and had something with two other girls which...ended up with that I couldn't get an errection. I was a bit baffled as I thought I liked these girls but I just couldn't do it. Didn't give much thought to this but now I think I get it.

Im still totally devastated by what happened more or less in front of my eyes. I am pretty sure at first I held back my thoughts and feelings and didn't think much about it. Because after all she isn't interested in me and she can do what she wants. 

I guess I need to see someone first before I approach her. I need to work through this to better my future.

So do you think it would be good for me to see her? Try to reconnect with her? Or would it worsen my problem?
After all I want her friendship back.

211,"My best friend is one of those people that always has a lot going on their lifes. He's always fighting with his boyfriend, they break up all the time but come back later because they're stubborn and miss each other even thou it's clear they have a very toxic relationship. He has depression, and is very sensitive , so I spent half of our time together either conforting him or listening to his fight with his bf. Also his dad got cancer, so you can tell he's going through a lot. But somehow I just can't deal with all of it anymore, there's just so much drama. Some times it feels like he just doesn't deal with because he's weak and so negative, and can't think racionally. I want him to be strong and stop overthinking sometimes, but it seems like my advices are just invisible. I feel like I might start to hate him if I don't say anything...

212,"He's a former drug addict. He recovered from that, but is an idiot now who decides to damage public and private property as his free time hobby. He go an iron stick and smashed street signs with it, also steals side mirrors from people he doesnt like, etc.. 

So, I want to break contact with him. I'm sure he doesn't do anything to me (I mean, attacking and stuff), but I would like to ensure that he doesn't start damaging or stealing things from me or the people I live with. We don't have security cams and cant afford them, so getting evidence of such things would be difficult, when he'd do it.

213,"So this person is literally just a work colleague. We barely speak more than to casually say hi when we pass each other. 

We were scheduled on the same lunch break today and I can't remember how or why she started telling me this, but she told me she ""drinks more than her alcoholic husband"". The other day she drank ""two bottles of wine, half a bottle of Baileys and 2 cans of beer! Was completely out of it by 9pm! Didn't even get a hangover!""

Her shift starts at 6:30am, she would be well over the limit by the time she drives in if she's drinking the night before work.

I'm thinking about talking to her next time we're on lunch together (but because of our shift that won't be till next week), to see if I can gauge if she was joking, or what. At the moment, that's the extent of my knowledge. I don't know if she drinks all the time. I don't know if she was being serious or joking. 

But with this information, what happens if she has an accident or kills someone before then? 

I don't know what her car plate number is either (although I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult to find out - but again that would be next week). 

Is there any point going to the police? Should I talk to a supervisor? Talk to her myself? 

It's a pretty sore point for me because my Mother was an alcoholic and I actually phoned the police about her drink driving (because I knew 100% she was doing it). 

I'm in the UK if that helps.",20Sep2018,1
214,"Was hoping to get some opinions on this. My now ex broke up with me 4 months ago suddenly. To give detail, he told me we needed to talk, he picked me up and parked a bit up my street. He dumped me, and said it was never going to work and that he still 'loved' me. I walked home. Since then he never bothered to contact me. I feel like after spending that much time together, he should have at least checked in with me - as he saw how hurt I was and how bad I must have been feeling? Maybe its not a common thing for people to contact their exes afterwards, but when you know how much you would have hurt someone...I thought they would have made contact to make sure I was okay. I'm glad I never caved him and contacted first. About a month after I decided to delete him as a friend on facebook, then i noticed a day later he had blocked me. I found it funny. Then around a week ago, I saw that he had unblocked me...what does that even mean? Was he trying to check up on me - thoughts? Thank you, just wondering others thoughts :)

At the moment she attends University (hence the 'on and off') but afterwards I want to make sure she has decent foundations when she finishes her course.   
Although she absolutely loves caring for people, there is a big part of her that wants to make a more significant impact in society and I believe she would be amazing in a position where she can work up and lead with campaigns in the third sector, rather than following.

216,"I'll try to keep it quick. I came from a pretty bad place and it had an incredible impact on my life and the lives of those around me. I regret many things I have done, but also have always tried to not let my actions waste; I try with each new second to allow my failings or missteps alongside successes or triumphs to influence my thought pattern, that I might exude as much positivity outwardly possible.

I was never very well adjusted due to my sob story and sordid selections. Run of the mill issues of impulsivity, aggressive behavior, cruelty, hyper sensitivity, and etc. All the trappings of a trauma survivor. As I've aged I've leveled considerably but this instance has been bugging me lately. 

I was sent to an alternative school due to my issues. Upon arriving I was appointed to the care of a psychologist. During the time I spent at this school we would meet for therapy in groups, individually, and in a familial setting. I made as much progress as I could at the time but was well steeped in denial and still an adolescent. Eventually I left the school. I thought this person was helpful but do recall, a few times, feeling particularly uncomfortable. Catching this person looking up my shorts during session and similar subtle but uncomfortable and confusing circumstances. I recall feeling at the time as though I might have been mired in misperception. Altogether, and in fairness, my view of them was one of affection and respect. I did, after all and with their help, make some progress. 

Fast forward 4 years. I've been away the school at least this much time. I am now a legal adult. My life is really falling apart and I don't know what to do. I get in touch with this person because they are my only link to stratagems of release that I've known that aren't incredibly self destructive. I was having a hyper difficult time. They relate that we may have sessions and it would be *pro bono* and I am incredibly relieved. I proceed to delineate some of what troubles me but the relationship morphs and forms into one of what I perceive to be gross misconduct. Here's a redacted version of what unfolds. 

We begin contacting each other with SMS. What began innocuously turns friendly and then romantic. We then begin to discuss this in our sessions. This person has a family and offspring. These short messages become ceaseless and constant, and I'd been encouraged to protect their identity with a false name in my contacts. We converse on the phone openly and message back and forth with a great frequency. This novel, and now proclaimed, mutual affection/attraction manifests and begins to burgeon and cross succinctly into the physical realm. We continue to meet for some time. Sometimes I mention that I am concerned about my financial position and they offer me funds. I refuse. We practice physical displays of affection. Eventually we stop because of a particular event and I am left abruptly out in the cold. I am told to go back to my world and they'll remain in theirs. I still have the cellular that has our conversations from these days long past. 

I have a lot of issues. Over the years I've twisted and turned this event over in my head. I thought of contacting their SO, their offspring, or their employer and displaying the proof in order that I could relate how this relationship had so deeply affected me. When I turned to them I had no where else to go, and in the wake of it all my trust was so thoroughly and completely trashed. I lost all faith in the therapeutic process and it was what I needed more than anything. I feel like I've lost years of my life. 

Looking back I stand in awe of the gravity of this experience. I fell into a pattern of horrid behaviors and fostered awful relationships with people identical, though not professionals. I only blame myself for lacking the wherewithal to press forth and rectify my person. I found it easier then to spend time with people that played genuine and would placate. By this I mean that when I would discuss feeling inadequate and in need of professional guidance they would quickly discount it and produce some drug or another to dispel my discontent. My consumption Theron was completely my own design and I don't hold anyone accountable but myself. 

Upon recounting, I often shudder upon the remembrance of this person issuing the following words. ""There's a student here and he reminds me so much of you""

Recently I've made more progress then in a lot of my life. It was difficult realizing the oft occurring confluences of connected complexity and staggering depths of deception and deceit that the relationships I'd fostered, after this, had, but I have and am so much the better. 

I'm ready to deal with this. I want to approach this person, surely confident that I will be able in a proper manner. I reckon it's time our worlds collide! I want to look upon them and deliver in the calm voice I've strived laboriously to earn, these words... ""I'm ready to hear you say that you're sorry"" It sounds really dumb and dramatic now that I read it typed but it would mean the world to me. If this were just another sour relationship, whatever, I'd let it go but they used their post, expertise, and all they knew about me to manipulate and use me so fully. 

I don't have any real interest in involving their employer, family, or anyone else in this matter but my girlfriend thinks I should. She told me that it is my duty to involve their employer in order that this not recur with another person. I am not sure what I ought do. I believe in forgiveness and know not a single person is flawless. Perhaps they realized the gravity of it all as I did and proceeded on purposefully, modulating constantly to avoid similar transgressions. I can't say, I just know what occurred in my life.

224,"I'm 21 and currently in Rome for one semester with Erasmus. For the past 4 years (maybe more) I've been trying to come to Europe but never quite managed it, my visa applications were rejected, I did not have the financial possibilities, etc. So for this chance to be here, my family and I, we put in a lot of effort and money. And now that I am here, I realize that this was a complete mistake on my part. I've been here for 9 days now, and the longest I had gone without my family was 3 days before this. I've met people here, I made friends, been to events, got invited to more and been told countless times by my new friends to not abandon this experience. However, their company is not enough to fill the space my family's absence leaves behind. My family is equally distressed, they keep messaging me and because they know I am sad, they keep telling me to come back home.  

Apart from the completely soul consuming homesickness, my current accommodation is an hour and a half away from the city, I live in the middle of nowhere. The closest supermarket is 15 minutes by foot + a bus. I was ready to burn my security deposit and cancel the contract, but I can't seem to find another accommodation closer to the city.  

Adding on to that, half of my classes are in Italian, and half are from Master's level. I'm a bachelor's with no knowledge of the language. And if I say, you know, screw the classes, I won't be paid 20% of my Erasmus grant. Seeing as I've already spent so much money here, it'd suck to stay here for the full duration and not get the full money.  

I was already dealing with depression and anxiety back home, and I feel like what improvements I have made in regards to that, will be completely thrown away if I stay here and try to get through the next 4 months (and 2 weeks).  

If I do leave, I will be throwing away all of the efforts and the money I've spent to be here, as well as my only chance to see my European friends (was planning a meetup in February). I will certainly feel like a disappointment. I don't know what results it will have in regards to my classes in my home country. I am already mad at myself for not being able to handle something everyone else sees as the best period of their life.  

&amp;#x200B;

226,"So basically we have 3 managers. But one only works mondays so he doesn’t count. Yesterday I learned that one manager is moving on and is getting an internship in her career which is great. 
This now only leaves with one manager. If they ask the guy who only works mondays to work more he’ll likely quit since he has another job and works more There. The main manager  doesn’t want to work any more than he already is. This will all take place in October as she won’t be there. 

I’m a worker and I’ve been there a year come October. I’m not sure what to expect in this coming weeks. I know it’s not that important but I was thinking about this before but now that it’s happened it’s actually real I guess. 

I’m not next in line but the person who is has only been there for like 2 years and apparently not long enough. The main manager even talked about quitting if they asked for too much time. We are all students btw. 

I’ll miss the manager leaving and everyone will too. Making everyone a bit salty. I doubt I’ll be asked to be a manager I’ve learned more stuff gaining responsibility but if was only after a certain time.

238,"Hello, my father is 43 and his persona has been deteriorating for sometime now. First of all he is very aggressive and quick to anger, when ever an incident happens he just says ""I am like a race car, when you press the gas I go all the way"". One particular incident (one of many) my mom was on the phone with a person that was interested in buying our used up RV, we originally wanted 35,000 $ for it but any reasonable person would take a look at the RV and realize its far from that price. Turns out the guy offered about 23,000$ and he was asking for honesty from my mom over the phone about the condition of the RV and he out of nowhere began shouting at us about our attempt on ""honesty"". He told us that honesty died away with greedy people and this country if you wanna make money you have to be a lying asshole. My guess why he is like this because he recently started getting into stocks with my moms money of course and I bet he thinks like he is some kind of hotshot at it.

Keep in mind we are from a different place on earth where such things like an RV are unheard of, we tried to explain to him that this is not the way things are done here and that honesty is important when it comes to big money business like this. But no he went apesh!t on us, we were in a hotel at the moment on the first floor so that means that reception heard us and others around. We tried to calm him down but he kept going at it telling us we don't have to be honest with people we never met. After he calmed down my mom started crying and we decided to leave an honestly nice trip until that day, it was an awful car ride on the way back. My mom usually sits next to him on the drivers seat but told me she wanted my seat on the back because she was pissed at him. Turns out he later accused me of wanting to keep them separated and went apesh!t at me aswell.

However bad this sounds this is not even as worst as other incidents like drunken rampages ect, but honestly its starting to get a toll on me. One day when he was drunk he revealed to me and my brother that he loved another women years ago and we might have had a sister now, I called him a piece of shit but he just said that he loved and that was not a crime. Currently he has started to listen to music completely alien to him, English pop songs for that matter. He always listened to Spanish songs from our country but suddenly he switched over to this, now you might be saying that this is a low hanging fruit to argue about but listen this is where it annoys me. In truth the Spanish songs got annoying for me and I hated listening to them so when he switched over I thought it was a good thing but no he managed to fuck this up to.

When he comes back from jogging and takes a dive on our our pool he puts on our music equipment and plays the same fucking track ( at 8 in them morning!!!!!!), the worst part is when the song imagine dragons : Believer comes on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wtfhZwyrcc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wtfhZwyrcc) .

Holy shit man he blast it at full volume and I feel like squidward in that one episode of spongebob when he is dancing with the jellyfish. What also worries me is that he spends a lot of time alone on the house because he is unemployed and sometimes I hear him outside whistleling at a hawk that lives near our house as to call him or something, this is because he saw that movie called ""Alpha"" and now he thinks he is some kind of animal whisperer .Now you can just counter me and bring out the memes ""haha 40 year old boomer dad"" or just simply tell me he is just going through a midlife crisis but that still does not explain the aggressiveness and lack of control for his emotions. 

How can me and my family possibly deal with this?",20Sep2018,2
239," My whole life I’ve always seen myself settling down somewhere far away from where I grew up and doing a ton of traveling. Growing up I always saw people who stayed close to where they grew up as ‘lame and boring’. Like they didn’t care about adventure or new experiences. 

I ended up living in New York for 4 years and also living in a different country for almost a year. Now I’m back around where I lived as a kid (about 30 miles away). The area is actually really cool for people my age, up and coming and there is a lot of opportunity. I also have a really great partner and friends, as well as my family around. 

But my partner wants to settle down here. She moved a lot as a kid and doesn’t want to uproot her life again. My goal is to build a community and have a family and be able to buy a house (which is affordable where I live now). 

Yet, I feel a sense of lameness and guilt for abandoning my dreams of living somewhere new. I feel like I am not as interesting of a person for settling down close to my hometown. Is it really that bad to live in the area you grew up? Do you see people as boring if they do that? Can you change your dreams over time and not feel like you betrayed yourself??

We already have two kids. She is not on BC because nothing works for her. She feels awful whatever she used, not even things without hormones. She cant stand condoms either. So we have been using the ""pulling-out method"". A couple of months ago when we started to get a better sexlife we realized that I could last even after I had finished. So during the summer I would pull out , finish , wipe it off and then continue. I often tried to do it as fast as possible so it wouldnt die down. And things were great.   


We were scared like 3-4 weeks ago when her period hadnt come. She did  a pregnancy test and she wasnt pregnant. The thing is that sometimes when I had wiped off everything and continued, I would sometimes feel that there was something stuck in the penis. I dont know if that is semen. The first time I didnt think much about it and the feeling that something was stuck in there got over. The same thing happened two weeks ago. I have never finished inside of her. It has been close but I never have.

252,"So, long story short, they're all friends. I'm cool with them all, but I spend most of my time at home with my boyfriend.

We have monthly house meetings where we think up ways to make the house run more efficiently. Cool, nice, good.

Issue is, since they all have an implicit bias to agree with one another (and talk over me), they keep thinking up stupid plans and going with them.

For example: The spices have been moved to the shelves so high that we all have to climb a ladder to get to, and the oils—which *used* to be on those shelves—are sitting on an open ledge directly above our gas stove. 

We also used to have individual shelves in the fridge. One of the roommates moved in and decided we didn't need them anymore. Therefore, different people's foods have been eaten because we all buy the same shit, and half the time I can't even find or reach my shit because the fridge is so stuffed and disorganized. Me and another roommate, thankfully, carried out a coup and returned to individual shelving, but rather than just doing mostly individuated sections throughout the whole kitchen, we now have to place *stickers* on our *shit* (except what's already separated in the fridge) to discern whose is what. I proposed just writing your initials on things that you buy that we might already have to avoid confusion. They said it wouldn't show up in the fridge because condensation, or something? And then moved on. 

They keep coming up with these needlessly circuitous plans for basic shit, and so running the household becomes complicated FOR NO REASON! *I* end up fixing the problems brought up by their plans—like introducing a task-based chore system after the ""system"" (people just clean whatever once a week?) they proposed fell to shit—but I want to be heard *in the first place*, not after their ideas don't work out. 

But whenever I say ""that seems needlessly complicated"" I'm told to deal with it as an individual. I only got to institute the task-based system last time *after a huge argument*, and recently I've been the only one doing my chores (because now we know exactly what we each have to do) even though one roommate *literally insulted me* when I fell behind on the dishes one week...which led to the ensuing argument in the first place!

What do I do here? I don't know how to disagree with them in a way that will allow me to be heard. It's like every time I point out that there's a much simpler way to do things, I'm gaslit and basically treated like *I'm* wrong.",20Sep2018,3

So I knocked again. Nothing. I left a note explaining the situation and wrote down my email and phone number and ""or just come downstairs and we can discuss it."" Never heard a word from them.

Up until now I haven’t really known the full extent of this until about a week ago when I was informed that he hates me with a passion. I’ve asked him several times what I’ve done to wrong him and has either blocked me on whatever I’ve asked him on or will walk away from the conversation all together when I ask him in person.

Normally I wouldn’t be this upset with the loss of one friend, especially one that won’t even tell me what I did wrong so I can either make right by my mistakes or keep myself from making the same mistake in the future but as mentioned earlier, we’re apart of the same friend group, one that he’s been in longer than me, making it difficult to spend time with my other friends without him being around or involved.

So run down here to start. Been with my wife of 5 years for a total of almost ten years. During these 9 years i have not been great and have lied to her on multiple occasions.

She is also battling depression and anxiety which could be making matters worse. I have just offered trial separation as an option to grow fond of each other while apart.

263,"Hi, thanks in advance for anyone who reads this. I feel lost


I'm in a position that I should be very thankful for. I recently graduated with a degree in computer science with decent grades. I have supportive parents who I could stay with as long as I wanted, so don't need money urgently or anything like that. All my friends did internships and got good jobs from those internships and are currently working. I decided to study abroad in South Korea instead of doing an internship, which was *amazing* but has made it harder for me to find a job now that I've graduated. In the mean time I've been working a temporary job with the father of a friend in an intern like position on some projects he needs help with, but they're not tech related. So basically at the moment I need to decide between 3 options:


What I really want to do is join the JET programme, its been a dream for a maybe 5 years now, and i've lived abroad before so im certain its something that I want. The only problem is I want to get some experience in the tech industry before I go. Because i'm afraid if I go for 2 or 3 years i'll be very difficult for me to get a job when I get back. Because it'll have been 3-4 years since I graduated. Many graduate jobs say ""Graduated in the last 12 months"" and technologies move quickly in IT, so every year the stuff i've worked with becomes more obsolete. 





The company I would like for to working for as a developer (Where many of my friends work) has graduate positions which will start around march. Lets call it 'ideal company' It seems like the smarter option is to delay my jet programme for a year and do that, but A. I REALLY want to go on the jet programme in 2019 and B. This job is not guaranteed at all. I have a few contacts which will give me an edge, but its still not guaranteed at all. 


There is a third option. The man I'm currently doing some work for has quite a successful networking company. He's set up an interview with me and the guy who runs the company for him. Thats not guarenteed either, but i'd say its like 90%. Its the safest option and to be honest I might be crazy not to take it. I dont have much interest in networking, and i'd prefer to work as a developer in the other place, but I dont really have much interest in anything. And the pay is good, starting at like 35k and could be 50k within 4 years. 

Options (I think):
1. Go and do the Jet Programme in 2019 (this is what I want, but perhaps its not wise)

2. Try and look for a developer job and work for a year first. I want to try for ideal company, but theres no guarentee of that at all. And if its some other shitter tech company I might regret not doing the Jet programme.


3. Take the near guaranteed networking job. Its not really what I want to do, but I dont particularly want do anything. And despite my apathy I know it is a great opportunity.



Even theres not much you guys can give in the way of advice, just writing all this down was helpful, so thanks.",20Sep2018,1
264,"I just graduated college and started my dream job at a hospital. However, I live with my parents who just built this beautiful custom home that’s an hour away from where I work. I work 14+ hours a day (with my commute), 3-4 days a week. I also rotate between days and nights and that really limits my actual sleep time. I’ve only worked there less than  2 months and I fear I will burn out soon due to the commute (I’m dreading the coming winter and snow). I can’t take the train because it doesn’t get there in time. 

My boyfriend of 2+ years also revelry took a job by me and is moving to the area since I graduated college. He’s currently commuting from my parents house as well until he finds an apartment. However, this arrangement is pretty suffocating for us both. So I suggested why don’t we just get a place together? It’s not that simple though....

We are both pretty sure that my parents will raise literal hell if I try to move out after they literally just built this house and paid for my college. They want me to save money and live with them as long as possible until I’m married. It’s possible they will threaten to cut me off from the family and damage their relationship with both my boyfriend and I. They don’t actually have a problem with him, just a problem with their kids growing up it seems. I see their point about saving money but at the same time I need to be able to function at my job. 

Half of me is like if I don’t move out now I never will and the opportunity won’t be as good since my bf is already moving. The other half of me is like I’m committed to this job for the next year, have very little savings, and get a raise in one year.  Should I just tough it out another year, save money, and move then? Or do I make my move now? Honestly I’m kinda of sick of moving since I have packed up my whole life 3x in the past year and moved.

267,"Hey guys, I have a conundrum so I'm bringing it here for your advice.

I'm 22 and in my senior year of college. I had a really rough time earlier this summer, I was working too much and I had changed my anti-depressant under my doctor's recommendation and was not doing well. I gained a fair amount of weight from the meds even though I was exercising a lot and trying to eat well, and I felt so upset and out of control of my own body.

Fortunately, I'm doing a lot better now, changed meds again for the better and have really started working on taking care of myself. The weight is really stubborn but I'm trying my best to give myself the time and the tools that I need to get to where I want to be. However, one of my friends is turning 21 and wants to take a trip to Vegas next week. I've already booked travel plans but they are refundable, I just have to decide in the next few days.

I want to go because I love the friends who are going and I know that it will be really fun, but I'm also thinking that I shouldn't for the following reasons. I feel like the long weekend in Vegas will set me back in a lot of ways: I'll have to miss a couple of classes for it, my friend who's turning 21 is from a rich family and wants to spend more money in a day than I have in my bank account when I already had to pull a lot of strings to afford going, I'll be drinking so much that I'll probably gain back weight I've been struggling to lose, and I'll come back tired and feeling like I have to play catch up at work and school. My friends want to party really hard and non-stop and I just don't think I have it in me to do that, plus, if I go away for a weekend I want to come back feeling renewed and refreshed instead of tired and stressed. I'm also afraid of how it will effect my self-image. I'm not used to being this weight and I hate seeing pictures of myself right now, I don't feel like I'm looking at myself and it hurts. I feel like Vegas is one of those places where beauty is in your face all the time and my friends are going to want to take a million pictures and it's just going to remind me that I don't like the way I look right now, and I'm going to be hyper conscious of the fact that I'm likely to gain weight on this trip by partying at the same pace as my friends.

I guess I'm really just scared of losing the forward momentum that I've been making in my personal life in regards to caring for myself. I feel terrible because I really do love my friends and I don't want to hurt their feelings by bailing. I'm also sure that we'd have fun, but I don't know if it would be enough fun to stop me from thinking about all of these concerns and to make it worth while.

I on the other hand run around looking for deals so I can budget myself appropriately. I don’t mind cooking and sharing my food occasionally when it’s something I feel like offering. The problem is when I’m cooking. He’ll come around and start prodding. “That looks super good, what are you making?” (as innocent as it sounds, I know it’s his round about way of mooching). He then proceeds to hang around the kitchen until I start feeling bad and eventually end up offering him whatever I’m making. Often times it’ll be a meal prep, so it looks like a lot of food but it ends up getting portioned out into a extra lunch and/or dinner.

270,"So i've been with this driving teacher for 8 months and learning for 3 years overall.

Over the past 3 years i've had teachers leave me and i've quit using them because i'm not making enough progress for my likeing, well today with my current teacher evreything was going very well untill i made a mistake.

The mistake was that he told me to turn right and i forgot about it, he then told me that i don't listen because he had told me earlier.

A short while after that i nearly missed the exit and he grabbed the wheel saying in a low key shouting "" this is the 1st exit and this the 2nd exit.

After that there no more issues and he went back to normal, i noticted he kept checking his watch later on during the lesson as we were stuck in traffic.

Well I guess a long time ago my crushes dad met my dad (they’re both somewhat public figures in my city I guess). So I guess my dad made a bad impression on him (not surprised, like I said, my dad has no filter unfortunately) and my crush’s dad said “I don’t like him, he’s very loud and very vulgar”. I found this out because my crushes best friend is my best friends boyfriend. And her boyfriend is an asshole and brought it up out of nowhere. It was really shitty of him to do that, he did it to be an ass. So that’s how I found out. He wouldn’t tell me who told him that though because he “didn’t want to lose that persons trust”. I don’t know why he felt the need to tell me the whole thing in the first place, like I said he’s an ass. Anyways, my crush didn’t want me to know about this whole thing, but I found out it was his dad who said that because well, my friend told me that her boyfriend told her. I’m just really really embarrassed. I just feel like never talking to my crush again, I feel like everything is ruined.

I believe that can be a badass combination if you play your cards right, but being in high school, the situation gets a bit more complicated. At the school so far she’s probably made about 30 friends that she hangs out with on a daily basis. I’ve made about 3; that’s just how I roll. But at this school she’s my favorite person to hang with. The only problem is she has 30 other people she wants to hang out with. That’s fine, I’m not really a possessive person, but when our hang out sessions are so limited, we start to drift apart. We do go out on dates occasionally, and talk on the phone quite a bit, but she’s almost always busy with something. To compensate we show a lot more affection than usual, but when she’s hanging out with a large group of people it’s not particularly romantic. This isn’t 100% on her though, I could just hang out with her friends right? I can, but I’m not good in groups, especially groups of strangers. I don’t mind hanging out with her and her friends, but I freeze up and can’t think of anything to say.

283,"I'm weird, I'm well aware of that and I don't think of it as solely a bad thing because it's not, but it's obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do so much with my life... I've dealt with severe depression for a long time (early teens to now, 21).

I want to start a business, I want to build an empire, I want to change the world, and make a lot of money.  
But it's not 'oh I want nice house. fast cars and bling'..

I'd like nice things, and it's a good incentive but it's secondary.. I don't want billions in my bank account, I want shares in businesses to that tune, I want to start and fund charities, I want to put money into research, I want to have a large scale positive impact.

  
I'm not happy unless I feel like I'm working towards that.  
I've tried to 'switch off' by playing video games, watching TV series, and going getting drunk with friends..  
I might play a game for less than 2 hours and I'm bored, it wears off and I don't go near it for another month..

Or I watch series like Billions and learn about communication - how they use strategy, regardless of how sensationalised is I watch it to try and learn from it..  
Everything I do I try to learn from it, so I might watch a documentary on Steve Jobs and look at how he made his decisions, were his focus came from and how I can/could/should use that myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't enjoy going out and getting drunk with friends, I like meeting girls and being intimate but that wears off after awhile.  
Even an interest in fashion, that's dwindled, I appreciate quality and performance so I want to dress to minimise decision fatigue, and so the clothes I wear don't make me feel a) self conscious,  b) not dressed for the situation, and c) uncomfortable because of the fit of something.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in college, studying Business Information Systems, I spent 2 years studying business and hating it, I enjoy this more as it's more 'up my alley'.

I know what field I want to work in and to a degree how I'll do it, so a BIS degree could be seen as necessary.

  
I'm not really enjoying college, I transferred to 2nd year and everyone already has their friends and has their groups.. so I'm an outsider.

I also feel like most of the course is for the most part useless, it's either stuff I know or have no interest in knowing..

There are some modules I find interesting and I had the first real conversation since I started college 2 weeks ago, it was with a lecturer on why DHLs IS is so integral to its success... that's what the lecture was on so I just cared on the talk after the lecture..

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost sight of having some 'purpose' or thinking that is impractical, not at all feasible or stupid and that led me down a dark path in my own mind..

&amp;#x200B;

This probably all makes me sound autistic, I'm not, it's just how I see the underlying cause or effect.. why I do whatever it is I do, and what could be the cause of an effect of my depression.

I can hold a strong conversation when it's on a topic of interest, I'm shit at small talk..  
I hate reality TV, marketing that assumes you're stupid.. social media..

Everything around me seems counter intuitive for what I believe to be success, it's right inline for complacency..

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know..

I just know I either feel productive or deeply depressed and suicidal.

I don't know if I should do something else, or how to even go about doing that or do I keep going..

286,"So I'm 31F and have spent the last 10 working years of my life in customer service. I'm so over it. I started out in retail for the first 4 years and did management. Then I went to a call center for a bank for 5 years and walked out on my 5 year anniversary. Went back to retail for a year hopping around to a few places. Now I'm back in a call center for another financial institution. I've been here a year. Changed positions once so I'm taking slightly less calls, but I'm just bored. I am so done with talking to people every day. There aren't a lot of off the phone options in my current company and most of them require degrees which I do not have.  


I don't want management anymore. I am just tired of having to see my performance based on the performance of others as well as just managing people in general.

&amp;#x200B;

I like the company I'm with now because they treat me like a person, leaders are super nice, the pay is fantastic, benefits are good, I can wear what I want and dye my hair any color I want, and I can even work at home sometimes if I don't feel up to going in. It's pretty cushy, but the work I'm doing just really eats at me. I have pretty bad anxiety and depression which can be triggered by stress. Anyone working in high volume customer service knows stress comes with the package. My plan is to stick it out another year, and put out feelers in the company for really anything off the phone. If I can land a position great I'll be happy if not though I'm going to start searching externally.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I like doing-

I'm artsy, I love crafting and painting. I spend the majority of my free time playing video games and I make some side cash Twitch streaming. I could probably get good at Twitch, but I don't feel it has long-term stability. I love data and organizing things. One project I worked on with the first financial company I spent a year reviewing calls for trends and compiling the data to create a training program to improve the overall quality of calls in terms of just how customer's were treated. It was quite successful and I felt very accomplished. This led to a position in Quality Control, which I hated because they only wanted us to focus on if procedures were followed versus how the customer was actually treated. I also enjoy writing and reading.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just at a loss because I feel I've narrowed my focus so much to customer service over the last few years I just don't know what else there is that I could get into with a semi-decent starting pay.",20Sep2018,1

288,"I'm 27 and recently moved in with my mum and step-dad whilst I'm waiting to complete on the purchase of my new house.

In my early 20's I did a fair amount of drugs, however I haven't had any class A's in almost 3 years, just weed. Mum and step-dad  used to use cocaine semi-regularly, they aren't 'typical' users, both very wholesome family-oriented people with good jobs, neither had done any drugs whatsoever before age 30. Both stopped taking coke a few years ago, it was only an experimental period. Mum banned it, my step-dad reluctantly agreed. 

We were visiting my hometown at the weekend and I was picking up some weed, step-dad took me to one side and asked if I could grab some coke for him on the sly. Nothing major, just a couple of g's as he hasn't had it in ages and doesn't have any contacts anymore. I picked it up without really thinking, but haven't given it to him yet even though it's been a few days. He probably assumes I'm just waiting for mum not to be around.

The real reason is that I feel horribly guilty about going behind my mum's back and enabling this. She WILL notice, because step-dad is so obvious when coked up. Today I subtly brought up the last time we all took coke together (over 5 years ago) as casual conversation, and my mum said she's done with that for good, and that whenever step-dad mentions getting some she gets really upset. She said if he ever crossed her on that there would be hell to pay, she's too concerned about his health to allow it.

So I'm sitting here with coke in my drawer, which I don't want to take myself because I'm done with it, but I don't think I can give it to step-dad. He's such a great guy (even if this post indicates otherwise), he's like a dad to me and much better than my biological father, he's a very kind man. I'm torn between helping him out and loyalty to my mum. Today's conversation did make me think though...if he had a heart attack or something because of what I'd given him I'd never be able to live with it and mum wouldn't forgive me, it was different years ago when we all knew the deal and what we were getting into. If mum knew I wouldn't feel responsible in the same way.

I guess the question is, do I give him the gear and write it off as a favor, which pales in the huge amount of favors he has done me, and hope mum doesn't find out?  Do I grass him up to my mum and tell her I couldn't give it to him? Or do I flush it and tell him I lost it, and give him his money back? Money not an issue, only cost £150. I think I already know the 3rd option is the one, but I feel so bad, he works hard and doesn't have much in the way of vices, and I feel like I'm denying him a bit of fun, the type of fun my mum freely indulged in at his age (she's 13 years older than him, hence why she's more aware of her mortality). I'd do anything for him, but I just really wish he hadn't asked me to do something that betrays my mum, it's causing a huge amount of internal conflict for me.",20Sep2018,2

290,"Long back story...you can read my last post for more clarification or ask questions in the comments.

**Basically our work van got towed. Either the tow yard or police didn’t file paperwork until 13 days later, so now we have to pay for the 3 weeks it was in the tow yard . Even though we filed a stolen van report with the police on the day it was towed and they told us it was NOT towed Bc they had no record of it!**

We’ve been out of work since Aug 27 Bc that van was our van we used for work Bc we deliver shipments over the US as expediters.

We just spent $2000 to get our van out of the tow yard on Sep 17. We then made an appt to get a new van key made Bc oddly our key went missing when the van was towed (suspicious- but not going there unless you ask about that theory).

The dealership forgot to order our key. Haaa. So instead of us getting back to work on Mon we have been stranded in Orlando. Now they’re saying the new key won’t be here until Monday the 24th! So at this point we’ve almost been out of work for 1 month.

We still have bills. Even though we travel around for our job we do have an apartment in our home state (which is a 24 hour drive away from where we’re stranded) which we stay at when we take breaks from work.

**The lease is under my name so my rental history is now at risk. If we can’t get back to work we can’t pay my rent. I talked to my landlord and he’s not really accommodating and if it’s late I have to pay more and if unable to the eviction process will start**.

I have a small window. My bf has bills. I have bills. He still has to pay the van payment and insurance even though we are stuck here waiting on a key. To give perspective we went from making $2000 minimum a week to spending ALL our savings to pay bills and use gas to get back to the tow yard and get a new key, even though we have both had no income coming in for almost a month now.

We’ve had to spend money on food and motels. The homeless shelter kept telling us they were at capacity but I keep calling and hoping every day that’s no longer true. Our family’s loaned us money and so did our friends. We’ve ran everyone dry, including ourselves.

We tried sleeping on the streets but the cops kept telling us that’s illegal and we can get fined...probably true but idk what to do cause we can’t even loiter anywhere. (Big duhh there, I’m just so lost on what to do to survive in this town?)",20Sep2018,1
291,"Hi sorry I needed to vent. This is a throwaway account. My mother-in-law is leading this Bible study at church and she wanted me to join and so did one of my friends. I was hesitant to agree at first because it’s on Wednesday nights and it goes until May. I do not work close to the church where this is taking place. I live about an hour and a half away from church. On top of this I just got married about a month ago and my husband and I are still getting used to our lives together (we did not live together before) and we are still trying to figure things out. I also live in a place that snows and has bad weather during the winter so that’s a concern for when it gets to be winter. On top of all this I also have small group bible study every other week which is by the same location as church. So that’s twice a week I’m driving that I’m driving far for two days and I get up at 5 in the morning. 

I went to the Bible study for the first time last night and it was fine however I caught myself a couple of times holding back tears because I was tired and I couldn’t stop thinking about having to do this every week until the end of May. Also I am very new in my faith only a couple years ago I reconfirmed my faith in God. This Bible study seems very intense and comes with homework (our small group also comes with homework) But on the other hand it seems interesting. 

I am uncomfortable taking about my faith to people who have been Christians all there lives and I think it might be too much for me right now and that I should start with something that is not disclosing things about my marriage. 

There is also a survey in this study that you fill out and it’s questions about your marriage and some of the questions make me uncomfortable but I’m not sure if I am taking them like they want me to. There are questions about submission and I don’t think that a wife should be submissive to her husband but it should be a equal and loving relationship. 

I talked to a teacher that I respect from when I was in college and she said that I should stay far away from this study because it seems like they are teaching how to be submissive. Please give me advice on what to do. Thank you for reading. 

TL:DR: there is a Bible study at church not sure if I should continue in it. I am new in my faith and not sure if I’m ready for it. Takes an hour and a half to get there with other commitments and work during the week. Concerning talks about submission in survey. ",20Sep2018,0

I’m currently 18 I turn 19 in October, and I want to attend school to become a Registered Dietician, but I’m struggling even applying to school because my parents still are abusive and really just aren’t parents so they didn’t give me their fasfa information during school, and I’ve worked so hard my whole life despite moving so much from getting kicked out (since I was 12- basically I had realized that my mom and dad didn’t love me the way they should- I realized she tried drowning me when I was 6.) and dealing with abuse as both of my parents are mentally ill. I don’t hold any hatred for either of them- as I just completely understand why they are the way they are. (My mom has history of suicide attempts, my dad was abused) they both didn’t graduate high school and ran away to California and Florida when they were 14. Used to sell drugs. No real job experience for both of them- my dad took over his brothers H/VAC company when he passed so basically has been handed everything- my grandma is signing him a house now because they’re afraid of my
Mom coming back, I asked him to move closer to my school since he’s getting help anyways and I could save money and he told me to pay $700... and it actually made me tear up and hurt my feelings (something I haven’t felt in a long time bc they long since numbed me through emotional and physical abuse) when he has 2 bmws no suv for the kids... I just want to go to school so I can be more myself- live truthfully and help others. 

My mom left my dad now for some other drug dealer.  Very stressful situation as I watch my 3yo sister and I just see the negative effects my parents have on everyone. My uncle tells me that I have to focus on myself there’s nothing I can do- he told me I was like the lotus flowering blooming through mud. I don’t feel that way though, I feel like real love is resilience and understanding and I know when my parents’ time to pass will come I will be there to forgive them and teach my siblings the same. 

My past is too much to explain and I truly don’t want pity from other people but I do acknowledge that everything I went through has shaped my mind, has given me resilience and the ability to be grounded.  I’m the oldest sister/siblings so they also used my love for my siblings as means to be lazy.... as in the last year of highschool my mom would sleep in till 3pm, and make me clean after everyone when I got home from school. She would constantly travel to a different city to party and gamble and go to strip clubs. I would get tired sometimes and not want to do anything. When I did have two art internships she made me quit bc she was attending bartending school (promised to pay me) and well never did...  I had a job at a restaurant where the owner would sexually harass me so I quit. My family got mad at me for quitting. The only support I have is grandma n grandpa but I never ask them for money as living here is enough. 

I graduated with a 94 gpa in the top 10% (I was 43/700+) while missing school a lot bc of me trying to help my family (I probably shouldn’t have legally graduated) 

Throughout everything- I still focused on myself because I know that’s the only way I can guarantee my siblings life. 
I realize my natural talents, how I perceive things, I teach people all the time... I want to do this with my career. I want to live zero waste, I’ve been plant based on and off since 6th grade dealing with everyone now vegan fully for a year. I love dancing and found a natural affinity for that and healing others through means of just cultivating intimate relationships with others. 
I was watching Humans of New York on Facebook and it just struck me how much I would love to do something like that. I would love to teach people, I just feel so frazzled because I feel like since I can’t understand to go about doing that I can’t plan it. I like being able to take things step by step but how do you show the world that. I wish I could talk to people who have done amazing things and ask them how did you do it. 

First I recognize that people need something to respect you by in order for you to even be seen as you truly are. (Wether it be by status or etc).
I am really hard on myself and I know that this life can be cultivated and I see myself as powerful, raw as I am. 

I believe in myself I just need to know the steps I need to take in order to  grow the way I need to.  Sorry this was so scattered in terms of writing- I’m just typing this off of my phone. 

I tried telling people my whole life that they were this way, they never had to push me to excel in school it was all my own since I was young bc of how much I saw. I still feel a little vulnerable sharing this and even asking for help because honestly when I moved my parents didn’t provide for me, it has shaped my mentality a lot and I can see when people try to help me and I just don’t want it because I just have a lot to prove to myself, currently I’m trying to move closer to campus so money isn’t a issue it’s there to be made, it’s just I need a plan, the hard work is gonna be there and I’ll do it with a smile on my face bc I couldn’t control my life growing up. I just feel like the person I am, (I’ve always been more serious) and the person I’ve grown into- very compassionate and warm. I care about the environment, I don’t like how people are dividing (by any means), when we are all interconnected, we are all trying to feed our families....  I believe that the world is changing especially because of AI, a lot of things need to be addressed within society. Big pharm. I’m not going to try to change everything all at once but if anything I can change by leading by example... so thank you again. I’m grateful to live and be able to grow and progress.

So, I'm a 25yo male in my last semester of college working on my second degree in Comp Sci. I met this girl last semester, although we didn't start talking more until about a month ago. She's in my project group and and my classes, so I see her every day.

The more I get to know her, the more I like her. She's incredibly smart, cute, funny, and driven. We share a lot of opinions and interests and a similar sense of humor. We are both graduating in December and going into the same career field. She's over here starting conversations with me and we're starting to study together outside of class. So, it's going well. Lately when I talk to her, it's like everything else disappears around me and the only thing in the world is this girl in front of me. I mean, I haven't felt this way about a girl in years.

The big catch, though, is that she has a son. She's a single mom. I'm thinking that ""if she's worth it, she's worth it."" and I really do believe it's as simple as that. However, my friends and family are all looking at me like I'm crazy. My best friend continually brings up the fact that she has a kid every time I mention her name. My mom is keeping her mouth shut, but is obviously not happy about it. My dad straight up told me I'm being an idiot.

Am I being stupid? Is it that weird to want to give it a shot with her? This would not be my first relationship, so that's not an issue. Money isn't an issue, as I've already landed a $60k/yr starting job and she should be able to as well. I've had pets my whole life, which I know is different than kids, but I'm still familiar with the responsibilities of taking care of a living thing. 

Anyway, any input is appreciated. I don't just want to hear what I want to hear, I want to hear what you want to say.

Thanks!",20Sep2018,1

I asked the bride about a dress code and she said there really is none, just no shorts. Would it be appropriate to wear sneakers with my outfit? Going to go with slacks and a nice button up. They’re nice shoes and would fit the outfit but not sure if they would be considered appropriate. Another thing is they’re Nikes, white Nikes. I know you’re not supposed to wear white at a wedding but would this be okay? I know I should just ask her but I don’t want her to get offended or think I’m straight stupid.

297,"hey guys

I'm in a weird situation with a friend, so I met this girl at work a few years back and when we first met it seemed like we were keen on each other to go the next level and start dating but i'm not exactly sure what happened but it just never fully escalated, we never had sex but we did kiss a couple of times. I think she just lost interest in me but we remained really close and talked daily etc, after about a year after meeting she started seeing another man and I got quite a bit jealous (confirming i still had feelings for her at the time) but it quickly didnt work out between the both of them

We were still calling each other (I moved interstate) and talking nearly daily and i started seeing another girl which didn't really cause any issues but myself and the new girl stopped seeing each other. About a year ago she started seeing a different man and she sort of went cold for about 6 months (maybe calling once a month) and then she called me crying to say hes blocked her out of the blue, so i gave her some support and now we're back to calling everyday

although i now live interstate, i've developed feelings for her again (not sure they ever went away) because of the support and attention we give eachother via phone (and we did have a small weekend getaway when i went to visit her) , I feel like its possible in the future for us to date, but i'm not sure how she feels about me, she does seem to know i have feelings for her but idk if she cares and is potentially just using me as a backup or for attention

do you think theres anyway we could just remain friends and my feelings would eventually go away? or should i just delete her and try to forget her

302,"So, for context, this is my personality that needs changing for the sake of my marriage.

My husband has told me that towards the opposite sex, my overly-friendly personality makes it seem that I'm flirting. It's happened on XBox Live to interactions with our neighbors. It's been putting a strain on our marriage and my lack of awareness to how my husband has been feeling makes me feel like I'm the absolute worst spouse ever.

I've practically stopped playing games where I chat on mic unless it's with my sister and whenever I start over-thinking MY personal actions I start acting weird and, to my husband, creates more suspicion.

I've told him over and over that it's not what it seems, that he's stuck with me until death, etc. but I still feel horrible. Like I'm too selfish to care about his feelings, too selfish/immature to change and be more aware for him but I'm a very live-in-the-moment type person who pushes bad experiences out of my mind that happened only a few days ago--I try to focus on the positive and happy.

For example the incident that happened today to cause me to write this: At the beginning of the summer, spring even, we all got drunk at a neighbors house. Said neighbor is a very happy drunk and gave lots of hugs. The two times I saw him since then we've hugged (in front of our spouses) and I told him he gave the best hugs. Apparently my husband told me his wife rolled her eyes at him when we hugged the second time and the neighbor gave my husband an apologetic look the third time (two days ago). I was just trying to be friendly and told my husband that there would be no more hugging. 

I'm sorry that this is starting to ramble.

A) Bite the bullet and just ask your boss and save the Uber money

When we went outside I saw my brother just standing next to the harbor looking at sea. At first I checked if it was him and it was. I told him to come home, asked what he was doing, where he was the whole time. He didn't say anything in response to me. He simply said ""This family made me suffer too much, there's no reason to suffer any longer"" he then just got into his expensive car and just drove off.


I told my parents about this yesterday and they didn't react much. It was almost like they didn't care about him anymore. So I decided to find him myself. Sadly, being stupid as I was so shocked I forgot to memorize the car's license plates. Although I remember how the car looks like and the logo of it. It was without a doubt some sort of ""BRABUS"" car model.


Is there any way I could find him myself without the help of my parents? Do I confront my parents about this and try to figure out why they don't feel like going to the police or anything?

I recently started taking college course again after taking a few years off. I know that I won’t have my “dream job” until I graduate, but there has to be something I can do until then. 

I’ve waitressed for 6 years and I’ve had receptionist positions for a little longer than that, so I’ve never had a different type of job outside of those. I’m currently a receptionist at a veterinary office, and while the cute pets are nice, I absolutely dread getting out of bed in the morning and spending my days at that place. Like I said, this isn’t the first time I’ve been like this. 

Is there something wrong with me? Am I just not meant to enjoy (or at least tolerate) working? What kind of jobs are there for people like me? I’ve been desperately searching for other jobs in my area, but nothing is really catching my eye.  So, I thought I’d list some things I really enjoy doing and see if anyone has any job suggestions (or degree suggestions-still trying to figure that one out too). 

So here’s what tickles my fancy:
-Crafting. Of any kind, really. I do have a wreath “business” on the side but really haven’t had much luck with that. 
-Organizing 
-Planning 
-Decorating homes 
-Upcycling/restoring furniture 

Anyway, I’m hoping maybe someone out there could give me a push in the right direction

Thanks!

337,"So my nudes were first found to be leaked on anon-ib back around January of this year. It was upsetting but they didn’t provide any identifying information so it wasn’t as bad as it is now. This time around I found my pictures online under a tab for the college I go to along with my full name and Instagram username. These pictures include pictures from when I was 16. 
I know it’s not an ex I’m pretty sure it’s someone from the college that I go to because the other girl that I recognized from the site also only sent the nudes to her current boyfriend and she’s sure he didn’t leak them. we think it’s because I used the campus WiFi to send the pictures to my current boyfriend. 
Some more background information, right about the time my nudes were leaked the first time, my house got broken into and my mom saw a college age male running out from my room. I told the revenge porn thing to the police and they wrote it down in the report and I never heard back from them. I have an active restraining order out on another male that used to stalk my bedroom window from back in high school so I just feel like my privacy couldn’t be invaded more and it beats me down and gives me really bad paranoia.
I’ve called the sexual misconduct office at my college and they told me to contact the police and then ghosted me.
So is there any legal or non legal ways I can handle this to find out who’s been doing this or just to prevent future employers from finding any of this information?
Or any tips in general?

Now, a few years later, I've realised my missing part won't ""grow back"". There have only be a few people over the years that commented about it, so I don't think it's disturbing to others. But it does kinda annoy me.

340,"Posting on mobile so forgive me if any formatting issues arise.

So currently I'm in my early twenties, ""jobless"", renting a bathroom size room, and feel paralyzed in life, not knowing which direction to go.

Some background info: 
I'm the youngest of four raised by a single mom (my dad passed when I was 4) with a turbulent past. She tries her best but life has scarred her in many ways. With a mom who worked all the time to provide and my own anxiety with school, I ended up with terrible attendance and got my GED around 16. Around that same time though, my mom had a back injury and lost her job and we became sort of homeless for a few years, staying with friends. 

Fast forward and i started school to get a certification for a job and lived with a friend's family, as my relationship with my mom wasn't the greatest (she was prone to explosive outbursts and heavy drinking due to pain). She also suffered from PTSD and bipolar disorder which meant things got heated quickly. I returned home though (after passing the program) due to her becoming pretty much bed bound due to arthritic hips and I was the only sibling around/willing to care for her (inluding cooking, errands, bed pan changes, financial support). At this point her emotional health was really bad and while taking care of her she would be very controlling, verbally abusive etc, which wore on my not so great mental health. This resulted in moments where cops were called, friendships lost with family friends for years and so on. It also had me delay the job I went to school for, for about a year, and her losing the apartment she had finally received. 

Since then she checked herself into a hospital because of how bad things had become and has gotten the physical and mental help she needed for the most part, and is on the tail end of her stay. Ive rented a bedroom and began the job I went to school for and everything began to look up.

Until, it's as if I began to decompress after everything. Life began to slip through my fingers or should I say I let it. I let my certification lapse and left the job. I took a break for a few months, living off what I saved, thinking that's what I needed. But now I have zero motivation while also feeling dread for my future and pent-up anger. I do some construction jobs on the side along with writing poetry for people online which is a little bit of money at times but infrequent. I know I need to bite the bullet and stop being a brat and grab any regular job that comes along. There's just a part of me that feels exhausted, drained, unable to cope. Some days I can hardly get out of bed and dream of being a writer while traveling as I've been in the same twenty miles my whole life. 

How do I get out of this slump? How can I pick my life back up before serious damage is done?",20Sep2018,3
341,"I’m in my early Thirties and recently sold a business I’ve been building for the last 5 years. The proceeds aren’t enough to retired but, if I saved every penny of it, it would be a good head start on retiring a little early. 

The rub is, I don’t know what to do next. I’ve been an entrepreneur my whole life (Financial Advisor &lt;2009 to 2012&gt; after BA in Biology, then started my business in the Beverage Industry &lt;2012 to 2018&gt;) but don’t have my MBA (big requirement to work at a corporate business level?) and haven’t figured out “the next big thing”.

Right now I’m pretty much just golfing, working out and smoking weed. I can do that for a while (2yrs min based on residual income from the business and other side projects), but I would like to get back to work NLT Feb 2019.

Just putting it out there to the smart people of the internet: 1) should I consider a “job” right now/ever? 2) Any suggestions for a guy in my situation? 3) what would someone even hire me to do? 4) should I just focus on making the next great business? 5) what should I do to stave off boredom?

343,"Last week, my wife was dealing with a medical emergency that occurred after having surgery. While at work, she was freaking out due to finding a lot of blood at the site of the surgery. It freaked her out and she went to the ladies room to check the bandaging and clean up. So, after fixing her clothes, she went to the sink, took off her wedding band and engagement ring to wash them off, washed her hand, cleaned her shirt off the best she could, and then got a phone call. She exited the bathroom without realizing she left her rings behind. 

Within 10-15 minutes, after dealing with the phone call, she realized she left the rings in the restroom by the sink. In a panic, she ran back to the restroom from her office to retrieve the rings, but they were gone. We then dealt with security, the local police, and proceeded to put up flyers everywhere with contact info and details about the ring. The police urged us to press charges if they found whomever took the ring, so my wife agreed to it. I contacted insurance and put a claim in for the ring.

Today, we got a call and the ring was returned. The caller only provided their first name, wouldn't give us any additional details, and claimed she took the rings to hold on to because she didn't trust the buildings security staff. She then said that she is only at the building 2x per week and she hadn't been there since last Friday until she saw the flyers today. She told me her plan was to hold on to the rings to see if anyone would claim them. If she didn't hear anything, she planned to keep them. After speaking on the phone she said I could meet her in a public setting and we settled on the mall about 30 minutes away. I picked up the ring and had it checked out by a jeweler. They compared it to the GIA diamond report and confirmed the stone wasn't swapped. 

After the whole ordeal, I thanked her for returning the ring, and since the flyer had mentioned a reward, I asked the woman for her contact info so my Wife could reach out and they could settle on a cash reward as I didn't have adequate funds on me in cash at the moment. The woman declined giving me any additional information and said her phone number was fine for coordinating giving her a reward. She didn't seem really interested in the reward, to be honest, and I think she wanted to remain somewhat anonymous. 

With that said, should we pursue contacting her to give her a reward? Also, the detectives asked for her contact information, but my wife isn't sure if we should press charges since we got the ring back which is what we really cared about. I'm curious how others would proceed from here?",20Sep2018,1
344,"My fiancé has struggled with serious depression since she was young (10-12 years old). The more I’m researching, the more I think she might actually be bipolar. Her depressive episodes can last weeks or months, and it’s incredibly difficult to see someone you love struggle with it the way she has. 

She has 2 kids from a previous relationship, and she’s told me more than a couple of times that they’re pretty much the only reason she’s still alive. She tells me fairly often how much she hates the world that we live in and how she hates being a part of it. Her life has been filled with a lot of struggles that definitely don’t help with her depression, but it scares me to think that at some point her kids might not be enough to keep her from going over the edge. 

We have an incredible relationship. Our communication is our strongest suit, so we can literally talk about anything. She’s talked about wanting to see a therapist and a psychiatrist to get help. She’s taking anti-depressants that we’re prescribed to her by a general doctor from a clinic, and they aren’t really working. She just switched Medi-Cal plans and doesn’t know if seeing a therapist is covered by that new plan. 

I want to voice my concerns about this, but I don’t want to make her feel like she can’t talk to me about it by raising my concerns with her. How should I approach this in a way that would be conducive to her getting the help that she needs?",20Sep2018,2
345,"I’ve been friends with the same person for almost my whole life(since 1st grade). However I’ve noticed throughout the years that he is extremely narcissistic.

I’ve honestly gotten to the point where I’m sick and tired of being a filler friend. They ask me to go to stuff, but I guarantee they only ask just because someone else isn’t available. Half of the time we joke about it, but honestly he isn’t joking anymore. I’m just so sick and tired of people who think they are better than everyone else.

346,"  

My partner no longer wants to have sex with me, they say it’s their sex drive that is low but they still masturbate regularly and get excited for other things/people/concepts and they were insanely sexual with their ex partner who they went out of their way to coax sex out of for the 7 months they were together. I know this because we’ve (me and my current partner) were friends during the time and I recall how upset my now partner was at the lack of sex from their ex. Yet if I even mention wanting sex with them they shout at me or make me feel incredibly uncomfortable.   
 

At the start of our relationship we had a lot of sex, more than I ever had with anyone else and they did all sorts of things with me – made me feel wanted for the first time ever.   
 

Now I just feel repulsive to them. It’s effected my confidence and self esteem so much I am on the cusp of an eating disorder.I am constantly terrified of them leaving me because I am not good enough to keep their affections.

This is literally killing me inside. I don’t understand why their ex was so much more worth all the effort yet I get an argument thrown at me if I mention I want to just watch them jerk off.   
 

It feels like I am being punished for being attracted to this person and that they want a more a-sexual relationship with me whilst still having the options of other things.   
 

I don’t know how to deal with this and the worst part is I can’t bring this up to them because any slightly negative opinion that comes out of my mouth aimed at them or the relationship results in a full blown angst fest and I am the villain.   
 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel trapped and honestly, I’ve had to change my expectations/wants/needs/brain so much that I am starting to fall out of love with them. I am definitely way less attracted to them physically just because of how selfish they are. 

And that transcends just sexual stuff. They are selfish in every possible way. I just don’t know what to do.   
 

Is it wrong I feel this way? Is it selfish of them to expect me to completely just capitulate and give up what makes me happy to make them happy? I never feel valid in any relationship anyway, so I typically just give in and give up everything just ot make the other happy, but it hurts so much in this instance because I honestly though they were different. I just want to be happy and to have someone value my wants/needs.   
 

My partner constantly tells me I should respect his feelings and boundaries. I do my upmost best, but it’s killing me he doesn’t reciprocate. I tried to compromise this morning, I asked him if he’d consider doing sexy RolePlaying with me over text so he doesn’t have to be doing anything actually sexual and I could just enjoy SOME form of intimacy with them that didn’t involve me watching them jerk off to porn. But that was quickly ended with them being upset at me and acting as though I’d asked them to murder a bunch of kittens.

At my school, seniors are able to get excused to sleep in during their first hour if they have a study hall. Sadly my parents will not excuse me because they think I'm lazy, and choose not to wake up. I've explained to them what research has shown with teenagers and sleep, but they choose to disregard the facts. 

The worst part is that I get punished for waking up late. I've been forced to walk to school a few times, My car has been taken several times, my phone and PS4 always seem to be gone, and my parents stopped paying for my gas (I'm in sports all school year so I don't have a job) . Honestly this has really impacted my relationship with my parents. 

When I had a conversation with them, two things happened that made it unsuccessful. My dad can't admit when he's wrong, to the point that I don't think he's ever apologized to me. Second, my parents won't take me seriously, and actually listen to what I have to say. I get teens can be stupid a lot of the time, but that doesn't mean that everything I say is invalid. I'm positive these are some of the biggest factors that are blocking me from reaching them. I just don't exactly know how to go about it. 

Another problem is that being tired has really impacted my performance in academics and sports. It's really frustrating because I know my potential is high, but I'm unable to reach it being so exhausted all the time. It's crucial I finish well because it affects my chances of colleges I'd like to attend, and athletic scholarships. I don't have amazing grades, so this is something that worries me. 

Lastly, not getting enough sleep is affecting my mental health. 80 percent of the time I'm in a bad mood, and I feel sad more often than I really should be. I don't think I'm clinically depressed exactly, because during summer break I'm much happier with a healthy amount of sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I moved to another city with my long-term girlfriend (5 years) for my Master degree. She was already studying there for a couple of years (we managed to have a long distance relationship during that time) and we moved together in a small apartment.

About a month ago we broke up.

Now I am facing another year in that city and I am worried it'll be very difficult.

I did choose this University based on my interest and future career but I would be lying to myself if I didn't admit that part of the decision was taken for the sake and future of our relationship. So now that we broke up I am quite lost. I'll be living in that city and going to that University and doing things that are so very related to her and our relationship. I feel that everything there is intimately bound to the memory of the last year.

Also, I'm moving into another house with people that I have yet to meet and unfortunately I am prone to adapt slow and not very easy in this circumstances. I've made friends at the University but we are not particularly close so I don't know how much they can help.

Most importantly though is that I am taking the end of this relationship quite badly; we broke up for various reasons and problems but it was mainly her decision while I thought we could still work things out.

I[16M] have a problem at home with my mother. I am your average teenager, I’ve been dealing with acne these last years. Last year I tried accutane for 4 months and it helped for 6 months, than my acne came back not as bad anymore, but still too bad for me because it was really messing up my confidence. My mother, sister and friends always gave their negative opinion about my acne which I hated very much, so I decided too look online for help. I learned more about my acne, I read that sugar could make acne worse, and in my case that wasn’t too hard to believe, I was eating cookies, cakes and drinking soda like crazy so I decided too cut that, and it helped A LOT. Since than I’ve have cut sugar completely from my life which my mother HATED, she really was against my diet because I’m only taking some healthy crackers too school instead of chocolate waffle. My acne improved a lot, but I was till getting some breakouts once every week atleast, so I decided too look up what was causing it. It was the rice and pasta I think because of all the carbs in it. So I decided too tell my mother about it today(2 hours ago), her response was worse than I could have imagined. She screamed at me that I was taking this too far and what am I else gonna eat, because I am eating “nothing” anymore. And she was still insulting me about my acne, and said that the diet wasn’t working while in my opinion it was working VERY GOOD, I was seeing a big difference. She also screamed at me that I was devoloping an eating disorder which scared me, because she never told me that. I get why she’s worried, but she wasn’t listening to anything else I was saying, she screamed at me the whole time while I was trying to explain everything and she just walked away. How do I deal with this ? My mother is a really complicated person, she never listens and turns my words into something completely else.",20Sep2018,1
364,"So here’s the short version of my dysfunctional family. My Mom’s mom isn’t all there in the head which has lead to a bad relationship between my mom and her mother. My mom is so focused on having some sort of relationship with her and feeling equal/loved like her sister that she doesn’t see how she’s ruined our relationship. I am a 31y/o whose mother wants her college/work schedule still (I refuse to give her it). My mom is also not someone you can talk to and point out her flaws. She has every excuse in the book to not work a full time job. She has always chosen my brother over me which has caused issues between us as siblings. Recently I had a side job that I was doing alone and I offered for her to tag along and I’d pay her. All she did was complain week after week. She never said thank you once to me for letting her come make some extra cash. I quit my pt job since it wasn’t working with my school schedule so all I had was this side job for the summer. She would complain how she didn’t have money and I would say how do you think I feel this is all I have right now and she’d compare it to herself (she was still working her pt too!). I was a little mad all summer she never backed off this job so I could have that income while I wasn’t working pt. Recently I gave her the boot bc I needed that money, I got a pt job again that works with school and she’s mad at me (how selfish am I?). I gave her a two month stay on before I’ll start doing the job alone. We recently went over what time to be ready to go to work, confirmed it multiple times and I was at her house waiting. She decided she was going to go to dinner instead and I should wait.... I was pretty pissed. I’m full time school, pt work, and this side job I do not have one day off. I called her out and now I’m the jerk. She even had my dad call me and hang up on me... she’s talked about me to my brother which I find wrong. Now it’s been two weeks and they won’t talk to me. Isn’t this immature? How am I wrong? My birthday is next week and she’s told my brother she doesn’t plan to talk to me. My brother plays the same games as her. Hence why I see how she’s just like her own mother picking one child out of all to be the favorite and play them against each other. It’s really hurting my heart and I don’t know how to deal with them... she’s not a bad mother I just don’t like her games. All I hear is how SHE doesn’t have grandchildren yet. I’m recently divorced and decided to go back to school which hasn’t been easy. No one ever said that because you have children you’re guaranteed grandchildren. She told everyone about my divorce issues. I went home to stay with my parents when I first left so part of me feel guilty that I’m angry with them after they helped me.",20Sep2018,1
365,"Throwaway account just in case.

So my MIL is at times a really awesome and intelligent lady, but in the past few years that I’ve been a part of the family, I’ve noticed some definite changes.

There are times where out of nowhere she will just blow up at her husband (FIL), son (my fiancé), and grandson (who they have custody of). There have been times where she has threatened to physically harm them and herself, including a situation where she and my FIL got into an argument, my fiancé broke it up, and she picked up a gun and said that she “should just kill myself and all of you too.” A couple days ago, she scratched up my FIL (not sure where), picked up a knife, and threatened to “gut” him. 15 minutes after both of these situations (and other similar blow ups) she’ll act like nothing happened and that everything is just peachy in the world.

Clearly something is not right here mentally, but when we’ve (delicately of course) broached the subject of mental health, she acts like nothing’s wrong and that she doesn’t need to see anybody. She also is refusing to see a doctor about a lump that she found in one of her breasts (this REALLY bugs me as my actual mom is a breast cancer survivor, mostly because she caught her lump so early).

We want to help her. My FIL has the patience of a fucking god, but it’s starting to be more and more clear that when she gets like this, it’s really affecting him too. They’re both in their 60s, and we want them around for any future grandchildren as well as the grandson they’re already taking care of.

368,"Hi. I recently started going to this swing class for beginners. Its every thursday evening for the next 1,5 months.

Im 28 and Ive never danced so Im pretty terrible. But so are many of the others there. We usually have a pretty good time regardless, we laugh at our own and eachothers mistakes, we give eachother tips etc. The sessions last for 90 minutes and you switch partners every two minutes. So you dance with pretty much every woman in the room throughout the evening.

Then comes Sally.

The first time I danced with Sally we quickly established that we were not on the same skill level. She told me she had done dancing for several years. I wanted to ask her what she was doing in a class for beginners but decided not to. I told her this was my second evening dancing in my entire life.

So we dance for about 10 seconds before she starts complaining. Over and over and over. ""Thats now how you do it"", ""Youre doing it wrong"", ""I thought we were here to have fun"" etc. Basically just criticising my every move, seemingly without understanding that I literally have only been taught two or three dance moves so far, and offering no tips or guidance of any kind to help me correct my mistakes. Two minutes of dancing with this woman and I just cant wait for the partner switch. I feel drained and down.

I spoke with a mate who was also there that night, and he out of the blue told me about this ""weird crazy fat woman who was really mean the entire time"". I told him that sounded familiar. 

Fast forward to today, we enter the dance hall and I point and say ""is that her?"". He goes ""yes!"". I just found it funny that out of 40 women the only person in there we both had something negative to say about, turned out to be the same woman.

So we've learned another couple of new moves and everyones dancing. Another partnerswitch happens and I end up with her again.

She goes ""oh hello again"", clearly remembers me. We dance for approx 4 seconds and she goes ""ah, theres that thumb of your again that I dont like"". I waited for her to follow up with some instruction on what exactly she wants me to do differently with my thumb, as I have no fucking clue whatsoever.

But she lets it hang in the air. Then I go ""ah theres that complaining again straight away"". So she says ""if I dont tell you, you wont learn anything"".

Suddenly there was another very quick partnerswitch for some reason. So I didnt get to argue my point any further. My point being that theres no point coming into a beginners dance class as an experienced dancer and do nothing but tell the new people that they are doing things wrong, and offering no guidance on how to do it right.

Im supposed to go next thursday as well, but just the thought of having to dance with her again just puts me off.

What would you guys have done?

383,"To keep it fairly simple, I am a 5'6"" (168cm), 134 pounds (61kg) 18 year old girl who's just starting college. I've never been one to gorge on food or go on diets - my eating habits are fairly normal: eat about three meals a day, with some snacks in between if I'm hungry.

As someone who suffers from both depression and anxiety, I do have times where my apetite is much lower - but I always make sure to eat the bare minimum to not make myself sick. I also unfortunately have a tendency to suffer from iron deficient anemia, which can make me feel faint and look paler.

Up until my mother got together with the man who's been living with us for the past half year, she couldn't give less of a shit about me, how I felt or how I looked; but thanks to him, that's changed, and not for the better.

He thinks himself some sort of pseudo-psychologist who, without ever talking to me, has me aaaall figured out and thinks he knows absolutely everything that goes on in my head; and he's convinced both himself and my mother that I think I'm fat and am trying to starve myself.

I spend most of my time home alone, and therefore the only meal they ever see me take is dinner - which (unfortunately for me) is the time of day where I feel less hungry and tend to eat less - and though they never comment when I get seconds or fill up my plate, if I ever get a portion that's deemed a smidgen too small that day then I am done for.  I try to eat more despite being full just to please them, but that never counts for them - only if I ""don't eat enough"" according to their standards.

I was recently forced to go to the doctors and undertook several unecessary exams to prove that I'm healthy, and, as expected, the only issue I have is with my lack of iron. Everything else is perfectly fine!

I'm constantly bombarded with insults, unecessary remarks about my weight, body, appearance and mental health, and often left either in tears or visibly upset at the end of every single meal I have to share with these two. This is hardly the only shit I have to put up with from them, and with starting college for the first time and some other personal issues, everything is becoming too much.

I just feel the need to start off somewhere, so here - how in the hell do I make them see I'm not purposefully undereating or trying to starve myself, and this is just what I always eat and that I feel perfectly satisfied like this?

A, A's sister R, and I lived with a roommate who was practically never there and always had a good, respectful situation and overall had a great time and grew close. After going thru a shitty roommate situation with John, our second roommate who was stealing stuff, my good buddy S came back to my area and was looking to rent a room. It was all perfect timing. And knowing S for a few years and him being a fellow vet and student, I suggested to A he would be ideal than some random person off Craigslist. However I was proven mistaken. S told me his intentions were to go to school, work out to get healthy, cut down on drinking (I didn't know the extent of his alcoholic consumption), and save money. I presented it to A and he would be on time so he didn't miss a month of rent and we went for it. And things seemed good at first, he was not exhibiting anything negative and seemed very kind and open about things. But with time, things change.

I got a therapist after that and she's legit, she likes working with teens and she made sure my dad knew both of those things. Even so, he's mad at my mom because since they're divorced and I live with her, he can't do anything to help improve my mental state, and I don't want to go live with him. 

I also told him that I don't appreciate him telling my mom it's her fault I did what I did because she works two jobs and doesn't spend as much time with me as a normal mother would. He even told me himself over the phone that he thought it was her fault. I understand this. Because of this, my mom has said she's tried to just ignore his shit-talk and live on.

Skip to this week:
During my recent therapy session on Tuesday, I signed a ""Choose to Live"" contract that said I would still be alive by next Tuesday, my next therapy session.

I think she did and he got mad.
My mom said she has Thanksgiving off so I suggested we go to my hometown where my family on my mom's best friends side lives 45 mins away from my dad's and stepmom's family. My mom added him, my grandma, and her best friend to a group chat to ask if I could stay with either of them while she stayed at her friend's house (which I was completely fine with). We get home from a dentist appointment and my mom says my dad replied IN THE GROUP CHAT with, ""I don't understand your train of thought [Mom's name]. You were supposed to keep her for Thanksgiving and I met her for Christmas.  We're going to be out of town.""

Those aren't the exact words but I expressly remember the text sounded like he was pissed for some unknown reason and now I don't want to go visit anyone for fear of running into him because someone else told him I was in town. Even though I promised I'd focus less on seeing my dad every year and more on improving my mental health, I don't know what to do to keep this from escalating into me not inviting him to my graduation like he wanted and never wanting to visit him again.

406,"A couple months ago, a girl came over to my place after a night out drinking. I had ran into her and danced with her at a club, but went home to my place before she did, and then she ubered over. I was pretty drunk and had thrown up right before she got there. We went up to my room and kept making out like we had been at the bar and started to hook up. I pulled her pants about halfway down and started to finger her and do other things. I asked her to have sex, but since I didn't have a condom, she told me that we shouldn't.

We kept hooking up and doing things for another 10 minutes or so when I asked again, cause things had built back up to the point of where one would normally fuck. She explained to me that she *wanted* to have sex, but that we *shouldn't* since she wasn't on birth control. I said okay and we went back to passionately hooking up and having outercourse. We kept doing this for another 15 minutes or so.

I then started to lose consciousness some and went out of it for a bit. When I finally come to, she was spooning with me and grinding her ass up against me. **Not remembering** what had happened for the previous 20 minutes or so, I started participating again and went ""okay this is where we're going with everything"". I pulled down her pants halfway again and grinded against her for a little bit and then motioned my dick as if to initiate sex. She immediately pulled away and yelled at me saying that she had already said no twice. That's when the memory of the two no's flooded back into my brain and I started feeling extremely guilty. I truly thought we were building things up and it was a natural progression, but as soon as she yelled at me, I felt extremely guilty but genuinely didn't think I was doing anything wrong.

I apologized immensely we ended up making out some more and then falling asleep together. We haven't really spoken about it since then because of a different falling out, but I feel extremely guilty, but think I genuinely made a mistake and wasn't trying to violate her or her consent. I know I may come across as a dick, but I needed to get it off my chest some and ask for words of wisdom.",20Sep2018,1
407,"Hi,  


I'm not really sure where to begin, but i'll figure it out as I write I guess. This is gonna be a long post, but I think every part of the past kind of plays in to understand how i'm feeling and what i'm thinking.  


She hasn't always been a bad person. When I was a kid she was great. She always took good care of me and my sister, I probably couldn't have a better mother. My parents separated when I was about 5 years old, but I got used to it really quick since it didn't really bother me, double amount of gifts on birthdays and Christmas right?   


My dad has pretty much always been financially stable, smart investments and a lot of hard work has pretty much given him financial freedom at this point, but my mom was always a big spender. When they had a joint income it didn't really bother her nor our dad since they were never running out of money anyway.   


When they separated it quickly showed that she had no idea how to manage any kind of income. She quit working about a year before the separation because of her chronic joint pain, so she pretty much lived paycheck to paycheck with 100 dollars to spare each month. since I was so young I can't recall when, but she racked up a lot of debt really quick with no way to justify it. We always had enough money for good food, rent and so on, she just loved to shop. Any time I would need clothes or other essentials my father would always buy it for me because of her financial situation.  


I really don't care if anyone is in debt, it's their problem and not mine, but when my sister turned 18 and hit the legal age to be able to order stuff on payment plans that's where everything turned to shit. She ordered a phone on a payment plan which my sister was okay with at first, until she couldn't pay for it anymore. My sister never told me about this until years later, she eventually paid her back in full, it wasn't really much anyway.  
During the years she ordered a few more things, but not a lot, and all of it has been paid back. My sister moved out at the age of 19, and payment plans weren't really a thing back then so she didn't order a lot of stuff.  


A few years before all of this she met a new husband. About 5 years in they had a son which they adopted from social services. This process was insanely long because they check every single family member and you basically had to meet them every week for a year. At one point they wanted to meet me, my mother and my step father. During this talk with the social services was when I first heard about her debts, which I then looked up through our equivalent of IRS. At that point her debt was at 50,000$, that was 7 years ago and I haven't even dared to check it again. She had to promise the social services that she would get rid of her debt, otherwise it could lead to a decision that their new son wouldn't stay with them for good, since it's not the most optimal home.

&amp;#x200B;

After realizing she couldn't order more stuff in my sisters name, she started racking up debt in her husbands name instead. He was working a few miles away from town Monday to Friday, so she always collected every single mail that arrived to their house. He didn't get a single collection notice until it was too late. Eventually she had put him into about 20,000$ of debt, but somehow they managed to get through it. She had also put me in about 1,300$ of debt, the worst part was that she was gonna let me get a strike, she wasn't even trying to apologize, just hide it until her house of cards fell apart. It ended up with my dad having to pay the amount in full (which she never paid back) and me not seeing her for 6 months.

 she moved out for a few months but then moved back in together with him. I feared for my life that he would actually kill her, but I met with him about a month after she moved out and he was very supportive, he was mostly just disappointed.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember that my mother promised the social services she'll pay off her debts? yea that didn't really happen. Seeing as both my step dad and my mother was in debt they lost their son and it totally crushed my mom. At this point we were talking again and I felt really sorry for her. Their relationship went to shit about a month after this happened.  


My mom was in debt, and in my country you're not allowed to rent if you have a strike (which you get when you don't pay your debts). My mom was a mental fucking breakdown at this point so I got us an apartment in my name so she could move. It was fine at first because she still had welfare every month, but after a while she just kept borrowing and borrowing from me and never ever paying back. She got a job after 2 months after we moved in, which was great because finally I could start getting some money back that i lended to her.  


3rd month in she asks me to pay the rent in full and lend her money for a fucking dishwasher, which was fine by me since she now had a job and I was getting tired of doing the dishes. I think she kept the job for about 3-4 months before she went to the doctor and complained and got sick leave again for about a year, then got a new job and same thing happened again. She came up with a new reason every time why I had to borrow her money, and I felt so sorry for her I did it every time. I then found out a few times that after I borrowed her the money she didn't really need it at all. This resulted in me not getting a dime. At one point she was even on student loans and welfare, and still didn't pay anything back to me.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is getting really long, so let's just skip forward to present day. In total she has about 3000$ in private debt to me, and about 2000$ in payment plans in my name. I know she will never ever pay me back the private debt, but hopefully she'll pay the payment plans every month. I guess this post has gotten so long because I want to explain why I've done what I've done for her, I liked her so much but I've come to realize that she's just a manipulative monster.. Some days she can complain all day long what a fucking jackass her old husband was, even though everything was her fault. They lost their son and their relationship because of her, nothing else. Every time I hear this bullshit I feel pure rage building up inside of me, and I just wanna tell her that everything that has led up to this point in her life is all her fault, no one else's. I can't trust a single word she says anymore, I don't even think she has joint pain or anything, she just hates working.   


What triggered me to writing this post was her getting super drunk tonight because the IRS forcibly deducted 1300$ from her account. I just couldn't watch her sit in her fucking misery when all of this is her own fault.  


I want to tell her to get her own place, but she can't, and I don't want her to be homeless. Getting my own place is also impossible since this apartment is in my name, and if she can't pay for it one month a long with a rent of my own will quickly bankrupt me as well.

I considered turning her in to the police at one point, but I just can't do it. What she has done to me, my sister and her ex is horrible, but I don't want her to end up in jail. I really do love my mother and despise her at the same time so i don't know what to do. I am stressed the fuck out at the moment and I have no idea how to deal with all of this.

408,"I've moved house 4 times in 4 years. I'm tired of it. I never feel at home anywhere. Like I'm always running.

I move in somewhere and for the first few months things are ok. Then I'll fixate on something that bothers me. 

1st place I actually left cos I split with my ex
2nd place was a nice apartment I moved from cos there were some girls living next door that had really loud parties and I never got used to having someone living above me
3rd place I moved from cos the neighbours would be out with power tools all weekend from early on and play 70s music loudly..
4th place I'm in now, and after 6 months in thinking of moving cos some lads off the street play football by my house that drives me mad. They aren't bad kids (though I think it's inconsiderate), several times a week I'll have to ask them to stop as it's getting late or I'm putting my kids to bed. They do stop, but they will be back a few days later. There's nothing for them to do round here, and I don't begrudge kids being kids. But I find it irritating non the less.

Am I just ridiculoys intolerant? Am I crazy to expect peace and quiet in a neighbourhood. I can't move to a remote rural place as I have to live within walking distance of work. I feel like I'm trapped in this cycle.

410,"My dad died when I was 6 (I’m now 22). He was a really, really good dad. I loved him with all my heart and am still not quite over it. I recently did AncestryDNA and was puzzled when my results didn’t show any Italian (my dad’s side was right off the boat from Italy). I asked my mother about it today and she admitted to me that she &amp; my dad had a brief breakup around the time of my conception and that she had seen another man. She gave me his name. I looked him up on Facebook and he’s still around. He lives a few towns over. He has a wife and an adorable little girl. He even looks a lot like me. 
So, after 16 years of mourning my dad, I found out he wasn’t really biologically mine. I actually have a biological father out there alive &amp; well. But I’m very conflicted. I’ll never stop seeing the man who raised me as my dad. Nothing will change that. So is it pointless to reach out to this guy? Is it an insult to my late dad’s memory? Or will I regret not trying to get to know him? I just don’t know.

412,"I've known this friend for around 3 years, and was actually in a relationship at with them at one point. It fell apart due to failings on both parts, but I called it off because of this persistent issue. Not the point. For well over a year he's been very obviously struggling with depression, issues of self worth, self hate. I've been through this myself, and still am, though I'm starting to pull out of it with professional help and all that good jazz.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is I don't know what I can do for him any more. It feels like a vicious cycle or a dance that we've been doing for the last year and a half. Every few weeks he'll enter a depressive state, shut himself off, act and behave erratic and sometimes lash out.  I've spoken to him a lot about it, long conversations about what he feels, why he's feeling it. And I always end up giving him the same advice, to speak to a professional about it. I try my best not to put blame on him for it, but sometimes i do get frustrated, I feel guilty if I ever snap at him or say something I know wont help. I've gotten through to him a few times, he's agreed to seek out help. Be it a college counsellor or an actual doctor. I've even kept asking him if he's done it, just to make sure he remembers. But it feels like it's no use, because he never does. He never has. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should mention at this point that he is an extreme pessimist about most things, including his own mental health. And also mention that he is an online friend only. We live approx. 100 miles apart.

414,"So, I realized I wasn’t really going anywhere in my current job. I decided to look around and found a new one that will match my current pay of 15/hour. 

On top of that, my new job is only 10 mins away whilst my current job is about an hour drive away. 

You may be thinking “thats crazy! An hour drive for 15/hour!” 

I was under the assumption that I was being trained for a particular role, which then once my training was complete, the pay day would come. Well, the hired someone else for the position. At that point I knew there really wasn’t anything left here for me.

So, I quietly handed my two weeks in and this caught my bosses off guard. 

About a week later, they approached me talking about how they wanted to retain me and that they were going to train me for a different position. They were going to give me 5 more an hour and after a bit make me eligible for bonuses in the future. They have to ask the owner of the business first, of course.

This was on Friday of last week. Monday rolls around and I asked them if they spoke to the owner. Of course they didn’t, but I told them if they get me 5 more an hour I would stay. 

They said “great! We’ll have an answer for you thurs afternoon” (today)

I hear from my manager about an hour ago “yea, we haven’t spoken to the manager yet, I’ll let you know by 12:30 PM tomorrow.” 

So, it took them a full week to approach me. Now, its taking them almost a full other week to simply give me an answer on the possibility of a raise. 

I feel like I am getting jerked around by my job. Do I bang out sick tomorrow and get ready for my new job? Or do I stay hopeful and see if they’ll give me my pay day?

Thanks.

tl;dr: my job promised me a job and didn’t deliver. So, when I found a new one it became a fire drill to try to keep me. However, all the things they promised they have yet to deliver. Do I stay hopeful for the promises? (Will have an answer by 12:30 PM tomorrow) or do I say fuck it and get ready for my new job?

416,My ex (16F) and I (17M) have been broken up for about 4 months now. We still go to the same school and see each other in the halls almost everyday but we haven’t talked in months.

Now I’m starting to regret that decision and I really wanna hook up with her again but I’m worried if it’s a terrible idea.

417,"Approximately 3 weeks ago I was hospitalized overnight for central chest pain that was presenting in the morning when I would wake up from sleep. The pain was acute, 8 or 9 out of 10. But after getting up would go away after 20 minutes (mostly). 


After two weeks of this and it getting worse I sought medical help and was hospitalize. 

EKG came back as abnormal indicating a possible heart attack in the past but repeated blood tests did not indicate that I was having a heart attack or that the hormonal indicator was present or rising. So they kept me overnight and did more EKGs, an echo cardio gram that came back as normal and a nuclear stress test without and with dye.  Chest CT with dye was also normal. 

So at this point the heart is looking fine. It was then discovered I’m a follow up with my primary that I had fucked up my mess and was essentially only taking half of my high blood pressure medicine. Once that was fixed the pain stopped after a few days. 

To rule out gurd I went for an upper GI. Also normal and began fixing my lifestyle by going paleo mostly and exercising. Everything was going pretty well. Lost 12 or so lbs. 

Then yesterday. I am working from home in a shitty chair and sorta slouching a bit. At the end of the day I go to get up and the pain is back to insanity levels. I’ve been practically doubled over. And am writing this while laying down. 

I emailed the doc about getting something stronger than ibuprofen. I am at my wits end. I can’t go to the emergency room because anytime you talk about chest pain they have one reaction mode and I can’t afford another $1700 bill for nothing.

426,"TL;DR at bottom. 

Alright so here's the scoop. I recently moved in with my uncle from a really shitty spot on the other side of the country. I was one bad day away from being homeless and my work wasn't giving me any hours. So, I started looking into the military as an option to secure my well-being both financially and otherwise. I decided I'd call him and talk to him about it since he'd been in the military before, and to my surprise he opened his home and said I could live there while I got my diploma (I'm 19, had to drop out) and go through the DEP (Delayed entry program) to eventually join the Navy. All good stuff. 

Fast forward to the present, and life is pretty good. I have a job at a local sandwich shop, school starts in a few days, and things are looking bright.  My manager is really impressed with my work and just seems to like me a lot. He said they're opening up a new store sometime in the future and depending on how well I do he'd love for me to be the assistant manager there and open it. I'm absolutely thrilled and loved to do it. 

However, by the time that rolls around I'll probably already be enlisted in the DEP and have signed a contract with whatever job I decide to pick. And I'm not 100% sure if I even want to do the military *right away.* The last few years I've always been dependent on someone else. Be it family friends, or just bouncing between family. I have worked and put in my dues but I've never had the chance to live by myself and experience the world as an optimistic young adult. I'm also moving from a really shitty hot climate to Washington State, so I'm hungry to do some camping and experience the gorgeous scenery. 

However, I can't. I won't be able to if I sign up and go into the Navy as planned. And I can't help but feel as if a pivotal part of my youth us going to be robbed from me if I decide to do this, even if it's the smarter decision. I want to live on my own for a couple years. Date some amazing women, just be on my own. But I can't help but feel as if I owe my uncle to do this. I'd be homeless if it wasn't for him and I know he only agreed because I expressed enthusiasm for the military. He's been stoked. I still want to do it, just not right away. 

TL;DR I'd be homeless if it wasn't for my uncle offering me a place to stay and helping me get out of my shitty spot in life because I wanted to join the military. Now that everything is stable, I don't want to go into the military right away, and would rather wait a couple years. How do I go about talking to him about this? Should I just join anyways? Am I being really naive?

So I just said no. Then I saw her press 2 and 3 and it processed in my head what she had asked. She then presumed to say she’d just look at both floors.

I didn’t really know how to react because I figured she hated me and she was being nice(?). I pondered that all evening. Then today after work I went to the gas station to get gas and milk. As I was pumping gas I hear someone say hi and my name. I look up and see her walking into the doors.  I don’t respond. She says nice to see you then laughs. I don’t respond. She keeps walking and goes inside. It’s 3:55 so I figure she works at 4 I’ll hurry and checkout before she clocks in but when I get up to the cashier she is standing right behind the lady and says she likes my scrub top. I don’t respond. At this point I’m so annoyed I’m pissed off. I’ve never liked people a whole lot anyways. She is especially awful. The cashier asks what she said and she repeated then walked over to her coworker, whispered something and giggled. I am so over this girl. I need to prank her, fuck with her just enough to annoy her the way she annoys me without it being illegal. What should I do? ",20Sep2018,2

431,"About a year ago me and my girlfriend (who’s also my coworker) of 2 years broke up. Was turbulent near the end for a multitude of reasons, but never because of any sort of physical abuse. The other day during a lunch break a few of my buddies brought up that a couple months ago she was telling them I would push her off furniture, push her on the stairs, and push her to the dirt. They didn’t outright believe her, but they admitted they had suspicions for awhile and just didn’t know what to think. 

Then, today, my coworker lets me know that my ex was apparently chatting with the boss casually about how I was “abusive”. My boss apparently said something like “ask u/ademonlikeyou” and ex said “no, I don’t talk to people who punch women”, and then said I was “awful and harmful to her”. 

I haven’t confronted my ex about it because frankly I don’t know if that would make things worse. I don’t think anybody actually believes her, but like my friends mentioned earlier they just weren’t sure. I don’t want *ANYBODY* having a seed of doubt in their head about whether I “punch women”. I don’t know why she is saying any of this besides for attention or in an attempt to ruin me. She may be exaggerating an event in which I bumped into her or something?

432,"So today I got into my maths class. I’m a junior in highschool. Immediately my teacher told me to “pick up your garbage off this desk”. He was referring to an assignment thing we had to do with a binder.

I thought he was joking. I didn’t say anything, and when I went to pick it up he raised his voice aggressively and went on a mini rant on “why can’t you listen why can’t you get this right”.

I said okay and sat down. It was in front of my whole class which embarrassed me cos everyone got quiet. I would’ve preferred if he just took me aside and let me know that I messed up on the assignment instead of embarrassing me like that.

Later when I tried participating he wouldn’t call on me, when I was only one with hand raised.

Finally, with an overly obvious sigh, he called on me. I tried to answer a problem. I was wrong on it. Throughout my entire explanation he was making rude faces to the rest of the class and looked at me and was very condescending when he spoke. It made me not want to raise my hand to participate anymore cos my heart sank.

He’s said stuff in the past like “How do you even get out of bed in the mornings seriously...” and I thought he was joking but I’m not sure anymore.

I addressed to him in front of the class. Looking back I think I could have handled it better but I was nervous and upset so it ended up sounding disrespectful in some parts. That wasn’t my intent. I told him I didn’t need him to raise his voice at me for me to get what he was saying. He threatened to yell at me. I told him he doesn’t need to do this peer pressure thing to embarrass me. Ultimately he told me to stop talking.


I messed up on a simple binder assignment. That’s on me. I admitted to that. But the way he acted made me pretty embarrassed.

Afterwards a kid came up to me and thanked me. Others seemed to nod and agree too. I guess some of the other students agreed with what I said cos they had similar issues.

how do I approach this situation. I’m nervous about class tomorrow. Thankyou guys.

433,"Hi all, hope you are having a nice day, 

To explain my situation, I am 17, I go to a secondary school in Ireland which I despise with a real passion, we are ""learning"" absolutely nothing of value that can be taken into the real world bar a few things, tests can be passed without true knowledge of the subject, to sum it up it's a joke. Everyday I sit in class just wasting away, thinking about the weekend which is only good because of no school. I live to see my dog when I go home and to not go to school on the weekends, I just hate the place. The thing is I normally work all weekends which eats time and I rarely get to go fishing which is my main hobby, I just feel tired and sick of living half the time because of school where I learn nothing and get put pressures of homework everyday and then work and repeat, I hate it. Even reading this my standard of English has dropped since I haven't had time to read. I know this sounds like every teenager but I really just see this as futile. Anyway I have no idea or plans for my future, I don't know what I want to do at all, everything seems like it will just depress me over time like school and work (dishwasher, go figure).

435,"I’m a pansexual/demisexual female, age 22. 

I was in a serious relationship with a guy for almost 5 years. It wasn’t the best relationship, it had it’s problems because well, teenagers. We eventually decided it was time to break up and we did, mutually. It was on a vacation to another country. Which I ended up living in after the fact. 

Fast forward 2 some odd years and I fall in love with my ex and my mutual friend. We date for a few months long distance before he decides to come visit across the ocean. I’ve never enjoyed long distance relationships and I was hesitate. Extremely. I wish I listened to my instincts. Fast forward through the 2 weeks he was visiting and realize that I never loved him. I was absorbed with his intelligence and kind heart. I loved him in a way that wasn’t romantic love. And when I realized how much baggage he had that I could not help with, it spun things out of control. We broke up pretty badly, he called me horrid names and accused me of horrible things. 


Since then I haven’t found love or anyone remotely worth loving. I found myself missing love, sometimes questioning if I knew what it felt like. I text my ex (the long term relationship ex) sometimes and wonder if I still have feelings for him but instead chuck it up to me missing the feeling of love.

442,"Hey guys,

As the title says, mental illness has destroyed my husband and I's finances. 

We have already had a ton of help from family, and are at the end of our credit lines &amp; barely paying rent.

For some context, we both suffer from anxiety &amp; depression. He has adult autism and I have seasonal affective disorder &amp; DID (dissociative identity disorder). 

We are both college graduates and have held full time jobs in our fields. Due to series of breakdowns and suicide attempts, our work history is now full of medical leaves and a transition to part time employment. This has had a huge impact on us financially.

To add to the stress, we bought just before a housing market crash. The $40 K we sunk into our house while we were doing well we won't get back. We sold the house only due to the generosity of family members who turned it into a rental property. We've been given 30+ K from them which is enormous to me.

We lived in our fifth wheel over the summer for $500 / month to save money. Now we have moved for my husband's work to a good area but he is still working part time. We found an excellent place to rent for the same price that a subpar apartment we looked at cost. $900 + utilities.

I haven't been employed since March, and before that I've been in part time positions for low wages. I'm overqualified for retail and have sent out a ton of resumes with 3 interviews. The most recent potential employer in my field said they had 43 applicants and only 5 interviews. I was one of the 5 who had an interview, but still no job. The employer said they thought I was great but the hired person had a more outgoing personality which is what they needed in the position.

Thankfully our mental health has been getting much better over the last few months. My husband transitioned into a job that understands his autism and gives him the tasks that he does best.

The financial stress is still wearing at our confidence and I really don't know what to do other than hope that a job comes through for me. I'm afraid of a huge breakdown again.

Bankruptcy would destroy our credit and has been strongly advised against. We pulled 10 K out of RRSPs (retirement fund) and are 30+ K in on credit lines.

Do we start up a go fund me account / reach out to the public? We don't know what to do. 

Please advise.

*We have also reached out to financial assistance from the government but have been denied because we are still covering bills (barely.)

445,"It started off this year, he was a new kid who introduced himself to me the first day of the school year, tall, blonde, blue eyes. We hung out together one night after school at the orientation, and then basically every day after that up until this week. Last week we were talking about how he has been liking the new school, and we got onto the subject of if he had feelings for anyone, since he hasn’t really had the chance to get to know people as long as everyone else has. He says “ya know... I kinda like *Sarah* (name has been changed)” I respond kind of a little heart broken, “oh, cool...” he asks me if I feel like that towards anyone and I say “not really I guess...” 

Sarah is actually one of my best friends, and she actually just got out of a relationship and is so desperate at the moment that she’s going for a person in a grade above us who is such a dbag. 

Flash forward to today, in history we sit across the sides of the room but in the back row. We were mouthing words to eachother but I couldn’t understand what he was saying, all I could understand was “you know how I said I liked Sarah, well I lied” I couldn’t read his lips for anything he said after that, so I motioned him to write it down so he did. He wrote me a note and put it on my desk (not discreetly either, he literally got up in the middle of class) and I didn’t open it until the end of class because I think the teacher saw him pass it, and I didn’t want him to read it along with me. 

So I open it, and I find these words: *”So you know how I said I liked Sarah, well I lied. I’m in love with her.”*

My heart broke a little after reading that, and he noticed I was different the rest of the day, and asked me after school if I was okay. I told him no, but obviously not why (I didn’t have time to stay after school because I take the bus) so I told him to meet me tomorrow at our spot (a special place just the two of us eat lunch)

What do I say?? How do I tell him that I kind of like him?? How do I tell him that Sarah likes someone else??

TL;DR - I found out the guy I kind of like (we’re more just best friends at the moment) not only likes my best friend, he’s in love with her. He told  me to meet him in our special place behind the school tomorrow during lunch to talk because he noticed I was off the rest of the day. What do I say to him, how do I tell him I kind of like him, and how do I tell him my best friend is already in her own relationship?

446,"For about my entire life, I’m been really weak when it comes to confrontation. You see, my dad has really kind of brought me down over the span of my life, getting pissed and yelling over me whenever I even have a slight disagreement with anything he says (even as an 18 year old now) and has made it almost impossible for me to argue with anyone in real life without it resulting in me mentally curling up in a ball. In a written format like a text, sure, I can shine pretty well on that front. However, as soon as I’m face to face with someone who’s ready to argue, my jaw completely locks and makes sure I can’t speak. It’s even worse when my autism makes it so even when I get past the the first locking locking, there will be another lock that occurs that can only be unlocked if I begin tearing up and eventually spiraling into balling (which is quite obviously not great to hold an argument with). It’s absolutely unbearable when, at this moment, I’m trying to disconnect myself from the toxic set of chains that is my father. He always wants to confront me personally because he knows for a fact that I can’t argue and thus allowing him to rag on me for hours on end, watching as I’m powerless because I have the moral code and human decency to listen to what people have to say whether I like it or not. However, I can’t tell him how I truly feel about him because my jaw constantly locks. I can’t get to him via text (since he just doesn’t take texts seriously). I have all this boiled up anger and knowledge on what I’d say to him, I can practice for hours every day in a mirror, but as soon as I’m facing the real thing, my body gives a hearty “fuck you” and locks my jaw right up. I’m really tired of constantly being berated by some toxic hinderance that only slows and derails my progress and keeps me on a path I don’t want to go on.

447,"Hi, 

I have issues with rejection and failure that are holding me back in life. I am sure it stemmed from school because I tried SO hard to get an award for SEVEN whole years. I sat through 24 rewards ceremonies and got nothing. Everyone in the class did, I know because they wore their badges on their uniform and I was so ashamed I had none. I froze in winter because I was too ashamed to wear my winter coat with no badges on. It just gave me the mindset I was worthless. I'm in my late 20s. Towards the 20th ceremony it got so bad I would cry for hours afterwards and self harm. I still don't understand why I didn't get an award because I always tried my best and was never in trouble. Since then I have won some competitions (art, photography etc). It made a small difference and gives me a nice boost for a week or so but I think the damage has been done.

It has always been more school/work failure that I am afraid of, I have a long term SO so I haven't really had the chance to be afraid of romantic rejection as even though I was also bullied at school due to my looks a lot of people seem to consider me handsome, I was placed third in a men's modeling competition in my city with no prior experience. 

How can I beat this? When I get rejected by a company/business etc after applying to work there I just crumble and sometimes I can even become hysterical.

448,"Hello Reddit I need some advice. I work for a small IT company and I feel like I am being overworked and underpaid. I want to ask for a pay raise but I don't want to come off as arrogant. 

I graduated university back in May with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. A week after graduation I started an internship  as a tier 1 tech at a local IT company for 8 dollars an hour. At the time I told them I could not afford to work there full time, so they offered me 11 dollars an hour to quit my current job and work there full time as an intern. I agreed as I wanted the experience and started full time.

At the time, there were 5 Remote techs including myself, and 2 onsite techs that went onsite to handle issues. Over the next couple of months The Tier 2 Remote tech who you can also consider the ""Lead"" Tech and my ""trainer"" had quit. They instantly threw me into his desk and gave me all his tickets and projects despite me being an intern. As time went on the number of remote techs dwindled down to just me and one other onsite/remote tech who hardly does his remote tickets. So it is safe to say I do all the remote work myself. 

Around this time my internship ended and I asked them when I would be hired as an actual tech. I convinced them to give me a raise up to 15.50 an hour. But shortly after that I was handed a bunch of projects and was unofficially made the lead tech. Zen desk, Payroll, our time clock system all state that I am a simple tier 1 tech, however, I get assigned all high and urgent priority tickets, I am responsible for ongoing projects and server maintenance. Any time there is an issue another tech cannot solve, it becomes my problem.  They tell all the other techs to report to me regarding problems as to not put more work on management. This has become very stressful for me as I now not only have to do tickets, but manage projects, assist other techs with doing their jobs and every other thing that comes in and management does not want to do. 

I often work through lunch and never once got paid overtime. I have no benefits, no paid vacation, all the other techs get paid more than me (New on site tier 1 tech dude gets paid 16 starting)  and I am starting to feel I deserve more.

Reddit, do you think I am reasonable asking for a raise. How much do you think a lead tech/ teir 2 tech deserves to get paid? I don't want to over value myself and be an ass, but at the same time I am working much harder than I was initially and my pay has stayed the same. ",20Sep2018,2
449,"To be completely forthright, I just feel lost in life. I'm a 21 year old college dropout working a menial 9-5 job whilst
living with my parents, and I generally feel like I have no purpose.

The solution that I've come up with in my head is one that you can discern from practically any 
self help book: I need to focus on myself, focus on a passion, get the natural dopamine releases of achieving
goals that pertain to these two aspects instead of the artificial short term releases of drugs, alcohol, and sex. 
But the problem is, I really just don't feel like doing anything. I don't have any passions, and, because of that, I 
can't make any plans around them for the future. There's many things I slightly enjoy in life enough to do them in 
my free time, but there's absolutely nothing that I'm so passionate about that I could just bury my head in it. 99% of 
my waking life is spent trying to distract myself from the fact that I'm completely and utterly miserable. I spend 
so much time in my head over-analyzing (probably extremely obvious just from reading this post) that it's nearly 
impossible to live in the present moment. I've become so good at multitasking that I can sufficiently carry out difficult
tasks in life whilst simultaneously obsessing in my head over random shortcomings I've had. It took me damn near 10 months to 
finally stop obsessing over the details of my failed relationship and finally give up hope that there was still something
there. I beat myself up literally every day over the same thoughts about it, despite realizing that obsessing changes nothing. 
I'm finally to a point where I recognize it wasn't healthy, and I honestly don't want her back, but I'm still lost as to what 
my next step is. 

I feel as though I should be working towards whatever career I want, whether that be achieved by going back 
to school or self teaching, but I honestly just don't know what I even want to do because of the lack of passion and enjoyment
in everything I pick up. I have many different talents and realistically there's a lot of different routes I could take, but 
again, nothing seems to be a passion for me. I was recently offered a coding job that would potentially pay very handsomely. All
I would have to do is self teach the languages/logic, and I could very easily make a career out of it. The problem is that I just
don't have the motivation because it's not a passion for me.

To sum it all up: I'm really unhappy and I don't know what to do about it. I've had a very easy life and have been spoiled, so I
realize this reads as very ""woe is me"". Maybe the fact that my childhood was very easy is the reason why I'm lazy and unmotivated?

450,"Hey guys. This is going to be a really long post but thanks a ton if you read all of it and to preface it I'm 22 and a guy.  So me and the gf pretty much fell in love at first sight about 6 years ago and have been like best friends, partners, and lovers ever since. Once I graduated college a couple months ago, we moved to a much bigger city due to me getting a new job and her really wanting to leave where we were. I have my 8 to 5 job and she has a job working pretty much as a front counter greeter person somewhere. For a while everything was finally perfect and she talked a lot about how she was making new friends and I was ecstatic. I'm more of an introvert but she likes to go out so when her friends ask I am always 100% for her going out. So she started to do that with her girl friends and one guy and probably went out 4 or 5 times that month. Well eventually it turned out that it wasn't all those people. Just her and the guy and they weren't going out they were just hooking up. When I found out I didn't really know what to do. I've forgiven her really fast because it really had felt like we had become more like roommates and friends but we weren't making an effort for our actual relationship so I kind of even still understand. My reason for posting this here is still a month and a half later it's almost all I can still think about when we are not together and she still doesn't seem to be attracted to me sexually anymore. She says she is like crazy but when I asked her what I could do or already do that she likes she just said she would get better. I've been pretty fucked in the head since then so I've started seeing a therapist but it's still in my head a ton. We both want to stay together and are happy when we are together it seems but I'm just kind of stuck mentally. What do I do from here?",20Sep2018,1
451,"Alright before I get into the advice I need, let me give some back story.
About 2 years ago by now, I met this girl who we'll just call ""A"" back on the Vine app. It started off with her messaging me for advice about editing to which I replied very politely - and apparently she wasn't use to that which made her want to befriend me. We became friends pretty quickly because a lot of common interests and to this day we still text each other every single day.
As time went on, it became very apparent to me that she is a person who has pretty awful anxiety. I too have bad anxiety so of course I felt sympathy for her and wanted to help her - so I did. And I have been, for the past two years. And in this time, I feel like not a single week has gone by without her having a really bad anxiety attack in which I've had to calm her down.
Naturally this wouldn't be a problem if the anxiety was getting better, or at least more manageable. But it hasn't. It's improved here and there but more often than not, she still seems to struggle with thinking in a rational mindset as opposed to an anxious one.
Here's where it gets tricky. I, as much as I don't like to admit it, am a total and complete pushover. I think I take other people's feelings to deeply into consideration before even considering my own, which ends up with me being in a situation I could have easily avoided had I spoke up to it. In time, me and A got into a LDR (long distance relationship) despite me not being completely on board with it as she was. She lives in X state on the east coast and I live in X state on the west, so pretty much polar opposite sides of the country and I tell ya, it's fucking hard.
I have always been the type of person to prefer physical contact in a relationship (and I mean, who isn't), and despite this - she still seems adamant about maintaining the relationship, and ""trying"" to make it work.
It has been so, unbelievably hard for me to do. Technically speaking, we're not ""really"" dating as much as we are just ""talking"" (we did this in order for me not to feel overwhelmed, which I appreciate her doing for me despite me not really wanting to do it at all), and when there's no label in terms of a relationship, lines get blurred in my head and I don't really know what to do. When I'm single, which I *technically* am, I tend to be pretty flirtatious, and of course it's not killing me to not flirt with anyone but a part of me feels like I could be missing out on so many potential opportunities for relationships in my home state because of this ""test the waters"" thing I have going on with someone across the country. She is also *veeeery* protective of me, and gets easily upset when I just talk to other girls in general (which I do have a lot of female friends, but it's not like I'm flirting with them or anything). I can understand completely where it's coming from but it's to the point where I feel pressured to even show myself interacting with a female in fear of her retaliating.
Now, here's where I am reserved in breaking this whole thing off. She has often told me that she likely wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for me helping her through her anxiety. Which is 100% true, being that her home life is quite terrible. Now, she doesn't live at home anymore because she's dorming in college, but that still doesn't really help. What I'm afraid of is her plummeting into a total anxiety meltdown, being passive aggressive with me, and even threatening to do things such as drink herself to death or take harm to herself - which she has done in the past.
I just can't bare that type of guilt, knowing that I was the reason someone took harm to themselves. I've been told that I am not in charge of her mental health, which of course if true, but that still doesn't make me feel like shit knowing that someone is harming themselves in the first place.
I've been told by my parents to just cut in off in general, as in the entire friendship, but I'm just too scared. When she's not having a panic attack, she is easily my best friend and someone who I feel comfortable with, but at this point I feel like her anxiety is even triggering MY anxiety, and it's becoming so fucking hard to handle.
I just don't know what to do. I feel completely pinned down. Do I end the relationship and try to maintain a friendship while recommending her to get mental health treatment? Do I stop talking to her in general? Do I just keep this going until I think the time is right to cut it off? I just don't know. My mind has felt so scrambled lately and I just can't go on like this.
Please let me know what you guys think, and thank you.",20Sep2018,1

Especially when you be living in the most ghetto burough of NY and being popular as a girl is how loud and sexy you are. I really wish I was like that. Sadly, I'm more of the cute small type.

 I dunno man. I just wish I was more outgoing. I try to be. But I'm not I just want to have a fun life and be able to say hi to people without it being awkward. Maybe not popular, just good at communicating. As you can see by my terrible attempt to describe my situation, I'm not very good at expressing my feelings and communicating in general.

What should I do?

454,"So, bit of a simplified back story: 

our relationship was beyond toxic. It took me a very long time to get out of that relationship, and it drove me to my breaking point. I took a spontaneous vacation out of state at the cost of my entire savings just to salvage my mental well being and get away from her for a few days. My point being, her and I are not a good combination. 

After my vacation though, I had a moment of weakness and half out of pity, half out of residual love, I had sex with her. But she is on birth control, and I pulled out, so no big deal. I told her that it didn't change anything and I was sorry, and it was a mistake.

 Fast forward a few days and she tells me she got her period almost 2 weeks early. I panic. Her and I have been down the termination route before and it's not an option again. She had implantation bleeding last time, so pregnancy was my first thought. It lasted 9 days (still going) and has ranged in color from light pink to black. She said she peed positive 2 days ago on the test but never sent me a picture. Could be a forgetful mistake. Maybe not.

 Today she was supposed to go get a blood test, I asked for a copy of the results. She responded by saying she does not want me involved in any way and goodbye. She says she knows she's pregnant because she knows how it feels, and I'm an asshole for doubting it. 

So now..I'm kind of in limbo. I don't want a kid. God no. But I don't want her to get another abortion. It was so bad last time..I am still having a hard time getting passed the whole ""I pulled out. You're on birth control. How is this happening?"" Aspect of things. I just don't know what to do or think, any advice or insight at all would be greatly appreciated. ",20Sep2018,2

458,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

So I am having a difficult time deciding whether to stay in the living situation I have now, or to move. I live in way upper Manhattan in a 2 bedroom apartment. I share the room with my girlfriend. In the other room is a roommate we've known for a few years. We aren't really friends, but he's nice. She works far away and is looking to find a new job soon, I am a student and work part time, also a little bit far away. We are both getting pretty tired of living with another person, we've been together for a long time and really want a private home to share, even if its just a small apartment. However, NYC is expensive, and what we could afford would either put us in a part of the Bronx or in a tiny studio apartment uptown. We've been discussing moving to Yonkers or Mount Vernon, smaller cities that are sort of like suburbs of New York, but the lifestyle there would be a whole lot more suburban, slower, less stuff to do, reliant on driving and the metro north commuter train for events in the city. A one bedroom or larger studio in lower Westchester would probably be about what we pay for the room currently, or $100-200 more each. And utilities, most likely. We are both 22. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should we just stay in the apartment we have now? Enjoy New York while we're still young? Plenty of time to have privacy and a nice apartment to ourselves? Or would it make sense to try and move out?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty torn because on the one hand, I would miss living with immediate access to the subway downtown or into brooklyn whenever I want it. On the other, realistically I only leave my neighborhood (not including work/school) once or twice a week. And the time on the metro north into NYC is the same or less than how long it takes me from our apartment. So I don't know if I'd really be missing out on that much.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the neighborhood we live in now isn't exactly the most exciting place in the world. I usually end up seeing friends, art, movies, music, shopping, etc. downtown or in Brooklyn anyways.

Was hoping to get some opinions on this. My now ex broke up with me 4 months ago suddenly. To give detail, he told me we needed to talk, he picked me up and parked a bit up my street. He dumped me, and said it was never going to work and that he still 'loved' me. I walked home. Since then he never bothered to contact me. I feel like after spending that much time together, he should have at least checked in with me - as he saw how hurt I was and how bad I must have been feeling? Maybe its not a common thing for people to contact their exes afterwards, but when you know how much you would have hurt someone...I thought they would have made contact to make sure I was okay. I'm glad I never caved him and contacted first. About a month after I decided to delete him as a friend on facebook, then i noticed a day later he had blocked me. I found it funny. Then around a week ago, I saw that he had unblocked me...what does that even mean? Was he trying to check up on me - thoughts? Thank you, just wondering others thoughts :)

471,"I love my job and I don’t want to leave so it’s not an option right now(but could be in the future) I may run into a rude boss at any time anyway so I’d like tips to handle it.

I’m an early years teacher and we share a class with a lovely school teacher. She’s a very nice woman and needs time after school to help her students and tidy up.

As a result I’ve been gathering my childcare students at the end of the hallway for attendance each day before we enter her class. It’s the safest place without large older students and we don’t block any classes or lockers there.

Today my boss came huffing and puffing about how we shouldn’t be in the hallway and how head office is going to “Lynch” her if we are in the hall.

I tried to explain we can’t just barge into a seventh grade class with tiny primary children and take over at the bell.

She basically told me to just deal with it and went on and on about how we can’t be in the hall, we need to be in the class and can’t meet out in the hallway.

This is just one example of many I’ve been documenting. I had to tell the teacher of the class and she was shocked so she’s going to the principal and is going to talk to my supervisor as well. I completely understand. How can she just bolt out of her own classroom right at the bell? She has to clear up.

My supervisor just wants me to deal with whatever which is fine but I wish she’d give me options or solutions as opposed to now implicating the school teacher. Clearly my hallway idea was the end of the world for her. The lynching comment was extremely disrespectful and out of taste as well. 

Anyway my supervisor never really sticks up for her staff, questions everything, talks poorly about our families and other staff, hates her job and a lot more so maybe she’s depressed I’m unsure. But in the mean time I want to be professional and not be worrying about this all the time. What can I do? I exercise, eat well, have a social life but it’s always on the back of my mind. Honestly i get anxious going into work because she could be waiting to vent about I don’t even know what!
