1,"Towards the beginning of summer last year, my girlfriend got into a situation that had us in a moment of no contact between eachother. Towards august we started talking again, but not consistent conversations. It was more small talk, that felt flimsy. As of now, we have been together for 14 months, and are working on building everything back together, but its almost like I'm struggling to bring everything back together like it was before the huge incident. Small talk is still difficult, and getting to see eachother as much as we used to is also pretty hindering. Someone once told me waiting hand having patience, is key, but how long is too much? At this exact moment, all emotions arent there like they were when we were together all the time, we're distant, and its really afflicting me. Im a bit of a mess right now, and my post is too, but I am running out of ideas and thought Id leave something here. any advice is more than appreciated. Thanks in advance :)",08Feb2018,1
2,"ive been give this advice by so many people including my doctor and therapists, they say i lack confidence and they say to try to be more confident? i literally have nothing, ive gained 90lbs in the past 2 years, dropped out of uni, ugly, poor, dumb, unemployed, no friends, leeching of my family, spend all my time playing games and instruments but suck at everything.. i dont even know why i made this post i just really wanna end this",08Feb2018,1
5,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to go, nor if it's okay to be swearing in the title, but here I am, first Reddit post, woo.

I just want to know if I'm fucked, man. I'm in 11th grade, want to pursue a career in astrophysics but my grades are looking at a low 2.3 GPA and the more I look at them the more time I spend being self-loathing and anxious to fix them. 

I've been getting worse and worse recently, that's for sure. I'm going to see a psychiatrist this Friday, but I can't help but feel worthless every time I see a D on my report card. Every year I tell myself that I can do better, but it never ends up happening. At this point, I'm sure it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, but what's most important to me is whether or not I'll amount to anything.

In earlier grades, say 6th, I'd be getting As and Bs easily. I don't know why the change was, but ever since 8th and onward, I've never been good with school. I could chalk up these issues to ADHD, sure, but I don't think that solves anything. Grades dropped, so did my self-esteem, and I guess at some point I just started acting like it didn't matter. I was bullied when I was younger by a family member, but I still don't want to blame it on that, because I still feel like it's my own fault.

So give it to me straight, Reddit. I just want to know that with standardized testing scores, community college, and some psychiatric help, am I fucked?",08Feb2018,2

10,"Hello everyone! I need some help here... Im the kind of people who dont like to end relationships, Im a guy of a girl only..

But I dont know, I AM in a relationship with 8 months, I do everything for her, everything you can imagine, but I dont know, I know she tries, but everything she does for me Is not enough, and when she does something I become so happy, like she is doing so much, but she is not.. I just expect for her to maybe sometimes do normal things like a normal girlfriend should do.

Lately we have been in alot of fights, I dont know she is all the time saying that she feels like shit because of what I say...

I dont know, I feel like she Treats me like someone else and not like his boyfriend, she doesnt show love for me, that so rare to happen.. I dont feel loved.. I try to do all the time things to see her happy, to make her happy, and for her to give me the value I deserve?

I dont know, I just dont feel loved, she is so cold with me, When Im with her, she only stays on her things, she dont try to show some love with hugs and stuff, If she tries is just sometimes, but I think she only tries because I say all the time that she dont give me love, that's why I don't feel like It's a natural thing, you know? I feel a emptyness..

I feel like she dont give me value and takes me for granted..

Because of that lately we have been arguing all the time, and now I dont know, Im making her feel like "" like shit"" like she says... I dont offend her, I just try to make things better, because I dont like to give up on people..

Please help me, I dont know how to feel anymore, I love her só much.. But I feel so distressed, só bad, I don't feel loved, I don't feel anything from her, I just feel like Im just trying to make happy and expecting something in return that will never come... I know she tries, for what she says, but Is not enough to make me happy, she tries, but the things she do, are so little, they are just not enough, Im literaly carrying this relationship on my own, I dont understand..",08Feb2018,1
12,"So I completed my matric on 2012 and went to get a diploma in chemical engineering. I stayed a year after school without inservice work because companies wouldn't hire me because im severly asthmatic. I got a job as a production intern finally and six months into it I started getting very sick, my lungs were not coping. I decided to stay just to complete my inservice requirements so I could graduate and then go back to school to study something else. I quit my job end of 2017 and finished my notice period january 26. I decided to study a bsc in civil engineering at one of the top universities in my country, I got my student card on January 29. The next day was the first day of orientations, which I attended. On my way home I was involved in an accident that had me in hospital until the 5th of February. I took the next day of  and attempted to go back to  school yesterday on the 6th. I sustained head injuries and a broken ankle and a huge laceration in my left foot so im using crutches without the use of one foot. I cannot afford a wheelchair. Yesterday was a failure, halfway through the day my foot was in so much pain, my whole body shaking and I was nauseous and dizzy.

I left for home before the end of classes. My mother is strongly suggesting I postpone my education for this year as it will be impossible for me to attend classes for maybe a month. Almost every class I have has practicals which I cannot attend since it requires that you wear closed shoes, I am unable to hop from class to class since the venues are far apart and I keep on missing some classes. She says I could get my driving licence and a job for this year rather than fail some classes as  that would get me excluded from the university.

I feel like that would be giving up without giving it a chance but I also see her point. Im confused as to what to do. I turn 23 years old on august this year and am female. What advice can you guys offer me please, what should I do?",08Feb2018,1
13,"(Throwaway)

So, I messed up. I've been working at this fast food place for about two months now and noticed a bottle of liquid eyeliner in the women's changing room. I stupidly assumed it was there waaaay before I even started and thought no one owned it/would notice it was gone if I took it. So I did, even though I knew I would never actually use it. It was a stupid, impulsive action and I deeply regret it.

As it turns out, the item actually belongs to one of our shift managers. A couple days after taking it, I returned to work and saw a post-it note in the area where it used to be, asking whoever stole it to return it there and no further investigation will take place.

What should I do now? Should I return it or just do nothing? I don't think there were any cameras around. If I put it back, I'm fairly certain they'll figure out it was me, given that I only work there on certain days of the week.",08Feb2018,1
14,"I have an interview tomorrow at a company and just now,  I stumbled across negative reviews about the management on Glassdoor from former employees. They all point out the flaws in the management and how firing people almost every week is normal for them. 

I personally don’t want to work at such a company as I have experienced a really bad work environment in my recent job. 

Is it okay to cancel at the last minute based on the reviews I read or go ahead anyway and see how things turn out to be?

15,"So I moved in with one of my closest friends from high school (I am 24 now, and moved back home after attending college) because I was financially stable to move out of my parent's house post-college, but not enough to have my own place. At the time, my roommate (let's call her Jenny) had finally put her abusive ex-boyfriend behind her. They had dated for 6 years, all while he was mentally and physically abusing her. After they officially ""ended"" the relationship, they continued to talk. He is an extremely unstable person (ex. he slit his wrists in front of her in her car, he has thrown her clothes out on the street multiple times, called her work, shown up to her work announced countless times, etc. - enough to warrant a restraining order easily) and the only reason (she says) she continues to talk to him is to make sure that he's still alive. He would call her and text her upwards of 500 times a day, every day, for about two years. 

So when we moved in together, she had me believe that she hadn't spoken to him for two months. This made me happy, because I believed that was a sign that she was maturing and no longer continuing on with her 17-year-old mindset. A week after moving in it became incredibly apparent that that was a lie, as he was texting and calling her every moment of everyday, showing up at our apartment building, etc. etc. We had to call the cops on him twice (we moved in in October, so there's that for a timeline).

She would sometimes spend the night at his place and whatnot, but I never allowed him to come over here because he made me feel super unsafe and I hate him for what he did to her in the past. She believed that they were ""just friends"", but it was clear that he was not on the same page.

Jenny has always been someone who NEEDS attention at all times, from anywhere she can get it. She's had a past of being the second best, which leads to her finding the attention she originally wanted from other outlets (speaking about boys). She was no longer getting the attention she wanted from her abusive ex (sexual attention), and shortly after we moved in, a new guy came into her life (or rather an old one). We'll call him Brandon.

Just a quick recap on the past - Brandon and Jenny had a fling back in high school where she ended up being the second best. Brandon went on to date her best friend at the time, which, I think, led her to have a ""forever wanting"" kind of mindset towards him. Brandon has multiple felonies, misdemeanors, has been in and out of rehab basically since he was a teenager, is covered in shitty, self-done tattoos, and has absolutely nothing going for him. Brandon and Jenny started hanging out again out of the blue, and at first it was good to see her focusing on someone else other than her abusive ex for once. But I was clearly wrong about that.

She truly believes that she loves him and that he is her one true love, which I don't think is right. I believe her intense need for him to ""love"" her has made her feel that she ""loves"" him. 

Basically, ever since he came back into her life it has been nothing but anger in mine. He is constantly vaping his fuckass mystery airhead juice, being loud as shit, having her pay for basically everything, etc. etc. The amount of times I have heard them having sex, as well as having been woken up from them having sex, is enough to scar me for life. It's fucking gross and I just can't anymore. The first time it happened, I was like ""ew Jenny, you nasty lol"" but now I get increasingly annoyed and angered by it. 

So other than them having woken me up every night that they have slept here (he ""stays"" at his mother's house, but clearly not really, because he's pretty much living in our apartment), his gross vape juice, loudness, lack of respect from either of them about me being able to share the communal space - I basically hole up in my room once he gets here - there's one big thing,

He got her pregnant with twins. Twins. Two babies. As a 24 year old. After he got her pregnant, her abusive ex became increasingly mad and flipped his shit on her and Brandon, which prompted Brandon to block her on all social media, texts, calls, etc. for a month. Brandon, her abusive ex, and his not-so-ex-girlfriend (the one from high school) all got together one night and talked shit about her soon after NYE. 

So Brandon blocked her and refused to make any decisions with her about the pregnancy, so I stepped in and tried to lead her to the right direction (abortion) based on her current financial status, who the father was, where she is at in life, etc. At week ten, Brandon came back into the picture and wanted to talk to her about it. This is when she decided that she was going to keep the babies. 

This was last week - and ever since then, I have been woken up every night by them either fucking or fighting between the hours of 2am and 6am. I literally had to leave the apartment to sleep at my parents house after slamming three doors and them not fucking getting it two nights ago. He has been here everyday, and I can feel myself about to freak out by how much anger I have bottled up inside of me. 

I have talked to her at least three times assertively about her waking me up, her letting him stay here during the day when neither of us are here (many of his arrests have been for grand larceny), and him being here for more than two days in a row. The thing about Jenny is that she will apologize but then do it again. Like I said before, she is a literal 17 year old. 

I'm at the point where I really don't think I can ride out the 8 remaining months of my lease with this shit. I did NOT sign up to live with a pregnant 24 year old and 23 year old xanax'd out felon. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do? It's either ride out the next 8 months in anger and probably lose a part of myself along the way (my friendship with her is far gone at this point, seeing the amount of disrespect she's displayed towards me in the past 4 months), find a way to get her move out and save money for her future twins (which she should probably be doing anyways, seeing as her only paycheck goes to rent and other small things like gas and food), or should I find someone to sublet on my part?

Sorry this is so long but I literally don't know what to do...",08Feb2018,3
16,"For a long time, the water in my apartment has had an unpleasant smell/taste when you drink it. It's not so bad to be unbearable, but it's not fun. Some quick googling indicates that this could be due to sulfur bacteria in the apartment's water supply, and probably harmless. If this was my house I would get things checked to make sure everything is fine, but I don't have that ability as a tenant.

17,"So I'm taking a professional photography class this semester (I'm a photography major) and this class is known for being very time consuming, very tough, and the instructor (a 50 something year old white woman for later context) is hard to please. But I'll get to the point: 
Our final assignment is to publish a book of 50 photos that all tell a story when put together, and the theme/story has to be approved by the instructor. She didn't approve of very many, including mine.
My idea was to do a photo series of POC aged 20-30 to showcase how far we've come, how we're finally getting a chance to be in the spotlight, and basically how representation matters, but she (instructor) said it was offensive to white people (lol). I got a big lecture about how it's wrong to not include a race, it's a racist idea, etc etc. 
BUT she said she does understand what I'm trying to do (although she said it wasn't believable as minorities are just that- minorities) and if I word this in more politically correct terms, or alter the idea in some way, she might approve it. I suggested doing all millennials as a whole and she said it was too vague for her

So how do I word this? I'm awful at words and I'm bad at putting my ideas into words (i'm a photography major damnit!) and i have no idea how to say this. Is there any way to word this better?? I don't know how I can get her to see from my point of view",08Feb2018,0

19,"So basically my dad is a physically abusive pos who has never hid his disdain and disgust for the gay community. 

Our mom died when my little brother was only four so we were stuck to be “raised” by our dad if you can even call it that. I moved out as soon as I was financially able and have tried my best since to distance myself since and not become like my dad. 

Now imagine my worry when my little brother came out to me a month ago. I couldn’t care less that he’s gay, he’s my little brother and I’m happy he told me. 

But I really worried that my dad would find out as my little brother has already had to endure some abuse from our dad, even before he found out. 

Yes, our dad found out this past weekend. He was snooping in my brothers room and saw a message that my brother’s boyfriend sent him (my brother was in the shower so he didn’t have his phone on him). 

Long story short as soon as my brother got out of the shower my dad confronted him, started calling him a fag and tried to punch him but my brother managed to dodge it and basically ran out of the house and walked all the way to my place. 

I’ve been housing him for the past few days but honestly I’m worried that our dad will come find him and something bad is going to happen and also I really can’t afford to house another person with me as I’m barely scraping by myself. 

What should I do? He really can’t go back to our dad’s house but all his stuff is there and he’s basically homeless right now. I’m really worried and at a loss for what to do. 

Tl;dr: My homophobic abusive dad found out my little brother is gay and I’m worried about where he’s going to go and that my dad will find him. ",08Feb2018,142

My brother is a fucking liar. 
I got angry at him because he wanted me to do every household chore and he do nothing. I asked him for help. He got bitchy with me so I left, he then lied to my mom and said that I was complaining about him and my boyfriend being lazy. My mom called to see what is happening and repeated what my brother said. My boyfriend heared it and is hurt, which is reasonable except i never fucking said that. my boyfriend isn't lazy. He works his ass off. So now my boyfriend is believing my brother over me and I don't know what to do. It feels great that my boyfriend can't trust me and that I'm such a shit girlfriend. Shouldn't have had my brother move in if he's going to be this way. My relationship with my boyfriend matters more than my brothers.
I'm just so agitated that I'm not trustworthy to my boyfriend.
Half of me just wants to vent and the other half wants to ruin my brothers relationship with his girlfriend if this has any impact on mine. 
I love him but the fact he can't trust me and is mad at me over a small fucking lie my brother told is pissing me off. 
So now I'm seeing if any one my friends want to hang out so I can have a place to go to without telling them what's wrong. Because it's so embarrsing my boyfriend is mad at me because my brother is a fucking liar.

26,"Sorry, this is going to be a pretty long post. I currently live in a triple room in college. One of my roommates (let's call her Yvonne) has a friend (Sam) who is disliked by everyone else in our friend group (including my other roommate, Jody). He seems to really like Yvonne, even though she has a boyfriend. 

Sam lives in a different dorm. Pretty much every night, he comes over to our dorm, eats dinner with us, and then after that he comes up to our room and parks himself right next to Yvonne at her desk. He doesn't leave until he feels like it, or when Yvonne wants to sleep (but not when Jody or I want to sleep).

Now, Jody and I wouldn't really mind this, except Sam is genuinely a horrible person. I'm not really sure how else to phrase it. He is very violent (anger issues, likes to talk about gore/death/his dead father). He doesn't care at all that none of us like violence, and continues to stubbornly talk about it a lot. This makes us pretty uncomfortable, and he knows it. 

Continuing on the violence tangent, he likes pointing out that he always carries a knife with him, and likes talking about how to kill/injure people (""This is where you want to press if you want to gouge someone's eyeballs out"" -Sam) He also really likes play-fighting with Yvonne, even though (1) she has a boyfriend, and (2) if you actually try fighting back, his anger issues flare up, and he becomes really aggressive. Obviously, this scares Jody and me since we don't want Yvonne to get hurt.

At this point, Sam is only friends with Yvonne (pretty sure he's picked up on the fact that the rest of us don't like him). Even Yvonne seems to keep him at a distance, but he doesn't seem to get the message. We think he likes her because on multiple occasions, he's been very insistent that she go with him on outings (like frat parties or drinking events, stuff that Yvonne isn't really into). 

Once, when Yvonne's boyfriend was visiting, they were going on a date to the mall, and Sam intentionally third-wheeled even after the rest of us in the friend group clearly got the hint that they wanted time alone.

Most recently, once Yvonne went to sleep, Sam stayed in our room and pulled his chair up next to her bed and watched her sleep until Jody turned off the lights and he finally left. 

How do we get him out of our room (and hopefully out of our lives)? To him, Jody and I are like air. He couldn't care less if we were going to sleep or even taking a shower or if we wanted to study quietly. He hasn't done anything worth reporting to authorities, but we are concerned for Yvonne since Sam's creepiness level has increased drastically since the new semester started. 

PS- Yvonne is also a really accepting and nice person, and Jody and I don't think that she wants to/could cut off relations with him. 

PPS- Somewhat unrelated, but Sam is also nasty. Like, doesn't shower nasty. His hair gets really greasy and he doesn't look like he takes care of himself (another reason why we don't like him).",08Feb2018,14
27,"Hi Reddit. 

So I'm a university student, and I'm quite a confident person on the whole, but my social confidence is the one exception and I'm afraid it will begin to really let me down. 

I'm pretty certain I have social anxiety. It took me a while to accept it but I don't think I can lie about it anymore. Meeting new people is something I shy away from (mostly because first conversations with people are super awkward 95% of the time), and I absolutely dread the idea of parties. However my biggest let-down is my complete inability to present myself. I had to do a presentation last semester and it was an awful experience, which led to me almost fainting. 

On the other hand, I'm incredibly confident in most other regards. I have an unfathomable desire to achieve and make the most of out every second I'm alive. This creates an unhealthy balance for me. 

I now have the opportunity to potentially take a pretty prestigious role as a university student (the president of my course's school), as I've already taken a lesser role which has kinda 'opened the gateway' for me. I would REALLY like to do this, I feel it's something that would suit my desire to achieve and I think that if don't take the opportunity then I would end up regretting it later on in life. However I really don't think it would be worth applying for if I would suck at socializing when I get it, in the way I currently do. This is just one example, but it causes problems with many other opportunities I'm offered.

One thing I'm very confident about is that I can improve. I've set it upon myself to achieve the confidence that I need by the time I turn 19 (one year). But I have no clue on where to start.  So I ask, if you've read to this point, what would you suggest I do to find the social confidence that I need so desperately? Any replies would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you :) ",08Feb2018,1
29,"I am in the last month of renting a room from my landlord who is also my roommate. Last weekend she told me she was having a possible renter come and look at it tuesday and that my room and bathroom needed to be ready by then. The last time this happened it was just an inspection and when she gave me a deadline i got both my bed room and room cleaned. this time i left her a note on monday night (somewhere that i KNOW she saw) that i wasnt able to do it and that i could wednesday on my day off since i was so busy with work and other things. 
I come back home on tuesday to see ALL of my belongings in the corner of my room. Everything i had was just packed into my bags and backpacks. My clothes were in my laundry baskets and a garbage bag. My bed was completely stripped of my sheets and blankets. She had hired one of her cleaners to clean my room when i was gone, a stranger went through all of my stuff and packed all of my things on accident thinking she was having me move out. Honestly when i came home to see that all of my stuff had been gone through i broke down and cried. Cried so much that when the worker came to apologize i couldn't even say anything. My landlord asked why i was crying and told me that ""we got it done for you."" and i told her that i wished i had done it myself. 
I had already had a bad day at work, so coming home to that really did me in. Can someone please give me advice on what to do? I'm a 19 year old female that has never rented before and this was my first experience. 
I'm in the state of South Dakota. Could she (my landlord) legally have done that? I feel like my privacy was extremely violated.

33,"Hi,

So my most relevant experience I’ve gotten was a practicum I had in January to April of 2016, which has inspired me to pursue a future masters to further study that specific population. However, due to my academic career I will not be applying to a masters program (most likely masters of social work, but sociology is also a good option for me) until around 2021/22. Would experience from 2016, despite it being my most relevant work experience, be too irrelevant to the timeframe of when I apply to a MA program? I do plan on volunteering a lot up until then. Thanks ",08Feb2018,1
34,"I've always been a boy who dreamed of having that wonderful girlfriend. Someone to talk to, hold, make plans with, but whenever I asked a girl out, they would say no. I'm only a junior in high school, but I'm very nervous, and I tend to drag my crushes along before actually being crushed when they deny me. After each girl I would blame it on my weight. I was 5,8 and 224 pounds. I dropped most of the weight and reaching 155 lb, I was still not satisfied, because my overall goal was not met. I still have not found someone to share a relationship with. I have had this dream for 5 years and finally today it happened. I found out this girl I was really into felt the same about me, and we are going on a date soon. This is what I was aiming for right? I feel no different. I have been dreaming of this girl for a month and now that I finally have her, I'm still not happy. Any advice on this?",08Feb2018,0
36,"There is this girl i used to date. We were in love and we still have feelings for eachother but due to reasons beyond our control that i won’t be getting into, we had to end our relationship. We’re best friends now and tell eachother everything, talk everyday, and hook up occasionally

I have such high respect for this girl. She’s such an amazing person and I love everything about her.

Since we broke up, she’s hooked up (hook up meaning making out, not anything beyond that) with a few guys. 

We aren’t together, so I don’t get angry when she does that. But there is this one guy. He is the biggest douchebag in the world. I’m not saying this in the jealous boyfriend type of way, he’s honestly the biggest piece of scum i’ve ever known. But for some reason she has a weakness for him. The cycle is that they hook up, he acts like a douche after and they fight and she hates him, then they become friends again then hook up again. 

This is like a 6 month cycle. Anyway, it’s coming to the part if the cycle where they hook up again. Last time they hooked up, I freaked out at her, said things to her, and didn’t talk to her for a week. I talked about how amazing she is, it just bothers me and drives me crazy that a girl like her is fucking with a guy like that and giving him what he wants when he puts in no effort other than being a giant douchebag. I respect her and i like respecting her and loving her. But if she hooks up with him again, i’m going to hate her and lose my respect for her. 

We just had a dramatic talk with her asking me why i care so much about this one guy. And at the end of it she said “so if i hook up with him again, should i tell you or not”

Idk what to do. I like loving her and having respect for her, but if she hooks up with him and i don’t know about it then that love and respect will just be a lie. Should i tell her to tell me and i be depressed with the truth, or tell her not to tell me and be happy with a lie

38,"Hey guys. I’m at university doing a two year postgrad at one of the top 5 universities in the world - this is relevant, I’m not attempting to ‘brag’ - lord knows I’m the dumbest person here. 

Anyway, before the end of my course in the end of May, I have to write four 5,000 word essays and one 25,000 word thesis as well as doing a tough language paper. For various anxiety-related/health reasons, my work has been delayed until now. I feel really overwhelmed, and though I am working a lot I still don’t hit the (informal) deadlines I/my tutors set for pieces of work. 

I am running out of steam. I already repeated my first year, and the pass mark is weirdly high for my course. I came into the postgrad with little knowledge on the subject and feel like I’m constantly disappointing everyone around me. I don’t want to give up because otherwise I will have wasted three years of my life and I worked so hard to get here. But I’m not sure if I can do it. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Was it doable? I essentially need to (if I’m going to finish) work harder and more quickly/efficiently. How did you manage it, if you did? I just feel like I’m the only one on my course constantly disappointing my tutors and it makes me feel awful. I’m sick of apologising for my inadequacies when I feel like I’m working really hard. 

Thanks in advance. Sorry for all the complaining.",08Feb2018,1
39,"I'm going to start off by saying I live with my parents and i'm incredibly self-reliant. I'm in my late twenties, work kind of a shitty job, but it pays 23-2500 a month. I live at home because my MOM needs my income due to reasons, but they are completely legitimate. She provided for me growing up when I didn't have a job and I was severely depressed. She supported me through all of it so now that she needs help, I feel obligated to help her.

My parents, mainly my mom, doesn't know when to stop ""babying"" me. Constantly telling me to go to bed because I have to go to work and wakes me up 2 hours before work so I won't be late (i'm incredibly punctual, never late). She doesn't know when to stop. If I go out she asks me 20 times where I went and if I respond with ""don't worry about it"" or ""none of your business"" she gets all sad and says i'm rude. She also volunteers my services to fix shit for her friends, build things, paint, move and whatever else she can volunteer me for. It's gotten pretty old and I don't know how to tell her to stop.

All of that is a walk in the park compared to my dad. He is the most stubborn mother fucker I've ever met in my life. I am rarely in the living room, but when i'm cooking/baking or just there by myself and watching tv, he will change whatever i'm watching and say ""you have a room don't you?"". He put cameras up EVERYWHERE outside and refuses to shut them off if I have company when they're not home. I see the green light flash when he's watching it, so I know when it's happening. When I realize there are cameras (I forget a lot) and shut them off, he blows up my phone and tells me to turn it back on and loses his god damn mind. It was getting hot and heavy. While I don't think he is getting off, I still don't want someone to watch me for a second in the spa with a girl I met in a bar.

If I have friends over for DnD, to watch MMA fights, or to just hang out he is INCREDIBLY rude to them. He cusses them out, talks shit to them, tells them ""Don't you have your own god damn home?"". My best friend of 20 years he tells him that shit all the time and it pisses me off. I am not rude to ANY of their friends when they come over, even if I don't like them, I still have beers and talk to them. So I don't bring my friends over to MY house. I BUILT THE GOD DAMN POOL DECK, THE LOUNGE AREA OUTSIDE, PAINTED THE FUCKING HOUSE, PUT THE TILE IN THE KITCHEN, AND MADE THE HOUSE EVERYONE FUCKING COMPLIMENTS THAT THEY BRING OVER FOR BEING NICE AND I CAN'T BRING MY GOD DAMN FRIENDS OVER. Her friends have hired to me to do the shit I've done to MY FUCKING HOUSE, but I have to plan to have my friends over when he isn't here to swim, drink, and hang out.

The most recent fight I had with him is him giving MY DOGS two treats a fucking day THAT I FUCKING PAY FOR. Those big ass milk bones. I don't have time to walk her EVERYDAY; so I try to limit her dog treat intake. I talked to him about it, very calmly this morning, asking if he could PLEASE not give the dogs that many treats. He told me to fuck off. I got home from work about 40 minutes ago and he gave them a full treat in front of me staring me down. Like he's trying to taunt me. We got into a huge fight and I fucking lost it. Punched a wall (outside, very hard, bad mistake) and i'm pretty sure I have a muscle contusion in my right hand.

I can't move out because of my mom and because my credit is really bad. I made some bad decisions when I had a good job and now i'm paying for it, but it's all good because lesson learned. I give her around $1800 a month for food, bills, and spending money. All of the money she makes goes to bills, so I give her extra to do things. He gives her SOME of his money and gives the rest to my fucking sister who is 12 years older than me. Like I don't want to move the fuck out. I want to move out of state, go to school, and enjoy my twenties, but I fucking cant.

He TRIES to control EVERYTHING in this fucking house. My mom is passive about it, but i'm not. So I get yelled at for telling him he's a fucking prick and do what I want anyways. I have gotten much more irritated over the last few years. I'm starting to get suicidally depressed again. It's affecting my job life because i'm stressed out to the fucking max all the time. My job is stressful and I just want to relax, be by myself, and recoup after a 10 hour workday. Just like 6 months ago I came home from an 11 hour workday to him having a heart attack in the pool. I dove into the pool, picked him up on my shoulder, and walked him out of the pool. Did the necessary protocols (I used to be an EMT). He refuses to eat healthy or exercise, so WE are the ones who have to deal with it.

My brother and I talk about him a lot. We both think he is exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's due to his drastic mood changes, forgetfulness, anger, and he is starting to become less aware of his surroundings. He REFUSES to go to a neurologist because he is SUPER paranoid (just like his mom who refused to go to the doctors until her cancer sidelined her.

I'm not really sure on what to do anymore. My mental health is taking a toll, i'm starting to lose my fucking mind because I have no idea on how to cope and/or relieve some of this stress.

TLDR; I live at home, my parents are incredibly controlling. I can't move out because my mom needs my money and my dad is exhibiting signs of alzheimers and is making my life 10000x more stressful due to his inability to reason or adjust.",08Feb2018,9

42,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this but here it is... so almost 10 years ago I took a job working as a caregiver for an extremely wealthy man. Let’s call him Bob. Before I worked for him he was a hedge fund manager in New York and was worth I believe around about 100m by the time I started. Bob was diagnosed with a disease that very slowly took his ability to do pretty much anything on his own.. which is why he needed a caregiver. I became very close with bob and his family over 7 years of working for him and had to watch as he became completely bedridden. His wife, let’s call her El, is a young, gaudy Russian woman who is obviously just waiting around for him to croak. She convinced him to leave where he was living (Ohio) and his great doctor to move to California for a different doctor. (I believe El just didn’t want to live in Ohio any longer.) I chose to not move with them to California. They moved 3 years ago and I get updates once in a while from his siblings and friends. He is still bedridden, he never leaves the house, eating blended up food, is not bathing, peeing in cups, full-on Howard Hughes-crazy. El has his power of attorney and refuses to take him to a hospital or get some real help. (The doctor they went to out there is some homeopathic nut.)


To make matters worse, I recently stumbled upon El’s instagram and found that this woman is going behind his back and purchasing enormous amounts of money’s worth of bags and shoes and then photographing herself (face always covered) wearing them on private planes and whatnot. I guess she’s doing it for the “likes” and also I think she’s doing it to get as much money as she can if he does die. And I’m not just talking about a couple hundred dollars here and there.. I’m talking $100,000 Birkin bags. Like I couldn’t even calculate the amounts she’s spending and I know from being friends with him that she’s only allowed to buy “fancy things” on holidays. 

What do I do? There’s truly nothing I can do about her not taking him to a hospital. His family knows and they’re not doing anything. And with her accentually stealing his money, It is really none of my business anymore but do I have an obligation to his family to tell them about this? ",08Feb2018,2

For having my diploma in cinema ( which is only a Pre-university ), I’ll need to do one more year in this program.

I made my application in a photographie technic. If I actually do this, it’ll take me another 3 years of school to finish it. But even that, I’m not sure about where I’ll be going with that..

I have in mind a plan to open my own coffee shop downtown. But, this project need a lot of time, preparation, thought, ressource, and money.

So, I was wondering what you were to suggest me between :

Finishing my diploma in cinema + working a part-time job. ( If I stay in cinema, I’ll have a lot of free time, so more time to work and earn money )

Or going into the photographie technic which I’ll be sure to appreciate my time there, but will work less time and be 3 years more at school, and not really knowing what to do next.

Thing is, I feel that my problem is not anything that requires legitimate help from therapy. Yes, I have anxiety, but I am willing (and I have also done in the past) to get out of my comfort zone when I return to college. The biggest problem as to why I have anxiety is vulnerability. I feel that being vulnerable - in the sense that I am opening up myself to someone and showing the real me - is the only thing I would prefer death over. I have a past of people making fun of what they know about me because I decided to become vulnerable with them. 

The real me, that only myself can witness, is a WAY more interesting person to be around, in my opinion at least. I can give opinions about stuff, say what comes to my mind, and EXPRESS EMOTIONS.

50,"**This is a long post, with a lot of backstory. Scroll to the bottom for a TLDR.**

I graduated a few years ago with a B.A. in Psych and a Minor in Cognitive Science. For a while I thought I wanted to go to a Psych PhD program so that I could become a professor. I was, and still am, really interested in neuroscience and evolutionary psychology. I loved my classes. I was a teaching assistant for one of my professors. I became president of my school's chapter of Psi Chi (academic honor society for psych). I even had a few short stints in some research labs at my school. Not enough to actually learn much about running experiments, but something to put on a resume. I spent my spare time reading books and watching lectures on my favorite topics in psychology. I had a 3.8 GPA in my major. I was *certain* that this is what I was going to do for the rest of my life.

Then I started the application process. I spent some time visiting schools and talking to professors who shared some of my research interests, with the hopes that one of them would be my advisor if I got accepted. I quickly realized that my expectations about graduate school, especially the application process, were wrong. Most of the professors I talked to either ignored me or talked to me like I was a nuisance. I didn't realize that most of the other applicants already had Master's degrees, or at least had a decent amount of research experience. I didn't even consider the possibility that the professors I wanted to work with already had enough doctoral candidates and couldn't accept any more unless I got independent funding (I had absolutely no experience with grant writing). Getting a master's degree meant an additional two years of school, and a great deal of additional debt, all to get a degree that only qualifies me to go to school for an additional 4-8 years. I didn't want to spend my twenties stressed out behind a desk just so I could get a degree that would put me in debt and would only qualify me for a narrow range of jobs that would barely pay me enough to live, let alone pay off my loans. All I really wanted to do was spend my time talking about cool ideas with people who wanted to hear them. I was passionate about the subject matter, but couldn't deal with all the attached strings. 

So I decided to postpone graduate school until I could figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Since then, I've been sort of floating. I live with my mom and work a part-time job at my local bookstore. I've applied to a lot of full-time jobs, but I've never been offered an interview. I spend my free time doing a lot of different things. I've played the guitar and piano for over a decade now, but am not formally trained and practice sporadically. I read a lot, and I jump around from genre to genre. I've picked up a few hobbies over past couple of years: programming, photography, tabletop games, hiking, writing, running, cooking, 3D modelling, and a few others. I'm okay at most of them, decent at a few, but I'm a long way away from mastering any of them. I spent some time travelling around the country, mostly visiting relatives and staying in hostels. I've had a lot of fun doing that, but it didn't help me get a job or figure out what I want to do. 

My mother is very supportive, both financially and emotionally. She helps me with most of the basic bills, and I use what remains of my modest bookstore paycheck for walking-around money. She understands my predicament and lets me vent to her whenever I feel stuck. I'm grateful to her, but I'm painfully aware that I can't ask her to support me indefinitely, and whenever I think about how much of a burden I'm probably putting on her, whether or not she admits it, I feel guilty. I feel like a spoiled little kid, not a functional adult. I would love to be financially independent, but I don't want to get sucked into a soul-crushing job just to make a living, and I'm not quite sure I could get a job like that, even if I wanted to.

About a year ago, I came up with a solution, or at least I thought I did: I would become a librarian. It shares some qualities with my bookstore job, you get great benefits, it's pretty easy to get into an MLIS program, and there was an affordable online option in my state, which meant very little debt! I applied, got accepted, and now I'm in my first semester. I was pretty excited at the beginning, but now I have some doubts.

There are some small complaints. The workload is more of a strain than I originally anticipated, especially since most of the classes are pretty boring, and don't actually teach you much. The professors are kinda rude. The readings are almost always written in an ""academic"" style, which is to say they use a lot of big words and repeat the same concept over and over again, but with different phrasing, just to reach a word count and sell you a nice, thick textbook. The assignments are not particularly difficult, but they are time consuming, and they're mostly just busywork so the professors can justify their paycheck and have something to grade us on. As it turns out, very few of them have actually worked in libraries, so I'm not sure how they're going to prepare me for a career in one. 

Bigger complaints, I've looked into the job prospects for librarians, and boy are they bleak. I sorta knew this going into it, but I figured that a lot of it was just exaggeration, and as long as I worked hard and supplemented my coursework with an internship or a volunteer position, I'd be set; I didn't understand the full extent of the problem. As it turns out, the reason it's so easy to get into an MLIS program is that it is a very poor guarantee for a job. MLIS schools are often just degree mills that only exist to collect tuition and pump out more graduates than there are available jobs. You don't actually learn many marketable skills, and the degree only qualifies you for a narrow range of jobs. I'm applying for whatever library positions I can get, even if it's just a volunteer position or an unpaid internship. My program offers a practicum that gives you some real-world experience, which is promising. But that doesn't change the fact that libraries today are often underfunded and understaffed. So much so that many of librarians are relegated to work that would normally be reserved for library aides or volunteers, often working multiple part-time or temporary jobs, because full-time, tenured positions are so hard to find. There are plenty of MLIS graduates looking for jobs, so as a new graduate you're not in a position to negotiate a raise or promotion to a more senior position.

That's not to say there are aspects of the career that don't appeal to me. I value education (although I don't like teaching, especially children/teenagers). I value free access to knowledge and technology...  supporting an informed democracy and all that. I like the idea of learning about research and helping others learn about critical thinking, the difference between reliable and unreliable sources, etc. I like the idea of government benefits. I like the idea of engaging with the community and working in a place where people can come and learn about anything that they want to without having to worry about grades or papers. I like the idea of working in archives and special collections (although my archives class that I'm taking is forcing me to reconsider that). I like the idea of promoting maker-spaces and encouraging interest in STEM fields. There are lots of things about a career as a librarian that I like the *idea* of. I also liked the *idea* of being a professor, but couldn't handle the realities of becoming one. I can't shake the feeling that I'm only doing this because I can't think of what else to do with my life, and this is the best option currently available to me. I've felt this way since I started the application process, but I dismissed it, because... what else am I going to do?

Therein lies my predicament. I considered and rejected a lot of different career paths before settling on librarian. I wanted to become a freelance science writer, which would allow me to share my love of science with others without all the attached strings of academia, but that's not a practical way to become financially independent. I thought about going into programming, because I took some programming classes in college, continued it as a hobby, and have had a lot of fun with it. But I don't have the time, money, or credentials to get into a decent computer science program, and all of the online ""bootcamps"" that promise to get you a job seem sketchy. I wanted to become a 3D animator, but tuition for art school is crazy expensive. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...

Here's the thing: I'm incredibly lazy and easily deterred, but only under certain circumstances. I've quit a lot of things in my life, for the simple reason that someone forcing or paying me to do something that I might otherwise find enjoyable, for some reason, undermines my intrinsic interest in doing whatever that thing is. Either that, or I liked the idea of doing that thing, or of doing that thing the way I wanted to do it, but didn't fully consider all the ugly, difficult, nitty-gritty aspects of it. It's why I quit soccer, violin, school orchestra. I've always been this way. It's a flaw that I'm fully aware of, and that I'm working on. All I actually want to do is spend my time learning about the world, hanging out with friends, and making cool stuff (doesn't everybody?). I have a lot of hobbies, as I mentioned above, and I'm constantly busying myself with little personal projects: writing stories, creating dinky programs in python, creating a Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign, writing 'articles' on topics that interest me (that I never actually share with anyone), making my own board games, making videos, cooking, and a bunch of other stuff. Occasionally, I'll actually finish one of them, but most of the time I don't, mostly due to the fact that (a) I don't have a regular schedule and (b) I'm not financially independent. Every time I work on a personal project, something that doesn't directly lead to a job or financial stability, but something that I do just for the fun of it, I feel guilty that I'm not working toward something more productive, so I put it aside and tell myself that I'll come back to it when I ""have the time."" But even though I only work about 20-30 hours a week, I never seem to have the time or energy that I need to complete a personal project, especially since I started school, and if I land an internship or volunteer position, I'll have even less time.

If I had a job with regular, predictable hours, that paid me enough to support myself, and didn't interfere with my free time, I feel like I'd be able to get one of these personal projects done and-who knows?-maybe turn one of them into source of income, or maybe even a satisfying career/side-gig. But that kind of job doesn't seem to exist, or if it does, I'm not qualified for it. 

I'm frustrated. I'm sick of waiting for my adult life to begin just because I can't find a decent job. I applied to the MLIS program because I thought being a librarian would meet those criteria, but I'm only a month into the program, and I'm already falling behind on my classwork. On top of that I'm working an exhausting retail job (I mainly work the stock room at the bookstore), trying to maintain a relationship and a social life, looking for a second job (or, more likely, an unpaid internship/volunteer position), trying to save money, trying to make time for the hobbies that make me happy and keep me sane, trying to eat healthy, trying to get regular exercise, trying to get enough sleep, trying to deal with my ADHD and anxiety, trying to not be a financial burden to my family, trying to move out of the shitty state that I live in, and I just... can't do it all. I'm exhausted, I'm stressed, but I feel like there's no other path for me to take. I've been in a rut ever since I decided to forgo doctoral programs, but no matter what alternative option I consider, there's always some obstacle or deterrent. 

**In summary** (bet you've heard this one before): **I have no idea what to do with my life.** 

***Help?***

**TL;DR - I'm in graduate school to become a librarian, but I'm having second thoughts. All I really want to do is pursue my hobbies, but that's not a practical way for me to move out of my mother's house. Advice?**",08Feb2018,1

I overheard lots of yelling on the phone and felt like they were being unreasonable towards him. He currently lives with me and pays a little less than half the rent and no utilities which is what I asked (the price I set). He hasn't had a job but has been searching vehemently. That being said, in between searching for jobs he's been laying in the bed all day. He's still had no luck and has been sleeping for upwards of 14 hrs. He hasn't done any of his laundry and has everything strewn across the floor. He's started asking for money for gas and food and I'm starting to draw the line. We went out today, after making plans for being out for several hours and after being out just a bit, he insisted on going home to bed. On the way home, I mentioned this dog walking job that's an app (he loves dogs). I looked at the app and asked him if he wanted me to apply for him. He started shouting about applying tomorrow. ""I'll do it myself!"" I then was like well, why don't you apply right now? At which point he started screaming about me telling him what to do, etc. Like, I get that I was being bossy, but I feel like he doesn't understand my perspective. I don't want to work 65 hr weeks, pregnant to come home to some dude sleeping with his mess all over the apartment. I also don't like screaming. My family doesn't scream. When someone screams I want to cry. My roommate is now complaining that he needs space but I'm gone for at least 65 hours a week. Like, he wants me to give him a full day, but I'm like, I'm working 12 hr shifts, dude. It's him that needs to leave the apartment! Help!",08Feb2018,1

56,"Hi guys, I work at an auto parts retail store that I won’t say the name of and there is something shady going on. It’s a large corporate company. I’ve been there for four years and am part of the management team.  

They have came up to me and sat me down in the office and interrogated me with a tape recorder for two hours because they thought I was stealing before. They lied to me and said they had evidence of me stealing but wanted to give me “the opportunity to be honest and have some credibility.” That was a blatant lie. I got written up with a “First and Final” warning. They pretty much treated me like I was guilty until proven innocent.

So today I was talking with my boss and he said that corporate thinks someone is stealing again and that they’re coming to look into it. I know that I have a giant target on my back even though I’m innocent. I just know they’re going to come straight for me when they get there. 

I could use some advice/help in how I can prove my innocence as I’m not really wanting to find another job that suits me as well as this one. 

Thanks! ",08Feb2018,1
58,"I find this stupid. Talking to people on the internet for advice, but it’s come to this. There is no one in my life to talk to and I’m just hiding everything I feel and crying almost every night I can’t do it anymore. 

I want to be happy. I’m really trying but everything has been so shitty for the past few years and I’m trying to do good and keep a positive attitude but when everything has gone bad it’s frustrating . 
Even though I’ve never had more than 2 friends, I have none now. I have a boyfriend that my mom hates because of his race. Let’s just say our relationship is weird. I do love him though, he’s all I have right now. Even though he would probably leave me if he knew. 

School is complicated. I’m sweating bullets all day because my anxiety is KILLING me. I want to stop being “quiet and shy” but I can’t. Everyday during lunch I just go to the bathroom or walk around. I don’t want to go in and sit by myself and be looked at I would panic. My skin is terrible and I tend to hide my face I hate it when people look at me but I always wear makeup. Even in front of myself. No one ever sees me without it. I’m trying to fix my terrible skin and it’s just staying bumpy and red and just scary honestly. I’ve tried everything for my skin even accutane (!!!wow the acne cure!!!) 

My family treats me different, they always have. I just feel so alone and closed up in my room all the time. I can only do so much by myself, going on walks in this small boring town gets old. It’s hard for me to think of a reason why I should keep myself going through this, but if I do kill myself what then?? I don’t know what to do. I seem like a negative person, I get told that. It’s just that I want to be happy like all the others my age, going out on the weekends with their friends and family, not hiding behind makeup everyday, sitting enjoying lunch with friends. Why can’t I have this too? Also, I must mention I have no talent. Absolutely not good at anything, no exaggeration here. 

My emotions are crazy and always changing, seems weird. Maybe I have a disorder. One minute I’m screaming and angry. Next I’m crying my eyes out and 10 minutes later I pretend nothing happened and I’m “happy” again. Everything mean anyone ever says to me makes me want to break down. I hold on to everything that hurts me and my feelings and it always comes back to me at the worst times. My anxiety is getting so bad I have panic attacks a lot and I’m jumpy all the time.  I’ve been to a few therapist. I just need someone to give me some advice I guess? I know my situation could be worse and maybe all of these “problems” are just me being a sensitive bitch, I don’t know, but I’m still hurting. ",08Feb2018,8
59,"That was the best title I could come up with, but here's the story. I moved across the country to go to a new college, my program has 11 students including me. I live off campus and don't drink/party so outside of class once a week I don't see my other classmates. So they have bonded pretty well and I'm the one left out (which I don't mind). 
So last Friday I was at the neurologist and she said I had to get a spinal tap. So I went to our snapchat group, and asked for help. I said that I have to have a spinal tap done, this is when and where and I need somebody to take me to and from and maybe some help afterwards also with food cause I have to lay down for 24 hours after the tap.
Nobody replied. At all. 
There's been other messages on our group since then and it's as if I never sent that message. And everybody saw it, I know that cause Snapchat shows. It's been five days and nothing from anybody. I see them in class tomorrow, it'll be the first time seeing them since last Thursday, the day before I asked for help.
I had to ask my instructor and the small college's secretary for help to take me to the tap... and I'm feeling hurt and betrayed by my classmates. It's a really small group and our program director and instructors constantly hound us on being a team not only in class but outside of it, in all areas. He says that we're supposed to be there for eachother. 
One classmate once asked me if I had a truck, I do, and he said he needed help buying a couch. I told him I could be there in 15 minutes. No questions, no anything. Wouldn't let him pay me for gas either.
Another classmate asked our group if somebody could take him to do an errand. I said I could, when and where do you want to go. Just like that. 
If any single one of them contacted me for help I'd do it, no delay, no questions asked, no matter how much I like them or don't or how much I know them or don't. 
Today in our snapchat group there was a fight because one classmate hasn't been coming in proper uniform and it's lowering all of our grades because of it. They really hounded on him and two classmates specifically said ""we are a team if you need help ask for it.""
It pissed me off. I DID ask for it, and nobody said a darn thing about it. So. Now I'm crying.

62,"I can't decide which one is the best option, therefore I have come looking for advice and experiences from you lovely people and how you think I should best proceed with the rest of my life.

So I (Canadian, 21, F) am graduating university (Communications/Advertising/Marketing so jobs) in April and have been accepted into 3 postgraduate programs for colleges here. Tuition is around $5000. I am $10,000 in debt to the government for student loans for my university career. I have around $2300 in credit card debt currently. 

Option 1: I go to college in September and according to OSAP I can receive around $13,000 in government help. I will be living at home so my only expense will be my $70/month phone bill. No rent, no groceries though I will always chip in for stuff obviously. Pay my tuition, pay off my credit cards, hold the rest and get a part-time job during school (if possible, I may be super busy depending on my course load). Get a higher paying job than what I would have gotten with just a degree, pay off student loans and start saving at 23. IMO, least frugal in the short run, most frugal in the long run (higher salary vs faster saving). 

Option 2: I still move home, but instead find a job or multiple part-time right away. I have serving experience, live in a university town and would be able to find another job easily. Pay off student loans and credit cards ASAP and just get my life on track. Potentially go back to school in the future, maybe defer my acceptance a year. The only issue is I start paying interest on my OSAP in 6 months after graduation, *unless* I go back to school. Otherwise, I start paying 3.5% interest on $10,000 so if I add another 10k this time around (unlikely but possible) monthly payments will climb significantly. 

If I go this route I would probably wait a few years and reapply to college if I can't find anything permanent worth having; pays off all debt, reinvest and try again when I'm financially secure. I can make $10k pretty easily, I would get at least 2 part-time jobs until its all paid off. All my friends are going back to school so this wouldn't be an issue for at least a year. 

Basically, go straight to work and skip the whole post-graduate program for now. 

Option 3: I pay off student loans and credit card debt and then travel, then hop into the academic or actual world depending on what experience I manage to gain while taking my time to explore the world. I'd work part-time jobs to fund the lifestyle short-term, potentially living out of a van if I decide to do a Canada/US road trip (Canada in Summer obviously). 

I have major wanderlust and I have been focussing on travel being my way out after being stuck in education for 18 years. It's the *least* economically viable option, for obvious reasons, but that has been my dream for the last 8 years. Au pairing is an option across seas, of course, you get a stipend and generally room/board which is nice. I love kids and have babysat for years, so it isn't a far-fetched idea. 

Any input, experiences with any of the above, or anything at all would be w o n d e r f u l ! ",08Feb2018,3
63,"My MIL was diagnosed years ago with Policystic Kidney Disease, a genetic disorder that leads to kidney failure.  About 5 years ago she had both of her kidneys removed, each one the size of a football, and has been on dialysis 5 days a week ever since.  She has been on the transplant list and does everything she can to take care of herself but we just got news that she is running out of time.  Her doctors believe that any kidney that doesn't come from a living donor will likely kill her, as her heart wouldn't be strong enough to resupply it with blood.

I have tried multiple times to lose weight so I can be a living donor for her or as part of a cross-donation.  But every time I make progress something seems to get in the way, whether it be life events, family, or budget, or just simply time.  But now I'm afraid that letting these things stop me may have made things too late.  

I need to lose about 100 pounds before her doctors will even consider testing me as a match.  I've done Keto before but it is hard to do on a budget, especially with a two year old.  I am also having trouble finding time to exercise as my wife's schedule, my schedule, and our son make it extremely difficult to get out or go to a gym, let alone being able to afford a membership in the first place.

He advised that we do not use any of the dishes that have been left out and to thoroughly clean the apartment afterwards. He also advised to wait at least 2 hours. Now it's been 9 hours since the cleaning of the vents and we're going to bed, and we cleaned as much as we possibly could.

When it came to court the 'State Police Bomb Squad Expert' claimed it was the worse thing he saw in his ""whole 14 years on the force"" and made it seem like I was making something nuclear-radioactive.

I won't go into details of exactly what was used to make it (easily found online) but I will say it had the composition of a traditional M-80. I can promise you it was not as bad as he made it out to be. Because he was an 'expert witness' he put me in a terrible position due to the influence his opinion had on the judges perception. The average lay person looks at a M-80 like it dynamite so with that and what this 'expert' has to say, well I was fuckkkd.

So, as of now, I'm a trans person that's still in the closet about things.

This isn't a post about ""how should I come out to my parents????"", because that's the easy part.

The problem I'm worrying over is why I'm transitioning.

I've felt a desire to transition ever since the latter half of middle school and it's stemmed from two things, those two things being a hatred of how ugly I am, and how lonely I am.

I've grown up frequenting edgier parts of the internet, and my case reminds me almost of Christian Weston Chandler's situation, where he was looking so hard for a girlfriend that he decided to become a girl.

To be clear, I'm not looking to become a trans-lesbian. I'm simply looking to be loved, and to do that, I figure I need to abandon my disgusting appearance as it is now and recreate myself in a feminine image in order to be loved properly.

I have a feeling I may be poisoned by the MGTOW blackpill, considering I used to be that sort of edgy memer, and that's driving my entire will to transition.

So, the thing I'm worried about is, am I transitioning for the right reason? Am I really trans or just painfully lonely and confused? Anyone care to answer? ",08Feb2018,2

B LOVES attention from anyone, but mostly from boys. Now there’s nothing wrong with that, but it makes her a victim for a lot of sleazy guys at school. She falls for people extremely easily. I hate seeing her get hurt over and over by boys who only want in her pants while she develops feelings within a few days. She’ll come to me and I’ll tell her that she needs to be a bit more careful in who she chooses to take an interest in. She’s aware of the problem but doesn’t want to change. “I like the attention,” she says. 

B always comes to me when she’s upset and I’m always there to do my best to comfort her. When I’m sad, she’s just kind of shrugs it off and doesn’t seem to care. 

We also have a mutual friend who has depression. B’s the type of person who thinks the cure for depression is to “put yourself out there more” or “go hang out more.” It’s really infuriating. 

B talks to my exes. I don’t have a problem with this because most were amicable break ups. There’s only one who I mind her talking to because he ended up hurting me so badly. B just goes right on ahead talking to him though and sending him nudes. She talks about me with all of them. It’s irritating because I know for a fact if I talked to one of her exes, it would be the end of the world.

B does have problems at home though. Her mom is abusive. I feel like this is why she loves attention so much. This is also why I feel like I can’t leave her because of her situation at home. I feel like she needs someone to talk to, but I feel like I’m getting mistreated too. B is a really nice person. She’s very sweet and kind but she’s extremely naive.

75,"Hello, 

When I got out of high school I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I applied to become a Pharmacy Technician at Anthem College. I made a quick decision, simply because I saw all of my friend going off to college and knowing exactly what they wanted to do. I dropped out of Anthem College after a few months. By that time it was too late to get any sort of reimbursement  for my tuition. Being the idiot 18 year old I was, I never paid my student loans. Which obviously took me to collections. The school levied my wages and took their money from my paychecks/income taxes. I was in a pretty bad accident when I was 19 years old and after receiving medical bills, I also avoided those also, and of course brought me into collections. 


Long story short, I made some pretty bad decisions. But after years of growing up I had to do, I realized that this wasn't how I wanted to live anymore. I went on Credit Karma and looked at whatever was remaining in my collections history and paid them in full. I am no longer in debt. 

My question is, how do I establish/build credit? On the Credit Karma website it gives me a list of Credit Cards that I am able to apply for and will be approved, however every card has an APR rate of 24%. Are there any other ways to establish credit? If I do sign up and get a credit card, are there any tips/advice you would give to a first time Credit Card holder? Are there any other ways to establish and build credit other than signing up for a credit card?

78,"Hello everyone,
I've never done something like this before, but I'm feeling a bit lost and am in need of an unbiased opinion. I am 21 years old and half-way through my sophmore year of college. I was attending an art college in NYC, but I am taking the spring semester off to look at other colleges. I had very good grades there, but I was very depressed and began having suicidal thoughts because I had no friends and no support system. Most of the students who attended my college were international students from China. Understandably, they did not feel as comfortable interacting with me than they would other international students. Most of the students also did not live in the dorms (which was where I was). The school also did not offer any classes or outside help in terms of how to make it in the art world, everything was technical skill, which was good, but I need more than that. There were also no clubs outside of art, so I wasn't meeting anyone with similar interests to me outside of art. I couldn't even find anyone who wanted to go shopping with me. After a year and half of being very unhappy, I made the hard decision to take a leave of absence. I know I made the right choice, as I am no longer having suicidal thoughts, but I am very scared about how uncertain my future is. 
Before all this, from when I was 13 years old to when I was 19 years old, I was working with a dog aggression specialist and I was so sure that that was what I wanted to do with my life. However, over time, I noticed that all the people around me in the profession were very unhappy with their lives or had a lot to complain about, and that's not how I wanted to live my life. The woman I worked with, my mentor, was arrested on 29 counts of animal cruelty, which I had no idea about, and thus my passion came to a sudden halt. I had no idea what to do, so my mom suggested I try art school, because I had been drawing my whole life.
My mom wanted to be an artist, and her godmother was going to send her to Paris, and art school in New York. They said no, you have to be a doctor or a lawyer, so she became a physical therapist. I often feel that I am just going to art school to live out my mothers dreams because I don't have any of my own. I feel like I have no choice but to make this work. I went through plan A, I'm on plan B, and I don't have a plan C. I don't really have any other passions or things I'm good at. I'm of average intelligence. I am above average at writing.
I was told growing up by teachers and kids in my school that I would never amount to anything because I had autism. My mom and dad went through so much emotional pain and financial burden to give me everything I needed to succeed. I feel like I have to repay them, and the least I can do is be independent, but I don't know if I can. Most people my age in my area are in their senior year of college or having kids and I still feel like I'm 16.
My extended family has told me not to worry because ""I'm very pretty and one day some rich man will marry you and you'll have his kids and he'll take care of you."" That idea to me is so void and meaningless. It hurts to know that they believe that is all I can hope to amount to. I don't want kids because I feel that it would be cruel to potentially bring a child with autism into this world, where they will grow up being told that they do not belong or will not amount to anything because of who they are down to their genetics, like me. Not to mention the heavy financial burden, and at this moment, I don't see myself making enough money to support a child. But when my cousins kids were over I secretly heard her talking to my dad about, 'How she has to enjoy them because she will most likely not be alive when Connor (my younger brother) has children because I don't want any.' I feel guilty and unmotivated.
Long story short, I'm visiting other art colleges this weekend, so all this has been on my mind. If anyone has any advice for me on how to move forwards, that would be great. Thank you.",08Feb2018,2

This morning, I woke up to 3 squealing mice. It was then that I realized I’ve made a horrible mistake. I didn’t realize how inhumane these traps were. Because I was running late for work, I had no choice but to put them in a cardboard box and deal with them later.

But now, it is “later” and I am mortified with the situation at hand. I opened the box after work today and am now traumatized by what I have seen. At least 2 of the mice were still moving. And there are three aborted mice fetuses on one of the glue traps. One of them had been pregnant...

My initial plan had been to use vegetable oil to free the mice at a park a few blocks away. However, after seeing the carnage, I really don’t have the stomach to open the box again. I also don’t have the guts to kill them with blunt force. My boyfriend just wants to bag them up (alive) and throw them out with the trash.

Planned on getting a 8000 watt generator, some 330 gallon water totes, a dumpster, build a water tower, and a shack like place for me. I do want to eventually grow a pot farm along with a few other things, but that’s not as important to me as everything else. Does this seem like a good idea? My family is on board but the people I’ve told don’t think so. I need more opinions. What should I do? ",08Feb2018,4
85,"*Context: I work for an upscale office as my full time job. And on the side, I freelance remotely for a sex club: I do web support and general administration for them in my spare time.*

I'm working for my full time job remotely this week, so I have both email accounts (two different URLs) installed on my Mac Mail as separate accounts. 

I've been very careful about which account I'm sending from, but today I fucked up: I sent an email to three important business clients from the full time job, and CC'd my full time colleague... but from the freelance sex club email, instead of the business email. 

The content of the message was fine, but the URL is coming from a sex club's website, and I'm concerned that if the external clients and colleagues notice it, and go to the URL, they'll be shocked and confused... 

**What would you do?** I'm torn between owning up to it; mentioning it and saying ""oops, looks like I've been hacked, something weird happened""; or just letting it go and hoping no one notices. ",08Feb2018,2
86,"So I just found out about this earlier tonight and I’ve been kinda freaking out. So before y’all judge me, I was 18 when I did the big dumb things and I was in a really weird headspace and I know it was a really bad idea. Basically I put a bunch of nude stuff/masturbation stuff on my tumblr and on a pornhub account when I was 18. I was still finishing high school at this point, but I was hoping to get to a point where I might make some money. After not too long I got paranoid and realized it was a bad idea so I deleted all of it. I figured that would be the end of it.

Well, here we are, 3 years later and I’m being contacted by other women who are being put on blast by some “after dark” tumblr that stole photos from their iclouds. I checked my tumblr for the first time in years and I had messaged from the after dark account asking me for the pictures and videos I had deleted and they sent me a screenshot from a video I had put on my tumblr. 

Needless to say I’m pretty freaked out. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want stuff floating around from when I was barely 18. Any pictures/videos that are out are from when I turned 18 to about 3 months after I turned 18. A very small, very creepy window. Like I said, I’m incredibly embarrassed and never thought it would come back. 

Point of clarification. The main woman who messaged me went to the same university I’m currently attending, that’s the only thing we have in common. ",08Feb2018,2
87,"I currently work at an authorized retailer for T-Mobile (let’s call them Company A). I’ve been with them for over 6 months and I have never felt cared about by the company. I feel extremely stressed at work 24/7 and I never have a sense of job security. I feel there is very little actual management that goes on as well. 

Recently I was wrote up for not meeting my sales goals. However, January and February are known to be very dead months and the store that I am in is over staffed, making it nearly impossible for me to meet that goal. I am being threatened to be wrote up again on the 15th if I don’t meet that goal, which I can almost guarantee I won’t. 

Today I applied at another authorized retailer of T-Mobile (Company B). Was this foolish of me to do? If they don’t hire me, can my current employer fire me for applying there in the first place? Should I have left T-Mobile as a whole?",08Feb2018,1

Today, she decided to grab my dick and hold it for a few seconds before letting go, and laughing like it was a joke... so, I told my girlfriend what happened and she wasn't too happy either. The girl that grabbed my dick, she's been an alright friend within the few months I've known her, and we talk every day, I hug her and compliment her sometimes, and we talk shit on each other to each other faces and laugh after... under the circumstances, is it possible to remain the friendship or should I end it?",08Feb2018,1
91,"(I apologize for the long wall of text. I usually have my two friends mentioned in this story that I talk to, but aside from them, I have no support. Thank you if you take the time to read this)

I'm going to start off with saying I have a hard time loving myself as a person, am very insecure, and have constant anxiety of things that aren't worth worrying about. I mention this for context, not for any excuse of my actions, as I am fully aware I can't be acting like this. 

 But basically, I don't have the chance to make many friends. I have a constant fear of being inadequate, and while embarrassing, I get jealous and feel insecure. I never necessarily act upon these emotions, but lately I have been having breakdowns because of them. My jealousy probably stems from those things, and is probably the reason it tends to affect me whenever the person is a girl. I never get this feeling when for example, a guy would show up in a friend group.


So...again, this is embarrassing, but I will be honest. Honesty helps for honest advice. So, basically, I am in a new school and have been for a while. For the first time in my life, I have made wonderful friends who have proven over this period of time to have been there for me in my ups and downs. I'm a girl, and my friends are two guys. I often call them my brothers, because, as I have lived a very sheltered life, they have protected and educated me on basics life skills, and have given me memories and happy adventures I will never forget. 

Now here's the embarrassing but serious part. Recently, the three of us became friends with another girl. She's nice, and makes people laugh. However, since she has joined, I have had the anxiety of being replaced. Like, really bad. I have a history of only being able to make friends with guys for whatever random reason, so part of me worries maybe I'm jealous of this girl getting attention from them because...I'm used to being the only girl? Again, they are like my brothers, so seeing them also offer that same love and care to someone else of similarity gets me anxious. She's a very nice person, but...I secretly get upset. 

I see her interact with so much more charisma,  and the two only friends I have seem to love spending time with her. These observations could obviously be through the vision of my insecurity and anxiety, but lately, I have been distant. The three of them often do things together now without me. I tried really hard to maybe consider other possibilities, like maybe they just happened to be at the same place and decided to hang out. Or maybe they're doing homework? 

But I still feel jealousy. I'll be honest. I am jealous because her personality relates with them so much better.

So this will obviously be me comparing myself to her, but I will say these thoughts so that you can get an idea of my thought process throughout these anxious emotions. So,  She relates to them by having a troubled past as well, while I am naive and have experienced nothing. She gives good advice, I cannot. She knows so much more things they do. She just overall has much more charisma. In comparison, my personality I feel is stale because I;m too nice in the boring way. I am sheltered so I dont know many pop culture things. I am the typical 'good girl' who gets average grades, and is 'sweet', but to me, I feel my sweetness is the  bland kind of sweetness. She actually has a personality, and is so cool! They always wanna learn more about her. With me, however, I feel they have not shown that much interest. They just 'enjoy my positivity', as they say, but of course my anxious self believes that is a code word for BORING. Again, this is probably due to the vision of my own anxiety of insecurities. But that doesn't change the fact that it's still affecting me. I want that to change before I hurt myself and others.

Again, this new girl is very nice. I try to talk to her, and she's very open! And as you could probably tell, I compare myself to her A LOT. And it's horrible. She doesn't deserve to be entangled in my mess of emotions! 

I have no other friends. I cried today because of mainly other issues in my life, and so I excused myself today from our group. My friends, my brothers, being the kind people they are, ran out to walk me back to my house. I felt so happy and sad, because it had been a while since the three of us had been together for a while. I also felt guilty for crying. While they themselves chose on their own will to escort me, I still probably made a scene, and it probably seemed like I did it for attention.

What if I DID break down for attention?

Maybe It is pathetic for me to beg strangers on the internet for help, but all I want is honest advice on what I should do. I'm scared that this will hurt other people. While I am never the type to hurt someone over jealousy, I'm scared I will slowly and subconsciously hurt my own self esteem, and hurt my friends as well. I can't afford therapy, and I have no option for support, as these are usually my primary friends. 

I just dont want to lose my friends. They are what made this chapter in my life so lovely. I should know better than to assume they would 'replace' me, but I am still honestly so scared. I love them so much, and they always say I'm like their little sister. I don't want to lose this sibling-friendship we have going...I don't want to be alone again. These guys proved someone like me, whom I thought was boring, could make friends and be happy.

Thank you in advance. This was the best place I heard of to ask advice. Even if no one is a professional here, I would appreciate it. Thank you so much.",08Feb2018,2
92,"I'm just upset. And to this day don't understand whats happening to my husband. When we met, he was an atheist and so was i. One of the first things we bonded on was about what we thought about the world, ourselves, everything. And we both agreed that we think no one knows the answers, no one knew the answers and no one will ever know the answers. Things just are and people in this world only come up with answers or believe someone else's answers because they can't handle reality. When our children were born my parents wanted to get them baptized and both myself and my husband told them no. That we didn't believe in that stuff. Just last year out of the blue my husband begins talking to me about something he called ""Nordic stories"" about Thor, Odin etc. and how he liked reading about them. I thought he probably found some book and didnt think much of it. Days later hes back to the same topic, about how he likes learning about Heathenry stuff. It just took off from there. He wears a miolnir pendant around his neck that cost more than my damn wedding band. He belongs to several group chats where heathenry is all they talk about. He joined a group meetup where they do who knows what once a week. He made a shrine in a tiny part of our place i didn't even know about until recently where there's candles, pictures of some bearded dudes, beads, plants and rocks and crap everywhere. I told this to a friend of mine, how uncomfortable this was all making me and she suggested i get into the heathenry thing with him. But i just can't. I don't want to fake interest in something or pretend i believe in a god that drinks coffee offerings (yes ive actually caught my husband pouring coffee into a tiny cup to offer some to a picture...) I'm just feeling resentful towards my husband for doing this and as weird as this sounds, feeling betrayed. I know i sound petty or childish but i don't care. I asked him an hour ago (we fought after finding out hes not going to pull overtime this weekend because he has yet another heathenry meeting to go to and we needed the extra money) what this religion means to him, if it makes him happy or what he gains from doing all this weird stuff and he says ""it just feels right"". And he then got defensive and told me to back off and leave him alone. I am probably in the wrong here, i mean he's not hurting anyone, he hasn't tried to teach the kids any of this stuff and keeps it pretty well hidden. Its just something thats been bothering me all year. Should i just learn to live with this new husband and let it go?",08Feb2018,2
94,"I am currently a junior girl at a small high school in California. In one of my classes there are these two freshman girls who I talk with sometimes, they are best friends, lets call them Amanda and Emma. I am closer with Amanda, I actually have two classes and a seminar with her. Today we had an all-school assembly where the topic was consent and sexual harassment. A class or two later, Amanda mentions to me in passing that Emma has been harassed or assaulted by a male student at our school. She gives me no more details than this. Both girls come to talk to me about things like the boys the want to date and other sorts of things you might want mentoring from someone a little bit older on. I texted Amanda this afternoon to talk about what she had mentioned earlier. She said she wouldn't give me more details and that Emma couldn't know that I knew. I told her that she had to tell an adult and she replied that she had confronted Emma about it and that Emma didn't want to report it. I tried explaining to her that by not reporting it, it puts Emma in danger as it could easily happen again if the boy doesn't get the message that what he is doing is wrong. Amanda goes on to tell me that it doesn't matter since the boy is moving to another state soon, and after an explanation she doesn't seem to grasp that another girl at his new school could be a victim as well. Overall Amanda seems to have a casual attitude towards it, she would reply to my questions with ""lol"" or ""whatever"" (she is a very jokey person and often has a casual attitude towards serious topics). The problem that I have is what should I do with this info? I don't have enough details to report anything and I don't know how to go forwards since I don't the severity of it situation.

95,"So to start with, I have to say that my brother is kind of bad at dating. Every relationship he’s been in hasn’t ended well, to say the least. I’m not exactly sure why, but for some reason, the women he ends dating always seem to be on a different wavelength than him. It’s kind of hard to explain, but it’s like he never really clicks with his partners. Like he can’t be himself properly around them. 

So last week, he told me that he signed up for one of those romance tour things online, those events where you meet a group of foreign women in another country and choose to date them? He’s leaving for the Philippines next month. I checked it out, and I honestly don’t know what to make of the whole thing. I feel like I should keep him company in case he does something he might regret. Should I be talking him out of it? Like I said, he hasn’t been having a good run when it comes to love, maybe this could be a good thing for him.

104,"Hello everyone. I'm wondering what the best way to tell my parents is about... essentially everything. Basically I've been going through years of depression and anxiety. I've always kept it hidden but, after a recent failed suicide attempt I decided to drop out of college and go back home for a while. The thing is they know absolutely nothing about my mental health issues, my alcohol abuse issues, or the suicide attempt. My dropping out and wanting to come home hit them out of nowhere and now I'm absolutely dreading the conversation we're going to have. I'm 100% certain they'll know all the right things to say to seem supportive, but I know they'll be absolutely disgusted with me right under the surface.

105,"I use to be such a good student. I could study 5-8 hours straight with short 15 minutes between every 2 hours. I would pay attention in class and do all my readings. Now, I barely make coherent notes. I haven't seen a dent in my grades yet to scare me. 

Please don't judge me because I know I'm cheating myself, it isn't fair to other students and I'm a horrible for doing so  but its mostly due to the fact that my professors this term use testbanks on quizlets. I've been still getting 90s like I did before.  So basically, I've been rewarded for bad behaviour which is never good.

I haven't been able to study properly since last term. I can't pay attention and I get bored super easily. Last time I studied well was for finals in the fall, where I had 4 exams in 48 hours. 

I'm going to stop using quizlet and try studying like I use to. I did better  when I studied if I'm being honest and felt less guilty. Or use them after I studied.

112,"I feel it's appropriate to first give context of my situation.  I'm turning 19 this year, live in a upper middle class household in Australia, I got sent to the best private school of my city and I currently attend the best business school in Australia.  I'm a normal looking 6'3 white man in perfect health.

 My parents come from humble backgrounds, they've dated since 13 and never had a single argument.   My mother was as poor as you can be in a country like Australia growing up (didn't have food some nights grew up sometimes homeless parents had addiction issues, she'd get bullied for not having any shoes etc).  My dad is from a normal middle class family but is extremely down to earth, caring, hardworking and his life literally is our family and he will try and do everything he can to provide (does all the house work, yard work, puts all of us first and takes us on holidays around Australia and Europe).

They try and give me everything because they had nothing. 

Essentially I am in what I like to call the privilege cycle. 
You often hear people talk about how the kids of wealthy parents flunk and don't harness their potential and have a disconnect.  That's me.  My mum is emotionally scarred from her parents drug and cigarette addictions, yet my cruisy life has meant Ive taken up both habits for fun and sent mum into depression after she found out.  I know right from wrong but can't put that into action.  

I love my parents so much but continually make decisions that hurt them (without me intending to).  I'm afraid that I'm going to flunk because of it and the writing is on the wall as I have very little value of things like money because I've always got my parents safety net.  My parents have both had such a great run at life and now I'm plunging them into anguish and pain that they certainly don't deserve.

I feel like an ass even complaining and asking for help but I'm lost on how I could correct the trajectory of my life.  

Additional information that may or may not be useful is that I'm somewhat Aspergers.

115,"TL,DR: I don't know how to properly heal from a relationship that ended years ago. I haven't been interested in anyone since but I am lonely and starved of physical intimacy.

Preface: 21 year old heterosexual man here. Good social life. There are a couple of intersecting causes of my problem that I bring up.

My previous (and first) girlfriend and I split up about three years ago. I still think about her on a daily basis. I have an intense nostalgia for the relationship, that has never died down. It was a beautiful and formative time of my life. We went out for three years and it was an amicable breakup, though it did drag on for months, as it can do, with us continuing to sleep together, until she said we had to stop. I think of this as the true end because it carried with it the most acute sensation of loss. I have changed a lot since then and I regret some of the attitudes that I held and how they likely catalysed the ending of the relationship. 

I haven't gone out with anyone since then. I haven't had sex with anyone since her. She is the only person I've had sex with. Not only that, but, as the title states, I haven't really been attracted to anyone since her. Or at least not to a point of wanting to pursue them. I considered that I might be demisexual, but I don't actually feel that way. I'm heterosexual with a low sex drive, I guess. I still masturbate most days. I don't even know. I am extremely particular about who I could see myself in a relationship with: so far, no one. I do that thing a lot where I look at an attractive stranger on the bus and fill in all the gaps about who they are and what they're like: they're perfect, obviously... until they stand up and I see that they have a lame tattoo or something. Counterproductive. Alienating.

Anyway, I just feel like at this point I should have met someone or at least had a thing with someone else but no one has interested me. I also get anxious about sex because I can find it hard to get an erection, which is a viscious cycle that has played into my apprehensions about going after people. A couple of months ago I met a girl at a bar and we were talking for ages and I ended up going home to hers but I couldn't get an erection. I wouldn't say I was embarrassed at the time, but it confirmed a fear that has plagued me about my abilities thereof. But even in that case, I don't feel like I really wanted to be with her, I was just doing it to try and break out of the rutt, the cycle. But at the same time there is no reason I shouldn't have been attracted to her. We connected, shared interests and were having good conversations, and she was beautiful. I haven't been able to relate with anyone on this issue and I feel embarrassed when any attention is brought to my romantic life in social settings. I think it is just assumed that I am private about it.

I have the option to move to my moms, she has my sister and my other brother (I'm the oldest with 19) but then my dad has to pay child support and I don't know how I feel about that. Also my little brother would be here by himself and I'm scared he will get treated like I am being treated now.. 
I just want to talk to him and explain what I feel is wrong with the situation but I always end up getting emotional and shit, which is very.. Not like me, additionally I actually want to have a relationship with him later on, but if this continues I don't see that happening.

125,"I'm just gonna lay out the facts of my situation and then ask for advice at the very end. 

I currently live with two roommates, Austin and Liz.

Austin is a great guy, easy to hang out with, and is a largely functional person, so I've never had to worry about him. Austin's dad owns the apartment that we live in, which is great when it comes to repairs. Austin currently has his own room.

Liz (who I was friends with before we moved in) dropped a bit of a bombshell on Austin and I when she announced that she wouldn't be attending classes at the university she was previously enrolled in. She promised to get a job and attend a community college last year, but instead spent the semester doing nothing. She is now enrolled at a community college, but I'm still not comfortable with her after how she handled last semester. I share a room with Liz, and Liz has many strange quirks that drive me crazy. Liz will be moving out after this summer. 

To replace Liz, Austin has been working on finding a replacement roommate. However, this replacement roommate would share a room with me, not Austin. As the title indicates, I really don't want to share a room with anyone anymore. I've tried asking Austin what he thinks it would take for just us to have the apartment, but Austin is facing pressure from his dad to find a third roommate so that his dad can continue to make money off of the apartment. Additionally, Austin may have found a replacement roommate and I'm supposed to meet her this Sunday.

What should I do? Should I try and force the idea of sharing the apartment with just Austin, even at a much higher rent? Or should I move to a studio/one bedroom on my own, but leave Austin scrambling to find another replacement roommate?

I really like Austin as a friend, but I can't deal with another year of sharing a room with somebody. I have a boyfriend who lives in another city and I don't want to have to sexile anybody anymore. I don't have a space that is truly private that I can retreat to or do homework in. I have a desk in my room that I share with Liz that I rarely use, because she is always in the room or trying to hang out with me when I try and get my work done at the kitchen table. I have to be extra careful whenever Liz is sleeping, which she usually does at odd hours. I am sick and tired of having to tiptoe in a space that should be half mine.",08Feb2018,3

128,"So, off the bat I want to give you some background on me to help you understand. I'm a 22-year-old guy with a pretty happy life, I've just graduated college and things are looking good for me. I'm rational and can always see things clearly and I've never been depressed or anything like that. This is also the first time I have ever told this to anyone but I need help because its eating away at me. I know this is long but please read this I really do need help.

When I was in middle school I dated a girl, let’s call her Ashley, and she meant the world to me and still does. She turned me into the guy I am today. Before I met her, I was kind of a douche and kind of narcissistic, she was the first to make me care about someone else.  We dated up until high school despite her mom not wanting us to be together for no reason. We dated in secret for the longest time but one day her mom gave up and just let it be. We were each other’s first for a lot of things. 
Don’t get me wrong our relationship had its flaws. She was diagnosed to be bi-polar, she tried being bulimic. But it only made me care more. Her mom didn’t understand her and I never really had any real problems of my own so I wanted to take hers away. Sounds cheesy I know and even looking back on it now I don’t think I was being just a dumb teenager in love I wanted to be there for her. Somewhere close to our graduation from middle school she got this idea from a book she read to write notes to each other in the future so we did. We agreed to open them when we were 20.
While we were dating I always remembered that her mom would talk to this patient of hers (she was some sort of doctor but I don’t remember what exactly) he always needed help and he was in a wheel chair but he only talked to her through skype because he lived in Australia. One-night Ashley invited me to some fancy dinner with her mom and this patient of hers. He was visiting the states just to meet her mom I thought it was odd but I went with it because free food. It was super fancy and her whole family was there. Later that night we found out why and her mom announced she was getting married to him and they were moving to Australia. She cried a lot that night
Skip ahead a couple of months and she was a week away from leaving and I invited her to my families big 4th of July party and we used that day to say our goodbyes. That day was the only time in my life I ever felt true sadness. We gave each other rings as a promise that no matter where we were that we would always remember each other and I also told her to never give up on life and I promised I would see her again to make sure she is happy. And I still wear that ring as a necklace every day. 
Fast forward to current times and I’m a mess some nights because even though we kept talking a bit when she moved, we weren’t dating so we were just friends but even that faded away. I can’t stop thinking about her. I have had other wonderful relationships but she is the one I always think about. I see her in my dreams. I just can’t let her go no matter how hard I try. And it doesn’t help that last year I remembered the letter we wrote to each other and I opened it and it was written as if we are still together. She always thought we were going to get married. I know we were dumb kids in love but it hurts to think about that we were torn away from each other and I always think about what could have been. I still check up on her Facebook to make sure she’s okay its creepy I know but I need to be sure she’s fine. I tried to talk to her again just asking how she’s been but no response and I didn’t keep trying because I didn’t want to be some weird ex-boyfriend that can’t let go but I think that’s exactly what I am. I don’t want to rekindle a relationship or anything I just want to talk to her and remember. I feel happy with my life but when I think about her I always think that I was happiest then. I don’t know what to do anymore and this has been eating away at me slowly for years now. I don’t know how to let this go because I’ve tried to let time heal this but it won’t work. And other relationships won’t work. Please help

129,"I am 21 years old, currently in my 4th semester of architecture at a school that I do not like (so far). 

First, I think I should clarify that I do like architecture. I find the relationships between buildings and the people/animals/things who habit them (psychological, sociological, etc) very interesting and fulfilling to learn about. I really like buildings and how and why the styles change through the years and context. I just don’t know if architecture, in the university I am currently in, is the right fit for me (I say I don’t know, but in reality I really don’t think it is). 

*(Where tl;dr started)*
Changed major once, and then transferred to another university. I don’t think this university is the right fit for me and have come to the conclusion that it will be better for everyone involved for me not to transfer or start a new course “from scratch” again. 
(I am faintly considering though, changing my major from architecture to industrial design, which would not affect the current classes I have taken so far that much. But I am afraid I will end up in the same, or a similar situation as the one I am in right now.)

So, I am in a very shitty situation I never even considered I would ever be in (which I recognize as only my fault). Now, what would you recommend I do to keep going, and to make it a little more bearable? Any ideas?

Thank you, I would really appreciate opinions and, if possible, your advice on the matter. Sorry if it seems like I’m blowing things way out of proportion. 

**Edit:** I feel like I should mention that I am really burnt out and stressed by the amount of work I am required to do, since it was the main reason for me to write this post. It probably seems obvious, I just realized I hadn’t mentioned it in the text above.  

**Edit 2:** Got rid of long text, since I think it came off as more whiney than I would have liked it to, and I don’t think it contained much more relevant information than the tl;dr (which isn’t much of a tl;dr now). ",08Feb2018,2

Two years ago I transferred to a university that located at a small town which 2 hours away from any big cities.The moved was a bad decision, I felt depressed mostly of the time, nothing can cheer me up or make me happy. I was unable to fit into the small town lifestyle or perspective ( all my classmates and professors can tell I am not from this region , they were curious about me , and I try very hard to become one of them . But the more I try , the more depressed I become). Now I moved to a suburban that 35 minutes away from a new city after I finished up school.

My dad recently got relocated in MS and has been pestering me to apply to all of the local community colleges for automotive technician.

132,"Or not necessarily a whole year but maybe a few months.

I am about to start my last semester. I studied computer science, but honestly not sure what I want to do for a career. There are some short courses I have been looking at to further my skills in areas I am interested in related to computer science (as my degree was rather general/broad).

Since I am graduating middle of this year, I am considering taking the rest of the year off to do other things I wanted to do first. Other than doing short courses to specialise my skills. For example, I've wanted to get a dog since I was a kid. I wanted a puppy specifically but they require a lot of time and effort, which I knew I couldn't provide while I was studying. I'd love to finally be able to raise a puppy. 

I currently work a casual retail job as well but I work night shifts anyway so I'd have the whole day for a dog.

If I stay in my current job, it is possible I will be offered a supervisor position. Because they are looking for supervisors and it's been briefly suggested but I cannot currently take the position since I study. But once I graduate I'd be able to take the position if offered. (Although I am not depending on it, but I feel there's a good chance, given the circumstances).

134,"Tuesday night I had my 6pm - 9pm psychology lecture. I have a black protein shaker bottle with a “Punisher” skull logo on it that I drink my water out of and I had out on my desk all during class. Class gets out at 9 and some other girls from class and myself head to the bathroom. When I got to the bathroom I saw there were 3 stalls, two occupied and one empty. I look around and place my shaker bottle on a ledge out of the way while I go into the last empty bathroom stall. While I’m in there the other two girls (who I assume were in my psychology class too, as we were the only class to get out at 9pm in this wing of the school) finish and go and wash their hands and leave. As I get out of my stall to wash my hands I notice my shaker bottle is gone! One of those two girls took my bottle. I checked everywhere, the floor, the garbage can, I even ran out into the hall in case I saw her walking with it but I could not find it. I thought maybe she thought I forgot it and saw it on my desk earlier and gave it to my professor but I went back and checked and she hadn’t. Wednesday night I stopped by the lost and found at the school to give her the benefit of the doubt, but they hadn’t seen it either. I have no idea who she is, but I know I’ll see her next Tuesday. What do I do if she pulls it out and is drinking from my bottle in class? How do I approach her? In the beginning of class? At the end? The desks are paired, I can’t privately ask her in class but if I try to catch her in the hall I might miss her. What’s the most non confrontational way to get my bottle back?

135,"Ugh. Trying to figure out what to do with this.

My soon to be ex husband and I are getting divorced soon, which is probably a good thing after you read this. I did not want the divorce at all. So the other day, I went to his parents house just for council and tell them what was going on, without him. My FIL (who is also a lead pastor) tells me this in depth story of his son going on a date with this girl of whom my husband had snuck around with during our marriage (doing a naked photoshoot (he’s an amateur photographer), hiding it, lying about it, etc). 

Well, when I go to try to talk about it to my husband, things go south quick. At first he ignores my requests to sit down and talk about what’s going on, then we get into a huge fight and I tell him what his dad said.

Well, then his dad and Mom deny EVERYTHING. Saying they have no idea what I am talking about. Totally gaslighted. So my husband is now calling me a liar, which is disgusting to me because of how he lied through our marriage and I have NEVER lied about anything and would have no reason to just say that.

I want to confront my FIL. Not discuss it, but rather tell him as a pastor and a human being that was a shitty thing to do.

136,"My dad had esophageal cancer. He was diagnosed a week or so after just turning 50 in September 2017. It was so hard for me to hear, I’m only 22 and the oldest child with only one younger sister who is 19. He went through the chemo and radiation process and lost so much weight because the tumor made it too painful for him to swallow solid food.

Prior to all of this happening, my family really never dealt with emotions head on, and talking about how we felt always just seemed awkward so we never did it. I never even hugged my parents until I moved out two years ago and now they give me hugs when I’m visiting before I leave to drive back to my city. 

The cancer responded well to treatment and on January 12th he had surgery to remove his tumor. My mom and I waited for a little over 8 hours for it to be complete and I wasn’t worried. The doctor seemed very confident and able to preform the esophagectomy. An esophagectomy is when they remove part or all of the esophagus, as well as a good chunk of the stomach, and create a new esophagus out of what’s left of the stomach. It’s similar to a gastric bypass surgery in the sense that that’s how small his stomach would be now for the rest of his life. The difference is he’ll no longer be able to lay down right after eating because there’s nothing to separate the “new esophagus” from the stomach anymore so the food will come right back up. I don’t know why it wasn’t clicking of how serious this surgery was. They were reconstructing most of his digestive tract. When the doctor called my mom and I into the consultation room, he said everything went well and we could visit him in the ICU because they’d be bringing him out of the anesthesia shortly. 

I can’t even think about this without sobbing. We walked in and he still had a breathing tube down his throat. They’d collapsed one of his lungs and put him on a ventilator to do the surgery with minimal incisions from his side. The machine was doing all of the breathing work for him—his chest was rising mechanically with the awful noises the machine was making. As soon as I saw him I turned to my mom and said “I’m going to cry” and she said “me too” and we started uncontrollably crying together. I walked over to his side and held his hand, which I haven’t done since I was probably 5 or 6. It was so much softer than I’d imagined it would be. He opened his eyes and was trying so hard to breathe.. but the machine was trying to do it for him. He was confused because he was still coming out of the anesthesia after a really long surgery and I could see him start to panic. The nurses were trying to calm him down and tell him the situation — he just gotten out of surgery, he’s in the ICU, he’s safe, try to relax and take slow deep breaths so they could take the breathing tube out sooner rather than later. He was trying but they say breathing with the breathing tube is like breathing through a straw. He looked right at me and mouthed “I can’t breathe” before appearing to pass out. He just kept mouthing it “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe”.  I told the nurses and they said the same things again and it was so frustrating, for my dad moreso than me, I’m sure. I can’t even begin to describe how broken my heart was. The man who has always held it together and been so strong in my life was at the mercy of this machine and the doctors and everything that’s out of our control. When they took the breathing tube out he just looked so fragile and exhausted. 

Seeing my dad like that is by far the worst sight I’ve ever seen. The worst sight. I still can’t sleep at night because I’ll close my eyes and see him looking up at me trying to tell me “I can’t breathe” while nodding his head off to the side and it breaks my heart just the same all over again. I have to open my eyes and stare at the wall for a few minutes every so often so I don’t have to think about it. This is an every night occurrence. It gives me nightmares. 

He healed well and was out of the hospital in a week with a feeding tube in his side going into his intestine, pumping in exclusively protein shakes. He hasn’t eaten a single thing since his surgery still to this date because of the healing time. Hopefully he’ll be able to eat soon. 

I’m wondering how I should deal with this? I’m still having nightmares and insomnia and I just don’t have the coping skills to convince myself that it’s over and he’s okay. I’m trying to find a counselor, but my insurance under my parents runs out next month so I’ll have to deal with it on my own soon and just would like some advice. Anything will help.

140,"For the past couple of weeks, I have noticed my mom and step dad arguing here and there. Something new, but nothing normal couples do. 
That’s what first got me into the mindset that something might be off because they haven’t argued since being together.

Flash forward to tonight, my buddies and I were playing pool at my house, smoking weed and drinking. My mom was also hanging out with us. Our relationship is a mentor/friendship bond I guess, not conventional but we function. She got a little drunk and she said “at least weed makes it so my husband doesn’t beat me.” 

After she said that, my friends and I grew quiet and looked at her. Him and her were arguing in front of my friends tonight and my mom was viability upset but kept her cool. After she said that, I immediately stopped smoking and realized this was a big deal.

I asked her about it as soon as I could, so I texted her. I had to know tonight just to make sure she was safe. She told me everything was fine.

What threw me off is that she lied about not saying that. My friend sent me a text and he said verbatim what I heard her say. I’m not sure if it’s a coincidence, but it really scared me. I don’t want to see my mom get hurt. She reassured that it was nothing but they went into their room arguing and it didn’t sound good.

I’ve been listening for sounds out of the ordinary. I’m not sure if I should ask her again tomorrow if she is really ok, or if I should wait until there are signs. What do you guys think? That would help me so much right now. Please ask questions for clarification too.",08Feb2018,2

A few minutes later he was talking to another classmate about a money making opportunity. After a bit of inquiry he told us about Amway. 

So apperantly a shady character called Kai had introduced him to Amway. I say shady because he would not tell anyone how he knew Kai, and he also mentioned that he knew Kai was using a fake identity.

I’m usually just neutral but when I think of her I’m just happy. I want her to like me I really do. I want to ask her out but I just can’t bring myself to even text her if it isn’t about the assignment. I don’t know if she has a boyfriend or even wants one and that is what probably scared me the most. 

That’s about it. Like I said nothing special, nothing amazing or juicy, just a guy who likes a girl. I just hope if and most likely when it’s a no, I’ll be able to keep it together. ",08Feb2018,5
149,"So me (M), current graduate student moved back with parents few months ago after finishing undergrad. Slightly older brother is a bum, changes jobs every month and has anger issues. My parents won't step in to fix the issue (say ""he'll grow up soon"") and he either breaks things or is very disruptive and I cannot study when at home. I use the public library until its closed and most 24/7 coffee shops near me are in non-safe areas or a 20-25 min drive and full of obnoxiously loud people (I've tried)

I do help out with some bills (although still cheaper than when I had my own apartment in undergrad) and grad school loans are already killing me so financially this is a preferred option for me.

Should I shut up and deal with this? I'm a night owl and prefer studying at night but often time's he'll come downstairs and blast the TV (next to my room) when he has a TV in his own room. Nothing seems to help ",08Feb2018,1

I living with my mother and father and since my father works most of the day, im usually alone with my mother, she is very verbally and SOMETIMES physically abusive

I have a 1 brother and a couple of sisters I'm not very social so I'm not very good at talking to them and some i even have problems with, for good reason

I have depression and some type of social anxiety and i don't have any friends

The Reason i want to move is because i kinda want a restart on life ( i have no plans or reasons to go to collage) if i save around 80 percent of my paychecks for 2 years I'll have around 10,000 if i do move there i would rent a cheap apartment get a job and work on music and try to be more social and be myself without having to worry about what my family thinks of my personality and who i am.

I'm just sick of this cycle of life with no end, i want to make music and thats what I've been trying to do (my parents don't approve of my work ethic with music) but i don't know I'm just confused and not sure of moving.

152,"I used to be a music junkie in my high school years. I was living and breathing music. I had a wide range of artists and genres that I liked, and I would never go out without my headphones on. Heck, I'd wear my headphones on even indoors. Music was my universe, and if there was something that bothered me, I knew exactly which song or artist I needed to put on repeat in order to get peace from the external world. 

A few weeks ago, I suddenly stopped enjoying music completely. Ok, maybe suddenly is exaggerated, because it happened over the course of a few weeks, but it felt very sudden. I started to connect with the music less and less, everyday. At first I thought I was getting bored of the music I liked because of constant exposure to it, so I tried to search for new artists and genres. I would usually listen to heavy stuff like rock/metal/punk but I like other genres too, even pop (it has a happy vibe attached to it). So I started to explore...I tried to listen to new genres like soul, country, rap, folk, classical, dance, house/electronic, funk, trance, and even opera. I searched for popular artists for each genre and I tried to listen to a few. After a few weeks of constant searching, it was clear: it wasn't the music that wasn't good, the problem was with me.

I suddenly stopped connecting with the music. And no, it's not like my ears stopped functioning. My ears are still perfectly functional, and I can clearly recognize which music is good and which music isn't. I can separate what I consider to be quality music from crap. I can even listen to music and really enjoy the tune or the sound, but I get no vibe from it. It doesn't resonate with me anymore. I can consciously like the song and even get chills from it, but emotionally, it doesn't make me feel anything. There's no emotion or feeling attached to it. I don't even know how to describe it...it's like being in love in a commited relationship vs having a one night stand: a one night stand might feel good physically, and you can get enjoyment and pleasure from it, but there isn't any feeling of emotional connection with the person you're having sex with, you're just doing it for the physical benefits, without having any bond or feeling emotionally fulfilled. In a commited relationship, you don't only get the physical enjoyment from having sex, it also fulfills you emotionally because sex isn't just physical, it requires an emotional connection in order to feel complete. Otherwise, it's no better than masturbating, is it?

I am sorry for all the details, I really feel like literally no one gets me. Everyone around me seems to be so thrilled about music and it makes me really jealous and depressed because music used to make me feel SO much. Now, even though I can recognize what sounds good to my ears and what doesn't, it doesn't make me feel anything anymore. It's just sounds, without any feelings. I tried to go back to the stuff that I liked a few months/years ago, and while still appreciating the music, it was devoid of any emotion. I just couldn't connect with the music anymore, like I was removed from it.

Has anyone been through this? Is there a solution or am I going to feel stuck like this forever?",08Feb2018,2

My friend who I've known for nearly 3 years and am close to has recently been ignoring me.

I thought about either confronting or messaging him about it but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

161,"School’s recently started back up (me and my girlfriend are both in our final year). Anyway, last week I asked if she wanted to do something Friday night and she wanted too so I went to hers and we just cuddled/laid on top of each other for a couple hours and made dinner. I went in for a kiss after she was looking me in the eyes, smiling and licking her lips and she dodged that (her eyes closed after she licked her lips) and said “Sorry I was surprised” or something along those lines. We’ve known each other for a year and started dating Jan 1st but still haven’t had our first kiss, despite being very affectionate and open with each other so I’m kind of conflicted. Fast forward three days later (Monday afternoon) and she asks if I want to come over to her friends house (I’m in a group she’s in and we often hang out) on Saturday and I accepted. However, today I asked if she wanted to do something before 5:00 which is when we'd be going (as I’d like to spend time with just her and not a bunch of other people) but she said “I can’t I’m cramming all my study until five”. Just want people’s opinions on this, I don’t know if I should be mad she couldn’t set aside at least an hour for just us before we go to her friends house or suggest another day.

166,"To start off, I am in a very loving and happy relationship with my boyfriend. He treats me with a lot of respect and we make an amazing team, we have a lot of love and trust towards each other. The problem is that we are not intimate as often as I would like it to be (maybe once a week). On one hand I love the fact that my boyfriend loves me for me, my personality and doesn't treat me like a sex object, but on the other, I feel like he isn't really attracted to me physically. I want to feel wanted, but I don't want it to be forced. We have been together for almost 4 years and he is living with me this past year and a half (I'm 32, he's 27). I have mentioned this to him before, he claims that he would like to be intimate, but when we are settled after work/studies in the evenings he is too tired. 

I tried dressing up for him in lingerie, but he just thought I looked cute, no sign of lust in his eyes. I don't want to be asking for sex, because it will feel like an obligation and that will put me off. 

This has really effected my self esteem, I gym hard (6 times a week) and I am on a keto diet to keep my body looking good and trying to feel confident. I find myself fantasizing about being taken advantage of on a daily basis, I love being submissive. I crave that feeling of being wanted and it's really hurting me. I have been so distant lately because this is really consuming me. I also feel like I'm punishing him as he loves being cuddled and held, which I'm not giving him. The only time he seems interested is when he is bored and there is nothing else entertaining him, we had an electricity outage last night because of the storm and he was keen to get down to business, but I brushed him off as I don't want intimacy with me to be some kind of last resort.

When we do have sex, it's truly amazing and beautiful. He has been playing games every chance he gets lately, especially when I come home from work/gym. We do spend some time together in the evenings, but the time we spend needs to be entertaining on some level (like watching series). Don't get me wrong, I play games as well, but I just feel more and more ignored lately. I don't know how to approach him about this AGAIN. I feel invisible to the only person that matters.

167,"I had an interview in the beginning of the week, it was set up by a recruiter they had hired. I had a phone interview w the companies HR and we set up a face-to-face interview a few days later with the hiring manager.

My recruiter told me he would most likely hear from them the day after the interview, he said the HR lady had always been super quick with getting back to him.

The evening of my interview they re-posted the job online, next day I called my recruiter who said he had not heard about it, he thought maybe it was an automatic update (it wasn’t due to the content being changed)

‘No worries’ he told me, he had called the company earlier that morning to follow up and was expecting a phone call back by the end of the day.

I still haven’t heard from him which I assume means they haven’t called him back either.

Now I am just wondering, is this good or bad news? Surely, if they did not think I was a good fit, they would have let him know immediately?

Any advice?

168,"Long story short, I’m terrible when it comes to girls. There is this one girl that I’ve been crushing on, who happens to be a mutual friend, let’s call her R. R is a cute girl who I’ve hung out with twice, her, my best friend, (let’s call him H), and his girlfriend, she doesn’t need a name. So I actually had a class with her just a couple days ago and I was going to approach her and talk to her, only to find myself rather nervous, scared, something holding me back, and while I tried to muster up the courage to talk to her, she had gone somewhere else and I never got to talk to her about it. I texted her the next day, yesterday, asking if she wanted to get lunch and she happened to have a class, told her no worries, and left it at that. She did indeed have a class as she told me what class it was, and I went through the trouble of finding out if that class was happening yesterday afternoon and sure enough it was. Just to make sure she wasn’t bailing on me. Now I have another class with her today, and I really want to talk to her and maybe ask her out to lunch or dinner, preferably before Valentine’s Day because I have something planned for her that I’m almost 100% that she’ll like, since H is close friends with one of her best friends, let’s call her B. So H told B about my potential plan, nothing special, just a surprise to her dorm with some flowers and chocolates, asking her out, provided I would get to know her over lunch or something first. The plan is I’d tell her that I’m in the lobby, and I need to get into the dorm area for some reason, so when she opens her door, I’ll be right outside her door, not a crazy surprise, but I don’t want it to be completely unexpected either. Anyways the questions I wanted advice on are: How do I talk to her when I start to freeze up? Is it too early to ask her out again today at our class together ? I know about the whole three strike rule, but if she had a legit excuse, do I count it? And is my idea for the 14th even worth it or is it too forward?

yesterday, i guess i said something weird (i mean it was weird but it was a legitimate question) about the twins in my class. i was just curious as to if their puberty started at completely different times or around the same time (they were born in the same day, have the same genes, so how wouldn’t that be a good question. i was just curious). so the girl that was sitting next to me (let’s call her maria) says “wow alex. stop.” and when i’d try to say something else she’d be like “really stop”. maybe i’m crazy but i feel like that’s not the way you treat someone... i was acting weirdish yesterday because we were playing a game with the other kids that i didn’t talk to, and i felt like i had to make them like me (i guess it didn’t work because i’m a freaking weirdo). 

idk maria treats me like that pretty often and it makes me really sad and feel like i’m the biggest weirdo in the world (it actually ruined my day yesterday. it made me realize that if i didn’t speak, no one really noticed me). maria also sits at my lunch table and always tries to tag along with me everywhere i go, so i don’t know why she treats me this way. maybe it’s her way of being funny or whatever, but i don’t really think it’s funny. it makes me feel like crap.

173,"After leaving high school, I didn't think my study options through thoroughly, which ended up in a few bad decisions. Long story short, since I left high school, I've picked up studying a bachelors/masters degree at home combined with working online. Working online is doing pretty well for me financially, as I have a couple of freelance clients and can easily bring in between $3 - $6K a month depending on how much I feel like working.

Even though my studies were supposed to be priority, this whole studying at home thing is just too damn slow and allows me to have too much freedom, leading to procrastination issues. The courses are okay, but I'm not entirely interested in half of the courses. It is a good degree though, with decent work opportunities.

With the second semester coming up, I'm thinking about making the switch to regular college. I'll get out more often, meet new people and have notable study progress every week by going to the lessons. All this stuff at home - it's great financially, but my social life has taken a hit. I'm not an extremely sociable person, but I'm not socially awkward either - it just struck me that I probably won't connect with new people or even have opportunities to have a girlfriend if I do everything at home for the years to come. I'd make a switch to a completely different degree, one that interests me greatly and has the potential to land me a dream job, but realistically, provides less (job)security than the degree I'm doing right now. The college degree is considered to be fairly light - which means I could combine both this degree and my current degree and keep doing my freelance work in the commute.

What do you guys think of a 21-year-old who will start with his first year in college? I could potentially catch up with the first semester in the summer, or possibly do the second and third year at the same time to save some time - depending on how well my freelance stuff goes. I'm also involved in a couple of start-ups, but that can really go either way. The new courses aren't difficult and studying for exams has never been an issue. It would take me four years and most of my friends will have graduated from college then, but I feel like I should do something now before it's totally too late. I'm sure it's a bit of ""the grass is greener on the other side"" situation, but I genuinely miss studying, real studying and interacting with other people on a daily basis besides my family.",08Feb2018,2
174,"I have not spoken to this girl in almost a year, although we were together for 3. The breakup was pretty horrific, I told her not to contact me again. I later learned from a mutual friend that in the 6 months following the breakup she had confessed her love to at least 3 different guys. 

On occasion I'll still look her up on facebook... And I did yesterday - there was a long post clearly but not explicitly directed at me. ""It's so hard to admit I was being abused"" ect. Just for clarification, this was an unhealthy relationship no doubt - name calling from both sides, I would threaten to leave, she would threaten to kill herself, and after we both became so tired of each other and barely spoke for 3 weeks, she ultimately ended it. I'm in a much better place now, but after seeing this post come out of the blue after a whole year, I feel sick thinking about one particular line - ""I'm still so afraid to tell my story of abuse"". The problem is, she is extremely popular online, a very likeable personality, she posts vlogs and slam poetry and tries to turn every event into an opportunity to write the most pretentious poetry, and people just eat it up. She's not ""afraid"" of anything. I suspect she's angry about the fact I actually moved on and am seeing someone else now. And surprised that I actually never contacted her for a year. 

Not that it matters, but she also recently shaved her head, got a septum piercing and wore a #metoo shirt... Nothing like the girl I used to know. She suffers from severe bipolar disorder but I'm not sure I can chalk it up to that. 

Essentially, I don't know what she is capable of, and I'm scared she has become vindictive and is about to tell complete lies about me . She still has some of my friends and family on Facebook, and I don't want them to see any of it. But I haven't talked about her for such a long time. I'm a very private person, I never post on social media, and going up against her is not an option because her charisma and likeableness convinces even me sometimes. I'm literally sat here questioning my own sanity... are my memories of that relationship corrupted? Because I swear I wasn't abusive. Or at least if I was, then you certainly were too.

179,So I was with this girl for a year well twelve days before our one year anniversary... and let me back track on our relationship it’self so I don’t leave any confusion with this we argued about petty stuff because she’s a argumentative person like everyday she’d be upset when I came home from work and didn’t just pay attention to her the whole night... her living situation was awful got kicked of her dads house and started living with her moms which didn’t feed her didn’t drive her anywhere and lived in the middle of nowhere... so I took her under my wing when we were together after a couple of months and let her pretty much live at my house for free and bought food for her all the time and made sure her life was way more positive than it was. My family was like her second family too my dad even payed for her to go to Disney world with us all expenses payed... which may I add that’s more than her family has ever done for her lately because they’re terrible with her... anyways back to my point there was one night before Halloween when I went to a party with her and this random guy starts being really friendly with her and hugged her. and me and her both thought nothing of it (well I thought so at least) because we honestly thought he was gay.... so he gets brought up from time to time me not thinking anything of it because this girl never broke my heart never did anything to hurt me... would even post about me pretty much every hour of the day as if she was obsessed with me... anyways she goes off to college for two weeks... (she was in my room everyday so this is like the only freedom she ever had because she always wanted to be with me).. and the one kid from the party lives there and one night when i was asleep she told me he kissed her twice and then they fucked... she tried to say he consentually forced her into it so I said “what did he fucking rape you” and she said no please he didn’t do that so we come to conclusion that she cheated because she cheated and her reason was idek... o let me just add too she had unprotected sex with this guy and then a day later she had unprotected sex with me and then told me she cheated on me... so for the past couple of days afterwords I really tried to get a understanding of all this because all she would ever say was idek but I knew that was bullshit. but thankfully someone close to me that goes to the same college told me she’s still going over to this kids room... so now the impression I’m getting is that she was diggin this guy from the start and wAs using me the whole time... and literally ever since I broke up with her she literally will just point her finger saying how she’s toxic how we argued and how I could do better but like honestly she makes me feel like she doesn’t care at all and it’s hurting more and more everyday and I can’t stop thinking about it... because I know things could’ve been worked on if she didn’t try to complain about little things all the time but she wants to give me every excuse in the bag and like she didn’t understand that if you actually love someone you don’t hurt them the way she does and to still keep fucjing with the guy she cheated on me right after all of that it shows her true coolers and just gives me the feeling this whole relationship wasn’t about love it was about how she could live a better life and not need to deal with her shitty family... I don’t want to think it that way but all this just isn’t right and I wouldn’t ever do any of this because I’m head over heels for her... idk I’m just looking for some advice on this because I feel like I’m in a maze and people just don’t seem to understand how to help me out with this. ,08Feb2018,1
180,"Today a couple of friends (not seen them in over a year) posted stuff on Facebook about feeling they'd be better off dead. I went to Messenger to try reassure them, or at least give then some speck of positivity for the day.

One of them is in a different city. Works all the time to keep herself occupied and doesn't have any friends. Every response I get is just negative and sad. I often don't know what to say next because I want to help, but I think trying to make suggestions to people with depression isn't helpful.

I've told her that I can visit her whenever she wants, but I don't know what else to do. I'm worried about asking her too much or trying too hard to be helpful and insulting her instead or making her mindset worse.

 I keep wanting to ask her how 'things are' but I know the response won't be good, so I am stuck.

181,"I've always felt a bit like an outcast, until last year when I was able to friend one of the ""popular kids"". This completely transformed my life, as I felt like I could talk to people. I felt at home. I made good friends and I was really happy. 

I made lots of good friends, but recently something changed. The people who I used to know stopped talking to me and after a while it felt like were strangers. This is happening with everyone, and I feel more lonely than ever. I feel like I still get scared and I'm still extremely shy. I had a friend who I was always helping out, but then a few weeks ago when I needed someone to talk to and messaged her, she just left me on read (after specifically telling me that she would be here if I needed someone.)

185,"I’ve had a recent trip to the mental hospital on an M-1 hold (72 hours). I was there so they could monitor my big change in meds. 

So I get home and see my friends again. I’m talking to my one friend and they want to know my diagnosis. (You get a diagnosis sheet when you leave the hospital)

So I told them. For every one they said “oh, I think I have that.” Even though they have never (visibly) shown a single symptom. A lot of these things would have visible symptoms that they would have to show doing almost daily. But I don’t. 

Should I say something? It’s kinda clear they do not have the things they say.

That was the main question but I’ll give you more suspicious behavior too that goes with it that convinced me they don’t have any of those things. 

Once they said they had it, for the next week or so they would show the visual symptoms. But these visible things look forced and scripted (like they thought about doing it before). After that week or so, I think they would forget about it and stop. 

This one is kinda specific to a certain illness (schizophrenia). They tried acting out this one but I don’t think they really knew what it was. A lot of people think that schizophrenia means multiple personalities(it doesn’t.) people confuse it with MPD (multiple personality disorder). My friend said they had schizophrenia while acting out symptoms of MPD. When I called them out on it they said: (I quote) “you wouldn’t know what it’s like.” Even though I’m the one with a PROFESSIONAL diagnosis and they are not.

They also refuse to talk about this with their therapist.

They told me a voice that they heard. The told me a name. Jerry. And how he is really loud. So I try an experiment. I wait two weeks. Then I ask them about Jerry. If the schizophrenia they “have” is as severe as they say it is, they will still know who Jerry is because he’s a voice. I ask. And they don’t know who Jerry is. Best proof yet: they said they have never known a Jerry except for that mouse on the kids show.  And if they can remember a mouse from a TV show they watched 10 years ago, they could probably remember a voice that was talking to them two weeks ago.

186,"My coworker has been struggling a lot after her divorce and we know she has been drinking a lot. This morning she came to work clearly drunk, but our manager is off today. She was openly telling everyone that she was ‘over the limit’ when she drove in today, so it’s the talk of the office. 

The issue is, no one has got the courage to snitch on her. Something needs to be done because she could drink-drive again and kill someone, but no one wants to be the office snitch. 

It’s worth mentioning that she’s very close to the manager. They have known each other for a really long time and she hasn’t ever got in trouble for making some serious mistakes. Also, it’s very likely that confidentiality will not be adhered to as our manager will probably tell her who snitched.

191,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year. About four months into our relationship, I went on a trip to another country to visit an old friend with whom I'd previously been intimate. In hindsight my biggest mistake was even going on the trip, but it had already been planned, and I naively thought it could be a purely friendly visit.

There was sexual tension the whole trip, and the worst thing that happened is one night after some drinking, my friend got in the shower with me. I won't lie and say that no part of me wasn't excited/aroused to have a naked woman in the shower with me, but in general I was uncomfortable and rinsed off and got out, but my friend gave me a hug before I got out. After we were both out, she asked me to kiss her, but I said no.

The whole week was really quite terrible for me and I felt uncomfortable and pressured the whole time, on top of the confusion between the immediate sexual attraction but also really wanting to be faithful to my girlfriend and have a platonic week. On top of asking me to kiss her, my friend asked me to sleep in her bed every night, which I also declined.

Anyway, after the trip I felt guilty and that I needed to be honest with my girlfriend. What I told her was that it was not a completely innocent trip, but that we didn't sleep together, nor even kiss or touch each other sexually. I told her I would tell her details if she wanted, but she hasn't ever asked.

Now six months later I still feel guilt about it as if I'm hiding something from my girlfriend. Am I? Do I owe her a more detailed confession? I can provide any further details if needed.",08Feb2018,2

193,"Hey everyone, 
I will be graduating HS soon and I have to start sending out applications. I already know that I want to study accounting. There are only two schools in my country that teach accounting. 

1st is university in capital city. Its pretty much the best university in the country. The entry exam are hard as hell, math there is extremely difficult and there is also an issue of actually getting there. Im from a smaller town (70 000 people) which is 70km away. And Im living on the outskirts. If I want to get there I would have to travel to train station, travel to the capital, then walk to bus stop, get on bus, get out and wait for another bus and then I would finally get there. Which is quite lenghty and pricey matter when you think about it. Doing this every single morning (and afternoon). Of course if I actually managed to finish it I would be probably set for life, I would be able to apply anywhere I want in terms of economy and get the job. The question is if its worth to live stressfully for 5 years. Also I would probably have to get math tutoring, not that my math is bad but its not good enough to pass there. 

2nd Option is to go another town very similiar to mine (around 60 000 people). This university is not bad by any means, but its definetely not as good as the first one. Travelling is much easier as the university is close to the train station. And it the atmosphere there feels much better. As I said its similiar to my hometown and definetely not as hectic and overpopulated as the capital. I dont know what I could expect if I graduate this one but I know for sure that these 3-5 years would be alright and I could handle it. 

But then again first one is THE best, and assures your future if you can make it. They even teach stuff like SAP which is pretty essential for accounting (only university doing it here). But I know I would hate everything about the university and especially the town while studying there (I hate big cities)

Problem is that I really don't want to go into the work force, have a job, whatever. I really desire to be a NEET, but I know I need to sustain myself.

I work as a barista at a place she likes to study and it could be that she’s just thirsty but the last three times she’s been there when I’ve worked she’s either bought a tea or asked for a water, which is what makes me think she’s just trying to get an excuse to talk to me...not many people ask for us to pour them tap water. All the conversations we’ve had this past month have gone over very well and she seems nice and funny.

My problem is I’m unsure as to whether she’s dating someone or even interested in me. I feel a chemistry that I’m hoping she does too and was thinking about asking the mutual friend about her relationship status to see if that’d get the ball rolling.

I feel like I have been hyper-focused on doing well/working hard and it's kind of draining.                        

***The backstory:***                    

My parents both came from abusive parents and were in term, abusive towards me (cue the Larkin poem).  It was mainly emotional/psychological abuse with some semi-accidental neglect thrown in when they didn't realise how much a growing teenage eats. Things started really coming to a head in my teenage years, leading to CAMHS (Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services) being involved, which resulted in me getting a mild ASD diagnosis, but nothing else. They threw me out of the house at one point.                            

They always made a big deal about education - doing Well In Exams - and getting a Good Job (middle class, go figure) and I have internalised part of it. Especially Earning Money in a Good Job. That was part of the abuse, was when I did not perform to their exacting standards.                          
             
I have a sibling who is five years younger than me and also suffering under my parents.                   

At age 18, I got a place doing a degree I wanted to do in a middle of the road Russell Group university and left, to go to it.              

***My university life:***                  

For three years I have been studying an undergraduate degree in archaeology.                 
                 
*My university first year:*               
                   
My relationship with my parents drastically improved now that I was away from the house. I got involved with university societies A and B. I also started volunteering for a food charity (not a food bank, but like it) for one afternoon a week. I got a minor role on a committee in society A and had a good year academically.                    
                    
After a rather awful winter holidays, I made it a personal rule not to spend more than two weeks around my parents and have stuck to it thus far.                     
                        
I got a permanent part-time job (about 16 to 17 hours a week) towards the end of the year and spent my summer working and milling about in my university town.                 
                        
*My university second year:*                    
           
I picked up a major committee role in society A and a major committee role in society B. I put a lot of work into both of them, especially society A, where we had a lot of drama with a member who was abusive towards others and we had to throw said member out. I also started to tagging along to meetings in a society, C.            

I spent my summer working on that part-time job and milling about my university town. I also volunteered at a local museum to boost my CV and went back and volunteered for the food charity.          
             
*My university third year:*            
           
I now have a different major committee role in society B and have a minor committee role in society C. I have continued working my part-time job. I am currently trying to get back into volunteering at the local museum.                   
                       
I interviewed for and got offered a job working in commercial field archaeology (about £16k per annum) after I graduate. I know I can shop around and find other jobs in the same area (all paying about the same) because the job market in commercial archaeology is currently very good. I tell people that my working plan is to work for a year or two as a commercial archaeology and then go back to university and do my master's in archaeology (my university for undergraduate does not offer a masters) and then make up my mind. But that is not the whole truth.                  
                           
***The dilemma:***                
                     
Overall, I look like a very good applicant on paper. I have spent most of my university life involved with at least one university society, have done real tangible work for said societies, had a part-time job and maintained average to very good marks. But the issue is that part of this is all was undercut by a kind of franticness. I wanted to do well in university and make myself appealing to employers because I did not want to end up back and living with my parents. As much as I love the societies that I am part of, I also understood them as a way to make myself look good (but only a little bit - I love(d) them all).         
                 
I scared myself by reading articles about graduates going back to live with parents. I didn't want to, no matter how much my parents offer (they think they were abusive, but that's whole nother animal).                                               
                            
But I'm sick of pushing myself hard. Part of me understands for sure that this is the real world and so on, but I want more. I wanted to do something that was not a nine until five. Off and on I wanted to join the military but that is not really an option (mild ASD diagnosis). I want to see more of the world. And do something different.                       
                           
What I haven't told anyone is that I applied for a masters relating to development and charity within my university and got offered the place! I kind of want to take it and do a masters in archaeology and go out and help people and do some more voluntary work. But you only get one master's loan which means I would have to pay the other one off my own back. Also, I feel like where-ever I would apply for my master's in archaeology would look at me funny because I'd come in just having done a master's in something completely unrelated.                        
                                
I love archaeology, but I also really want to help people/make a difference/do something different. I feel as though I am at a cross-roads in regards to choice.                      
                          
My goals: get a job that pays me, help people and see more of the world.                   
                       
My options (as far as I see):                        
a) do what I said I would do. Take a job in field archaeology, work for a few years and then go do my master's in archaeology. This feels like the safe/boring option. I could try and see more of the world in my holidays, but I feel like that is not going to happen. My parents will be demanding and I will have friends I want to see.                       
b) do the master's in development/charity stuff next year. This would require me taking out a master's loan for sure and I do not know what I would do after that. I could do it part-time and carry on my part-time job, but I would not be able to increase my hours in that job and would have to find another job, most likely.        
c) something else. Part of me wants to try to join the merchant navy, but I worry that my autism diagnosis would get in the way.

213,"Greetings Reddit!

Soooo I have recently decided that I've been living a bit of a lie....at least when it comes to my employment. You could say I have reached a sort of Eureka moment and want to do everything I possibly can to change my life, for the better...but I need help/advice where I can go from here as I'm a bit stuck. I think I'm on track with my personal life/ fitness but employment is the tricky one and I believe a lot of my lack of self worth/negativity stems from here. 

Apologies for the essay of a post - I thought I'd type out my entire story in case anyone else is in the same position -&gt; can relate -&gt; more people can benefit -&gt; mega yay! But there is a TLDR version below should you prefer.

*TLDR: are there any websites for industry specific volunteering searching or suggestions on how I can start doing something I enjoy (job wise) even if it is unpaid for a while - ideally resulting in me getting experience in this field and ending up working in it. Sadly, I cannot quit my job while doing this or I will be homeless but I would consider a slight salary decrease*

**My story**

I work in an office doing entry level Finance/Admin and my company is paying for me to start CIMA to become an Accountant in the long run. It isn’t a company I particularly like or admire but it is a decent job. I’m also now in my late-ish 20s so I feel like my time is somewhat “running out”. For a few years I have pursued this path and I keep telling myself that this is the right choice for me because it is a solid career path, it guarantees me a good income in the end and I may even end up enjoying it. But in reality I hate it and everything about it/ office work for big companies I couldn't care less about. The only thing I’m hanging onto is the possibility of qualifying and then going to any of the above fields with this skillset, a company that does something I love…. But it seems like I’m banking a whole lot on something that will be hard to achieve and something that I still may not end up enjoying. 

Unfortunately I made some bad decisions in my past, got a degree in Film/Media I don't think I really wanted (or knew how non-competitive it was may be more accurate) at a mediocre University and was often too unsure what I wanted to do with my life. As a result, I approached everything with the mentality that:

1) Any job with future prospects is a good opportunity to succeed 
2) If I succeed, I will end up loving it for this reason 
3) Due to my past choices, I can't exactly be fussy where I end up so should just take any opportunity I can get.

But for a good few years I have bouncing from one mundane corporate job to another trying to succeed and despite every job getting better and having increased pay, after I learn everything there is to learn and haven't felt much progress, the job fills me with dread and as a result it is more difficult to get the motivation I need to Excel in it. (Ewe... even that non-intentional spreadsheet pun made me shiver).

For years I thought maybe I was just not good enough or maybe it is the company but recently I think it is because I keep expecting to progress in a job I genuinely have no interest in and rely solely on exceeding expectations (or trying to), learning new things and having great interactions with people, something I'm now starting to realise isn't enough in terms of fulfilment/job satisfaction – at least not in the long run. Do I really want to pursue this future I will probably loathe but will potentially have a good salary? Or do I do something about it now before I become anyone of real ""importance"" in this field? 

So here I am, someone who grew from a very naïve, unsure and anxious individual with some mental health issues along the way, to someone who has fully overcome those issues and recently grew to learn to love themselves. I have a long way to go but I’m confident that I'm on the right track but how I feel in this industry is not doing me any favours. I just don’t recognise myself working in this environment its like I become someone I hate at work and I'm just lying to myself and everyone around me all the time. It's exhausting keeping this facade up. I like my life and have met some incredible people on the way…….but I feel like my job, which takes up most of my life, is definitely holding me back from reaching my full potential. 

Any help at all would be appreciated and if anyone would also like to share, I’m very keen to hear your stories. If you’re in a similar position I encourage you to write about it. Just accepting my feelings and thoughts and writing this post, despite being a bit rushed and all over the place, was wonderful feeling.

215,"I am almost 21 and i am in my third year at Framingham State University.  Its really easy and i want a greater challenge and i also dont like living at home so my parents suggested Mass maritime (and also i thought of it) because i had toured there a while back and because it almost guarantees and excellent job after graduation.  I wouldnt mind going there but it would add at least two extra years of college, which im not about.  Im sick of going to school and just want to work. I honestly love working hard and would be happy with a job as opposed to school.  If i stayed i Framingham State i would join the National Guard.  I probably would do the same even i went to Mass Maritime.  To go to mass maritime you need to know what you want to do and love it.  I dont know what i want to do, i just know i want to work.  Should i stay at Framigham State and join the national guard or should i go to mass maritime and join the national guard and do probably three more years of schooling?

216,"This might be long, please bear with me.

A little bit of my background: My parents are deaf and my dad lost his job and we had to move and adjust everything, etc. While my dad was looking for a job we went to a Social Security office and he got what i think its SSDI (social security disability something). 

So i have almost no knowledge of how this work (im 19 years old, lives with my parents), and I remembered while we were at SSA, they asked information about me because i am 18+, i dont remember specifics what they asked me but the only thing I remembered was they asking for my account and routing number. Im assuming they will send me money or something like that. I never gave them the info, i forgot why. And they’ve been trying to send money but was “bounced back” to them.

So that was almost 2 years ago.

Now, my dad found a job in another state and he moved there about 5 months ago. The rest of my family is still here for a few more month and this is the issue im facing now.

I about to head to college this year in August in another state and i am in need of serious transportation of my own. I am currently working at a job making 10.50 an hour full time and ive been spending all of it. Never been saving up. My parents is not going to give me any support and told me i have until June to save up or talk to the Social Security Administration. I received a letter from SSA a few months ago and they said i have a total about $4,500 ready to send to me. 

So in addition my dad came to visit us a fee months ago during Christmas and “pushed” me into going to SSA with him and we talked with them and i gave them my bank info so theyll send me the money within 10 days. My dad helped me through the process and i was trying to understand how this work but i dont at all.

So my dad left to his state and they never sent the money at all and its been almost 1 month and a half. I dont know what to do now. There is high chance that i am not going to save up 10.50 an hour until june for a used car. 

If i have to go to SSA, what do i need to tell them? 

Edit1: i called them before many times and they had no idea what i was trying to explain when i told them about the backpay.",08Feb2018,2

220,"I'm 23M. I grew up in eastern Canada, and dropped out of school to care for my dad, who passed away. My mom is American, and she is still pissed off with me for choosing to live with my dad when I was 13. She thinks I don't care about her and I'm just here to try to get my grandparents' money. They seem kind of rich, but no, I barely know them and don't anything from them. I really want to repair things with my mom and be in my half siblings' lives more, but she has major anger issues and kicks me out over something minor after I go visit her for any reason.

I dropped out of university. I was majoring in philosophy and Spanish, so maybe that's a good thing to avoid more pointless debt. I don't have any idea what to do for a career and I'm just lost. 

I have one friend in the US where I am now, a coworker at a gas station who is 16 and homeless, and I think the only thing keeping me sane is making sure he's okay.

What I should do and what I want to do never align. If it were up to me, I'd just hitchhike around until my money runs out and then kill myself.

I can't join the military due to severe intestinal damage. I think I can't become a trucker for the same reason. Anything that requires a physical will probably disqualify me because it's dangerous for me to eat certain foods or lift heavy objects

I receive invoice for $85 for service call. I made no assumption if I would be billed or not when he was only there for short time, but when he specifically said no charge, why the bill?

I call company, they said plumber told them he would hold the invoice for a couple days(makes 0 sense since the issue turned not to be plumbing, but sewer like smell from the washer). Owner said his guys never say that and I must have misunderstood him. My wife was also there and there is 0 chance he didn’t say that specifically.

235,"So my little sister, who is 20, for lack of a better way of saying it, has always had really horrible taste in guys, but it’s never been as bad as this. 

My sister “Sam” and her boyfriend “Joel” have been together for a little over a year. 

From the first time I met Joel, I instantly disliked him, but at first I didn’t know why. I just always thought he talked over her, shushed her and always dictated when and where they went to things while my sister ran around essentially like a house slave for him. 

Flash forward to this past Sunday during the Super Bowl, I invited my sister (who actually likes football more than me) but who unfortunately but expectedly brought Joel. 

Joel was being his usual possessive weird self but Sunday was different. He seemed more physical with her, but only in a way you would notice if you were really paying attention, which I always do when he’s around her. Sam was more quiet than usual and honestly just seemed really sad. 

At the end of the game when everyone was leaving, Joel went out to start the car and warm it up (its cold here) and I pulled Sam aside when Joel wasn’t there and asked her if everything was alright. She told me that the night before he came home drunk and hit her. 

I was furious. As soon as she told me I was about to run outside and beat the shit out of Joel but she stopped me and told me that I would just make everything worse and that she would “handle it” and it’s not a big deal because he was drunk. 

So I backed off and watched as she got in the car with that pos and drove away. 

I know she told me not to do anything but honestly I think she can’t clearly see what’s happening to her and I’m really tempted to just grab a bunch of my friends and go beat some sense into that asshole and tell him to stay away from her before he kills her. 

If I don’t do that I honestly don’t know what to do because I don’t know if I call the cops they will do anything and Sam is so unwilling to leave him even though I would be more than willing to have her come live with me for a while. 

What do I do? How can I help my sister before he hurts her again?

259,"Hi Reddit,

I'm 25yrs old, living at home, and looking for more out of my life. I want to someday live in a city. A big city. There's just something about a big city that really invogorates me.

The issue here is that I feel like I might be in a job that won't give me what I want out of life. I work with supporting a proprietary software for data centers and I'm worried it won't carry into the future. I'm paid about $45k/yr and with my school loans, it's not even enough to move out of my parents home. This is why I'm considering a change. 

I originally went to school for game development and while it would be ideal to make games for a living, I think what I want to do is some type of programming centered in some city on the east/west coast. Should I go back to school for additional training? Should I take an Udemy course? I want to be a developer. I know they make good money and are saught after in cities, but right now, I don't think I'm good enough to persue something like this. 

I don't know what to do, who to talk to, or where to go... Idk...

Thanks,",08Feb2018,1

263,"I know this girl [24F] through a family member, who is decently but not significantly younger than me. She's always been nice and friendly with me in person (which I'm now pretty sure is just because she's a friendly person), but enough to the point where I wasn't sure if she was interested or not. A couple of years ago we started texting to communicate outside of just talking when we happened to run into each other. Pretty standard stuff so far.

We share an interest in sports, and at one point she said we should go see a game together. To me it was one of those non-committal, ""Oh yeah we should totally hang out sometime"" where the person has no intention of following through, so I brushed it off. She again insisted we should do it so I went with it. In the end, she bailed on me three different times during the planning phase. I picked hard dates, I asked if she wanted to give me some guidance, I offered to let her pick a date/plan it, every combination. I understand this sign perfectly. Frankly, if she was a stranger I would have given up after two tries. Our last communication was a text I sent her that never got a reply. I seriously don't care about this rejection at all, but I do feel incredibly disrespected after the whole situation. I've seen her a few times since then and have been cordial, but otherwise cold and unfriendly (frankly I don't think she was being even friend-like).

So every once in a while, when I start feeling too cocky, I like to go on dating apps to completely destroy my self-esteem. I had seen this girl in question on there sometimes. Sometimes I'd swipe right (to no avail), sometimes left, and I really didn't put much stock into. But recently, I decided to swipe right (because hey, how will they know unless swipe right too) and of course we match. She initiates a conversation again but it doesn't feel any different than last time. It still feels more skewed toward me putting more effort into it, so I'm pretty sure this is just a waste of my time again.

How do I just let this go without being an ass? Should I just not put effort into the conversation until she has no motivation to respond any more? I guess the answer is obvious, but it feels nice to get it all out and hear some reassurance.

266,"We reside in the United States.

The other day my friend and I went to the park and on our way back we went through an alleyway and a youth on a BMX blocked our path. He said ""where are you going crackers?"" to us. We are both white and the guy was black. My friend said ""let us past"". And tried to move past. The guy blocked him, so he did it again and the guy blocked him again.

My friend then pushed the guy off his BMX and when the guy tried to get up and attack my friend, my friend punched him back down. I was shocked and a bit frightened at this aggression. After this display of violence my friend then walked on and I followed him.

I was very surprised, I have never seen my friend be violent before. He is a pretty calm quiet guy and is not overly aggressive. I am even more passive.

I am a bit worried for a couple of reasons one although our area does not normally have that much violence, there are sometimes tit for tat attacks, whereby someone from one school attacks someone and then innocent people end up being hurt. Two I don't want people to think my friend and I go around beating up black people (well him beating up black people and me watching). Especially as there is an older girl at school who I have been seeing somewhat and she is African-American. I don't want to get mixed up in this and alienate her.

We've got a mostly good relationship, he's supportive (most of the time) and we get along well with a similar sense of humour and similar hobbies. I am working full time, whilst doing two degrees and an NVQ. My boyfriend unfortunately isn't doing anything, other than the gym and persuing his own hobbies, so I am supporting the both of us from paycheck to paycheck.

Anyway, I've REALLY felt strained recently with my time and energy. I'm pouring so much into each of these things and it makes me want to do nothing but sleep. My boyfriend has complained that I don't spend enough time with him, and although I do try, I still have deadlines for my degrees and full time work. He lives with me too, so I think we spend plenty of time together already.

276,"This is a college math professor, and I've always retained information better when the professor lectures *with* the whiteboard and not just reading off a powerpoint that uses text from the textbook.

It is a lot easier to take notes when the professor chooses to summarize what he is saying on the whiteboard.

Today, we had a substitute in that class as he was out sick, and she did everything on the board and it was night and day.

A few of us in that class thought the same thing as we were walking out, and we were surprised we shared the same thoughts.

The professor in question always uses powerpoints with blocks of text that is very similar to the textbook, and taking notes is damn near impossible as it is a lot to write and interpret while listening to what he says.

He does some examples on the board, but looking at my notes at the end of the day, it is hard to really understand or remember methods, even with extremely fast OR slow, detailed notetaking.. I feel like I'm just referencing out of the book and paying top dollar for Text-to-Speech.

Is it my place to address this to him, and if so... how? How do I know that he hasn't been doing this teaching style for the past ten years and I need to respect his methods of teaching?

So I'm a little freaked out because I've been having all these awful reactions to medicine and the Claritin D one is understandable because of the sulfate. As for the cough syrup, I have no clue why.

Three months ago some neighbors moved out and after being accused that they stole a piece of furniture during moving out, they said that the cats are the actual reason they were moving out. One of ours was getting into their outdoor area and watched their birds. We actually tried to keep them away from there and placed nets over the doors and windows.

We really tried. But my FIL is 90 years old and he adores the cats, one of his favorite things is to chill in the hallway and look at them running around. So we kinda started letting them in the hallway again, under supervision.

However, recently new neighbors moved in, a pair with a kid. The woman is pregnant, so that's another thing to consider. She also has a huge irrational fear of the cats. Anyway, this morning they were shuffling about opening and closing doors and this time another one of our cats tried to enter their kitchen and get a bird they were responsible for. The bird was on the floor, out of the cage, with the window wide open. Our cat are usually very sweet, this one in particular, but they're very adventurous, as I mentioned, and love being outdoors.

The thing that is pushing me to leave this job is that there is no room for negotiation anymore. My manager (who is salaried) has a pattern of taking extra (paid) days off just on a whim when the mood strikes them. They’ll be “sick” when the weather forecast is favourable or when their S.O. mentions plans to do something over the weekend. The other staff and I have to cover for them in these situations because we are a skeleton crew, so even if it’s someone else’s day off they have to cover for them. None of us mind covering for one another in these types of situations, but with the manager it happens almost every week. We’re all a little fed up.
The higher up management adores this manager, there’s no way for us to schedule a meeting with the higher ups as they oversee our location remotely. Aside from having an intervention type meeting with the manager to air our grievances (which I don’t think anyone would be comfortable doing), I can’t see an easy way to have our complaints heard.
Most recently (the reason that triggered this post) my S.O. and I went through some traumatic things at home and on top of it all got news that a family member is in poor health. I mentioned that it would be nice to have one more day off to process all this shit and they (manager) said that “I’m actually taking the day off because I’m not doing so well”. 
I’m not actually sure if manager realizes what they’re doing to the rest of the staff by behaving this way, but it’s pretty shitty.

I’m up for a raise in May, but I don’t know if the pay raise alone would be worth staying. Also, the job market isn’t so good where I’m at, so finding the right job wouldn’t be quick or easy. 
I have recently started looking casually.

309,"For some context, my ex and I dated on/off (only one ""break"") for the past 2 years. I recently cut things off for good about 2 weeks ago, when I found out he was back in contact with his ex (who he had broken up with /gotten back with 3 times...). I decided to get out fast &amp; end things because I was not about to be caught up in a stupid dating triangle again.

Anyway, during those 2 years that I was with him, we had a 5 month FWB. It was honestly so much fun, no drama, issues, arguments, we were both so happy and the sneaking around made it even more exciting. Plus, we have amazing chemistry. We can't keep our hands off each other and we are both into the kink of dominant/submissive and very rough sex. It was honestly so much fun. 

Problem is, now that I ended things (I'm only assuming) that he's back with his ex...for a fourth time. Knowing their past, they literally do only last 2-4 months at a time, before things fizzle out. Last time that happened (after I dumped him the first time), he came crawling back to me after and said it was a stupid mistake...and so we began talking again, etc.

Anyway, once he and her break up again, I 99% know he'll be back. And when he's back, right now I honestly cannot see myself not suggesting we hookup again. We were able to keep it really lowkey for such a long time, and it worked so well. I just feel so attached to him physically &amp; sexually.

I've tried seeing/hooking up with other guys to move forwards &amp; forget about my ex but I keep comparing the sex &amp; the guys to my ex. It's horrible lol. I wan't to move on so bad but at this time, my ex is the only guy I want to hookup with.

320,"Hey guys, I'm after some perspective and advice on a situation that is happening! there's a tldr at the bottom because this is a lot of info.

So, my best friend (we'll call her Jane) lives really far from the nearest Major suburb. It's a town further down the peninsula of where I live, and is basically a seaside town that only has one bus going to it. She lives with her parents because of her financial situation. Jane cannot drive due to not having enough money for driving lessons and having her own car. Before she moved back home, she was living with an abusive partner and beginning to study at a local community college.

Now that she's moved back home and is still studying, she needs to couchsurf at friend's houses during school days, basically me and another friend.
I'm totally fine having her over, she's a really good house guest and my parent's don't seem to mind her here (I live at home, college student lol).

Recently, the other friend hasn't been home, so she can't stay with them. Jane isn't allowed to stay with her boyfriend (the mum is nuts and despises her without reason). Last tuesday, Jane asked to stay over, however I couldn't have her because I had a REALLY important event on that night, one she knew I had planned to go for at least two weeks. I told Jane she can come but she declined. I felt guilty the entire time. So Jane ended up being driven by her boyfriend ALL the way up to her house (40 minute drive),and thankfully had the day off. The day after her day off, she was  driven all the way to college (another 40 minutes give or take traffic), and then her boyfriend go to work. Jane refuses to take the train in the morning despite all of us having to get up at the crack of dawn to go to uni, because it's too exhausting apparently.

She has school today and then the weekend. Last night I offered my house seeing how I was home, she refused because ""I don't sleep well at yours"", due to me moving a lot in my sleep (nowhere else but my bed for her in this house unfortunately). Other friend couldn't take her in (or she didnt want to, idfk). In our group chat with other people, she acted like she was destitute and homeless, and ended up being driven back home and then back again by her poor partner.

After refusing my offer and making or guilting her partner driving her home, I've been rather annoyed with Jane and have been giving her the cold shoulder online. Probably not the most mature way. So what I'm asking is for a different perspective. Is she being unreasonable? Am I being unreasonable? I don't know how to help if she's refusing offers. She hasn't been like this at all until recently. I'm not sure if the boyfriend is bending over backwards for her. Thankyou so much

tldr; a friend is refusing offers to help out and instead, inconveniences her partner, then acting like she's a poor unfortunate soul.",08Feb2018,5

326,"I originally posted it here https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7skpgz/a_guy_from_grindr_called_the_police_after_we_had/

New updates:
1. I haven't heard from the police ever since my lawyer called the police and told them that I will not talk to them directly.
2. I received an email from the Office of Equal Opportunities of my university two days ago, saying that it is alleged that I sexually assault the Grindr guy and an investigation into these allegations will be conducted. I was assigned to an investigator and he will see me next Wednesday.
3. I reviewed the chat history with this guy and found that He contacted me multiple times in 10 different dates. And the guy initiated the conversation for all the ten conversations. Two of the conversations lead to sexual intercourse. One was the alleged incident about 16 days ago, and another was our first sex on early December last year, about 50 days before the incident. Both time the guy explicitly expressed via Grindr APP that he wanted to have sex with me.  

I really need professional advice. I have read the university's resource guide for the respondent of sexual assault allegations and all the related policies in my university. But I am still very anxious because I don't know where this investigation will go. 
Do you think that this will lead to serious consequences such as expulsion from the university? Personally, I don't think I violated any state or federal law but I don't know whether the university will treat allegations of sexual assault differently and might come up with different conclusions from the investigations conducted by the police.
I guess the guy wouldn't deny that he consented to have sex with me, as shown by our chat history. His major complaint might be that I didn't use a condom and I ejaculated inside him. But As I said in the original post, he never request to use one and we didn't talk about whether using a condom or not. Besides, I asked him where he would like me to ejaculate before the final ejaculation.
What confused me the most is why I should be responsible for not using a condom. We are two adults and if he requested to use one, I would definitely do so.",08Feb2018,0

I've seen them leave the apartment all lovey and cute and I've seen the girl quickly run into the unit and slam the door. It's been not great. 

But here's the thing... The whole building knows about it. And there's a ton of different theories and conspiracies as to what the fuck is going on. Some say she does it to herself and everytime he tries to leave she threatens to kill herself. Some think it's them doing it to each other. etc, etc, which, I know, doesn't really make a difference in the long run.

I've connected with a few mentors months ago who have been trying to offer advice and support me on a quest to find employment that is full time with benefits.


I've worked in a corporate office before and really didn't like it too much. Even with the perks and nice computer and office. After a while, the environment exacerbated my anxiety and depression. To the point I contemplated jumping in front of the train I took to work eveyday.


I just don't like working for other people. I've always been quite independent. When I work on my own projects, it's like a switch is flipped and I become highly motivated.


If I could work for myself, with maybe 1 or 2 people, that would be ideal. I have a bunch of ideas I want to materialize into real working business ventures. 


But I don't have the money to hire anyone. And when I speak of my plans of becoming my own boss,  people roll their eyes. I guess, my credentials on paper make it appear as if I'm a failure or lazy.

337,"Hi /r/Advice.

I never post, yet I use reddit daily and love the community so I'm truly sorry if there are any formatting issues.

So this whole ordeal started mid-January when my mother and 2 of her co-workers went out to a bar to play pool. 
For the sake of following rules, my mother will go by B, and her two friends as S and J. 
Both S and J are devout Sikhs and both had patkas on their heads. They were playing pool for about 90 minutes, until the bar manager and bouncer came over and asked the two to remove their headgear. This particular bar they visited had strict rules against having attire on your head in respect to veterans. The request was taken into consideration, and was obliged to, but before exiting B had made a comment on how we live in a country (Canada) where it is their right to wear whatever they please on their head as it is their expression of faith. The comment made by B was responded with hate and disgust. The bar manager was getting incredibly rude, and so were other bar patrons. The party quickly left before things got physical, and cops were called as a security measure....
Fast forward a couple days, and the event was all over the news, and an apology was issued by the bar in the papers, and was also televised. 
Last night B had made a harmless comedic comment on a friends post on Facebook, and someone responded to B's comment, and here is where things get ugly. The words ""I think you should drive careful now. You never know when you might get stuck on one of these roads, or you never know when your brake line might not work."" Immediately, B was alarmed and commented ""Is that a threat?"" That was followed by ""You should keep an eye out your window over these next few nights.""
B immediately called the police and explained the situation, the police officer showed up, and has been staying with her since. 

This morning a friend of B called her and asked if she had read the papers recently, and she had not. Her friend explained that a reporter from the community Guardian had wrote an article, slandering members of the community and province, stating they are ""uneducated, ignorant, stupid, lazy, and don't want to work, and thats why these immigrants are flooding into the community and taking everyones jobs."" The author had put some unsavoury comments and attitudes in the name of B, S and J. None of this is true, and all 3 identity's have been defamed. Members of the community are angry, and feel betrayed by the woman who claimed to act towards social justice in a situation that had called for it.
This is an escalating situation, and suing and/or legal justification to the Guardian is a likely possibility. 

Im asking you /r/Advice, to please pitch us your two-cents because we are not sure of what to do and it feels like the whole community is pitted against my mother. 

Everyone has a mother, so I hope you understand the magnitude of my concern as her life has been threatened.

338,"The art of small talk does not come naturally to me. Sometimes it is anxiety and focusing too much on what people will think of me. Other times, I feel like I do not have a lot to talk about. Serious topics typically are the topics that interest me (politics, economics, investments, religion, and other no go topics). I have very little interest in sports, pop culture, or many of the other things that people around me talk about. I am pretty good about asking basic stuff about how people's weekend was, how their kids are doing, and other things like that. To be honest though, I really don't care about their kids or their weekend and it is difficult for me to feign as if I do. It is not that I do not care about them as people, but I really don't care about how they spent last Saturday at the park with their kids. Written communication is not as much of an issue for me. I think partly because it gives me an opportunity to think deeper about what I am saying before I say it.

Not sure if this is the right place for this but here goes:

Just for some context, I'm 21 and finishing my last year of college.

About 3 years ago I was hospitalized and I'm fairly certain that some kind of tracking/watching device was put in me while I was unconscious. 

Look, I know how it sounds and at first I didn't believe it but ever since then I've been noticing more and more than people seem to be following me, among other things.

At first I never noticed, I thought I was just going crazy, like this person isn't following me, it's just a coincidence, this city isn't that large and we're just going in the same direction.

But then I noticed whenever I would pick up the phone I would hear this crackling noise like someone was listening. And when I'm be walking downtown I notice the same people making the same corners as me.

345,"I'm a 21 y/o F college student. For the past couple weeks, I've been feeling overly emotional, sleeping a lot, falling behind on my coursework, not cleaning, etc. I got back on hormonal BC recently, so I'm thinking that it's causing a bit of a depressive episode. 

I really just need to get back on track before it gets exponentially worse. I know that I should ""just do it"", but I really can't. I have so much schoolwork and cleaning to do that I can't possibly finish everything any time soon. (It's always like this to some extent with school, just a constant stream of work). 

Does anyone have any tips on getting out of this kind of slump? I just want to be productive and feel happier, but it doesn't seem possible. ",08Feb2018,2
346,"I have never posted on reddit before so I hope this is alright. A moment of your time and advice would be much appreciated. I’ll try to make a long story short. I’ve had an office job for the past few years and the work environment grew to be very toxic. I already have severe anxiety from past trauma and have received help overcoming it but this job has been setting me backwards in my recovery process. After months of hiding in the bathroom from anxiety attacks and tolerating stomach aches/fluttering heart beats, I built the courage and put in my two weeks. While it is a weight off my shoulders, I can’t help but feel guilty.  I know I have enough money put away to get by for me to get another job but as a young mom I almost feel as if I failed. Have any of you left your job without an actual back up plan? Does anyone have any job suggestions for someone with over active anxiety? Any job hunting advice? How do you cope working with anxiety/depression?

Any advice would be nice! Thank you for your time!",08Feb2018,15
347,"Hey guys and gals, I could really use some advice on this topic. Ive been with a sportsclub, lets say basketbal (its a bit different but that doesn't matter for this post) for almost my entire life now. The last few seasons have been horrible, especially this season after two headcoaches left us mid season due to multiple reasons. We get humiliated every match we play and I can understand why; nobody is taking practice (two times a week, 1.5 hours per practice) seriously. Some people screw around all the time and that effects everybody on the team, the coach we have now does nothing against it. At every practice we're supposed to grab all the equipment and put them ready before the practice starts, but im not even joking when I say I am the only one of 18 (!) players to do this while the rest is just sitting there chatting up about how there day went. They dont even take the effort to do warming up anymore. 

This should'nt effect me that much because it is only a hobby, but this is truly something which makes very unhappy and depressed even at times. Its sad because I know most of the guys I play with since I was a kid (im 23y btw now) but I really just wanna tell them to f*ck off and do something valuable with my spare time. Well, easy decision then right? Not so much because technically it is not allowed to quit mid season, and also I would be seen as the bad guy if i would quit now.

Please help me......",08Feb2018,1
