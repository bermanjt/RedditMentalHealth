0,"My friend of 4 years (also my recent ex) is going through some tough times right now. He won't tell anyone what but it's making him irritable and he's taking out his anger on other people. He has a history of bad depression but it's never been like this.

As much as I want to be there for him I'm trying to give him space to let him figure out things on his own and he has: he knows he's taking it out on people but he's not trying to fix it.

I'm worried he's going to do something stupid  but I can't approach him without upsetting him.",01Jan2018,2

I just want to find out how to get it of having to do this. Has anyone successfully dealt with this situation before? ",01Jan2018,2

8,"I have certain family members who have just plain ignored the inportant things in my life and or made things more difficult.
More recently i have come across some issues and was in need of some help that you wouldnt normally hope family could do for you, except mine.
For example i live far from them currently but im moving back so very rarely i may need something done before i get back to that city, i also have a surgery coming up in the same city.

To save time and a couple hundred dollars each trip, i have asked if they can do simple things for me regarding my surgery to which they always decline.

I last needed them to go to my doctor for a upcoming surgery i have to get pre surgery information they said i needed+documents.
They said they couldnt pick up the things i needed because they either had work or a test for school(the doctors office is maybe a 25 minute drive from them and it could have been picked up anytime in the week)

Its times like these where family is the ones you would count on right. If they need help and i can help they know i would do it but when its the other way around, it never happens.

We never talk unless they want something or after a year passes by and they havent heard from me, they will indirectly message me through someone else.

Should i just completely cut them off? ",01Jan2018,2
9,"Hello everyone and Happy New Year! To kick off the new year i would really appreciate some advice from anyone if possible. 

As of right now i am a junior in high school taking 3 AP classes and playing in a youth orchestra. However from September to November i was in 3 AP classes while participating in 2 orchestras and playing varsity soccer. During those few months, my life was awful and i definitely hit my breaking point mentally and physically. i swear i had at least a mental breakdown every week or so during that time period and started developing depression as my rigorous schedule with all three activities forced me into a robotic lifestyle. In addition, i also came to terms with me being gay but i have not been out to anyone and am tired of being forced to conceal who i really am. 

My question for everyone reading this is should i quit soccer senior year? This is a very complicated question for me as i don’t want to ruin my future college application as four years of varsity soccer carries some weight. However at the same time my true passion is music and i feel my effort for soccer is useless as no matter what we constantly lose anywhere from 6-0 to 10-0 for the past 3 years and quite frankly i’ve lost all interest in the sport itself. To complicate this further (i’m really sorry i’m just super lost right now), i know that when i do come out as gay this year (which will happen as my family is all over me to find a prom date) i will be forced out of soccer as i can’t deal with the backlash of being gay within soccer and my hopes of getting into an Ivy League school will be demolished. 

Thank you to anyone who can offer any sort of thought process on my situation. i am thoroughly petrified of the new year and am lost on what to do.",01Jan2018,1
11,"Hello

This may not be exactly the proper sub-reddit to post this, so feel free to redirect me elsewhere.

Lately I have been feeling really ""disturbed"" in a serious way(psychological speaking), by all sorts of ""negative"" media like movies and animes, and by negative I mean, things depicting violence (in various levels,from mild violence to brutal murders).

The other day I had almost a panic attack(more like a strong feeling of discomfort mixed with anxiety, not sure how to describe that), by a SIMPLE READ, like, really, no pictures, no video, just reading from a certain story(of an anime),were several characters suffered from gruesome deaths.
I didn't need to see a single picture of that,the thought kept echoing in my head and I had that feeling I described above for hours.

I've tried in the past to think what's with this negative feelings, I found out that most probably the idea that ""annoy"" me the most if the fact that I have no control over a media (wherever is a movie or anime or a TV show or even a book), and so every time something bad happen (like any violent act) I feel like compelled to do something about it, when I clearly can't, since, it's not real nor it's happening right now off course, so there's no way I can do anything about it. Still I can't control this feeling, this anxiety, I feel a very strong urge every time for example I see a murder in a movie, to go save the victim before she is killed, and I feel a deep hatred toward the assassin even if I know perfectly that's all fiction.
A thing that ""suppress"" the idea that ""it's all fiction"", is that, whenever something plausible is depicted, may first thought is ""This thing, fiction or not, has probably happen many times in the world, and it will keep happening for who knows many times in the future everywhere in the world"" -- so the whole ""It's just fiction"" just get destroyed by that though, and I'm left with all the negative feelings I already described.

So I've read the rules and I know I shouldn't ask for a ""general"" advice, but I'm not sure how to phrase this to not sound a generic, but, uhm, what could I do, other than seeking professional help I mean?",01Jan2018,2
12,"Long story, family drama. My mom was psychologically abusive in middle school, I moved out, graduated highschool, moved back in with her to get on my feet during my gap year. I graduated at only 17 so I figured I had time to breathe.

I figured it would be OK, that we'd both changed, but it turns out she's even more toxic than before. I had like four paragraphs here about how emotionally abusive she is but let's just leave it at this: She's nuts. She hurt me. She gaslights. She's manipulative. End of. I had a really bad time, depression, self-hate, you know the drill. It affected me as a teenager but I'm old enough and have enough self-confidence now that it just bounces off me. Still though, it irritates me, and today the irritation got to be too much. She's too annoying, even though I tried so hard to tolerate her. I've decided to go low-contact as soon as I can. She had her chances.

I'm not looking for emotional support, I just wanted to let that off my chest and establish the premise. It's pretty tiring even when if I'm over it emotionally. It sucked, but I'm done moping around, now is the time to mobilize. My family failed me, but that won't stop me from getting off my ass and starting my life.

My real issue is my lack of a plan for the future.

I want to work with computers, that much is clear. IT, Compsci, I don't know yet, because I don't know my talents. I managed to get a part-time job at a record store getting some side money, but let's just say it's not a living wage. I don't have any chance of getting into college: I'm flat broke, my GPA was awful, and I don't want to risk the consequences of seeking aid from *her*. My end goal is to move to a different state and really begin my life there, again I am not sure where, but I've traveled all over the country so I have a few ideas. I grew up moving from place to place so I have no ties to any one particular area, and no reason to stay where I am now.

Option 1: I bide my time here [fuck] and go to community college before transferring into a university. Would require a lot of homework on the particulars and a game plan on moving out. Probably the least likely option.

Option 2: I join the military and see what happens. Wildcard option. I could get a GI bill and go through college, I could stay in the military as a career, who the fuck knows. Physically I might not be suited to it but I think if I stay hydrated and get enough sleep I could make it.

Option 3: I make a pathetic mockery of myself and go seeking help from my family. I know a few people I could live with while I get on my feet, but something about that idea just doesn't sit well with me. It could be pride, but I also don't want to burden others with my problems.

There's also the difficulty of touching down in a new place and making connections. Kinda hard to make friends or get involved in anything when you're new in town and don't have any bearings. Doesn't help that I can be socially awkward sometimes. That's a bridge I'll cross when I get to it, though. Just something I know will be hard that I can see coming. In a weird way though, I'm excited for it, it will mean I've won.

It feels good to think productively like this, but now I need to act. Your input on this could well affect my decision so I would appreciate anything you have to say.",01Jan2018,4
13,"I'm almost 16 and I've been looking at getting a job at my local movie theater that just opened up. I've been wanting to get a job for years now, and since I'm getting my license soon and can finally drive myself it seems like the perfect time. But when I bring this up to my parents, they're very against it. My dad thinks I need to focus on school and that I'll have a hard time balancing both school and work even though I'm HOMESCHOOLED. I have nothing but time. The movie theater I want to work at would require me to work evenings and weekends which leaves me all morning during weekdays to get my school work done, so I don't see why this should be an issue. 
On the other hand, my mom is less against me getting a job but she definitely isn't in love with the idea. She thinks I'll call saying I have to work late, but really I'll go out and party and drink, because that's what she did when she was a kid. I'm really not the type to party and even if I could legally drink, I wouldn't.

14,"I summarized most of my situation on another post on r/offmychest [right here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7nbaze/my_fiancee_and_i_uprooted_our_lives_to_care_for/) but this is the gist: My mother just had surgery to remove cancer in her esophagus from a lifetime of smoking and drinking. She had complications and stayed in the hospital for three months. My fiancee and I essentially uprooted our lives and were willing to move 2.5 hours and buy a house to be closer to my mother. My mom got discharged and we made it two weeks until my mom essentially drove my fiancee away for being too ""controlling"" (though everyone familiar with the situation thinks my mom is being irrational.)

My mom will most definitely go back to smoking and drinking if I leave. She already arranged to get a bottle of vodka and some cigarettes delivered here to her house, and she has the pack open but yet unlit as I write this. She will also probably have an accident at home or mess up her med schedule if I'm not here. But she continues to speak ill of my fiancee, who has done nothing but put our lives on hold to be a support for my mom, clean and fix up her entire house, and run every last errand my mom wanted.

I'll be unhappy either way. If I move back in with my fiancee right away, I'll worry about my mom and if something happens, I'll never forgive myself. But if I stay, I'm apart from my supportive, loving fiancee and our two cats, and I have to listen to my mom speak ill of her and possibly chain smoke and binge drink again soon. And I'll be stuck here for another couple of months at least until she's fully independent again. And I'll have to keep my low-paying work at home job and my fiancee and I will continue to struggle financially. Damned if I do/don't.

18,"So it's Christmas Break and I have been very busy when it comes to schoolwork, studying for exams, as it is my last year in high school. Thus, I haven't had much of an opportunity to hang out with my friends outside of school. Because we all want to get together, we thought of hanging out during the Christmas holidays. Although I am supposed to be very busy, I do have a day where I can squeeze in some time to enjoy myself.

Although discussing our plans have been going well, one of my friends want's to see a movie. Now this same friend has also invited me to go play Dungeons and Dragons with some other people during the break. As much as I wanted to go, I couldn't because I was busy that day, so I declined the offer. Now, a few days after that event, he wants to go see a movie with a couple of our friends. Although I really want to hang out with my friends because of all the stuff I am doing, I don't really like watching movies. I know you might be thinking that it's pretty stupid and abnormal, but I personally don't like sitting for two hours where I might zone out due to the movie being boring. I also hate the possibility that some person will spoil the movie (e.g. those who walk out of the theater and spoil the entire movie) before I even watch it, meaning I'll be even more uninterested in the movie. Now don't get me wrong, I like short videos and clips, as well as certain comedy/action movies. However, I feel that after watching a movie, I'll tend to forget about everything that happened a few days later, meaning I wasted time and money. In fact, I have been living under the rock when it comes to movies that the last time I have even been to the movie theater was around five or six years from now, because some kid behind me was randomly screaming and even kicked my head, completely ruining my experience. Whenever I have to watch movies for school assignments, I would watch the first part of the movie, zone out, and end up looking up the plot on Wikipedia or IMDB. 

Now I'm very good friends with this guy who initiated this event, and he's came to a few of the events I initiated. But I feel that I don't want to go watch movies just for the sake of it, because I know I won't enjoy it. However, I also feel that if I decline his offer a second time, he'll probably assume that I'm not interested in hanging out with him. What do you think I should do? Should I just suck it up and go to the movies, or politely decline the offer? 

Also (as 2018 approaches), one of my new year's resolutions is to try to watch any movie without zoning out and looking at what the plot is on Wikipedia.

TL:DR-Decline to the first event my friend initiated as I was busy. He initiated another event: going to the movies, but I don't like watching movies. I really want to hang out with my friends, as we're all busy this year.",01Jan2018,6

My mom never told me about her real parents before she passed away. Or anything about her sister in Japan. I don't think she knew anything about her sister in Japan.

I think I did a good job lining things up but here's the thing I""M NOT A DOCTOR and I think it'd be very easy for me to misinterpret things or see things that aren't there but so much lines up I wanna share it with people to see what their opinions are but I'm not sure where a good website to do that is.

29,"I hate Florida with a passion. I've lived here my whole life and I've never left the southern USA. I've never experienced any seasons other than summer and hurricane season.


I want to see something different, and maybe start my life over. I want to go out in nature. Real nature. Good looking nature too, not swamps and palm trees. I want to climb a mountain. I want to live in a place that has jobs. 


I want to find people like me. Where I live, it feels like everyone is the same. I downloaded tinder and sometimes I swipe through that but I'm too scared to actually start anything, and anyway, if somebody told me that 95% of women on there are actually just three people with several accounts, I'd believe it. They alll look kind of the same and they all love the beach. I don't mean to knock their tastes, all I'm saying is it feels like I have nothing in common with anyone here. 


But most of all, I want to play in the snow. I have ever since I was a little kid and my parents kept promising we would, every year. Now I'm realizing that I don't want to go traveling with my family. They're so boring. Besides, just leaving once isn't going to help. I think I need to get out permanently. 


So, what do I do? I don't even know where to begin planning something like that. I don't have enough money to move out yet, nobody in my town is hiring, and I'm stuck here until at least may, when I'll be done with community college.

33,"So before my freshman year of high school, i moved out of state to a kinda weird spot. Super cliquey and the polar opposite of where i grew up. I'm a junior now and still really haven't found a stable group of friends. 

I have friends, but they're just not dependable. They typically blow me off to go smoke weed or get various levels of fucked up in some way. If we do hang out, they're either high as hell or hammered and i'm basically driving them around. When they're sober, they're super cool guys, but that's the thing. They're barely ever sober when we hang out outside of school. They blew me off again tonight for New Years. I'm honestly at the end of my rope with them. They're pretty much the best of a bad situation at this point, as much as I hate to say it.  They have fun though, and i'm honestly jealous of them for it. I'd love to go to parties (those opportunities are few and far between for me) but i think i'm on the outside looking in like 99% of the time because i don't do drugs or drink, which is a very large part of the culture of the school i go to and the town i live in. Addiction has hit pretty close to home, so i stay away from that stuff. Problem is that's a huge part of the social aspect of my town, as i mentioned.

I've basically exhausted all opportunities of making friends at my school, i think. I certainly hope not, but i honestly don't know. Third year in and haven't really made much progress. I live in a big town, so connecting with people at other school is difficult also, because i've never actually had really much interaction with anyone from other schools. It's really frustrating. I play two sports (football and baseball) and in the process of starting a musicians' club at my school (i play guitar and bass and write original music. Finding people to play with has been an absolute crapshoot, which sucks because i love music). 

At this point I just wanna be happy and have fun and be able to say I made a few memories before i head off to college and real life starts, y'know? The majority of my weekends have been spent in my room and i'm done with it. Any advice on finding better friends than the ones i have so far?

His parents love her as much as I do, and regularly spend weekends with her with they can.(He has another family, and another child, and a drug problem, which is why I guess he chooses not to spend time with her. I have a court order for child support, but he does not even pay it, and they can't do much to him since his driving license is already taken) 

I do not currently have a job, but have applied to many with open availability, even though I am truly not openly available to at least get a foot in to the hiring process, and then discuss hours. I can get state assistance with daycare, so that is not a problem as long as the work hours are during the day. 

So here is the kicker. I live with my parents, and have my own room with my daughter. I CANNOT DRIVE. I have horrible persisting anxiety and OCD and have tried before to drive and drove it into my neighbors front yard and wrecked their fence. I am scared to get behind a wheel, or to even walk down the street in my neighborhood to grab a bus with my daughter to go shopping. 

My mother likes to play favorites and will always favor my brother for anything. 

I personally enjoy gaming, and I have sold every console and even my PC to support my daughter right now. She doesn't understand that gaming is my stress release, and even my daughter enjoyed watching me play. I received a PS4 Pro for Christmas from a close relative, and my mother forced me to return it to them since ""You cannot afford your ""hobby"" you have an addiction! Your daughter is your life now not stupid video games!"" I brought up my brother and his addicition to purchasing tools, and useless vehicles. She told me that he has a job he can afford his...

... I was very embarrassed to have to do that and even more so depressed since she backlashed at me the entire day and today told me to get section 8 housing and to get out. I asked her what I did to deserve to get kicked out and she told me that she couldn't stand me anymore.  

Can someone please guide me or give me your honest advice on what I can do to provide for my daughter and myself? Or whatever advice you have to give please ?

36,"Well, I don't think it's a relationship anymore. My boyfriend told me he didn't want to be with me anymore tonight. 

Here's the story: About 2 years ago is when it started, he met another chick and basically left me for her. Turns out he still loved me and realized he didn't want her, he came back. We talked, said sorry, all that jazz. During the period he was away, I went into a really bad depression. I didn't sleep for 3 days once, as well as didn't eat for a week. I was a mess.

I met someone after he came back, someone who made me feel really happy, although I still loved my ""boyfriend"" (me and my ex weren't together at this point, just talking.) After talking for a while to this new guy, hanging out, he asked me for some sexy pictures one night and I sent them. I felt horrible the moment I clicked send. 

I told my somewhat ex boyfriend, boyfriend, whatever, about this, and he flipped shit. He cried. I felt so fucking bad my heart was gonna explode. I cried with him. He told me he would forgive me if I cut off the other guy, and I did.

Things got bad for the next few months, it was never the same. He thought of me as a really sweet, nice, girl and I ruined the image. He'd go off on me calling me a slut and a whore. He just doesn't realize the pain he put me through. He really doesn't. I know what I did was bad but I was horrible and wanted some sort of attention.

In these few months as well, I find out he's been talking to the girl he left me for even though PROMISING to stop like 3 times.

Anyways, a few months later he breaks up with me. I'm devastated. Same thing as before. But now, we still talk. He says he wants to ""fuck me but just be friends"". Friends with benefits. I was shocked. We continued to talk..blahblah.. a year goes by, I think we're in some sort of relationship but he doesn't totally confirm it.

He meets another chick, and all the sudden I'm thrown away. again. Heartbreak once a-fucking-gain. My heart can't handle the bullshit. He admitted to using me for the year because he lost feelings for me. Like what? I ended up calling the suicide hotline one night, I swear I'm not that kind of person. He spends months with this girl, telling me he fell out of love with me and they're happy.

I went back to the guy who made me happy from before. We dated briefly, things were okay, but I continued to miss my ex. My ex finds out about this and 2 weeks later, his relationship with the other girl ends. He begs for me back. I agree, I'm so dumb. I know. The next 5 months were okay, but he would still continue to call me a slut and stuff because of the stuff with the other guy. EVEN THOUGH HE LEFT ME. He is so delusional.

Fast forward to now, he started talking to me about what I had done with the other guy. Again.. calling me a slut, a whore, that I was good for nothing. He decides to break up with me again and tells me never to contact him again. 

At first, I replied nicely, telling him I loved him, that I was sorry. A long message, he never responded. Why should I even be fucking apologizing? he doesn't give a shit. I got mad and sent an angry text. I wrote: 

""Fuck being nice. Not responding just shows how much you care. I'm going out with someone in 15 minutes (I did, to a new years party) and I'm not looking back. You're a cheater and a manipulator and karma will get to you. I loved you but your bullshit is too much to handle. Bye""

I sent that trying to be strong but I'm really hurt. Nothing gets through to him. He'll always think he's right, and he'll always think I'm a stupid slut. I fucking love him so much, I'm sure most people wouldn't at this point.

He doesn't even love me anymore. I love him so much. I don't know how to let go. I've gone through this 2 times already, and I can't handle the pain. I'm really scared to feel it again. I know he'll be with another girl quickly if we do breakup. What should I do from here? Message him, or what?",01Jan2018,2
38,"I'm 15, male, sophomore, in a hick shit county called Buckingham, Virginia (although my friends aren't hicks, for the most part) and this whole year for me has just been a series of disappointments and rejection. I can think of four girls off the top of my head with whom I have ceased being friends. One of them was a girl I virtually fell in love with at the end of freshman year and we were on track to be in what I thought was going to be a great relationship. I thought this was the thing I've been waiting for that will make all of this school bs worth it at the end of the day Then, at the end of the school year, she moved away. I'll never see her again. I never even got to kiss her. Ever since then, and without that blossom of hope which withered away in an instant, I've been depressed, lonely, and overall very demotivated and uninterested in the furtherance of my academic career. I barely passed half of my classes this semester, and it doesn't really feel worth the effort to try. This is because, at the end of every school day, after another seven and a half hours of sitting and listening and writing, all I do is sit at home and watch stupid youtube videos until I have to go to sleep and continue the next day. I don't get to hang with friends, I don't even really like my friends enough to want to. And now, on new year's eve night, I see snapchat stories with my friends and they are partying, drinking, socializing, and most importantly, enjoying themselves. I don't get that. I don't have that. All I've done tonight is relapse on my cutting problem that hasn't surfaced in two years; because I was bored, sad, and wanted some kind of release. It's not that I think it's fun or that it brings me joy. It's because I have nothing else to do. Especially nothing that gives me the unique release of sliding a razor blade through the skin on my shoulder. I don't get alcohol or friends or a new year's kiss. This is what I get and this is what I am. The only reason I don't seriously suicide is because I'm afraid of God and I'm afraid of what might happen to me in the afterlife. I just want a release. Something to look forward to at the end of the day. A vice, even.
TL;DR: I'm really depressed and I feel like I'm in a rut that's impossible to get out of without some sort of release. Girls, alcohol, parties, etc.",01Jan2018,3

48,"Hi Reddit, need your advice. 

When my father died almost 10 years ago, after a short time mum sold up the holiday house as she didn’t enjoy it without him, and us kids got some of the stuff in there that wasn’t part of the sale. 

One that I wanted and then enjoyed with my kids was a simple old school milkshake maker. Great quality, commercial grade as you would see in a store. Mum always was happy to pay for quality. 

We have moved house a few times since, but never leave anything behind, and the only possible location is a work colleague who is also (supposedly) a friend of mine and my wife’s. a little while ago she unfriended us for no reason on Facebook and no ignores me at work. She helped us move around the time it went missing including transporting stuff in her car. I doubt it would have been taken intentionally if she knew the significance, but there is the possibility it was forgotten in car, not found till later, cue embarrassment etc...

So my dilemma - I’ve pretty much written the item off, confrontation wouldn’t be worth it as I would get denials, so I want to replace it as my kids and I all miss the pastime

Do I replace with an identical item, same as my dad owned, and run the risk of remembering it’s not his once but a replacement each time we use it, or get the newer current model, and move on. Same risk whenever I look at it knowing it’s not his one etc...

I don’t want to have sex in high school, not because my parents said not to(they probably wouldn’t be too upset if I did), it’s for myself, I have more important responsibilities, and I really have to get my self together emotionally before I get into a relationship, I understand that. But I’m worried my impulses will override that desire. Whenever I like a guy I get so disgustingly infatuated that it weakens me. It feels like I would do anything for a guy I have a crush on. And it’s usually older guys who I’m into too. Luckily no guy has ever asked me to do anything, thank god. But the possibility still freaks me out. I’m worried about what I would do in that scenario.

And I’m smart, but it’s only me being able to just think things out which just gives me the ability to learn and figure out new subjects) 

I’m stuck in life so it seems from my perspective. Stuck in the way that I’m not sure what to do. 

There’s different sides of me. I want success and to do great things but I also want to keep life very simple and live near Walden pond or in a little fishing in Chile.
Im just so lost.

I’m so interested in crypto currencies and learning about how markets work. And I want to learn a computer language. I want to move from my house in OBX, NC over to Minneapolis. Just get a little apartment and a coffee shop job so I can spend all my free time learning about things I enjoy and learning C++. 

However I’m distraught over other paths. My uncle has encouraged me to study economics to eventually get a masters and “write my own ticket” and has hinted that he’d want me to help him start a business. I’ve fantasized about starting businesses all my life. 

Other people in my family want me to go to college and that stuff. 

Recently I was offered a job as quality control guy for a concrete company starting at 45k a year which is flashy to me because I’m just 21 and only have an associates in engineering.

And I’ve been thinking about working this job until June where I would then go hike the pacific crest trail and figure life out from there.

 I may sound absolutely crazy, but I have an opportunity and I feel like maybe I should take it. There’s an apprenticeship in my country, I have all the qualifications to do it, and I’ll get a grant for it as well as my pay once I can actually work. I plan on moving to another country and after researching it, I’ll make twice as much there as I will here if I do this (and the pay here is high anyway!) 

  However I’m not sure if I’m cut out for it. I did a course in engineering, which is obviously different, and enjoyed it, but found it very difficult - also possibly because my teacher was... for lack of s better word, rubbish. According to the company this is all through there’s certain traits an aircraft mechanic should have and I have most of them. I have good grades (all A’s and B’s) and people say I should go to university and get a white collar job but that doesn’t really appeal to me. 

  If it doesn’t work out I’ll be screwed basically - I’ll either have to do a different apprenticeship or just get a shitty job until either I get our equivalent of a GED, or I can wait and be a mature student when I’m 23.

I dated this guy for almost a year. Would’ve been a year in a couple days. 7 months into the relationship he goes off to Army training. I wrote to him through letters, I missed and loved him while he was away, and I wore the ring he gave me everyday. I went to his Family Day weekend where I had to ask off work and school to go. I went to his graduation 5 hours away in the freezing cold and rain by rescheduling finals and work time. He became distant the week before his leave and I could tell it was downfalling. When I asked him specifically what was going on he said he wanted to talk in person. He’s been home on leave since Dec 18 and hasn’t seen me at all. Barely any communication. After 4 months of him away, countless tries to just talk with him and give him space, and hoping for the best, a couple days ago he broke up with me.

67,"A short bio: I was antisocial growing up. I always kept to myself and was very quiet. According to my mom, I didn't actually start talking (full sentences) until I was six. My parents split up when I was seven, so I moved around alot (four times to this day, to be exact). As a result, I had trouble making friends; I just thought that not getting attached would make things easier. Thus, I guess the story that follows is a bit of a paradox because it's about my feelings for a girl who probably doesn't even remember me.

I moved to the US when I was 12. And in my first week of 7th grade in the states, I saw this very beautiful girl from afar. I was too shy to approach her, and I only ever saw her on that one day; but I nonetheless never forgot about her. Though I didn't think I would see her again, I actually did--four years later. I was a junior in high school by then, and she was one grade above me. Deep down, I thought it was fate--or maybe just a coincidence--that we wound up in the same high school (some context: there are about 3 other nearby high schools in the area). 

I sat right behind her in bio class, yet I never even actually talked to her (small talk excluded) until the day before her graduation. She's all I could think about, and a close friend of mine said that I call other girls by her name without even realizing it (at the time.... I don't do it anymore, at least I don't think). Anyways, long story short: I asked her out the day before her high school graduation and she wasn't interested (it was actually more complicated than this, but you get the idea). I know it wasn't an appropriate time to have done it, but I don't think I'll ever have the chance again.

Today, almost two years later, the thought of what could have been is still looming over my head. Don't get me wrong, I never hated her for rejecting me. In retrospect, telling her how I feel and asking her out were a means for me to find some closure--to lift some weight off my chest. And it worked.

I'm a freshman in college now, and I've become more social. However, in the middle of my first semester, I just sort of reverted back to being shy and keeping to myself because every girl I met reminded me of her. Every time I meet someone, I think about her and fantasize about things I could have done differently.

So, back to my question; how do I move on from this girl? How do I stop obsessing over what could have been, and focus in the present?

70,"I'm jealous/frusterated with two (off and on three) of my friends in my friend group. One, let's call her Carol, is my best friend and one, we'll call him Trevor, is a really good friend to me as well. The majority of my friend group are middle~lowermiddle class, but these two(and the third) are firmly upper middle class. Overall I've felt hints of jealously here and there. Trevor's parents go on a vacation for a week and leave him half a thousand dollars to get food(in a fully stocked house) and he just gets the newest gaming console instead. I had to use all of my birthday money to pay for my Cat's health care. 
Honestly Trevor is more frustrating because he does things like this. He'll ""save up"" money his parents give him and buy really expensive equipment and gadgets, he has two cars already to drive, ""let's go out again this week and I'll eat a 25 dollar meal without a second thought"" ect
Carol at least has the same mindset as me, as in she's frugal and doesn't want to spend friviously, but her parents pay for her college out of pocket/gave her a car ect. 
Still, I'm rambling
What's really bugging me is that they're in Hawaii with Trevor's family right now. Both their families regularly go on vacations. They went to the Philippians with Carol's last year. Both Carol (with Trevor's family) and Trevor (with Carol's) had to ""pay for their own ticket"" which was, literally payed for by their respective parents. We've agreed to save up to go to Japan together in 2019. Trevor already has enough, and he had a job for the summer(but I'm pretty sure he spent all of it on a Flash costume (yes) and a really high cost computer.) (Carol DOES have a regular job(a really cool one actually) so she's not really bugging me in that aspect)
But Carol's family is going to Japan the year before we're planning, (And I keep thinking ""so she's going for free a year before she pays for herself?"") 
And with them going to Hawaii for new years, I'm feeling uncomfortably jealous and petty.
I keep feeling like I want to call the trip off with them and go with other people ""new to the experience""(Trevor has also already been to Japan)
But this is stupid, Trevor is super excited about going with me(and other friends) and Carol IS literally my best friend. I don't want to feel like this! It's ugly selfish, and ungrateful of what I DO have, but I still feel this crap. How can I ease this stupid jealously?

76,"A little backstory: My sister got knocked up at 19 and the father bailed after 6 months. My manipulative narcissistic mother takes advantage of this and convinced her to move in. Soon my sister is paying all her bills all the while my mother is nagging her and calling her every name you can think of. So I transferred from Uni to my hometown’s community college and get a place with my sister so she and my nephew can get out of my moms house. 
It was really hard and sometimes I blamed her for ruining my “college experience” or whatever but I’m really glad I got those two years with her. 

So two months ago she and my nephew got into a car accident. She didn’t make it. My nephew sustained severe injuries to his brain stem and we actually just came home from the hospital about two weeks ago, a few days before his 3rd birthday. I stayed with him for the most part. The issue is custody. I have no legal rights to my nephew but my mother does.  Even though I’m the one whose been raising him for the majority of life. I tried to get him when this all happened but my mother was right there telling the social worker every reason why I shouldn’t get custody. I need to finish school and I couldn’t possibly afford a place and a baby on my own. It’s been decided for me that I needed to move back in with my mother to help her raise my nephew instead of getting him myself.  Well I’m back home and it’s a nightmare.

Every day I’m worthless and she threatens to kick me out and keep me from my nephew who is like my own child at this point, she’ll talk about my sister and try to get sympathy from me but then also try to tell me how all of her kids treated her so terribly, she’ll screech at the top of her lungs over the most minor things and if I walk out of a room I’m “hiding” so I don’t have to do work, and she’ll constantly have people over and will just always try to humiliate me like by telling them how disgusting I am by over exaggerating how dirty I leave things or telling people deeply personal things that she acts like are cute little stories but are just stories about fucking childhood abuse, she’s always borrowing money, threatening to kill herself, and she’ll randomly wake me up in the middle of the night to pick up things or get something for my nephew or my 18 year old man child brother who can’t do a damn thing for himself.

If I try to stay here I will kill myself. I can’t do it a second time. I’m not strong enough without my sister. It’s as simple as that. But how can I leave my nephew to grow up in the hell hole that I did alone?",01Jan2018,10

81,"So, I'm a 25 year old guy who recently relocated to a new state for work. I've never had trouble making friends in my hometown, or even the town in which I went to school. I'd consider myself a pretty average dude, definitely not hard to get along with or anything like that. So my only question is, how do I even go about making new friends in an equally new place? I work in R&amp;D for a motorcycle manufacturer, and find that I don't have too much in common at all with my coworker's. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as it's been getting pretty boring going to work - then exploring the town on my own.

So my dad’s birthday is on the 1st of January and we have this tradition of celebrating with his friends family and he has this friend who gives him iphone every year like 5,6,7 and now x.

Well basically my dad is 54 and he didn’t even know there was an x and he doesn’t know anything about it.

Now before he got the phone I asked him “if his friend gives him an iphone x will he give it to me” and he said “yes”.  and today he’s like “oh it’s black u don’t want black.” Me “I don’t care about the color” him “it’s black I’ll get u a gold one” Me “dad, I don’t care about the color, and buying a new one is a waste of money” him “it’s black I’ll keep it and buy u another one” me “ok keep it never-mind” him “do u simply put a sim card in it and turn it on” me “no” I closed the door and went out.

He's also keeping the previous 7 one although he could give it to my mom sicnce hers is already half dead. But no he's keeping them both.

And I'm very upset I don't even know why. I usually don't get upset about maretial things. But this time I got really upset like super upset.

I typically leave the house on Sunday for church and then once a week for shooting, I don't have any friends there. There is like one person my age I have never talked to and a couple younger kids.  I don't leave the house much. I hate it. I have never even gone on a walk on my own. 

So now my mom says we are going to have 90 days with no internet other than when we need it for school. I don't know how I will survive. I am scared it will mess me up... For almost a year I was not okay. I don't know if it counts as depression or anything but I wasn't happy. I felt worthless. I stayed up all night worrying. I felt isolated and numb. I managed to get out of that and I'm happier now but I am a little worried that if I have my one window to the outside world taken from me I'm going to fall back into that. I somewhat talked about this with her and she smiled at me and said in a fake cheery voice ""You'll be fine!"".  She doesn't seem to get it and if she does then she doesn't care. 

Maybe this sounds stupid but the internet is 95% of the interaction with people I have outside of my family. I don't like my family.  If I don't have the internet I am left with nothing but them and I don't know if I can take it.

97,"TLDR-Should I ask this girl I’ve been really into out?? 

It’s New Years, I’m feeling brave &amp; I think I’m ready to move on from the shit relationships I’ve been having. 

Problem is she’s asexual &amp; she’s mentioned to me how a lot of girls admit they’re crushing on her. But she feels so awkward about it &amp; tries to let them down gently. She says it’s weird cause she barely ever talks to them...&amp; then out of nowhere they say they’re into her. 

With us, I want to believe it’s different. We got pretty close last year, but haven’t really talked this year (both busy with school). 

REASONS WHY I THINK/HOPE SHE COULD BE INTO ME-

1. She gave me this cute ring to remember her by before we were physically separated from each other. Last time we talked, she asked me if I still had it &amp; seemed happy when I said I did. 
2. She was willing to keep her Snapchat open so that we could have a quick way of communicating...Even though she really dislikes social media &amp; has no other accounts on anything. 
3. When I told her about my graduation plans, she was excited and planned to come out &amp; party with me to celebrate (a few states away). Even though it didn’t work out, this is kinda big cause she never really does social gatherings.  She doesn’t do parties or bars or any of that. Which brings me to the next point 
4. The only time she’s ever went to a bar/party was because I asked/begged her to go with me. We even tried sneaking into a frat party together once, which is 100% not something she would ever do. 
5. We’ve done the whole laying in bed together thing...but just to talk. We never got physical...she’s not a really physical type of person, but I do know I’m one of the only people she voluntarily decided she wants to hug (I know big deal right 🙄). 
6. She used to do this cute thing where she’d grab my arm and rub it and look at me and say “wow [name] you’re so skinny” and then smile this devilish grin and say “I could just snap your arm in half if I wanted to” in a strangely sweet/protective(?) way. Tbh Idk why, but it was really cute how she reached out just to grab my arm when she almost always avoids physical contact with nearly everyone. 
7. Whenever I argue with anyone around her, she always sticks up for me.

*****And the most damning piece of evidence****

8. I jokingly mentioned to her once that I might be into trees and she said “[name] if you’re into trees then I will be your tree”. She said it in a serious tone.

REASONS SHES PROBABLY NOT INTO ME IN THAT WAY
1. She’s religious. Goes to church every Sunday.
2. She’s rejected many girls who admitted they were crushing on her.
3. She’s asexual. 

I feel like I’m being stupid &amp; these are all things that normal people do with their friends. And my mind just went and ran off with it &amp; decided it was romantic. 
Why the hell would she ever want to be in a relationship with me???


I have this nagging feeling that I should ask. I just felt a close bond with her &amp; I don’t know if I should ignore it for the sake of not looking stupid.

105,"I'm tired of my job, I've been working here for 7 months and got promoted very quickly because I was the ""favorite"", I enjoyed the first 3 months but the following months were horrible. I hated dealing with the horrible customers, the horrible coworkers, the horrible schedules, the only thing I've been staying in this job for was because of the pay, I get 60c over min. wage, which I thought was pretty good for my first job. But now it's making me wonder if the money is even worth such a horrible place. The benefits are great, as well as the pay, but as I said, we have coworkers constantly coming in late, not doing anything at when they do come in, the manager refused to fire anyone, I deal with customers who are constantly in bad moods too, getting angry and insultive over every thing, and as someone who's depressed it makes the entire day much longer and harder because customers decide to make me feel even worse for all the little things I may do wrong, the schedule has us working sometimes until closing (12) and then back in the morning at 8, and I drive half an hour to get home and it takes me a while to sleep too, and wake back up an hour and a half before my shift begins so I can get ready, it's so tiring. Sometimes I barely get 4 hours of sleep, I ask for schedule changes but there hasn't been change yet. 

I would've quit long ago already but money in my family is very tight, and me getting a job to help my parents is finally getting us back up compared to where we were before. I'm also worried that if I do quit, I may not find another job anytime soon,  compared to how fast i got this job (I applied around the 12th of May, started working the 23rd).

Am I being a downer about it and just grow up?

113,"ok so for about the last 9 years my friends and i went to the same elementary/middle school. this year is our freshman year. 7 of them went to one school, and three others (myself included) went to other schools. 

up until about last year i could say we were best of friends until things got a little fishy. i saw them and talked to them all the time at school, but when i asked for advice, or for plans, i just kept getting ignored. this felt strange because i would consider these kids my best of friends, and it was really tough to see that i kept getting ignored. this was the middle of 8th grade, and this influenced me to go to another high school, away from most of them. the 2 others that did not go with the majority are two of the most liked kids in the group, so they keep in tough with the rest. every time i try to make plans it is always ""sorry im sick"" or ""sorry my grandparents are in town"" which could be true, but very, very unlikely. whenever they say they dont have a ride, i offer to pick them up, and then they say they have plans. 

based on that, you would probably guess that they hate me, and so would i. but here is the confusing part. whenever i see them (at parties etc) they are super friendly, and they remind me of their old selves. im torn because whenever i try to flush them out of my life, they always seem to pop up again and i think im crazy for not wanting them around

122,"Long time lurker, first time poster!! Thanks in advance for anyone who has some suggestions and can point me in the right direction!! Apologies for the format since I'm on mobile, and also the rant... TL;DR at the bottom. 

So I work in a restaurant with a very low carpet, imagine like a library or a school type carpet. Every night, as a server, our sidework includes having to vacuum the carpet in our section. To give you an idea of the size of our restaurant, we have 11 full size pull tables on the carpet. The bar has hardwood and is in the middle. The shape of the carpetted section is a U but more square and it goes from the front doors all the way to back of the restaurant where the kitchen is. 

The few dilemmas with the vacuum situation are as followed

-If our section is empty; no tables are coming in, and we get cut &lt;restaurant term for not having to take more tables, just finish your sidework, and you can go home&gt;  but if it's too early in the night; we are not allowed to pull out the vacuum. There was one night where I was cut at 10:30pm, but the other servers didn't want to be responsible for vacuuming my section at the end of the night (rather large sections to have to vacuum, it takes me at least 1.5 hours to vacuum the whole pool table side of the restaurant...that's not including the dining room side) And I had to wait around until 12:30am just to vacuum so I was able to go home. I totally understand the concern from the owner, because as a guest you wouldn't want to feel like you're being pushed out or rushed so we can clean. 
-Ironically for how big and open our restaurant is the outlets are very scarce. So we have to pull out this big orange extension cord that's probably close to 50 ft long and unfortunately it tangles really easily. Even if we wind/roll it up, when you go to stretch it out to plug it in it will always get some kind of tangle in it. Therefore causing you to take even more time at the end of the night to untangle this long cord. And trust me, after working a 9-10 hour shift and getting done around 2am, we are all just exhausted and having to then untangle an extension cord is very frustrating. 
-Another issue with the extension cord and outlets is that we have to plug the cord in an outlet by the kitchen and have to stretch it all the way to the front to be able to vacuum. I'm always worried that a guest will trip over the cord or accidentally hit it and unplug it. 
-I know this may be a vacuum issue, we have Bissells and they're not bad vacuums but sometimes they just don't get all the small crumbs on the ground on the first pass. Other times it will get clogged with lint and just spit the crumbs back out, and then we have to disassemble it and pull the fuzz out. Again, very frustrating thing to do when you're already exhausted and just want to go home. If we had manual sweepers and had to go over the area an extra time or two, it wouldn't be that big of an issue. 

One thing I have recently figured out is that I can use a broom to sweep the carpet and it will get the crumbs up with ease and no need to vacuum. I definitely do that when I have time that way I only have to spot vacuum at the end of the night. The only setback with that is sometimes you can't always get the crumbs on the first pass or you the crumbs will completely miss the dust pan and go next to it, so it takes a little longer. But all the servers and I agree we would rather take the extra time to sweep the carpet than to have to drag out the extension cords. I'm just not sure how the owners would feel if we only swept the carpet at the end of the night instead of also vacuuming. 

TL;DR Sorry for the novel but I guess what I'm trying to ask is..... Are there any manual vacuums/carpet sweepers that are able to pick up tiny crumbs on an almost bare floor, just like how a broom can??? Having to lug out a 50ft extension cord at the end of a long shift is very frustrating. I've seen a lot of infomercial videos of carpet sweepers picking up cereals, broken glass, etc, and that's great and all but we are more worried about tiny crumbs. ",01Jan2018,2

Financial aid and student loans are the only thing ahead of me. 

I already postponed a college for a single semester, because I freelance online and make some money, In this time I thought that I would either be in a position to avoid college altogether or less financially burdened by college itself. This is not the case. 

The most frustrating aspect of my situation is that things have finally started happening as I hoped they would months ago, I'm attracting clientele and getting more work than before, But it's still not good, just looking better, and more hopeful.

What I wanted to go to college for is essentially what I already do, Web development and IT. In my field, however, certifications and actual experience get you as far and often farther than a degree from nearly anywhere, and in my mind, my backup plan was always to get certifications and start a 9-5 to support myself until I can do what I love. 

But the bummer is that I still live at home. My mother has a masters degree, and my father has some college but didn't finish, same for my brother. My father was bouncing between jobs until he got settled in the field I want to go into, but he's out right now on medical leave because he had another back surgery, and is disabled. He had back problems for most of my memorized life. 

My mother has MS, and has been fully disabled and paid by her previous employer since I was young. 

My Brother didn't finish college, is a few years older and still lives with us, he makes music and jumps from minimum wage jobs, and often seems unhappy.

My parents I think are motivated by avoiding a repeat of his choices, as well as them wanting a child that is conventionally successful or at least a college grad, my mother especially doesn't seem to understand that college may not have the positive outcome we want, nor that the expenses might not be worth it when I have alternatives. 

I have my experience as a web designer, as well as a future in it, as well as the fact that I want to get an A+ and CCNA and enter the field and do web design on the side.

My Parents again ( my mother especially) have said that that they only offered me stay here under the condition that I go to school. I don't honestly think they will kick me out, especially without trying to come back and give them what they want. And with my older brother still living here as I described, I don't expect it for that reason as well. 

I honestly don't want to disappoint them at all, but their disappointment is not more important to me then my happiness and lack of student debt. I also don't find it shameful to go to college later in life if things aren't working.

What Should I do? how can I convince them to let me stay while I do those things and not go to college? Neither I nor my brother pays rent, but what if I offered that?

also accepting advice on related career choices. rather, I'd love some of that.

130,"Sorry if this seems like I’m rambling, I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. I wasn’t sure where to go. I need to vent and r/rant doesn’t suit me currently. Go ahead and ask questions and make criticisms, it’s Reddit, you’ll do it either way.

I’m 16m currently in my junior year of high school. I get decent grades, and play video games to both escape stress and to add interesting things to my life. And I know, “blah blah blah first world problems, privileged military brat blah blah blah”. But my escapes, my distractions from my stress and what not, have stopped working. Not in a literal sense, they physically work, they just aren’t doing what they used to for me. I can’t escape.

Life feels monotonous. Constantly. Every day it’s the same. Go to school, go to practice, go home, do homework, eat dinner, games until I go to sleep. Every single day. The weekends are the only different by the fact that I just play games being there is no school them.

I have people I play with, friends from my school and other places I’ve lived, in a military brat. But I want something else. Nothing makes me happy anymore, I get a bit here and there doing things with friends in person. But nothing allows me to escape from anything anymore.

I feel tired all the time. I fake emotions around people as to not draw attention. I lie and say I had a good day to keep family off me. Alone I feel nothing, like a hollow shell of what I could be, or couldn’t be. I feel like a robot living out my life. There is no deviation, no spice, nothing. Helping people has become a chore. I want to break down, but I can’t. My body won’t let me. I’m tired of wearing a mask of sanity, I want to change I want the color to come back to my life. I don’t feel alive anymore.  Physically tired of acting happy. Happy things aren’t happy, sad things aren’t sad, things that usually make me angry don’t. I’ve stopped fearing death at this point. And before you ask, no I’m not suicidal. I feel it’s just as pointless, it would cause more pain to others than I am feeling currently.

I want to disappear, go somewhere new. Go somewhere fresh. Where the food has flavor and taste, and the people have culture, and the sights are something to behold. Where I don’t have to act happy.

I just don’t know what to do anymore, nothing is worth it. I don’t want to be here anymore.",01Jan2018,14

I love her but I can’t stand the things she does. It would take me forever to explain in detail but in short she is just so possessive and she’s always in a shit mood. Depressed all the time. I mean we still have fun, honestly I don’t know. We’ve both been talking about breaking up but just haven’t. Well tonight I had sex with someone else at a New Year’s Eve party which number one I feel terrible about. 2 this chick has a boyfriend. So I feel really shitty about it because I 100% new about it.

Obviously I need to break up with my current girlfriend cause I cheated on her and honestly it was long over due... but like... I’m a cheater now... I’m one of the mother fuckers that I HATED.

144,"TLDR; Torn between living somewhere I love now and moving home to a major metropolitan city that I just happen to not like that much in order to be closer to aging parents.


I grew up in Miami - earned all my degrees through a PhD at FIU (state university there). My family (an aunt, three siblings, niece, and parents) lives there. Eight years ago I was transferred to Austin, Texas for a temporary work assignment. After a couple years, I chose to buy a house and stay a while. I've totally blossomed there. I love it, I have great social connections, and I'm a community leader now doing very fulfilling things. It feels like home and I am so self actualized.


The thing is... I cannot bear to not be a significant part of my parents' lives. They are aging and I know the time is slipping away. I go home to Miami every six weeks for a few days, and even at that I feel like I miss a lot and am not helping them much. Even the every six weeks takes its toll on my life in Austin though.


For various reasons, I do not like Miami. Weather, bad drivers, I find dating there to be tough, etc. Whereas I love Austin. I would rarely come back to Miami if not for my parents.


The thing is... my old university has asked me to apply for a job in Miami. I've had trouble working in my PhD field, and I'm actually not thrilled with my current job in another field. This would be a chance to at least break in to my field. To be clear, though, I would not leave Austin for this if it was any city but Miami - the opportunity is not THAT good.


So, torn... Do I stay in Austin and just keep doing this every six-week plod home? Or try to force myself to separate a bit more from Miami? Or do I say ""Eff it, there's a career opportunity and Miami is a major global city with your parents there and in eight years you've never stayed away - learn to like it and leave Austin behind""?


Partly asking for advice because there is a blossoming love interest in Austin and I know at this juncture he cannot influence my decisions.",01Jan2018,1

Whenever he accuses me of being that way my mother will not speak to me at all. At this point it isn’t up for debate that she loves him more than me.

163,"For years I was friends with, let’s call him Andy. Very good friends, but I always had an inkling he had feelings for me which he eventually told me, and I promptly friend zoned him even though I knew deep down I did care for him more than a friend.

Fast forward to last year, Andy had moved away and started uni, in a very prestigious university.

Last Christmas, me and Andy went for drinks when he came back home. I suddenly realised how much I did care for him. The night resulted in us kissing, and telling each other how we felt. That night he also told me some very sad news, his mum had cancer.

My heart was honestly breaking for him, he had a lot on his plate. Going to a very stressful uni far away, his mum. We began dating and I tried to support him the best I could. I was very cautious about dating him under such circumstances but I do feel, that our relationship wasn’t based on him just needing a shoulder to cry on. We had a lot of love for each other prior to this.

He went back to uni, and our realtionship became long distance. I could see he wasn’t coping well, but he shut himself off from me.

A few months into seeing me he phones me up and breaks it off, saying he’s too depressed etc We were both crying and promised to remain friends. I was absolutely shattered.

I tried to remain his friend but I wasn’t coping very well, and I cut him out for a bit. When we did eventually reconcile this summer, he had some really awful news, his mum had passed away a week prior.

I felt physically sick, I realised how much I still loved him because I was so upset for him. Not that his mum dying is about me, my emotions, but all I wanted to do was comfort him. I realised from that moment I needed to be his friend again, properly.

It was all very well and good me having all this love for him, but the last thing he needed at that time is me crying to him about how much I loved him.

We saw each other a few times over summer, I was pretty certain my feelings for him weren’t one sided, but I just wasn’t going to bring it up so soon after his mum. 

I went to uni in September, he went back to his uni. I made sure I kept in good contact, checking how he was, letting him now I’m always here for him etc. He wasn’t doing too well, naturally. Still we spoke weekly. 

At the start of December, I’m speaking to him, asking how he’s doing and out of the blue he tells me “not very well tbh, I’ve been seeing someone this term and they’ve cheated on me”. I did the motions of oh no, that’s so terrible, what a bitch etc. But I was actually really upset, why hadn’t he told me when we’d been speaking regularly? It just all seemed very strange. I wouldn’t of spoke to him so regularly if I had have known, I wouldn’t want to step on anyone’s toes. 

I got drunk on boxing night and brought it up over text (classy). He admitted he hadn’t told me because he still had feelings for me, and didn’t want to deal with the awkwardness. 

Anyway a few days ago we went for a few drinks, got chatting about this girl, to which he made it really clear to me he was more seeing her because he was in a vulnerable place, it was more he needed somones shoulder to cry on, didn’t love her. 

On top of all this he comes out to me that he’s non binary. (He’s ok with the pronoun he). Which I didn’t really see coming, but it doesn’t change my feelings towards him. Just adds a bit more complexity to everything. I am a bit shocked, but yeah I support him throughly. 

He’s hopefully coming to visit me when I go back to uni next weekend. I’m going to teach him how to do makeup properly and give him some good makeup (cause I have wayyy too much). 

If he does come to stay in my flat with me, I think I’m going to have to tell him how I feel. I can’t keep going on like this. But I feel incredibly selfish putting it on him because I don’t want him to feel burdened. I wholeheartedly adore him and just want to be there for him, and support him. I want him to know that he’s loved in a no pressure kinda way. I feel ill and heartbroken, no idea what to do. If they don’t come and visit, should I still tell them? Should I tell them at all?

It’s actually very frustrating to not be able to breath right but I haven’t been to check it out because I’m afraid of the cost and what they’ll tell me.

165,"I have a diagnosis of bipolar and generalized anxiety. I have been unmedicated most of my life, and every time I have been medicated, I usually do very poorly, and blow things up worse than normal.

My bipolar and anxiety are things that do hinder me from living a fully functional, healthy life, but not severely. I try to keep a very solid grip on it.

One of the areas it messes with are my relationships, but ultimately, my relationships are fraught with actual issues, and apparently my choice of man sucks, because they never seem willing to confront an issue or admit to fault. I can be a handful, but my massive depressive issues are largely kick started by actual, already existant issues, though it takes me a while to fully understand what they really are. My emotions become all embodying and the relationship blows up, and gen I can see it for what it was. 

I am scared to get on a medicine and depend on it. I am scared of having a large upheaval in life to where it makes me lose my medication. I want to be able to navigate through my issues with an unmedicated mind, and am considering looking into CBT and DBT for myself. 

I can't afford an actual therapist, there are only ""counselors"" around where I live, and I can't really afford one of them anyways.

173,"I am the biggest asshole probably on this planet. I hate myself, I can’t believe I would actually do something like this. 

I’m a single parent of a 2 year old child, his father was never involved so it’s just been the two of us. In late August my grandparents surprised me with an all expenses paid vacation in December as a break for all that I do for my son and my family.

The vacation was fairly fun, and I was truly having a great time. On the second to last day I met this nice guy while I was out and about. We hung out and had a good time, we ended up making out which led to us exchanging numbers after wards. We texted for a while that night and he told me that when my plane takes off to home, we won’t talk anymore and he will be part of my vacation.

Because of this, I didn’t tell him about my son because I don’t see fit to share information about my children to someone I don’t really know. Unfortunately, that is not what happened. He kept initiating conversation and we talk everyday and have for a month, and I still have not told him. 

I’ve been dealing with serious depression and haven’t told anyone because of fear they will judge me for being depressed as a single parent. I told him my feelings and he has been a savior, he’s helped me everyday to heal and recover from my depression. Though, he does not know I have a son. 

I feel that I’ve gone to far in that if I told him he would be so upset. He trusts me, and I’ve been 100% honest about my life and completely open. Though we’ve only had a friendship type of relationship, it is very open and close. Though, I am beginning to think we both want more than that.

My coworkers and even my boss are all really nice people that value my opinion, the pay isn't bad to start, and I get to be in a mentoring program to start, where I constantly have support and advice from others, and get a slow ramp up in number of patients. But I've only been working here two months, and I feel like I spend every weekend stressing and feeling anxious about another week. I'm constantly stressed and on edge, I get mad about little things (like my cat under my feet every morning), I take my anger out on my SO and it's affecting our relationship, and when I'm driving between clients, I constantly think about crashing my car so I could have an excuse not to go. The job isn't what I thought it would be. I essentially work alone with phone contact with coworkers, I'm constantly driving far between people and driving gives me anxiety, my clients have no respect for me or my time despite my education, I constantly feel lonely, and I'm working 9-10 hours most days just to meet quota. The pay doesn't feel worth it. I come home late and spend the remainder of my day documenting what I did (unpaid work), then go to bed.

In 2015 my father was diagnosed with stage IV brain cancer and posteriorly with severe dementia, so me and my family (mother and little brother) have to spend a lot with him and take care of him. 

As an anesthesiologist he built a fortune but no one never knew how to deal with money, so in 2017 while I was in my last year of high school I started studying everything about money. Countless books and hours after I developed a passion for dealing with money, business in general and especially the stock market. I do not want to live in Brazil, but sometimes I feel like I'm trapped here forever. My mother does not let me follow my dreams and ambitions, she wants me to go to either law or med school in Brazil and will not accept anything else. I always loved medicine but it is not compatible with my life goals, as it is very hard to move and work in another country as a doctor graduated in my country. I think I'd to go to New York, although I'm not sure if I could afford it right now. I want to pursue my ambitions and build the life I want. I don't want to leave my family behind but I find it really selfish that my mother does not give me the freedom to do anything else other than studying for the Enem (like the SAT's) and going to med school.

The sad reality is I justified my verbal assaults as reactionary and only done out of me being hurt from a previous comment of there's.  

I lost everything, including my 14 year marriage which ended in divorce and visitation with my three kids and still it didn't click for me.  I even read a GAL report detailing my daughters fear and responded with disdain because I've never hit my kids.

188,"I'm currently a college senior in Bulgaria. I'm planning to get a master's degree in the near future, and I want to do so in a (hopefully) good university in the United States. However, the degree is pretty pricey, and I'd only have a handful of classes every week, so that opens an opportunity to get a job in the industry while studying. Actually, let me rephrase: I need to have a job as a developer in order to pay for the degree and afford food. However, it sounds super difficult to both find a good job and get admitted in a good program at the same time, in the same city. So that leaves me with 2 options:

Option 1: I focus on finding a university, since that's more difficult, plus it takes way longer, has deadlines, etc. Then, when admitted somewhere, I start looking for a job, plus I'll have a visa that allows me to work (I believe). But if I fail to find a job I wouldn't be able to pay for my classes.

Option 2: I focus on finding a job, applying to jobs in cities that have good master's programs, and then apply to a university. But I risk not being admitted there (since I only have one choice), and I have to apply elsewhere. And I also need visa sponsorship in order to start working in the first place, which only so many employers are willing to do.

193,"Not sure where to start, so I'll just list off the things I'm involved with. I'm a college student. I take four classes, am on a club sports team, volunteer in a research lab 10 hours a week, and am a member of a student organization that works at a hospital for 3 hours a week (unpaid). I'm also on a club sports team that practice s Monday and Wednesday 8-9:30 PM and Saturday 11:30 AM-1 PM. On Sundays I work at a nursing home from 8 AM - 4:30 PM.  

Method to my madness: I need the research experience because I want to apply to PhD programs. You need to a be a published researcher to even be considered for these programs. Next semester I can be paid for my research, just not yet. I work at the hospital because it guarantees free student housing over the summer, and I can't afford to pay Boston rent prices, nor do I want to go home to my boring suburban town with 0 job opportunities. I'm on the club sports team because well, it's fun, and I need exercise.  

My dilemma is that I need more money, and the only time I can really work is after 5 PM on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, or before 9 AM on weekdays. Last year I worked as a babysitter from 7:00 AM-9 AM but that family no longer needs me and the only offer I have is 5:30 AM-7:30 AM three days a week. I know I can and probably should take that position but Boston is having it's coldest winter yet and the idea of waiting for the bus and then a 15 minute walk in these brittle temperatures (plus being sleep deprived) just kinda sucks. 

I feel like I'm doing things wrong. My parents don't give me any money. I need to work a lot to be able to buy groceries, clothes, go on spring break (it's frustrating because all my friends' parents just pay for them...). I applied to an online website where I can tutor english for money, but I've heard they take a while to get back to you. Advice please!! Should I quit something? 

Without another job, I'd only be bringing in $116/week from the nursing home. That is not a lot given that I need to pay 20/week for public transport pass, buy groceries, and monthly cost of utilities, and try to have fun on the weekends. ",01Jan2018,1

We met through mutual best friends and I can't say that I've ever been in a better, healthy relationship.

His family is also very open to me. I told my mom a couple weeks ago after chickening out for 5 months and she reacted very well!

198,"Keep in mind while reading this that I'm not 6, I'll be 17 next month.

First of all, I have a bedtime at 9:00, and get tucked in. There is no arguing it. The only way she'll let me stay up is if I tell her I'm doing homework. On weekends and breaks, our bedtime is midnight. No matter when we wake up. During Christmas break, I would wake up at around two or three. Then, I would still have to go to bed at midnight. That means I was only awake for 9 or ten hours a day. She was literally shaving hours off of my life.

Second, my mom will randomly ask if my brother (he's 14) and I are hungry throughout the day. If we say no, she'll say okay, and then start cooking anyways. Then she complains the we never eat when she cooks. If we say yes, it seems like she takes her sweet time with it. I'll go to the kitchen 20 minutes later and ask if the food is ready, and she'll be in her room on the computer. The food isn't even started. Then she'll tell me to make myself something to eat. You couldn't have told me that 20 minutes ago when I said I was hungry instead of saying you would start cooking?

Next, I'm not allowed to go outside when it's dark. The other day I was trying to drive to the store that was ONE MILE away from our house to get some popcorn. It was only 8:00, and we're on winter break so we can ""stay up"" until midnight. My mom said I can't go because it's dark outside. Even though I've already driven in the dark for 10 hours in order to get my license. Since it's only a mile away, I asked if I could walk. She said no because it's dark outside. 

Like I said earlier, I'll be 17 next month. However, I'm not allowed to watch rated R movies, and my mom doesn't even like me to watch Rick and Morty, which is TV-14 and sometimes TV-MA. MA as in you need to be 17 to watch it. She also doesn't like me to listen to or watch anything with swears in it. If I'm watching something and she hears a swear, she asks me what I'm watching. If she hears one or two more, she tells me to watch something else. Also in this same category, I'm not allowed to play rated M games.

She also constantly complains about how ""filthy"" my room is. I'm not allowed to have anything on the ground. If I do she complains. I'm not allowed to have anything under my bed. If I do she complains. If she doesn't like the way I have something, she'll move it or re-organise it.

199,"So I went to a New Years house party last night and I got very drunk. By about 3 in the morning (according to my friends) I could barely stand and was slurring very badly. Now, my friends boyfriend was there and was being flirty all night and we usually get along very well. He was also pretty drunk, but not as bad as me at all. 

I don't remember any of this but according to my friends, he took me up to bed at about 4 and said that he was gonna sleep on the bed on the floor. However, I don't remember anything and I'm pretty sure I was passed out in the bed, but the only thing I remember is waking up for 5 seconds and he was on top of me and I'm sure he tried saying something, but then I think I went back to 'sleep'. The next day my sister showed me a picture of him topless (maybe pantless?) in bed next to me, which I didn't remember. I'm also pretty sure I woke up and had no pants on, but I definitely went to bed wearing them. I was also bleeding slightly when I went to the toilet, which is unusual. 

I am now feeling incredibly guilty since it's my friends boyfriend, but I genuinely don't remember anything except the five seconds I described. However, I'm worried that I didn't say 'no' since I was drunk, and therefore that I consented.

200,"So, I belong to a ""lodge"" in my town. It's basically a bar (although they do community service and darts). I go there with my SO, have a few beers, and leave. No biggie, but...

Several years ago I was there with a friend, who kept buying me (and her) shots. I don't drink that way, so I was pretty darn tipsy. An argument arose ... about my friend -- I wasn't the instigator -- and, thanks to my blood-alcohol level at that time, I fought back verbally. A woman who frequents the lodge started chiming in, although she had nothing to do with the initial argument. This woman, I'll call her ""W,"" was toxic; she'd been aggressively intrusive with other friends, and had created a clique that was tearing at the lodge's social cohesiveness. When she starting chiming in to me, I let her have it, verbally. Problem is, I have absolutely no idea what I said.

Apparently I must've struck some chords with ""W."" 

At the time, some lodge members suggested that I apologize to ""W."" This was about 3-4 years ago. I see no reason to apologize. However, ""W"" continues to plague me. We watch each other the way a couple of cats do, just before a fight. 

I know too many things about ""W"" to want to be friendly with her. I go there with my SO once or twice a week to socialize, and ""W"" is almost always there as well. She ""holds court"" there, and many members circle around her. *She's the queen bee*. And there I sit, carefully ignoring her, feeling miserable.

I've been a member of this lodge for ten years. There are quite a few people I really enjoy there. But this ""W"" situation has got me stumped. It truly bothers me. She can be charming. She drinks heavily. And she bugs the crap out of me.

207,"I'll try to keep it short here and although the solution is fairly simple there are other issues too which I'm seeking solutions for. So, me and this girl hit it off 6 years ago, initially she was not serious and was two timing me(she still denies it) and later said she stopped talking to the other guy after a huge fight only for me to find that she had not. So I broke it off and being the emotionally unstable person I am got back after 4 months. She swore she had stopped talking to that guy. 

We fought a lot mainly because I could never trust her again and it would end up with her trying to prove that she was not talking to that same guy. But I never felt like she was really into me. All I ever wanted was for her to come clean but that never happened and in retrospect, I feel guilty for wasting both our time by getting back. We finally ended it 3 years back and since have been close friends since I was the only one with whom she was open about her life(family issues, financial problems,etc) and it was the same for me. We used to flirt, talk dirty,etc. Even the friend ship was on off. We would have fights and there were times when I was taken completely for granted and after a point I'd decide that I had had enough and would stop talking only to start a few months later.

So for the issue now is, after her nth time of telling me that we should cut off ties because we have a lot of misunderstanding and my inability to forget the past(which I accept is wrong and promised I won't bring it up), she decided to stay in touch. Here is what I don't get. She would say she wanted to cut all contact but then would talk nicely and then would bring up the topic of cutting ties later the next day again. That went on for 3 days. Then a guy in here church starts showing a lot of interest in her. I can see her attitude towards me change like I mean nothing but she says it irritates her when I tell her that. I knew she was interested in him since a long time though she wouldn't accept. She then sends me screenshots of a few chats with him and asks me what I think. I saw that the interest she showed in him was nothing like what she had towards me. I have also noticed that she always behaved differently with me and everyone else she knew(me being taken for granted). So the past week, all our calls and chats have been about that guy and I politely told her I am not comfortable with it but to no avail. She then told me today she expected I would be of some help to which I did not know how to respond. This is at a time when I am grappling with unemployment and a shitty time in my life. My circle consists of 2-3 people and she is one of them.

Should I help? Should I stay in touch? I just think that I would be called extremely soft and jealous if I leave. What should I do?

Outside of the video game world, I'm perfectly normal (to the best of my knowledge) and don't have a problem with anyone of any race, preferential status, etc. 

I have vowed to cut back on video games, but I feel this is not enough. Like any normal person (hopefully), I get the occasional rude (non-violent, albeit) thought and promptly silence myself. How might I go abouts bettering myself, and making these tendencies fade? Also, if not too rapacious to ask in the same thread, how might I be more accepting of those better than me? Rather than greet a challenge with anger that it is even challenging, I would love to be able to accept it. ",01Jan2018,2

215,"Hey everyone,  

I'm a recent grad (M 23) who just took a job which required me to move to a new city.  Fortunately, my mom lives here so I moved in with her until I can find a place to live.  Unfortunately, this has caused me to become very depressed as my current living situation is frankly very boring.  I'm finding it extremely hard to motivate myself to do anything other than sit on the couch and watch Netflix.  Even ironing my shirts today was a chore that seemed to take every bit of my willpower to accomplish.  

This isn't who I am.  Before moving, I was very outgoing and was always out doing fun things.  I had a good close group of friends and we played bored games regularly, but now I have nothing to look forward to.  The highlight of my life is going to work so I can throw myself into it, but when my co-workers ask how I'm doing outside of work, I have to lie or say something very generic and then flip the question onto them.  

I also believe that I am experiencing some sort of an existential crisis.  I'm a music producer/musician, or at least I have been my entire life.  I convinced myself that that was what I wanted to do with my life/dreams, but the first CD I released failed, and I haven't done much since.  I've been trying to get better at electronic music, but I don't have the discipline to practice for hours a day like those successful in the industry.  If I'm not willing/incapable of putting in the time, then do I really love it? Or do I just enjoy the fantasy of making music people will love, so that they love me?  If I don't truly love music as a passion, then what do I love and how do I find that?  

I hope my post makes sense for the most part.  I really don't have anyone to talk to about any of this.  I know that soon things will get better, but I still have about another month before I can get moved into a place I can call my own, and I don't know how much more I can take before I have a total meltdown.

216,"Some background, I'm 27 and my parents divorced months after I left for college at 18. It was messy, and he immediately married a woman that he was cheating on my mother with. I was manipulated into seeing him as a victim that was in love... sick situation looking back on it. He is still married to this woman and lives on the other side of the country way off of the US mainland. I haven't seen him since the year after the divorce. He was my best friend growing up, and my relationship with my mom was an absolute nightmare back when I was a teenager. Back then my dad and I seemed to have an ""us against everything"" sort of thing and my mom felt very left out by it which made everything worse. When he divorced her, he essentially left us together to figure it out and basically told me to just ""use her"" for financial gain as if I could do that without being racked with guilt. It was horrible and I could never do that- my mom continued supporting me out of sheer parental responsibility and it was a totally selfless act that I will never feel like I deserved. 

&amp;nbsp;
My mom and I have a great relationship now and have been upfront with every detail of what went on throughout our lives. No secrets, just two humans. However, my dad has just become more distant with the years and barely speaks to me anymore. I stood by him and defended him throughout the divorce- every little thing he did, I had his back because I loved him and wanted him to be the ""good guy"" running away from my ""crazy"" mom. I still love him. He lives so far away that I can't afford to fly out to visit him on my own and despite making plenty of money he always dodges the question if I ask him to split the multi-thousand dollar round trip flight cost. The only reason I can afford to visit my mom in a slightly closer city is because she pays for my holiday flights- I'm a freelancer and simply don't make enough to travel for leisure most of the time. He refuses to visit me because he claims to hate the city I live in and ""will never go there"". There are always new reasons- mostly to do with blacks and liberals being a large chunk of our population (I know how charming he sounds. I swear he's not a complete asshole... just a bit of a bigot and very right wing.)

&amp;nbsp;
Something strange to note is that in the last 9 years, he's moved four or five times. He's on his third wife (my mom was his second), and he works two jobs currently with countless different occupations in his past. Marine (vietnam vet), Ex-LAPD, Pilot, Illustrator, Scuba instructor, copy editor, real estate agent, security guard... I'm probably leaving something out. Constantly getting certified to do different jobs and doesn't seem to ever be satisfied. He's 69, his wife is 20 years his junior.

228,"So I purchased a training package from a personal trainer for twelve weeks of workouts and a meal plan for $50 dollars. That was fine. The workouts were great, the meal plan was something I could work with, and it actually helped me lose a little weight. When I bought it, he informed me it was a one time purchase and that if I liked it, I could purchase it again for another $50. 

After the twelve weeks were up, I thought that was it, and I went on my merry way. However, a few days later I checked my bank statements and saw that the trainer had taken another $50 out of my account via PayPal. The statement said it was an automatic recurring payment for every twelve weeks. 

Now I was NEVER informed there would be a recurring payment, and as I said I was told it was a one time purchase. So I contacted the trainer and sent this message:

“Hi. 

You have taken $50 out of my paypal account for a recurring purchase of what I am assuming is your fitness program. 

I bought that with the information that it would be a ONE TIME thing. I enjoyed it, I felt great after, but I am NOT planning on doing it again. I was also NEVER told that it would be a recurring payment.  

Please reimburse me the $50 dollars immediately. I would also like to unsubscribe from your workout plan.” 

He replied almost immediately and told me he would reimburse me and that it would take 3-5 days because PayPal would send it as an echeck (?). Three to five days later, nothing. I contacted him several times over the last month and he hasn’t answered me. 

I really don’t know what to do. Is it too late to refute it through PayPal, or my bank? I know it might seem like a lot for $50 dollars, but I don’t make a lot of money and I have bills to pay and 50 bucks makes a lot of difference. Some advice would be great thanks. ",01Jan2018,4

230,"I really don't know what to do. To tell the whole story would take pages and pages. Let me just say this: My fiancee and I have been together for over four years now. I love her and we've had our ups and downs. We've had our fights (shouting, never physical.) We both struggle with mental health but she's gotten help and seems to be doing much better, even through crisis after crisis that would have destroyed her before. I don't have the same luck but I've promised her to get help, too. Our relationship has gone from night to day ever since she got help. She is nothing but a support, emotionally, physically, financially, and she's always there for me whatever I need.

We were planning on moving in with my mom after my mom had major cancer surgery, could have died at several points from complications, but now she's home after three months in the hospital. Things were okay for a week and a half with us under one roof in close quarters. Then my mom started nitpicking about my fiancee being controlling, my fiancee buying generic-brand groceries to save money when my mom only wants name brands, and her ""Ms. Perfect"" attitude. My fiancee has cooked, cleaned, done laundry, fed cats and changed litter, and run all of our errands. I've been here to take care of my mom's tube feeding, administer meds, help her in and out of the bathroom and shower, and work from home when I have work available.

Things exploded two days ago and my fiancee cried from how mean my mom was being to her. We got some uneasy sleep that night. Yesterday morning, my mom (very angrily) tried to apologize to both of us for how she acted. I thanked her for saying that. My fiancee was unable to respond because she has a history of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of parental figures (parents and step parents) and I explained to my mom that she just needed some time.

That wasn't good enough and my mom started getting angry about the silent treatment. When my fiancee went to shower, my mom told me loudly, ""I apologized for what I did wrong but I don't kiss any ass."" My mom accused my fiancee of being a drama queen for not accepting her apology and moving past it. My fiancee and I agreed it would be best if my fiancee moved back to our packed-up house 2.5 hours away and if we decided to rethink our move to be closer to my mom. Not once did my fiancee say anything mean to my mom, even when my mom was shouting at her. Before my fiancee left, my mom was using her walker to get into the kitchen, accidentally ran into the back of my fiancee's leg, and loudly and angrily said ""Sorry! Excuse me!""

Now that the dust has settled, my mom insists that my fiancee is being manipulative. My mom insists she didn't ram my fiancee on purpose. My fiancee initially told me that it made her feel uncomfortable to be around my mom. I told her that she didn't do it on purpose, and my fiancee believes us that she didn't, but my fiancee still doesn't feel comfortable being under the same roof right now, at least living here and laying her head here.

Now my mom is saying, ""Don't you see it?! She's changing her story around to manipulate you! To turn you against me! First she thought I did it on purpose, and now she doesn't?"" And my mom said she'll never forget that I didn't defend her by saying, ""That was an accident. My mom would never do that on purpose."" My mom is livid that I didn't defend her.

Now I really don't know who to believe. My mom is trying to compromise by saying, ""I just want you to be happy. If you'll be happy with her, then be with her. But I see her for what she is."" I don't think my fiancee is being manipulative. But I feel like at least one of them is manipulating me. And I've been in an abusive relationship before, and my relationship with my fiancee is the farthest thing from that. We have open and honest conversations about our emotions, we lean on each other, we solve problems together.

I've never known my mom to be a manipulator, but I can't help but feel that one of them is manipulating me, and now I really don't know who to believe. But I feel like a manipulator wouldn't have gone to the ends of the earth for her partner and his mother the way she did, even at the expense of her own mental, physical, and financial health.

My fiancee and I have tentatively agreed to stay where we are, she's going to re-apply for jobs in the area, and I'm going to work from home until my mom is well enough to be independent and then move back to my fiancee. Which my mom also insists is ""her (my fiancee's) plan all along.""

What do I do?",01Jan2018,1
231,"Hi all, please be gentle with me here because my head's in a bit of a spin over this:

I've been living in Hungary for a while now and I recently heard from a friend that it's not unusual at all here for a girl who's 15, 16, maybe even 14, to date or have sex with someone in their mid 20s. I confirmed this with two friends from rural Hungary, and one from Budapest, all who are girls, and all who don't see any issue with it.

It's got me in a bit of a tailspin, and currently making me feel really, really uncomfortable in my own skin. My friends' opinions here about it is that it's fine if the parents know about it, and the people involved are good people. They all can recall examples of being in healthy relationships at those lower ages with someone much older.

I think this is really idealistic/optimistic -- such an age gap allows for a huge imbalance of power, and people often aren't as wholesome, especially when it comes to predating young girls. Another thing is that I think this being considered OK opens the door to abuse. One of my friends told me recently that they overheard in public someone who looked to be a young teenager bemoaning to her grandparents that her teacher was texting her suggestive messages out of school time, saying that he missed her etc.

This whole thing just boggles my mind and, to me, sounds like people are saying it's fine to have sex with children, aka, pedophilia, as long as they consent. Which leads to the debate of ""can they even consent."" The US &amp; UK says no. Apparently Hungary says yes? The age of consent here is 14 apparently

I've been trying to put this into perspective and not let it make me feel ill and completely turned off living here, and I know I have to respect that other cultures have different ways of doing things. But I don't know where to draw the line? Some cultures espouse female genital mutilation, bride kidnapping, or bacha bazi, and I don't think they should be excused? When does it stop being a matter of cultural differences and just become wrong?

Also, my friends who have been the younger parties in these relationships don't think there's anything wrong with it, and they're mid 20s. Who am I with my Western values to come over here and tell a totally different culture what's what, when people who'd be considered the 'victims' think it's a non-issue?

It's crazy because I've always heard the term culture shock and never actually experienced it in its entirety until now. Every now and again I'll come across a post where someone's talking about a 15 -- 21 age gap or posting a screenshot, and everyone will say it's awful and pedophilia, and it'll remind me of this and set this huge philosophical debate off in my head. Sometimes I walk down the road and see someone young and it makes me cringe and think where do people draw the line in saying who's fair game for sex?

I'm even considering leaving. It's so sad. Has anyone else dealt with anything similar? Or does anyone have any advice. I feel like I could cry just writing this. Thanks in advance to anyone who can reply.

Not the best retirement plan out there, but at least a start.  I get a 15 cent raise every 6 months, paid time off about 1 ½ each month I work, if I save it up/don't use it, I'll get about 8-10 days of paid vacation time and can save up about 50 hours worth before it won't accumulate any more.  I do have pretty decent job stability, and my job as of this moment, only requires a yearly background check, an HS diploma, 12 hours of paid continuing education a year and a food handlers card.  If I do lose my position for some reason, (company closes/layoffs) I don't think I'll have much trouble finding a similar position in my area with similar hours/pay, though I might have to take a pay cut down to $12 or $13/hour.

I am honestly not very good at math, science or computer programming.  I try, and try and try again.  I just...I can manage our finances.  I do really well at that.  I can handle everyday banking, grocery shopping etc but Algebra?  The math I would have to know to get into computer programming/computer science or any other STEM-based major?  I just..I can't.  My brain...just...can't.  Even if your the best teacher in the universe with the patience of a Saint, give me a trig or Pre Cal or even Algebra 2 textbook and my brain goes stupid.  Give me anything from Humanities/the Arts, I will barely try and shit out a golden goose every time.  

A Bachelors in General Studies is what I want to do, but I feel like I'm wasting my time and money if I don't get a more “useful” degree like something in the STEM field.  I want a Bachelors Degree for the sole purpose of saying I have one.  I do love learning about everything.  IF I was to choose a major other than General Studies, it would probably be in Psychology-something I'm interested in learning about and would enjoy, but seemingly just as “useless” as a major in General Strides.

239,"In September my Mom moved to Virginia and left my brother with nowhere to live. I was living with my alcoholic and abusive father at the time and was eager to leave. We found a house for $1,000 a month, under the rule that it had to have a garage because my brother is a mechanic, and my Mom paid half the rent since she left him with nowhere to live at only 18 without a full time job. 

This came down to me being the HOH more or less, my responsibilities being paying the rent and the utilities. I simply collect the money from my brother and pay the bills. Simple. 

Except it’s not. My brother refuses to give me his fair share. And when he does it’s a quarter of what it should be, or just enough for his portion of rent and nothing for utilities. We make the same amount of money, he should pay the same as I do, but instead I am stuck with all the utilities. 

This also includes my brother constantly bitching to my Mom that there is not enough food in the house, that I am never home, and that when I am my boyfriend is with me and he doesn’t like him because he doesn’t “talk”.  Paying all of the utilities (around $200 a month) and rent, and all of my other personal bills, I am left with not even enough money to fill my gas tank. 

I am at the point where I am done with this situation. It turned personal when my brother started picking at my boyfriend that he didn’t like him. Now my Mom is saying I need to pay and that my brother doesn’t have to, or he only has to pay for his portion of the rent.

242,"This has been weighing on me increasingly as I've gotten older and matured. I don't know what to do about it or even if I should do anything about it. Not really sure where I stand at this point and I guess I'm looking for outside perspective. This will be long and maybe difficult to follow, some of it might seem irrelevant to the story, but it's all tied together for me, so I'll try to make sense of it to the best of my ability.

So my dad married my step mom when I was 5. She had a son (my step brother) who was about 9 (we'll call him Adam) and together my dad and step mom had a son (John), my half brother, when I was about 10. 

I was really close with my little brother growing up. I did a lot of babysitting and spent most of my time after school and on weekends playing with him, something my step mom made me do back then, but that I'm glad I did now. When my dad and my step mom split up when I was around 17, he technically lived with his mom, but spent the majority of the weekends and every summer at my dads house.

I had issues with my older step brother and his friends. He ran with a really close knit group of friends throughout high school. We had a den that was fairly closed off from the rest of our house. They would have parties down there on weekends while my parents slept upstairs. My step mom knew there was alcohol involved, but my dad is probably the most oblivious person alive. Starting when I was about 13 or 14 I would beg to hang out with them in the den and get really drunk and do things that I'm so embarrassed about now. My step mom heard rumors about things that had happened, but the parties never stopped and life went on like that for a couple years or so. 

A few things happened during that time. My brother and his friends did things like attach mirrors to their shoes to look up my skirt or shorts whenever they were at our house. I was in the bath one day when a few of them busted in and recorded me. I was crying and covering myself, yelling at them to get out, so there wasn't anything sexual about the video, it was just embarrassing. The recording was passed around certain circles in school until a counselor found out about it and shut it down. They would do things like pretend to hug me, but pull my dress up from behind and flash everyone my underwear while I struggled to free myself. My step mom knew about all of this, but I think she felt like I was asking for it because I basically whored myself out during the parties, so nothing really was ever done about it. 

One of the friends was a guy that my step brother had grown up with since birth. Our families were very close, his dad was our youth leader at church, his mom and my step mom were best friends and I was best friends with their daughter. This friend in particular was at our house basically every day. He was also close with my little brother. We had a pool in our back yard and he spent a lot of time teaching John to swim, teaching him tee ball and even changing diapers and giving him baths. It eventually came out that he had molested John several times in the pool and during baths, putting his penis in my brothers mouth, fondling him, etc. We stopped going to that church, cut off contact with the friend and his family and that was that for a while. My older step brother was really devastated. He wouldn't talk about it at all and eventually, when pushed, stated that he didn't think any of it was true and that he was still secretly friends with the guy. Most of our group of friends felt the same way, the molester was never really called out as such by anyone. I realize now that's probably because of how my family handled the situation and the fact that they never pressed charges.

My family basically just stopped talking about it and pretended like it never happened. Eventually the friend was allowed to hang out with my older brother again, but he wasn't allowed in the house, and after a while things got a bit more back to normal. Our families started hanging out again (minus the friend) and we started going back to the same church. My step mom eventually had an affair with the friends dad (our youth leader) and my dad found out and that's when our family split, me and my younger brother going with my dad and my step mom doing her own thing (the affair didn't last long after that).

After the split I cut contact with my step mom and step brother and any mutual friends. It's been about 15 years since I've seen any of them. I'm super embarrassed and ashamed of my childhood and all the things I did and allowed to be done to me. I think my dad has since heard things and knows a bit about it now, but has never mentioned it to me because he knows I'm embarrassed. He still visits my step brother sometimes on holidays and they get along okay.

 My little brother has never been close with my step brother, I think mostly because of the age gap, but he too visits him on holidays with my dad. He knows I don't care for his brother or his brothers friends and has also heard the rumors, but I think he thinks I've exaggerated parts of it and doesn't like it when I bring it up (I don't very often, except to warn him about becoming too involved with that crowd).

 No one in my family has ever mentioned what happened to my little brother. I don't know if he secretly remembers and pretends like he doesn't for our sake, or if he really remembers nothing. I'm too scared to bring it up, and I think maybe my dad thinks I've forgotten it as well. Obviously I haven't.

 For a while I was okay with just going along with them in pretending like it never happened,  for my brothers sake. I guess we all thought it would be better for him if he didn't remember, better for him if he didn't get dragged to court to relive it all (I should mention here that my dad had previously been through that with me, a long court case in which my molester wasn't charged, I think tgat had a lot to do with his reluctance to put my brother through the same thing).  When my parents split up he was with me and my dad most of the time so I felt like he was distanced from the friend, and therefore safe. I was young and starting my own life at that point and honestly just wanted to move on and forget those people and that part of my life.

 Then about 5 years ago, my step brother got married and invited John to be his best man. I wasn't invited, but when I saw the pictures on Facebook I was floored. My step brother had about 12 groomsman (all of the old group) and standing right beside my little brother in all of the pictures was his fucking molester. I was shocked.

 Everyone who knew about what had happened was at that wedding; my dad, my step mom, my step brother, the molester, the molesters family, all of my brothers and the molesters friends. All of them, sipping champaign on the fucking beach like it had never happened; and my poor little brother, unbeknownst to him, standing right next to the man that molested him as a child. At that point I seriously wondered if I had just made the whole fucking thing up in my head, because surely, my dad (a good man otherwise) wasn't  *this* invested in the lie. So invested in the lie, that he would allow my little brother to stand right beside the man who molested him. It was like the twilight zone, just totally unthinkable. 

I never said anything. I was still scared to open the wound, particularly now that it had become apparent just how invested everyone was in keeping it buried. Things went back to mormal. My little brother didn't start spending more time with my step brother and so I fell back into feeling secure with the family secret. Until today. My brother turned 20 this summer. A bit of a late bloomer, he's just started experimenting with drinking and maybe light drug use (pot) and sex (all normal for a 20 year old). For the last few years he's been pretty devoted to the church, claimed he felt like he was called to preach and was pretty prudish in his teen years, so this new behaviour is a bit out of character for him. We talk pretty regularly and he called today and mentioned that he was on his way to his brothers house. I thought that was weird because it's rare that they see each other. He said they've been hanging out a lot lately, that he's been buying him liquor and inviting him to hang out with his group of friends (all the pervs) and the MOLESTER. 

At this point I'm angry. If my step brother doesn't want to acknowledge what happened, fine. If he wants to surround himself with child molesters, fine. But my little brother shouldn't be put in this situation. I can't stand the thought of him remembering something one day or being told and coming to the realization that he's been hanging out with the fucking guy. Idk if it's something I should just let go or if it's something I need to confront my dad with? Do I leave this alone, do I tell my brother? Confront the step brother? Leaving it alone seems easy, maybe better for my brother, but it feels so *sick* and fucked up. I feel like I'm just as screwed up as they all are as long as I allow it to go on. Help?

So should I tell my family or deal with this alone? ",01Jan2018,2
244,"Im a (almost) 25/M from Europe. Almost done with my BA.
My BA is a mix of engineering and psychology. 

I have always been interested in computers, all sorts of technology and specifically, cars. Computers I fell in love with at a very young age. I played computer games from as early as 4 or something. Later on I was intrigued with just general messing around with computers, so think about installing OSs, messing around with DOS (learning a lot of commands and stuff), just really getting a good grasp of all the important concepts, and learning it all by doing. Oddly enough, I have never been much of a programmer. I tried QBasic when I was like 10, there was the Gorillas game, I fucked around with it but I never really got further than just making bigger explosions and the like (I did it without the help of the internet though :) ). I only really started programming when I got a class in uni that required it. 
In addition, I LOVE computer hardware. I love just looking up the latest whatever, be it CPUs, Videocards, Memory, SSDs, Monitors you name it I know it. I love reading in depth on sites like Anandtech and all that good stuff. I guess I am quite the nerd in that respect. Of course, I also love overclocking and have done my fair share of this.
Next to that I really likes cars. I know pretty much all cool cars from the 80-90s onwards. Nowadays I am really intrigued by tuning, specifically with turbochargers. I love how people can turn a 1.8 4 cylinder turbo engine into a 1000 HP fire breathing monster by attaching a turbo the size of dinner plate to it, and then fooling around with a computer to tune it nicely so it somehow doesnt blow up. Seems like overclocking but with more risk, would love to learn how this exactly works.
I also enjoy driving cars. All this said, I do not really enjoy the prospect of self driving electric cars. I quite like electric cars, BUT I certainly do not like them to the point that all ICE cars should just be jettisoned at this instance. Self driving cars I obviously do not like.

I have also always had an interest in music but music only really became important to me from ages 16 or so, when I had a lot of problems in my life. Basically, since then I have had a variety of emotional problems, I have trouble socially, and trouble just being an adult (being consistent, comitting, stable, getting shit done type of stuff). I still dont really have friends (only 1 really... he moved away recently). By far the most painful thing is not having a relationship... this is a difficult one that undoubtedly has a lot to do with myself as well, but there are some more factors involved.

So I had trouble making it through secondary school, but I made it in the end. Because of the interests I laid out above, I went into engineering, particularly focused on cars. This didn't work out very well. I liked some parts but I really wasn't keen on the heavy theoretical maths focus of nearly every subject. Mainly because it just requires so much focus and dedication, I am certainly not a natural at math but given enough time I can usually figure it out in a reasonable way. There are also specific topics (e.g. control systems) that I cant really stand but obviously are required. Outside of this, my life just was not really progressing, I had made one decent friend, but even though I participated in outside activities, I can't seem to really get the friendships I desire. Furthermore, romantically / relationship wise I feel my opportunities are severely restricted. My world centers mostly around university, I do not really have other avenues. My part time job is such that I don't meet new people there (I have considered changing jobs because of this, would like to get some advice on this). A brief stint on Tinder failed miserably, I did not link my Facebook (although it would add nothing I think) and just entered my number. One match after trying for months seems absolutely retarded. I actually think the principle of Tinder is decent but the way it works out in practice is BS. Still I am willing to try anything that might potentially help.

I should also mention I am aware of and take an interest in people such as Jordan B Peterson and Sam Harris.
I have had experience with a couple of psychologists and the experiences have been a mixed bag. Too much to write here now.

Anyway, I got to a point where I failed miserably, and I transfered to a different (and admittedly, less demanding major) so that at least I would have something to show after all this time. But I do not really feel that satisfied with my current direction. I feel like it is reasonable, and my future could consist of things such as UX design, which is appealing but I still have an itch for a bit more engineery type stuff, it is just that that requires a level of dedication and shit-togetherness that I am unsure if I have at the moment. Funny enough I also notice that about my peers, there are more peers in my current major who seem like they also struggle with similar issues, I guess in my previous major those people all got ejected. I just clung onto something that clearly wasn't working for too long. 

All in all I am unsure what I should do, and the problem is I need to decide very soon.",01Jan2018,1

252,"So for starters I own a small landscaping business, opportunity came up to buyout another guy in the field we specialize in. 

  When I initially went to the bank in the beginning they told me I'd need to do my business plan, cash flow projections etc, and that I would most definitely need to go through the SBA, and that it would be advantageous for me to put my business on pause for the season and go work with the seller to learn his business, NDAs and non competes etc were all signed etc. I worked with the seller all season. I took about 3 months to work out cash flow projections, writing a great business plan(had great help from the SBC(small business collaborative) and getting all my paperwork to the bank. 
  The bank said it looked great, collateral was available and secured - come to find out when the bank did a recent merge, they lost their ""SBA APPROVED"" stamp is the best I can describe it and could no longer move forward with the deal.. bummer, everything just came to a screeching halt.  
  On the bright side, the banker I was working with hooked me up with a new banker, and a different bank.  Meetings were had, ALL my paperwork, business plan,personal finance statements etc all filled out and given to the new bank.  This new bank had issues with the asking price and what the owner wanted. No problem, talked about this with the seller, we again agreed on a price the bank was willing to work with.  The deal was about ready to ""moved"" forward again finally, when I hear nothing for a week, only to find out the SBA representative at the new bank basically up and resigned. 
  All my stuff had to be moved and sent to a NEW SBA rep in Chicago, quite the change.  The problem is now, its been stale for about the past month in half, and when I called for information the other day the rep had ""end of the year deadline stuff he had to take care off""  This is after I was told I would have information regarding the situation before holidays.  
    I do know its going to be a SBA 7A Schedule deal, and I cant find much information on it to try and get ahead of the game, seriously, https://www.sba.gov/category/lender-navigation/sba-loan-programs/7a-loan-programs is such a bad website , it doesn't even show anything for me.  I would like to send a detailed email to my banker with some sort of.. Pre planning, for example.
-Schedule 7A will need X ammount of collateral.
Okay, I have my current equipment,, and property with a house going up for collateral.
-You need will guarantors.
Okay, here is my list of guarantors(co signers).

I just do not like being a annoying pest to my banker, but the stress is starting to add up, and its all ready very much canceled plans as my wife and I had planned on choosing a house and moving there before march to get ready for the upcoming season.   I am 4 hours away from the new location we plan on buying.

258,"So, this is going to be a long ramble. I have to explain a lot. 

Firstly, I have always been a quiet kid. Even to my closest friends I feel it's a burden to talk about my emotions/problems. Probably because I just have so many problems in my life, and I know I could have it worse, but still. 

I have two physical disabilities. This has always made me the runt in the family. My siblings pick on me constantly, and my parents don't try to stop them. It happens every day. I also was bullied a lot in elementary and middle school. In HS not so much, but I am still left out. It's enough to make me feel occasionally upset. 

My mom and dad are divorced.   My dad had to move in with a friend in another state because because his house was foreclosed. My dad is probably one of the only people in my family who actually tries to get to know me. 

My mom goes out to drink a couple days of the week with her boyfriend. I know it must be hard, because we don't have any money, and that puts a lot of stress on her. But when she comes home, she's never in a good mood, screaming at us about the same old things---clean the house, blah blah blah. If she weren't an alcoholic (I hate to say that, but it's true) I think that we would be able to have actual family time. She doesn't spend much time with us when she's in the house, because all she's doing is talking with her friends, or with her boyfriend. 

Despite all of this, I still was able to maintain straight A's in school. It was my way of trying to make the reality I want for when I get older. Well, until this year. Because of two uncontrollable events (one having to do with medical reasons) this last semester, my grades have slipped. I have almost a C in three classes. I have homework not turned in.  It's the most important year of HS, it's the year they say the colleges always look at, and my grades are the worst they've ever been. I used to love school, it used to be my escape. Now every time I think about it, it makes me stress. 

I need to get a full ride to go to college, because we don't have money. Now that's slipped away. Being a minority because of disabilities isn't going to help me much. 

I've lost motivation, and I'm stuck in a black hole. What do I do? ",01Jan2018,2

I replied again and said well if it gets really bad I guess I might be forced to move out for my own health and living comfort. She didn’t really care after that.

269,"Hey, 

About 4 years ago, I met a guy on a forum, who I've been messaging every once in a while on Steam. About 1.5 year ago, I was looking for some game recommendations, so I messaged my friend, who was shocked to find out I only had three games in my Steam library due to my financial situation (compared to the hundreds he has). In response, he gifted me 4 games to play.
A couple of months later, when we're messaging about games again, he sends me another (fairy expensive) game, And now, just yesterday, when I asked him about the Steam sale, he gifted me another 4 games.
As far as I'm aware, his financial situation isn't good enough that he can just throw money away, so I kind of feel bad that all I can say in return is just thanking him a lot. I even purposefully phrased my question about the Steam sale in such a way that it said ""...that I can buy?"", to try and make him not spend so much money on someone like me. 

He's spend likely around €100-130 on games for me, a guy he's never even met or talked to in voice, and I haven't done anything for him.
Most of all I just feel bad that there's nothing I can do in return, or at least, I haven't been able to think of anything to do in return.
Sometimes I'm even afraid that he might think I'm ""milking him for more games"" whenever I start a convo. 

And that's why I'm here. I'm looking for ideas, things I can do to show this guy I truly his gifts.

274,"Hello, I'm N, male. I'm 18 and I live in Russia with my mom. She is a part of this two-way conflict. On the other side is my girlfriend, D. The problem I ran into is I have to pick. Pick a side, pick someone, who I will please more, than the other. 

So, all my childhood I spent being raised either by my overprotective mother or by my even more overprotective grandmother. It came to the point, where while everyone older than 16 is partying, having happy relationships and walking outside after 10 PM, I, being an actual adult, have to come home before it's dark and not go walking with someone if my mom doesn't agree. My location is being tracked, and I constantly am told off for being late after university, when I decide to take a spontaneous walk with my girlfriend. Oh, also, my mom simply hates her, even though she tries not to show that. Not that D has done something wrong to her, no, she just hates the fact that I love someone else other than her. She doesn't like that I'm attached to D, that I want to spend more time with D and she constantly tries to block it. How? Well, easy, she just tells me how ""there's plenty of fish in the sea"" and ""she will annoy you anyway in the future"" and all that bullshit. 

I've met my girlfriend this summer while applying for my university. We ended up in the same group, so we visit all our classes together. I will not tell too much about how I love her, but I gotta admit, that she is the most supportive human being for now. Yet, we also have a little problem. She wants to see me more often (and I want to see her more often too) but, as told before, it's all being blocked by my mom. D gets mad about this, and this is the point where I come to my inner conflict, which I can't solve for well over six months now.

D tells me to become more independent, to become an actual adult, stop being a little bitch. I want to do that too, but I am afraid. I am afraid of my mother. I am sure, that if I try to resist her, it may cause an even severe case of the blockade. It's basically Stalin's USSR at this point: I'm getting owned, but if I resist, I will be more owned. My mom will probably take away my home keys, my computer cord, and my phone — I won't be surprised. It's easy for her to follow my every action, especially since she works from home as well as my step-father. This all leads to the point where I feel like a dog, who is getting beaten by its owner, but can't resist due to love. So am I: I can't give up on good relationships with my mom, since I can't live on my own, being a poor unemployed student.

But my girlfriend can't stand that. She needs physical contact, she also needs support in her everyday life. And I can't decide, whether I should stick with her or my mother. To me right now both sides seem inappropriate. If I resist to my mom, I'll probably become cut off of life. If I will spend less time with D, especially when she needs it, she will probably destroy herself with depression and suicide.

The problem is I don't know what I want, I don't know what I care about the most. Sometimes I wish I have never met D, sometimes I wish I was never born to this family.  I'm stuck at this crossroad and I don't seem to find the way out. I'm afraid I won't make it out alive.

What do I do?",01Jan2018,2
275,"A year ago I moved to another country so I broke up with my (*ex-*)girlfriend (*we still friends btw, it was mutual acord*). I'm the kind of guy that hates long distance relationships (most likely because I had one, and ended it really bad, and now I don't want anymore that kind of ""problems"" in my life).

After that, I was not in a good mood to start another relationship or just hanging out with some girls, because right now I have a good work, but most likely I'll need to move to another city/country soon, so it reminds me that maybe if I start a relationship again, and then I need to move in 3 months.. Welp, Dejavú.

However, I met an amazing girl at work. The problem is that she has a boyfriend with +6 years of relationship, that is a long distance relationship (*they are not even in the same city, haha fuck it, I hate long distance relationships, and this girls seems pretty fine with it*), she's the kind of person that is hard to be a friend with, because she is shy, really shy, and she's a really weird girl.. She has not a lot friends, is hard for her make a new friends, she's not a good talker, etc. As I said shy as fuck.

Anyways, I managed to be a good friend with her, even if I feel that I'm in the fucking friendzone (~~I think she doesn't know about my feelings~~, not sure about this). 

So here I am. Asking for advice:

- Should I tell her that I'm starting to feel something for she?.
- Should I just move on and just be a friend with her?.
Any other advice I'll have it into consideration, like if it's something like: ""Go balls deep"".

It's the first time that I'm in a situation like this. I mean, it's the first time that I need to express my feelings to a girl that I think I can't have anything with. It all started with me, just wanting to be a friend to this ""weird"" girl, but now...

**What would you do in a situation like this?**

PS: Sorry about my English, not my mothers tongue.

TL/DR: I'm hanging out with a girl that has a boyfriend with more +6 years of relationship, asking if I need to go balls deep or just move on.",01Jan2018,0
276,"so i wasn’t really sure what to put as the title, but my fiancé [F] and i are expecting our first child in February. that isn’t the problem, we’re financially stable and ready and excited for him to be here. 

the problem is MY family. my mom and dad got divorced maybe a year or so ago, i’m 26, so it didn’t break my heart or anything and it didn’t really effect me—until now. my dad has a fiancé, we’ll call her A. 

A makes my dad happy, which is great. i’m not opposed to my dad being happy. but, my fiancé and i cannot stand A, she is so far right and frustrating in her backwoods views, such as she doesn’t think my fiancé should be induced bc “the doctor is being lazy and doesn’t want to be called in the middle of the night.” she also subtly talks shit about my mom, she hasn’t came out and said anything yet, so there’s been no altercation...yet. 

my mom is also not very stable, she left my dad on a whim and regrets it everyday, she won’t say it, but i know she does. she calls my fiancé and i sometimes just to ask about my dad (i forgot to include i live near my dad bc i work with him, my mom lives 10 hours away) and it’s pretty frustrating. she’s unstable for other reasons too that i won’t go into. 

here lies the problem, we are delivering the baby here, where we live, close to my dad. my mom is coming down for the birth in February. the issue is all of them in the same waiting room. i’m not sure my mom can keep it civil and i’m not sure A will either. is it wrong to not want them there? it’s my mom’s first grandchild and i couldn’t give a damn about A or whether she is there. (she thinks she is grandma, but my fiancé and i are going to have to set it straight later.) 

is it wrong to tell A not to come? so there won’t be any hostility? or another idea my fiancé had was to talk to all parties &amp; explain that if anything were to happen, they would be asked leave... or should i just let them do their thing? ",01Jan2018,8

280,"Hello All,

This is my firsts time posting here. So sorry in advance if this isn't exactly the right place for this.

My New Years Resolution for 2018 is to find a hobby. I've never really had one that was long term and that I was actually committed to. I have dabbled in knitting but nothing too serious. I'm not really sure where I should start and I would like some suggestions and help getting started. I would like to find something either physically active or some sort of creative outlet. 

There are some boundaries, however. I have some financial restraints so nothing that would take a lot of money starting out. Additionally I live in a place that's pretty cold in the winter so something like surfing would not be ideal. 

Some info on myself....
I'm a young female professional. I work pretty crazy hours but have weekends off. I like being outside. I'm not in the best physical condition but I would really like to change that. I am relatively creative and enjoy arts and crafts but have not found anything I really like long term.  That was a pretty shotty description but take it or leave it. 

Any suggestions or advice trying things out is greatly appreciate

Thank you and I wish you a successful New Year. ",01Jan2018,2
281,"Hello all,


I’ll try to make this as short as I can, I hope you can help.



I’ve always struggled with my self-image for as long as I could remember. I’ve always fluctuated with my weight, too. In junior high I was chubby at almost 200lbs and 5’7”. I remember days at 12 years old, my single dad would prepare one of the only dinners he knew how to... which usually consisted of PB&amp;J sandwiches and a jumbo can of ravioli on the side. At my request, he’d allow me to have third or fourth helpings. I’d sit in the kitchen after everyone was finished eating while stuffing my face with the rest of the ravioli until the pot was empty. The summer going into high school, I got my first boyfriend. I became really self conscious and actually starved myself for 3 full months. I would only consume water and crackers here and there. I lost about 40lbs that summer, making me really sickly looking, since I was so tall, but I liked it. I began to eat regularly once I felt satisfied with my body.



In my junior year of high school I became pregnant, and the cravings really destroyed me. I had absolutely no self control. My weight in 9 short months fluctuated from 160lbs to 240lbs. I was a disaster, and felt so uncomfortable and unconfident. I lost about 20lbs in the year after my pregnancy, but that was just about where I remained for several years after that, and now I’m at 200lbs again.



My eating habits were awful and still are. I find myself eating fast food most of the week, and when I do eat... I eat until I feel sick and I do it purposely. I’m not sure why I do, all I know is I’ll order or cook so much food and in my mind I have full intentions on eating until I physically can’t anymore and have the intentions on feeling ill afterwards.



I used to cut before my child was born, not because I was suicidal... but because I was self-loathing and deserved the pain. I sometimes think me eating this way is essentially the same concept. I’ve been diagnosed and treated for severe depression as well as anxiety.


I’ve noticed my purging episodes happen in Times I am most stressed or feeling numb. I’ve had a history of really toxic relationships and I just feel like I deserve to be treated poorly. I don’t feel like I’m good enough most of the time. The guy I’m exclusively seeing now for 9 months makes excuses why he won’t make me his girlfriend, but keeps me hanging my a string by talking about a future. He’s “cheated” on me, but why should I consider that cheating if we aren’t dating? Im not good enough for him or most people in my life if they’re looking for someone else to replace me, so I make my way to McDonald’s or Taco Bell. The other night I ate a large fry, three Big Macs, two pieces of little caesars pizza, 3 breadsticks and ice cream afterwards. I’ll go to bed uncomfortable and sick. Then I’ll have a period of about 4 day’s after that where I won’t eat anything. 



Im not sure what’s wrong with me, if I need help, or where I can start on the road to a healthier lifestyle. Any help is very appreciated.",01Jan2018,3

283,"Last year my mom (48yrs) went through her second divorce, uprooting her, my fiancé and I (both 20yrs), hours away to a small town near my maternal grandparent's home. 

Obviously such a drastic change will cause distress, a new job, new home, new town, but I'm worried about her. She has made a habit of calling out 'sick' to work, drinking a significant amount, and being more critical of my life. This is all very out of character for my previously hardworking, Buddhist, and straight edge mom. 

Its been over a year now, and with all of this new behavior coming in waves. I was hopeful by now she would be back to her old self, or at least moving towards it, but it seems with the Holidays coming around, she's much worse. Shes been over-sharing with me, calling herself a failure, and I see her crying randomly. 

I don't know what to do, as her only child, to help her get over this bump. I have clinical depression myself, and she would always advise me growing up to simply get more sun, or do breathing exercises. Those things never helped me. I doubt they'd help her. 

My fiancé and I have lived with her since we were 18, and now that we're 20, we've made plans to move out and start our own life together. It seems that anyone else our age would have their family be sad to have an empty nest, but I worry my mom would take it harder than most.

She accused my dad of having a meth lab at my house when he didn’t live with us anymore, she says we’re always making loud noise at night banging on her walls and windows and climbing on her roof, spraying pneumonia to her yard and spying on her and that we blow marijuana smoke to her side. We don’t do any of that, none of it. She comes to our house, bangs on the door so loud and just leaves, she tells us to go back to Mexico and that we’re dirty “beaners” since we’re Hispanic. She verbally assaults us constantly, she’s called the police on us multiple times, they come find nothing wrong and leave, at this point they already know something is up with her. I just don’t know what to do or how to deal with her anymore, we’ve been dealing with this for almost 6 years now. Is there anything I can do besides moving? We just can’t afford it at the moment...

292,"So, a little bit of a backstory. My friend and I hung out with my 3rd cousin a while ago. They liked each other and decided to go out. NBD, but I didn't find out through them, I had to find out from another family member. Forward to last year, stuff happened (he said, she said bs) and they ""broke up"". I talked to my friend about it and he said they still talk but just as friends (which I already know was a lie), my cousin said the same thing as well. Now forward to this past weekend, my buddy came over and we decided to play some PlayStation. He signed into his account just so we could play a two player game. Today, I remembered he didn't remove it, so I went onto his account for the hell of it to send a message as him to my account saying ""I like dick"". I saw an unread message from my cousin that says something along the lines of ""Thank you for the surprise!!!! I love you so much...."", don't worry I didn't open the message, it's just the preview that I saw. 

If they are in a secret relationship, I feel betrayed that he would lie to me, even after I told him he can tell me anything and that everything would be cool as long as he is honest with me.

296,"Hello Reddit,

I come to you seeking help for a friend of mine. Here's the situation : I have a female friend, let's call her Sarah, who has very terrible taste in man.
Sarah is a sweet, caring, joyfull girl who loves to help people. She's so altruist that she decided to graduated in social welfare and becoming a social worker specialised in troubled youth in order to prevent young generation to commit the mistakes of their parents. Outside of work, she's heavily involved in community service. For example, this Christmas she helped organise a fund raiser for an homeless shelter in our city. Unfortunately, she can't hold a relationship more than a year because of her personality. It seems every man she attracts is some kind of broken soul. By that, I mean guys with troubled past, harsh upbringing or toxic acquaintances (e.g abusive parents or junkie friends). I don't know why but she thinks she can fix those guys with kindness and an open heart.
Her last boyfriend was an artsy, hipster, pot smoking (personally, I have nothing against pot) pretentious pseudo-actor who thought everything was owed to him. He never held a regular job to my knowledge and always borrowed money from her to sustain his drug habit. Nobody in our friend circle liked him and he brought a bad atmosphere everytime he was around us. We warned her about him but she alaways had an excuse ready for his behaviour like : "" try to understand him, his father abandon him and his mother when he was young"" or ""he really try his best to fit in, just give him a chance"". 
Fortunately, she broke up with him when he tried to convince her to lend him around $2000 for an audition. 
However, I know Sarah's next boyfriend will be another bad influence on her, because she seems to refuse to see people can be real manipulative jerk.
How to tell her this sad reality without destroying her vision of the world ?

TL;DR : my friend date a lot of douche but doesn't want to admit it.

I have a license and I can use my parent's cars almost whenever but my curfew is 10:30, sometimes 10. All my other friends have curfews of 11 or 11:30 and having to leave so much earlier than them is alienating in a way. I'm lucky to have good friends who don't care too much, but they are equally as annoyed that my parents treat me like I'm 12. My friends and I went into the city recently by ourselves and we were all planning on coming back around 10, but because my mom wanted me to come home at 8, we all had to come home at 8. It's also not just things like curfew, I'm also not allowed to have my phone in my room at night, they know both my phone and laptop passwords and my mom constantly texts my friend's moms to make sure it's ok that I'm at their house. It's incredibly frustrating because I'm 17 and almost an adult.

So idk if it’s possible to start dating someone else after only 2 months after ending things with someone you claimed to be in love with. Does her dating him mean she didn’t love me?
