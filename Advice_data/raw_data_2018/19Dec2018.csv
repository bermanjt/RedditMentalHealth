Okay so I’m in a class where the teacher has no idea what he’s doing. 

I’ve learned nothing about the subject, and when you say you don’t understand he gets mad at you for not knowing something we’ve never been taught. 

This single class has resulted in the most stress that I’ve ever had in my high school life. The stress has gotten so bad that I’ve started having bladder problems. I’ve talked to my counselor about a schedule change, and all she said was that she’d call us back. We finally had to call her after about a week, and she told us that there was nothing she could do, but the assistant principal could help. 

Well I called the assistant principal and left a message asking her to call me back, but nothing. And then I finally went to the principal’s office to make an appointment, but her secretary basically told me to pound sand. 

The teacher who’s class I was in had to call the office and told the secretary that I needed to meet with the assistant principal. We were told she would come down to the class or call. Surprise surprise, nothing. 

I’ve been ignored over and over again and I’m done. Needing to constantly go to the bathroom because of stress isn’t fun. 

What do I do?

2,"So I (f 23) have been seeing this guy (25) for about 6-7 months now. We see each other often, maybe 2-3 times out of the week. At first I thought we were just going to be a summer fling that would fade fast.... but it hasn’t slowed down. 
We never once discussed what we are. We have sex and smoke weed almost every time we see each other. I never slept over at his house.... but that is because I choose to leave right after so it is not awkward. 

I’m so confused &amp; I’m terrified to tell the guy how I feel and what I want... because I don’t want to scare him away. I obviously want to do everything with this person. I have never felt this strongly about someone in my life..
And sometimes I get the feeling that he thinks I don’t want a relationship, hence why he never brought it up or asked me because he is afraid of rejection. 

Recently he got very vulnerable with me &amp; told me about his childhood, and how he had an abusive past. 
He never once opened up to me like that. And I never felt such respect &amp; this deep feeling of emotions before. 

I recently discussed how I went to California one summer &amp; how much I loved it there. He suggested that he would love to go and that we should go sometime. This is another reason why I’m confused..


 I need to have closure. Basically I need advice on what I should say to him to finally clear the air &amp; know what he wants. Because I know he will never bring it up. What do you guys think I should do? And what is your opinion on my situation? ",19Dec2018,1
3,"For about a year, I’ve suspected that my dad might be cheating on my mom. I would catch him looking at pictures of women and being very suspicious on his phone. During this time he would accuse my mom of cheating, which she would never do. Last night, I saw a notification on his phone, a message from a woman who wasn’t my mom. He works a lot, and makes most of the money for our house. They’ve had issues before and we were struggling with money. He’s back now and everything seems fine, except he seems really distant from my mom and i just cant help but to feel sorry for her. I have proof of this and I’m not sure if i should tell her or handle this with him. I just don’t know what we would do without him",19Dec2018,1

5,"As the title suggests, I've lived with my roommate for 4 weeks now, the neighbours all seem very nice, my roommate seems nice enough but I have this really strong gut feeling that tells me he's hiding something. 

Obviously you'd like me to elaborate a bit on how I think this, and please let me know your opinion on wether or not I'm just imagining things or what I should to I'm this scenario. 

My roommate is 25, he's not worked for 7 years. He's a full time student at college. As well as this he gets student loans but only if he attends classes which he has not been doing. The property we live on is worth around 100K, I am only renting a room in the property. My roommate owns the flat outright and doesn't have a loan or mortgage on the property, he drives a 2018 Audi A5 that he also owns outright, I'm paying 300 a month on rent, but for my next month he's telling me money is good so I can pay half? 
On top of this his car was in for repairs 2 weeks ago, read to collect 9 days ago and he's being charged £25 a day until it's collected as it's taking up space at the garages forecourt? In my opinion how can someone that doesn't work or get money from college pay for this and not have to worry about being tight money wise? 

My neighbours across the hall don't get on with my roommate because he doesn't know how to recycle or clean up his dogs messes e.g. poop. They told me yesterday they think more than two people live there as it's having lots of people enter the property. 

Today after work I got home and the neighbours showed me cctv of the hallway, my roommate was supposedly out all day while I was working but 6 people entered the property for 10-15 minutes at a time from 9-5. This rings alarm bells for me saying something isn't right? Who has this many visitors for such short periods of time? 

3 days ago my roommate was assaulted on the street so I called the police to report it until he told me he doesn't like the police and doesn't want to report it? It's convienent that he was assaulted and doesn't wish to report it? 

Finally, the toilet is clogged a lot with tonnes of two-ply that's not been used, it's in clumps making it look as if it's hiding something conspicuous, he never wants me to go into his room for dishes when I'm washing all the dishes - He insists he gets them. Every night around 12-1am he goes on to the main road outside my bedroom window, gets into a ford focus that pulls up and then comes back into the house not long after? 

What's everyone's opinions? Would I snoop about to see what I can find? Move out asap or just ask him or something? 

I tend to worry over things that aren't true but I feel very certain he's hiding something.",19Dec2018,1
6,"Hey there,  


So this ones on me and I want to know how to approach it as best as I can, and what the punishment if any I'd look at.  


I was driving on an expired registration. I let it expire because I was being lazy. I got pulled over and got a ticket. A few days maybe 3-4, I went and got a new registration. Instead of immediately putting it into my glove box, I left it somewhere on my seat. I think while cleaning my car, I lost it. I have the receipt from a couple weeks ago when I got it, but not the physical card.  


My court is tomorrow, My laziness got the best of me probably, and now I ask, Can I get advice to figure out how to approach this.

9,"As the title gives away my cousin always had learning difficulties, speech impediments, severe dyslexia, some mobility issues and generally you can tell that he is having challenges managing anything more complicated than everyday life. Among those things i always thought that he has a very narrow spectrum of emotions. 

For example i have never seen him expressing sadness, empathy or grieve even throughout a very distressing period for our family, when we lost two members in a timespan of some months. 

I can't easily understand what his mood is as it seems to be flat all the time. 

Yesterday i was at his house celebrating his birthday. At some point when we were alone in his room he said that he doesn't feel like eating and has lost his appetite. So i asked him if everything is ok. 

Then for the first time ever in front of me he became emotional and started weeping. I asked him what's wrong and he said that he doesn't like that he turned 30 and doesn't have a job or a girlfriend (never had both) and generally doesn't like his lifestyle. 

In the past I was suspecting that he is probably unable to express his feelings but for the last years i was convinced that he just didn't bothered about those things. 

I was surprised by him getting emotional and i don't know how to approach this. I mean i would probably tell a friend to chin up, start changing little things about his life, start working out etc. But I'm not sure if that is a good advice for my cousin because even if he does all those things he will probably neither get a girlfriend nor a job, given his disabilities. 

So this is gonna make him put effort into something that he will maybe not achieve and eventually he will become more disappointed. 

I thought about trying to make him lower his standards about his life but i don't know if that's fair or even ethical.

I think that he trusted me and said those things to me, so i feel like he wants me to help him. I'm willing to spend time helping him but i don't know how... ",19Dec2018,1

11,"So for the past 2 years I haven't achieved anything. In elementary and high school everything was fine. I mean, I was shy. But I had tons of friends. Mostly because they approached me. But since I went to college, it's just not working out. I can't follow classes. Whatever I try. I know a lot of times the advice is to push through. To just accept that it's uncomfortable. Trust me I've tried so hard for so long. I get physically sick, to the point where I have thrown up. My mind is all over the place and I panic. I can't follow what the teacher is saying, and when someone interacts with me I freak out. The longer I tried the harder it got. I eventually started leaving the class to ""go to the bathroom"" but all I did was hiding, hoping it'd get better so I could return. That never happened of course. Eventually I was too scared to even enter the classroom, so I wandered through the school. Telling myself to ""just get in there"". The more that happened, the harder it got to go back. This eventually made me depressed, and I take antidepressants daily. I do feel better now.

I don't have this walking through busy places. Like the mall for example. But if i had to ask someone something, that's where it kicks in. And because class is a place where you don't get to decide that my whole body feels like it's constantly on high alert mode.

I went to several psychologists. I'm in therapy, and have group therapy. It feels so good to recognize the things people say there and to be able to talk, but it doesn't help me practically. At the end, everyone seemed to have improved somehow. I still felt the same. I was so disappointed. I'm screwing up my second first-year now. My mom is very understandable, and it feels nice to be able to talk to her. My dad... Isn't. He really wants me to succeed and pushes me, rushes me. When I finally had a psychologist that listened to me and gave me advice that made me feel better, he said she wasn't old enough to have enough experience in the job, so I won't be going there anymore. In my eyes? It didn't go fast enough for him. I felt better about myself, but he didn't see improvement on the outside. I think that because he keeps saying ""You may feel better, but I don't SEE any improvement"". And as much as I hate myself for saying this, he is often a reason why I feel awful. Why I can't sleep at night and worry. He repeats over and over how bad I'm doing. I know! I really don't want to disappoint my parents and that's what I fear most. Sometimes I think I care more about that, than about myself and how I'm doing I swear. lol

I wish I could just follow the class, and study. Get a job and live a normal life. I'm only 18, but this isn't going well. For the longest time I made ALL the work at home I could, even if I missed class. Even the group projects I managed to do on my own. But it wasn't enough. I couldn't pass by only doing that. It frustrates me so much. Now why I posted here is because I have no idea what to do anymore. I just hope maybe someone comes with something I could try that I just didn't happen to think of yet.

17,"So I really liked this girl for a while, so finally after classes ended (in case she rejected me I didn’t want to have to cross paths), I followed her on social media and asked her if she wanted to hangout. I was so surprised that she said yes and I was feeling so good about myself and I just couldn’t believe that everything went exactly how I planned.

We met at a coffee shop and just talked for an hour and something, before she had to study and leave. I don’t want to go to into detail but basically we had a lot of similar interests and all that stuff, but I couldn’t tell if she was nervous or dismissive the whole time so i was really stressing out. At the end of the “date,” I felt we really connected well and she told me that we should hangout another time.

So a day after I see if she wanted to hangout, and she just seemed kind of short and weird. She made up an excuse and eventually said that she’ll let me know when she wanted to hangout. At this point I was so confused, so I tried to be upfront and said, “I’m kind of getting the vibe that you’re not really interested and that’s totally ok.” 

To my surprise she responded with “interested?,” and I was honestly caught so off guard like I’m pretty sure entering dms and going to a coffee shop are standard signs that’s someone’s interested. I tried to be clear and said, “what I thought dms were synonymous with making moves, but I guess I didn’t get that across.” She then just said that she was just oblivious and gave me the ole I just got out of a relationship, and you’re a cool person that I still want to be friends with.

I am honestly fine with that but I find it hard to believe that she had no idea I liked her. Like I didn’t even know how to react so I just tried to play it off and say “lol sorry I was so upfront but I was just so confused.” She responds with a haha it’s fine, and then I hit her back that I’d be up to hangout when the semester starts again since we’re going on break. The “for sure” kind of hurt bc I’ve heard that one before but I didn’t let it show so I responded with “have a good break.” She said thanks and that was it.

Did I seem to pushy with someone I only talked a few days with, or was I justified? I don’t even think I did anything wrong but I just wanted to clear things up bc in my head there was a potential relationship. It might also have to do with my lack of experience bc for some reason I was totally convinced that she was going to me my forever gf and yadada.

18,"I used to see a girl who I was madly in love with. We were friends at first, but it got romantic for a shirt while until she decided I wasn't good enough for her. 

We stayed friends for a few torturous years where I hoped it would work out, but it didn't and she found someone else who she dated for a year. I couldn't bear to stay around her anymore because it became extremely painful, so I cut off contact.

Every time I see her, it throws me into a panic attack and days of depression and thoughts of self hatred and even some darker thoughts. She's basically the embodiment of my many insecurities. The fact that I am insecure is why she chose others over me.

She works a lot. I knew about it going into this, didn't think it'd bother me. Met a few weeks ago, went out for drinks and had a great time, but just haven't talked much after meeting that first time. We do still talk, just not much.

Have been super excited for an opportunity to meet her again, but without the communication back and forth it doesn't feel like that opportunity will come anytime soon. She's gone out multiple times with those coworkers she spends a lot of time around (she's said as much), but hasn't really given me the chance to see her again.

I do still think she's interested and it's why I want to stick it out, but admittedly her being as busy as she is (and that she'll willingly go out with coworkers but won't communicate much with me) bothers me more than I initially thought.

Should I keep attempting to court her? I feel like I've made a ton of effort to keep some line of talking and attempts to meet up active, but doesn't feel like she's returning the favor.

For example, lying about a super high test score and making it very obvious that I’m lying, or just making an absurd claim and purposely failing to support it, or just flat-out pretending like I have no clue about a certain topic even if I really do. It’s the type of humour that mentally and physically makes people face-palm, but clearly it makes me seem more friendly and approachable than if I were to act as if I had a higher magnitude of intelligence. I suppose that the issue is that I’ve kept this up for a year or so, and it isn’t my choice whether or not I act dumb like this anymore; rather, it’s become my entire reputation. I’m not sure how I feel about this, though. I’ve inadvertently become a laughingstock at the expense of my reputation, but it makes me friendly, approachable, human, and not boring, and it makes everyone laugh. I don’t think I can just stop.

It makes them laugh, and it makes me feel good I’m amusing them and improving their day with laughter. What does this all mean? Comedians don’t do this. Their reputation is “humour”, not “stupid”.

26,"I have a friend whom I have been friends  with for about 5 years now. We met at our old job and I consider her my  best friend. She is a mom of two now - a mom of one when we became  friends. We bonded over our shared wild nights where we would go to the  local 18+ club or house parties. I loved to drink and so did she. It  seems that, now that we are 23, I have slowed down on the drinking  scene. I don't find bars that fun anymore, I still like the club but she  only ever expresses interest in going to the bar, and I after a bit of  an epiphany I realized that drinking was actually starting to make me  very sad.

I  expressed this concern that it was fueling my depression (in therapy  working through depression/anxiety) and that was why I was making myself  scarce in the drinking scene. She seemed to understand, but I hear from  her less now. I get less invites to hang out and she is often going out  with a new girl who also likes to drink a lot. I sometimes get invited,  but they are second-hand invites - after everything is planned. It  doesn't help that my boyfriend also doesn't drink very much so we are  both not as into that scene. I feel like an afterthought and it's been  really crappy! At the same time, I don't want to be needy to her. I just feel like I've been replaced with this other friend simply because I don't find the same routine of getting trashed, going to the same three bars, just to get more drinks fun anymore.

I  can't tell if this is her way of sparing my feelings since she still  loves to drink whenever she can or if I was just her drinking buddy and our bond wasn't as strong as I thought. She doesn't seem to express much  interest in plans that don't involve alcohol. She's more apt to keep  those plans than cancel.

27,"I have spent four days sharing a cubicle with a man contracted by my company. When I was introduced to him last week as a specialist who would be working with us for a few days, I felt a slight punch in the gut: butterflies. He had an air about him of someone who was very sweet and very smart. Adorable, awkward, well-dressed, intelligent, etc. He is awesome and is hands-down the nicest guy I have met since I have been there.

He is almost 30 years my senior (29 - plot twist). I hope he has noticed I’m smiling at him a lot - laughing at his jokes (they’re actually funny - they surprised me); asking questions - looking for ways to engage him. And he engages me - a lot! I know I’m one of the - if not THE - nicest people in the office to him. Perhaps that’s why he’s very apt to talk to me about anything: I’m a good audience. But, I don’t know... He’s sort of goofy and affable, which means maybe he just thinks I’m good-natured, too. Most people would feel they were being flirted with; being paid special attention. We’re both paying each other unusual amounts attention without crossing lines. I can’t tell if he thinks I’m cute in the same way 😫

This is incredibly “high school” of me, but I have knots in my stomach when he’s around/talking to me. He leaves town tomorrow. I have no idea if his company will send him back. I’ve already purposed it to add him on LinkedIn afterward regardless. I was so close - inches - to inviting him to sit somewhere with me after work, but I couldn’t work up the nerve. It would be a very, very brazen thing, for two reasons, the lesser of which being our companies have a client relationship involving litigation, although I’m so “low on the totem pole” there is no way my involvement with him could negatively influence my company. He is more established at his, though. They brought in “the big guns” when they sent him.

I did say something somewhat bold (for me). I told him he had “vigor”. What 50-something year old man doesn’t want to be told he is virile by a young woman? He responded pleasantly to that - of course he would. Later we were talking about age and he said he enjoyed being around younger people because he “learned a lot”. I reminded him he wasn’t old (which he said about himself outright more than once). I told him his particular age is a “sweet spot”: “old enough to be wise and capable while still physically able-bodied”. He responded positively, but he is so awkward I don’t know if he picked up on the nature of the compliment. He just sort of laughed and, “Ohhh, yeah, well”’d with a big smile on his face which is how he responds to many things. I don’t think I was being subtle at all - my boss was looking at me funny and I feared he could see I was flirting. Then again, he’d be right, and if HE saw it, how could this guy not?

He has not necessarily flirted back, unless his indication of flirting is asking me a lot of friendly personal questions (“Do you play any instruments?” “Why don’t you listen to the radio?” “Are you happier working here than [previous career]?” - all out of the blue/silence; not as part of an ongoing conversation) engaging me a lot more than others/joking, or being somewhat awkward - maybe nervous - while I’m talking to him. Then again, this could be a response to my flirtatious behavior and not necessarily flirting on his part. He’s cutely awkward as a person - his awkwardness with me may not even be because I make him nervous, but because people do in general.

If this seems like a lot to have registered in four days of knowing a coworker, it is. We have spent nearly eight straight hours together each of those days, though. I’ve spent that with all of my other coworkers for weeks and not talked to them as thoroughly. 

What do we think: is he into me? Any insight? Also, what the hell do I do/say to be more clear? I don’t think I want to outright say it - but I’m brave enough to walk right up to that line so he can push us over it/take the bait. Sigh.",19Dec2018,1

I thought about texting him and catching up. Maybe leading up to some experimenting. But I have no idea. Please leave your advice on what you would do. ",19Dec2018,1
29,"All my life he has been to busy ""we will hang tomorrow"" theme. And now its happening again with his grand kids. 
I miss my dad. And no matter how much I poke him and say HEY we all need to see you we miss you he will say ""I knowwwww lets hang tomorrow"" which I know is code for ""see you in a few month? 

When we are together our relationship is GREAT he is such a loving dad/grand dad but... ya.. life just goes by to quick to keep saying ""tomorrow we will"" 

I am slowly giving up on trying to see him because either way I get hurt. I either get the ""tomorrow"" treatment or we actually plan a day to see each other and it ends up getting cancelled half hour before.

I miss him so much but what can I even do? Nothing? The guilt trip will work for a day or two with him and he will come over for maybe a coffee and then he falls off the face of the planet for a few more months. 

Sorry for my rant. Its christmas and I am just horribly sad about loosing my dad like this. I know I probably won't see him this Christmas. It will probably be ""we will get together in the new year""",19Dec2018,1

31,"Due to various factors I have no friends, even then with my last social group I hung out with them but really struggled to connect with them or have any fun with them, I'm thus pretty socially isolated and although I've always struggled to connect with other people it feels so much worse now and my loneliness is causing severe depression. 

Having no friends makes it harder to make friends - there are some places that are only fun if you've someone to go with, I go places alone but when everyone else is there with other people it's not ideal to try approaching them, not to mention it's hard to start a conversation when you do nothing fun with anyone to have anything to talk about. 

I find myself alone so often...bars, gigs, events, cafes...I'm often surrounded by people, but I'm always alone. I work a few hours a week but I'm there to work and no one seems too motivated to talk to me anyway, I occasionally went to the gym but it's not a place to talk, I went to Meetups (no longer an option) but failed to make friends, etc.

They haven't sent out the letter about it yet, but I know that I should be able to appeal the suspension before the Spring semester begins so that I can continue to go the university. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking about taking the credits that I passed and transferring them to a community college in the local area to get my ADN in Nursing, seeing as I passed majority of the pre-reqs with Cs, nonetheless, and only need two or three more classes before I'd be able to apply to the ADN program. The reason why I am transferring is mostly due to not being able to afford the 15-17 credit hours the university requires for students to be full-time. My mom can't take out anymore PLUS loans for me and I've already exhausted having to get another unsub loan to even take classes for this semester...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I told my mom about it and she said we'd figure it out, but I don't know. CC sounds like a good idea and I should've went there like I was advised to do instead of a big university so soon.

Anyways, I had to do an appeal for the Spring 2018 semester after being put on Academic Probation. I suffer from eczema and psoriasis, which are both auto-immune diseases that occur when I am under stress. The breakouts are so severe that sometimes it is hard for me to move without the skin splitting and cracking.

I don't want to pretend that kissing what was once a cum-filled mouth is a ""romantic moment"". I live in the U.S. by the way.

I'm a black guy that was born in the tough streets of DC. I was in those tough streets until about the end of 5th grade. Even tho I was born into that harsh lifestyle I never fell into the bad crowd. I was always into video games and watched naruto and inuyasha when I wasn't playing dragon ball z budakai tenchaichi 3. My mom wanted me even further from the gangs so we moved too a prodominantly white neighborhood. I was meeting white people in person for the first time and not just on a television screen. Most welcomed me with open arms and I did the same. Learning that I enjoyed skateboarding and metal. You could say i'm pretty ""white washed"" and I don't really have any shame in saying that. It's just got my upbringing was. As I was making tons of new white friends I also noticed how my crushes were all white. In the early days I wasn't even really interested in girls but when I started too they were all white girls. Fast forward now i'm 22 and in a serious relationship with a white female. There hasn't been any backlash luckily. My family loves her and her family loves me. The only thing I see on the internet are people against. Some white but many many of my own race speaking ill of it. Why is it such a problem? Why can't two people just enjoy each other? Is it that big of a deal? Am I doing something wrong? ",19Dec2018,1

She is reliable, consistent, and clearly dedicated to building a meaningful relationships. But,  More recently some of her thoughts and actions have become somewhat concerning. For one she thinks people are constantly jealous of her. She is a pretty girl, but I wouldn't call her one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. However, she frequents in conversation that people are constantly envious of her beauty. Her own cousin (who is actually a 11/10)  But at the same time she is consistently insecure ... before she makes a post to social media .... I see that same photo like 60 times with various MINOR edits..etc. I'm not a social media junkie, so having these conversations are somewhat irksome.

Beyond all this, if she posts and I don't like the photo within an hour ...she rages...All the while saying she doesn't care about numbers on social media, because it's ""not real"". I'm a 23 year old woman trying my best to put my best foot forward in advancing myself and my career I don't have time for these social media games.

She also constantly is looking for attention from other men. I mean prowling for it. She is not single. She loves being around single men and dressing provocatively. Not only this, but when retelling an encounter with guys she will recreate the encounter in her head to make it seem like it was a lot more than what it actually was. For example, a man at an indian restaurant once gave her extra sauce and she went on a rave about how cute he was, and how he probably did that because he found her attractive. When really it was the end of the fuckin day and it's more likely they were trying not to produce so much waste. There's been times where she lets men touch her inappropriately as well. One night at the club one of these men asked her if she had a man at home. He scoffed when she said yes, she was LIVid.

So,my whole family is wanting me to just up and leave my mom here. I feel like I cant,that it's betraying her. And I feel like I can't leave her behind in all this mess we are in. 
We have our fights ,yeah. My mom's not a good money saver,always buying cigarettes,fast food etc when I'm on the other end trying to save money so we don't have to go back out onto the streets. But thanks to her this month running up a $190 bill with the cabs for her cigarettes,we won't be able to stay. 
I don't want to leave her,I actually feel like I'm going crazy with my family all trying to pressure me into leaving,I know they just want the best for me. I have never been away from her in my life. My dad passed when I was young,so it's always been only me and her. I'm old enough to be away from her,but feel like im being torn away and I start panicking?

57,"This all started in 2012 when it was my senior year of high school. I applied for a program through my current college to obtain college credits. I took Public Speaking. 

Fast forward two years, I received my associates degree from a different school. I decided to apply for the same 4 year university where I received my 3 credit hour class for public speaking. 

However, I was informed that I didn’t take Public speaking but a class on poetry instead. I knew this wasn’t the case but the transcript said 3 credit hours so I was forced to take the CLASS again because the poetry class was non-transferable to my degree. At the time, I thought it was a small mistake and took public speaking yet again from the same school. 

I finished up the semester and met with my counselor who told me that I needed to take several courses that were not listed on the requirements for me degree. I stupidly listened to her. Turns out two of the courses didn’t transfer to my degree.

After that I complained to another counselor and the head of the department who essentially blamed me and moved me to another counselor.

I thought “everything’s going to be ok now.” Nope. I was wrong. I get another counselor who tells me that I am missing MORE classes that the school required. I get a second opinion and am told that these classes are required. I take the classes next semester only to learn that my University has DROPPED those courses and they’re no longer needed. I took 6 credit hours for no reason.

Fast forward to what I thought was my graduating semester, I finished up my last 3 classes that I needed to graduate. I contact my new graduation counselor that says I’m good to go and set to graduate. 

Then just before the summer I find out I am ONE CREDIT SHORT from graduating. I was livid. I messaged anyone I could to complain but again they blamed me. I had to take yet another course in the summer just to graduate.

You’d think this would all be over by now but it’s not. I was stupid enough to apply for grad school with them and they’ve fucked with my application again. I was speaking with the head of the department who gave me a list of all that I needed. Turns out I also needed my GRE and no one told me. It wasn’t on the list of requirement. They told me I wouldn’t be accepted in the spring but the fall if I could get my GRE by January 15th. I took it ASAP and didn’t do well due to not having 3 fucking months to study. The counselors told me “not to worry” because I could take 6 credits a semester as an “out of town” student. That means I couldn’t apply for FAFSA and I’d pay double the price.

I see the pattern. I was stupid not to catch it earlier. I have cut ties with that school. They don’t care about helping you achieve your goals—they just want your money.

The date of the status has updated multiple times, the most recent being last week, but the actual status remains the same.

65,"Hey all,

I had  a very successfall 2017 Fall Semester. I was taking 2 awesome courses with great value - Operating Systems and Stasitics. Both pushed me, and I did well in both. I was on a high.

&amp;#x200B;

The next semester, I could have taken courses that would have set me up for a great data science career. Courses that heavily drew on statistics and programming. But out of laziness, I took two absurdly easy electives and two semi challenging courses.

This semester, I played some catch up. My plan is t find a job with my degree (a BA in comp sci) and return to school at a later date. There were some many opporunities I had in the past that I rejected out of fear of failure",19Dec2018,1

When we talk about how to change the habits it's a great conversation and he seems hopeful but we don't live together and mom doesn't have school skills to help; she's functionally illiterate. It feels like she's resistant to me prodding her son but it might be because she doesn't understand my text messages or doesn't know how to assist.

67,"My parents divorced when I was 11(I'm now 29) and my father remarried a woman with her own children. He was a wonderful father to them but slowly pushed me away over the years. For the past 10 or so years our only contact has been a text message on my birthday and one visit at Christmas. That's literally all. Last year I lied and said I was going out of town for Christmas so I didn't visit him. I feel a little guilty about that, but really not that much. We're practically strangers and our conversation is painfully awkward. It's awful to sit there in his house trying to make small talk, and opening presents that I know my stepmother bought (and that all get returned or sent to Goodwill because they know nothing about me and always buy me junk I don't want or need.)

It hurts me that my father makes no attempt to contact me 363 days of the year. We only live 15 minutes away from each other but we may as well be on different continents. I don't know if he thinks about me or misses me. Maybe the thought of reaching out is as painful to him as it is to me. But he's my father, and our relationship has been circling the drain for over a decade. I think if he wanted to do better he would have done it by now. When do I accept that my father isn't really interested in me?

I don't want to go to his house and pretend everything is fine and that I'm not torn up and dying inside because I feel like he doesn't love me or want me. I don't want his gifts. But I also don't want to spend the rest of my life angry at him, never knowing if we aren't both waiting for the other to make the first move toward reconciliation. What do I say to him? Do I suffer through this visit and let things continue as they have been, or do I put my foot down and cut him out completely to save myself this pain? But will I regret that later?

69,"My boss is around my age. He comes from a very wealthy family and acts like he's better than everyone, and like everyone is just a pawn in his game. He is rude, disrespectful, and cruel just because, and he does not feel sorry about it. In fact, he has expressed pride and a sort of glee about it to me in the past. He also refuses to give credit where credit is due, because of course, no one matters as much as he does. 

Multiple coworkers have come to me and told me how afraid of him they are, of how mean and angry he can get out of nowhere. People basically avoid him in the office. He will be in an ok mood, and then he'll just snap. You could ask him a completely normal question and he will start rolling his eyes and sighing like a passive-aggressive teenager. Even management asks him questions and he barely suppresses his annoyance and contempt. I have no idea why he's still working there. 

The thing is, lately he's been expressing his anger physically. He has started throwing things in his cube (pens, papers, etc) and slamming his keyboard onto his desk. His temper is volatile and his mood can shift in an instant. I am to the point where I don't even want to be near him. Not only can I not stand him as a person, but he genuinely scares me.

72,"So I'm not even sure how to begin with this post but I'll try my best.

I'm originally from Michigan but moved to Florida in 2010 for work. This work unfortunately kept me from spending holidays with my family. We mostly did holidays with my dad's large extended family as my mom's side of the family had had a falling out. In 2017 I got married to my husband (gay wedding) and we had invited both of our extended families to come. The main concern was that my husband's immediate family was Mormon and would not come. Surprisingly, all but his father attended, meanwhile, my dad's oldest brother, wife, and their three children and their spouses who he was sure would come, RSVP'd no, while the rest of his siblings attended. This was a blow to my dad who was very upset as we had attended all three of their children's weddings, and given each of them gifts. My husband and I only received a card from my uncle and aunt nearly a month after the wedding, nothing from their children. Unfortunately my dad is practically the lone progressive in a fairly conservative fair-weather Catholic family. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this year and my husband got a very lucrative job offer in Michigan and my parents had moved into a much larger house and offered to have us come live with them while we saved up to buy a house of our own. As the holidays rolled around the idea of entertaining the family came up as it was something we had never been able to do in our old house as it was far too small for the whole family to attend. We ended up inviting his sister, my cousin and her boyfriend over for Thanksgiving and it was very nice. So then the talk came up for Christmas Eve. This was always the big event in my family. My dad asked me how I felt about having family over and I told him I do not care either way, I was just happy to be home for the holidays. He was still very upset about how he perceived his family slighting me at my wedding but I'm honestly over it. He ultimately decided to invite all his siblings, one nephew, and the niece that was at Thanksgiving. He consciously chose not to invite his oldest brother's kids because of the whole wedding fiasco but had a decent out in the fact that one niece usually spent Christmas Eve with her in-laws, one lived on the other side of the state and didn't come home until Christmas day, and his nephew hadn't attended Christmas Eve at all since his second marriage. He sent out a group text inviting everyone specifying what everyone needed to bring,  as well as the rules for our traditional white elephant game. His oldest brother implied via text that his oldest daughter would be bringing something, essentially inviting herself. All hell broke loose as my mom did not want them in the house, specifically with their kids as they are super-hyperactive and our house is not furnished nor prepped for kids, and she hasn't bought them any gifts. Needless to say, stress is high around my house at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a loss of how to feel about this whole situation because I feel like this whole thing got spurred on by me being home for Christmas for the first time in eight years. Should we call it off? Should my dad risk telling his brother that his niece isn't invited? Should we just try to run with it? I'm worried things are going to be incredibly tense and I don't know what to do...",19Dec2018,1
73,"I apologize in advanced if this is scrambled, first time posting and I'm on mobile.

In the past 3 years of me having rental history I have never gotten noise complaints for how I live, as I'm pretty boring. I work 10am to 9pm most days as does my roommate. When I'm not working I hike with my dog or watch tv, I've never once thrown parties or had more then 4 people in my apartment at a time including myself and my roommate. My roommate literally never leaves her room and reads most the day, so I highly doubt the complaints are because of her.

Fast forward to now, I have recently moved to a new apartment complex with my 25lb dog and said roommate. I have been receiving nasty letters from the neighbors below me (I live on the second story or a three story complex) since moving in complaining that they can hear my dog  walking around the house when I get home and that they dont like that they can hear my laundry machine when I use it (between 9am and 6pm on my days off). I have gone down and apologized to the neighbor but the women below me just told me to give my number to her so she can call and let me know when it's ok for me to do laundry and basically be active in my own home. I refused as I felt it was a little insane to have to do something like that.

Our apartments have pretty thin walls I will admit, I can hear whenever people walk around above me all the time, but I've never complained because I understand they cant help it. I have made nothing but regular living noise of my dog and I walking around the house, cooking and cleaning like normal. I've asked management about it and they have told me that there are 24 hour quiet times but they understand that normal living noise should be tolerated, however if my downstairs neighbor keeps complaining I could be evicted. I've also talked to my upstairs neighbors and have been told that the unit I live in has high turnover rate because of the lady below me. I've never been evicted and am terrified that it may happen just because some lady can hear me walking around at 9:30 before I go to sleep each night.

Is there anything I can do to make the lady downstairs more tolerant or make management understand the situation without them thinking I'm crying wolf?

In short: downstairs neighbor complains she can hear my 25lb dog and I walking around between 5pm and 9:30pm, might get evicted because of it.",19Dec2018,1

87,"Hi everyone. First reddit post. Don't judge me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, first a bit of context. I've always been terrible at making friends. I feel like I do put myself out there which isn't an easy thing to do for me. I was abused mentally and physically growing up. I was also basically kept from going anywhere until I was about 17.  This included hanging out with any friends I did have or even going to my grandmothers house. (It's not because I was a little shit as a kid. I got straight A's and was pretty shy as it was. Just had a bad step-dad.) Maybe I just never learned properly.

Anyways, it became even worse recently when I found out that my ex-fiance had been cheating on me for over nine months. I've been hurt a lot in my life, but this was probably the worst because I thought she would be different. I had no idea. We had just moved to a new city for her job and bought a house after being together for 4 years. I knew things were a bit off, but I thought that was just the case because our lives had changed a lot after graduating and moving. My best-friend is just gone and I realized I don't have anyone else that I'm very close to.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm 25 in a new city yet again because I really couldn't stay there anymore since the place we lived didn't have many tech jobs and we were just there for her very specific degree. So, I'm here and don't know anyone my own age to really hang out with or anything to do to even try to get my mind off of things. That all being said, Peeps of Reddit, how do I learn to make friends and even get ready for a relationship again?",19Dec2018,1

89,"So, last term in college, I had 3 of my relationships go down the drain.

The first was a girl I had met over a year ago. We clicked really well, would go on road trips together, go out to eat, and just talk about life. Last time I hung out with her was at a bar when I had ran into her. She suggested we do something later that week, and when I messaged her if she was still up for it, she never replied. I tried calling her, and no response, so I let it alone. It confused me because I thought we were on good terms. About a month later, I texted her asking if I had done something to upset her and she just told me she was working on her self and that it would cost her a few friendships and that she hoped I understood. So I told her I did but I'm still kind of hurt.

The second friend was another girl, but one who was low-key toxic. I liked her because I liked her insight into certain topics like politics and relationship dynamics, but her cynicism got too much for me at times. She was always blaming other people for her problems, as opposed to her unwillingness to try in school or look for a job or become independent from her parents, and had habit of cutting people out for petty reasons. We tried going hiking, but I messed up the directions on where to so we wasted the day. I apologized because she was annoyed, and she said it was fine, but the next day I called her to suggest we do something easier I found she had blocked me.

The last friend was a gamer buddy who he and I would mostly play league with. When we first met, he was really chill and interested in being my friend, and we'd hang out once a week at least. It's been a year since I met him and we're slowly growing apart because he never suggest to hang out, and I've begun to realize I'm the only one ever inviting him to do something. I decided to stop texting him to hang out, and what do you know, he hasn't texted me at all.

So now I feel really lonely. I've always struggled with making friends all my life, because I was awkward and geeky as a kid and bullied for it. It makes it really difficult to open up to people, and sometimes when I make a connection I cling too long even if the relationship is bad for me. What sucks more is thinking you've made a decent friend, only for them to walk out on your life without any warning.

So I don't really know where to go from here. I'm dreading of going back to school next term, even though I'll be graduating soon, because I know I'm not going to have anyone to hang out with when I get back. At the same time, I'm really jaded about the idea of friendships, and just feel they're pointless as even if I make a new friend for some reason they're just gunna stop talking to me for whatever reason and I will have wasted my time.

Thanks for the help Reddit. Hope you're having a good holiday season.",19Dec2018,1

Over the years I've watched these releases and tried to justify spending the money, but have always decided against it. These small batch releases always sell out pretty quickly as well. I'm also located in a different country than the artist, which factors into my currently dilemma...  

I'm in a better place financially, and finally decided NOW WAS THE TIME! The artist was doing a charity sale for the holidays, so all proceeds were going to a specific charity. The piece I wanted most sold out pretty immediately, but I was able to purchase another awesome print for under $200. I was very excited. The print arrived and looks great. Then another package arrived...and contained three more of the same signed print.  

Do I reach out and let his team know about this error? Does that obligate me to try to send these back? If I got someone else's order, surely they're able to track where the package went, and potentially print and sign replacements to send to the true recipient?  

I don't really have a need for four identical pieces of art...but I would love to gift them to my friends, who are also fans. I also selfishly don't want to deal with packaging and international shipping to return these.

102,"I have a friend who I’m renting a place from on a handshake/honor agreement. We are both members of a subculture where your word is your bond come hell or high water so neither of us saw the need for anything in writing. 

In that agreement he said that after a year he’d sell the place to me and even finance it himself if need be. 

I recently discovered through another party that he sold the place to someone else behind my back with not so much as a text message. Also I’ve been informed I have until March to find a new place and vacate the house. He did, however, stop charging me rent for my remaining time here.   That’s nice of him but it isn’t much help since I live on disability  and the rent he charged was very cheap.  At this rate I won’t have the needed funds available to move and secure a new place until July or August of 2019 if I save every penny I can and I’m suppose to be out around mid April.  

We both knew there was outside interest in the property. He got the place for next to nothing and when I was to buy it he would have made a $40,000 profit after all was said and done. Once I had mortgage on the place then I would have been in a position to sell to the developers, make a profit myself and be able to get a better place than this one. The developers paid $225,000 for the place which gives my friend a profit of $195,000. If he would have stuck with our agreement I would have made $155,000 which is about what I was planning on. With that I could have paid for a place in the country in full. 

Hindsight is always 20/20 so please no comments about that I should have gotten this In writing.

103,"I live in an 800 sq ft apartment with my roommate. We have two cats and just recently got a dog (too many animals for a small space, I know. We’re moving in a few months). We also live in a historical building on the first floor, so our windows don’t open. We clean it as much as we can, but we both work full time+ and it can get put off. I can only burn so many candles. How can I “purify” the air in here? Preferably in a cost effective way. ",19Dec2018,1
104,"I have this friend in the Air Force who decided to adopt this feral ranch cat two years ago while we were at another friend's wedding. Being in the AF he has overseas deployments during which he can't bring pets or companions. So when it came time for his first deployment a few months after the wedding, he asked me to watch this cat for him. I agreed to watch this cat for the duration of his deployment: 1.5 years. It wasn't an issue because I typically really love cats. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 1.5 years later he comes back saying he no longer wants to take the cat back. He says it's likely he will have to deploy again and that the cat will just need to be fostered elsewhere once again. While this is true, keep in mind that he knew this all along when he ""adopted"" the cat in the first place. I did not. Personally, I feel he never should have taken the cat off the ranch at all. It was perfectly happy and well-to-do. But I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

So \*now\* I get the pleasure of dealing with his mistake. The primary problem being, I now feel responsible for this cat's happiness. The last thing I want to do is give her up to a shelter or put her through another unnecessary transition of ownership. As that is stressful and this cat never asked for any of this. It's already gone from Nevada to Texas, to California. As much as I love cats, not this one. It's extremely burdensome and my allergies flare up like crazy with her. Our apartment was never meant to host a furry little critter like this. This cat deserves outdoors and this was all meant to be a temporary arrangement. Of course after 1.5 years though, one tends to get attached too. So the only way I'd give her up, is if he took the cat back. Because she would at least recognize him.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here I am, resenting my idiot friend for his lack of foresight because he stuck me with the bill, literally and figuratively. A pet is no joke, and is an extremely long term commitment that I simply didn't want. But I would feel so guilty if I put this cat through another adoption type process. She is happy, I know that. I take her for walks and let her sit outside on our porch all the time. She is well fed and very healthy. It's not her living situation that is the problem honestly; it's mine. I travel a lot for work and it's expensive to find people to watch her. I'm extremely OCD so it bothers me immensely when I have to constantly sweep cat litter just to walk into the bathroom. Or smell cat urine. Or vacuum cat hair.  

&amp;#x200B;

I just... think my ""friend"" got off too easy here and I have lost so much respect for him because of this. I think he should have taken the cat back. And if he couldn't keep her, then he should be the one taking her to a shelter, or finding her a new home. Not me. I never signed up for this. Am I being selfish or irrational here? Is it fair that I demand he take her back? Is it fair that I ask for monetary reimbursement? Or should I just nut up and take her to a shelter?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, I think part of it ended up being my venting.  

tl;dr

Offered to watch my friend's cat while he was deployed for 1.5 years and now he won't take her back.",19Dec2018,1

109,"Hey

So I have made a post about a month ago about how I think that I love this girl (27) although she's 9 years older than me (m18).



--- CONTEXT OF OLD POST ---


I asked about whether I should tell her about how I feel or not.

Didn't got that much of attention but the one I got said I should not do it and first be sure and honest to myself about how I feel.


I also chatted to strangers online to get 3rd opinions. Most of them agreed that it is a tough situation and said that I should try to hint it and see how she reacts.

The problem was that I knew it wouldn't work.

I also knew that I could talk to her about anything because she's a person that you can talk to about everything.



--- WHAT HAPPENED AFTER POST ---


So I did.

I did tell her that after spending the weekend at her place and going to that concert with her my feelings kinda went crazy and that I do think that I love her.

I also told her that this is pretty confusing and difficult to me and that I also don't want to mess up the friendship we have.


To my surprise she told me that she somewhat feels the same.

She said that this is really confusing to her too, that I'm somewhat more than just a friend to her and that she doesn't know how she should describe the feelings she has for me.

She also said things like that she told her sister if I'd be like 10 years older she wouldn't even hesitate.


At that point I was kinda speachless.

We chatted about it throughout the whole day but we both were on a side of that it would all be more difficult than easy and that it most likely wouldn't work out.


To summarize the reasons:

1. We're in completely different Life-Situations. She's done studying, has her first job now for ~ 1 year and wants something serious and children.

I am in my apprentice ship and won't keep the job. I'll do a 1-Year A-Level and go study after that - if all works out of course.


2. She's afraid that I would think I had missed something in life one day and that it'll end up in a bad way with us.


3. We live in different cities (~3h with train)
Which wouldnt be that much of a problem to me since once I'm done with school in ~ 1 1/2 year I'd have to leave town anyways for studying.


4. Some other things that result of (1.) like I wouldn't have money to go on holidays or do stuff she'd love to do. She agreed that there are options but she's just seeing more problems than possibilities.



--- SITUATION/PROBLEM NOW ---


As mentioned, roughly one month passed.

My feelings haven't.

We still play video games every evening.

Next Week she'll be in my town for two weeks. 

Maybe we'll meet maybe we don't.

Nothing is planned.

Guess she'll just meet old friends of her, be with her family and we'll talk some nights as always.

In January, however, I'll go back to her place for another weekend.

I'm not afraid of that since I, obviously, like spending time with her and seeing her.

And I don't think that will change just if stop seeing her.


I'm just so confused right now.

I feel like she's got over it and it is a lot easier for her since I might have felt a lot more for her than she did for me.


Maybe I'm just being the little and childish boy here, idk.


But I don't wanna be that one..
That's a different topic tho.


If I think about how she'll find someone else really quick it just hurts.

I don't wanna say I'd feel cheated..

I just think I'd be hurt and depressed.


I feel like I'd be the crazy guy that I don't wanna be.


I also don't wanna bring that topic back up to her because I think she actually is done with it and I'd just make her feel worried about me.

(When we talked about that a month ago we both cried and she said things like she feels like she's enden a relationship and doesn't want to hurt me or make me feel sad/bad)

I also think that she could drift into seeing me as an annoying teenager that can't stop thinking about her and annoying her.


Maybe I am that guy.

But I don't wanna be that guy.

But I also don't know how to not be that guy..

He gets focused on one topic and will not let it go to the point that my dad gets really angry with him. Sometimes it’s about how much he wants the new Smash Bros. game, other times he repeats jokes that might have been funny at first until we want to rip our hair out. He will ignore what my parents ask him to do until my dad yells, which makes him cry, but he’ll usually go do what he’s asked at that point.

117,"Hi!

I'm a student in college who has interests in tech/engineering. I have internships at very very prestigious silicon valley companies, but I also have an offer from the agency for an analyst position. Analysis involves getting information and writing notes. The job is in Washington DC, and I live far away from the east coast. The offer pays less (in salary and benefits) than what I get paid in silicon valley. The position is an overt position, so I can technically put it on my resume, but here's the main problem:

I was raised in a country in the middle east that hates America. My parents are from there too, but I was born here in the US, so I have both citizenships. My parents, who live with me in the US, might have to go back to said country at some point--they don't have a green card--and I might need to visit them. Thing is, this country has had a history with the CIA and I don't know if it's safe for me to associate with the agency. The 2016 Office of Personnel Management released data on all government workers, including candidates who were considered for top secret clearance. The moment I submit my SF-86 form, I will be added to this list, and any hack in the future will not only give my personal information to people in said country, but my parents and extended family too. Anyways, it's not difficult for said country to figure out that I worked at the agency.

Now the question is, will the safety of my parents and I be jeopardized when I submit this form, or if I join the agency? Should I turn down an opportunity to experience something few people experience?

122,"Hey guys, so I need some guidance on what my next step is in terms of my finical life. 

(TLDR at bottom) 

  
I'm currently studying at uni and just finished my first year, and plan to continue my bachelors for a few more years. During my first year I worked at Kmart, I was cutting boxes open as a casual (decant), It was super boring and I only lasted about 12 months before a quit because I couldn't maintain focus on it for longer then a month and then I would do some dumb shit. I had a conversation with my boss about this and he said I can leave or get my act together, so I left.   


After this ordeal I decided that I hated working, the concept of working a 9-5 or even a casual job just makes me feel miserable because I know I'll hate the work. So I decided to get into day trading, it took me about 4 months and $800 to kinda get the hang of it, just recently did it feel like I could make money and not have to work for it, this felt amazing. So I started on a Thursday and Friday, and made a good profit, it was around $200. (I should mention that I'm not working, and haven't been for awhile, I've been living off $300 a fortnight for ages) So $200 on the first 2 days felt amazing, the next week was okay, I was up $600 in the first week, however I had some really bad days and lost most if it and my account went down to about $70, the Friday just gone, I managed to get back up to $250 (I started with $200). Then this week as been shit,  I stared Monday with a $30 loss, Tuesday came and I lost everything, I guess I got greedy and angry that I had so much losses, at this point I've lost $1000 on investing my own money, and with the profits I've made over time and lost them as well, I've probably lost +$2000 all up.   


Now this is we're my problem is, I just got my $300 a fortnight, I need to buy Christmas gifts for the family and some friends, I need to pay my phone bill as well, and with all this it doesn't look like I can add more funds and try again for the next two weeks. My problem is I was hoping to have this day trading thing down pat by the end of the year, so I could go into 2019 and not have to work and I could still have a pretty good income. Now I don't know If I'm ever going to see this day or if I should just call it quits on the hole thing and just work for the rest of my life.   


TLDR: I don't want to work for a living, I wanted to day trade, and the moment I think I can actually make my dreams come true, I fuck it up and I'm unsure weather I should just give up on my dreams and just work for the rest of my life. ",19Dec2018,1
124,"So, I completed my engineering UG in 2015 and got offered a role at a huge MNC. There was a waiting period of 6 months before I could start working there so I thought I'll do some part time work and decided to take up writing as an alternate job.

After a few months, I joined the MNC and worked there for 16 months. I put all my blood and sweat to the company. I agreed to work even at mid-night hours(1:00 AM to 10:00AM) when no one was ready to. I literally did this alternating between regular and night shift to work at that company. 

But as soon as the rating time came, my manager ditched me and gave me the lowest rating possible. When I confronted about this to him all he replied was ""you did good, do the same thing and next year you'll get better rating"". I got frustrated and quit immediately because I didn't want to work at a place which didn't give me basic recognition for the work I've done.

Anyway, after 2 months, I joined as a writer at another company and worked there for 12 months. I went into depression while I was working there because of my ex leaving me and getting married to someone else. I couldn't concentrate and couldn't handle the pressure. So I decided I'll do my masters in the US and go back to the tech industry.

I quit my job, scored a good GRE, and applied to 4 universities and got rejected by all the 4.

I don't know why because I have seen people who have got low grades than me easily got accepted by multiple universities and are already studying there. The rejection could be because of my year gap.

Anyway, I decided I would do something about it and started taking online courses to up-skill. I finished a couple of courses and did some side projects to build up my profile but I'm being rejected by every single company out there because of my year gap and also because I worked as a writer for a year.

The thing is I'm applying for an entry level IT related job and even there I'm getting reject and my buddies at college are working at mid to senior level roles. I know they have it better because they stuck to the field.

What do I do to make my career shift to normalcy?

133,"So it's finals week and I'm really plummeting as far as mental health goes all thanks to my stress from school and finals.

I'm a high school sophomore and I want to be either a surgical oncologist or a psychiatrist; however, my grades are HORRENDOUS and my standardized test scores are even worse. 

I have no self confidence or motivation, especially  because my best efforts don't even get me where I need to be. I get screamed at (literally) at home and in the car because of my scores..

I currently have an A in:
tv prod (92)
Spanish (102)
ap world (92.6)
hnrs biology (93.5)

I have a B in:
hnrs english (89)

I have a darned C in:
hnrs algebra 2 (78)

For freshman year my PSAT score was 1160 
And this is what destroyed me:
my score this year was 
EXACTLY THE SAME.

The only difference is my reading went down and my math went up.

I studied for the psats actually, and I still did terribly, while kids in my classes are scoring 1400s without preparation.

I feel so stupid and useless. I'll forever be a failure and I feel I will never accomplish anything i want to achieve. I am already reminded that i am a disappointment.

I have already been battling depression for 9-10 years and school is just reinforcing my hatred towards myself. 

Even my A's in my classes are just low A's.
Finals are this week, too and I'm definitely not prepared. I studied all weekend and followed suggested study tips and avoided the internet, but I'm still completely clueless about everything.

I'm sure my AP world final will bring me down to a B. 

I want to boost my 89 in English to an A but I will probably keep a high B which will bug me forever.. and our final is an essay and we have to memorize 4 quotes from 2 books we read in order to support our claims and I haven't dedicated nearly any time to memorizing the quotes I gathered.. It also doesn't help that I don't even know what I'm going to really make claims on. Definitely gonna do poorly...

I fear I won't do well in biology because some of the topics are just nonsense to me and I will probably go down to a B.

And math is just torture for me to think about. I dedicated 90% of my study time to math and yet I'm already forgetting what I'd reviewed and I don't even know how to do anything to begin with.

Also, none of my teachers round grades up, so my 89.5 will stay an 89.5 and my semester grade will show up as a B

My grades are bad and I can't even make up for them with my standardized test scores. 

I'm in clubs but I live almost an hour away from my school (because the school in my town is basically drug city) so I'm unable to attend most meetings and it's usually either a huge inconvenience for my family or i just cannot go out of town to conduct volunteer work.

I am struggling so much internally. I want to do better but i feel hopeless.

135,"I’m in my mid-twenties and share an apartment with my mother who’s in her mid-forties. Long story short I as well as my two older brothers have been helping her financially with bills since our teens. I’m the only girl. Well we recently relocated to another state which has been a somewhat disaster for me. She planned to relocate with a man she barely knew who left the same day we came to the apartment and hasn’t been back since. Also stopped paying his portion of the rent and bills which puts me in a bind because we had an agreement on how much I would pay so that I could save money and move into my apartment. She stated she felt he was a fraud which is why she begged for me to come which makes no sense. Now I’m going half with her. She’s even asked for extra money which I do not and will not give. I still plan to do move within the next year or so and pursue my passion…At this point I resent her because I feel throughout the years, she’s taken from me financially and emotionally. I’ve been working since the age of 14 (by choice) and have taken care of myself for the most part since. She began demanding that I pay bills! I even gave her an entire income tax check when I was younger which I regret because knowing what I know now that money didn’t all go to rent. Growing up the home was not family oriented (more like a rooming apartment). She was verbally abusive and emotionally as well. Will talk about all her kids to one another which pit us against each other at times but the oldest (since he started working and taking care of the household young (9th or 10th grade and giving her all his money due to manipulation, lies and being a sucker) was and still seems to be her favorite. I’m just sick of being around her and seriously resent her. Since I was younger, she smoked A LOT of weed and spends way too much money on lottery which tons of her money went to (now that we’ve moved, she stop smoking but seems to be turning to alcohol). She would always tell us “Every man for themselves growing up which I’ll never forget because that what it became unless SHE needed something. She’s never had much in life and currently doesn’t have a car which I do but I barely let her use it anymore because she doesn’t help me with it and when she has in the past she’s tried to throw it in my face which I explain to her; If you’re using my car she has to assist when needed. Now I just pay it on my own. I’ve realized she’s a user and has been financially abusing her kids. Overall, She was in my life, but she wasn’t there if that makes sense. I had to figure everything out on my own with little to no guidance from her or others helped me. It seems she’s fine with just getting by as long as there’s assistance. But I’m not. I have goals and great plans for my future, but I need to get away from her immediately because she’s no help for me. I have a lot of childhood trauma that I’m not over but have forgiven her for, for my sake but I want to begin my life without her in it and I honestly don’t care to keep in contact with her when I do. I feel I’ve sacrificed enough for her. She has nothing to show for her life and can still be negative when it comes to things myself or middle brother wants to do. I’m at my wits end. I refuse to take care of her and end up like her in my near future due to me constantly helping her get by. I eventually plan to go out and socialize so that I can be away from home and her more when I’m not working (I’m an introvert at heart) Is there anyone else that can relate or can just give me encouraging words or some advice with this situation? Thanks! Also, is it wrong that when I move on my own that I keep little to no contact due to my mental health and financial growth. She’s a liability to me and should be doing more with herself in my opinion. She’s said she isn’t sure what she’s going to do now that we are all branching on out own (“woe is me”) but oh well. I have my own life and possible future kids to plan for and raise with stability. I’m over caring for a narcissistic, manipulative, sad individual that can’t even save or fend for herself without asking for help. It’s pathetic to me honestly.

At 18, the choice seemed clear to move up with him, but I have been in a seriously committed relationship for 2 years and was reluctant to leave her behind.

After some disputes in upper management, I was eventually let go in place of a larger IT company. Still though, I exhausted my savings in staying nearby to her, opting to focus on finishing the semester at college since most serious IT firms demand full time hours.

After all this time though, I can't stop imagining the life where I am not caught in the perpetual stress of work, school, girlfriend, endlessly in loop with little to show for it. I fantasize constantly about the freedom to explore the frankly beautiful new city my parents moved to, with the opportunity to stack some change and not worry about the time-consuming girlfriend, with whom I have found impossible to explore other aspects of myself or generally see other people, as our relationship seems to demand more of my life with time. I suppose this is natural.

150,"Hello everyone,

I am a 2nd year graduate student. I am working at the same lab with a person who started the program with together.

We were great to each other in the beginning. We did not have friends and took the same classes, so we had lunch and dinner and studied together very often. 

The “friendship” started going downhill around the time when I started publishing first-authored papers while he did not have no first-author paper and was stuck in his research. Every now and then he peeped at my screen and talked about how my work was going well and my accepted papers. Also I think around the time he started developing friendship with his collaborator and the collaborator’s colleagues. 

We haven’t had a single meal together for months, just two of us. He always has meals and hangs out with the friends. I can feel his “slight” coldness towards me compared with other colleagues. I feel like he is just treating me as a colleague. He always tries to act like a cool person but he got snappy at me a couple of times before. 

There is no evidence that he started looking at me in a different way compared with one or two years ago when we were great. But I can definitely feel it.  
If some of you think that I should just stay with him as a colleague, then how can I develop a healthy relationship? I feel like we are not even great colleagues compared to my collaborators. I barely know their personal life but we work very effectively.

Any tips?

152,"**QUICK background:** I grew up in a very turbulent, controlling, aggressive (verbally) relationship with mom - we are currently working on stuff and getting better. I ruined my first relationship (age 17-19) because I was always condescending and critical of him, I was pretty controlling and was prone to be very dependent on him due to my issues with anxiety/depression. I ruined one of my best friendships this past summer because I was always too critical and controlling and negative towards everyone and everything.

**Problem**: For the past year I have really, REALLY tried to be conscientious of what I say, do, etc. and how I treat people. But it still keeps hitting me in the face and I fail pretty bad. I will be good about it for a couple weeks or so but then end up back in my old ways. 

I have been with my current boyfriend for about 1.5 years. He is the most patient, kind human being I have met and both him and his family are so gentle and kindhearted. I love them to death and couldn't imagine losing them. 

The thing is, I am often critical and controlling with him. He broke up with me for 24 hours on Sept. 18 until he came back and said he couldn't imagine losing me. I knew I really needed to make an effort now and things were going great for a while, with him, my friends, my mom... 

But, I don't know what it is. I feel like I am now stuck in my old ways. Making dumb, critical comments for no reason, trying to control everything. I want to get better FOR MYSELF. This isn't for him. This isn't for my mom. This isn't for my best friend. I want to be kind, patient, and gentle. Everything I am not. 

**Examples** (very minuscule things, but they add up and I know how frustrating it must be for him), he broke his tooth snowboarding yesterday and got it fixed this morning, he came over for lunch and joked he needed some soft food or something because his tooth hurts, and I immediately shot back ""it's your very front tooth. the majority of food you could eat you wouldn't even chew with tooth. so you're fine."" Like??? Why the fuck do I need to say that. I don't know?? THEN we went outside shovel the front driveway and I asked him to get the snow from under my car and he said he would get to it, and he went to the end of the driveway to shovel some other stuff first and I got very upset with him that he didn't shovel that snow under my car and he just left it for me and why didn't he do it when I asked cause he said he would? Why could he not just ask me to instead? Blah blah blah. Like? Why the fuck does it matter. It is literally the smallest deal ever. I don't know why in these moments I get so irritated and upset. 

Any suggestions to un-fuck up my mentality towards everything would be great, thanks!

156,"Hi, I’m 22 and I recently became my mother’s legal caregiver after my sister quit. It was forced onto me. My stepdad used to take care of my mum but he died shortly after my 21st birthday. He overdosed on heroine. For a little extra backstory, my mum is mentally and physically ill but can still function for the most part on her own. She has trouble walking and has a permanent neck/spinal issue that requires assistance when dressing and showering/etc, so that’s what I’m there for now. A little TMI I guess but it’s relevant to the rest of this. 

I currently live with my partner on my own a ways away from my mum, I moved out years ago due to the bad environment I used to be subjected to (was 16 when I left). Things have always been really rocky with my family but I can’t deal with them anymore, it’s like I’ve finally snapped... I feel completely stuck and I don’t know what to do. And I have no one to go to about this. 

Before my stepdad died I kept to myself and hardly talked to anyone in my family aside from my mother to check in with her, because despite all of her terrible decisions in life, I do love her. But now, I can hardly so much as text her without fuming with anger. It used to be a gradual irritation that I could easily ignore, but now I am CONSTANTLY and consistently frustrated and angry with her whenever I see her. Which is a lot, now. It’s getting harder to hold my tongue. 

She seems to think she’s clever enough to hide all of her symptoms of drug and alcohol abuse. I take care of her 5 days a week for 2 weeks out of the month. She is very different when intoxicated yet she tries to lie to me and tell me she isn’t doing anything. Why lie? I know what she does!! I always have!! I tell her to be honest in the very least but she just won’t?! Even when it’s all so painfully obvious. The number one thing I hate is the lying. Just fucking own up to it. 

I don’t live with her, I can’t control what she gets into when I am not there. I can’t send her to rehab, that wouldn’t help. I don’t even know how to do that?! I know for a fact it wouldn’t help. She’s so broken mentally after my stepdad died, if I took her away from her “safe space” I know that would kill her more than some dope would. She SAYS she isn’t doing heroine and to be honest I do believe that. I think it’s just cocaine... that is her drug of choice... but it doesn’t fucking matter what the drug is. It’s just fucked up. 

Now I’m responsible for her and I feel like a stupid and terrible person. Like what am I supposed to do here?! My sister forced this onto me. She’s 30 years old and a few months into caregiving for our mom she just said hey, can you do this, I can’t stand our mother. I accepted because, well fuck, I feel obligated?! And to be honest, the money from the government for taking care of her does help me too. I hate to say that because I don’t want to make money off of my sickly mother. But that’s how it is when you’re a caregiver.. it’s hard work /: 

Anyway my sister refuses to talk to us now and likes to “vague post” on Facebook about the family and how awful everything is which is just adding to my stress. Like goddamn please keep your (OUR) personal life to yourself???? But fuck do I wish I were as lucky as her to just be able to cut ties like that. I’m legally bound so I can’t. And morally I couldn’t either... 

I’m 22 and I’m trying to pull away from the negative lifestyle I was born into. I live in my own home with my partner and I’m so happy here. But I keep getting pulled back into all of this. And I literally cannot escape it. Even if I weren’t my mother’s caregiver, I’m still obligated to check on her and to care. And I do care! I care way too much! I wish I didn’t! I just can’t win with this. I feel like I’m permanently plagued. I just want to live my own life. I have my own goals and aspirations but I’m stuck taking care of people that hardly took care of me (I’m not only referring to my mother here)... I hate saying this but I wish I were born into a “normal” family. I really do. I should be able to live my life without feeling guilty. I can’t go a day without getting guilt tripped by someone. Especially my mother...

157,"Hey, guys.. How are you? I hope you are feeling at least ok.

&amp;#x200B;

There is one question in my mind. Is it possible for life to not be shitty?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in a relationship with a girl for 3 years. When we first got together I was 26 and she was 23. Now I am 29 and she is 26. She is at my age when we first met. It is kinda important, I will tell you why in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last 2 years we live together. I pay all the expenses because I have a job while she is still studying for her degree. These 2 years have been the most depressing years of my life. It feels like I dont even live. I work as much as possible to cover what expenses we may have, and also save some money for future investments that may secure us.

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't like my present life at all. I understand that when you don't have a degree getting a decent job is impossible, so I don't complain about me being the one covering all the expenses, although it is tiring. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I just feel like that my gf doesn't care about me. No matter what she says, she seems that she isn't able to care. Maybe she wants to, but cant really care. For example, when I tell her that I don't like being interrupted when working, she doesn't interrupt me for like 1-2 days. Then she starts again, and it feels like she forgot completely what I said about this. Then I have to say it again and again. And it has been going like that for 2 years. Sometimes I think I will have a mental breakdown by repeating myself again and again.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that no relationship is perfect from the start and you need to work on it, but how much longer should I try? She seems to not give a fuck about how I feel unless I get loud and angry. But this is not me, I am a quiet person, I don't like being loud and angry. I feel forced into the role of an agressive male. I have told her that and for a while she was trying to respect my limits without making me angry. But that didn't last long.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, I just accept that my life is shitty and that she is doing whatever she wants while I am trying to maintain my health. But really, I feel like a caged animal.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that annoys me a lot, is that she follows me only in bad habits. I work tirelessly and focused for long hours but sometimes I may eat some sweets to boost my energy. Then she copies only my bad eating habits, without copying my hard work habit as well. Problem with that is, that when I get an extra pound, she also does. Maybe this is fair, but I am not attracted to her anymore. Sex is very mediocre. Not bad but not good either. I could lose weight, but to lose weight I need to work less hours and have more time for relaxing and working out. Stress does contribute to gaining fat, and since I work almost all day I have a hard time losing weight with 1 hour of gym a day.

I don't know. I feel like this is a dead-end. I can't lead her to good eating habits, I can't lead her to getting a job. I can't set boundaries. I don't know what to do.

160,"Sorry in advance for the novel.  X-posted from TIFU, since no one bit.  


 A few days ago I went over to my sister-in-law's house to replace my mother-in-law's tail light on her Ford ranger. It had rolled down the big hill their house sits on and hit their address post pretty hard but no major damage.

My sister-in-law's husband is underway in the Navy and she has a full cast on her leg because she recently had foot surgery and so I just wanted to help out a little bit.

Got a new tail light on Amazon four screws and it was a pretty easy fix.

Then she mentions that her oil maintenance light came on and she asked her dad to do an oil change but he is too busy with work. She had all the supplies and everything that are has been in left with the car and just hadn't had a chance to do before they left.

Since I was there and I have my tools in the trunk I figured it wouldn't be a big deal.

I've done hundreds of oil changes and never had an issue. The local jiffy lube retightened my ex's drain plug with an impact so I told her not to take it there because I didn't want them to ruin her new to her 2007 Toyota 4Runner Limited, and most of the other shops in the area are either terrible or booked almost a month out.

Normally I would just YouTube an oil change video but the area she lives in is so remote I don't get service.

I climb under the car and start looking around, and there's only one drain plug. No problem same location is on my wife's Toyota minivan so I pop it open and it starts to drain an Amber oil.

I went and grabbed the filter off the top of the block, let it drain for a few minutes and then put everything back together and filled it up.

Oil read about a quart high but I figured it was on a serious incline so nothing too crazy. started it up got the oil light off everything sounded great.

Get a text the next day from my wife, car locked up, needed to tow it.

Apparently the drain plug for the oil is under a plastic skid plate that looks like an axle cover. The plug that I took off was an overfill port for the transmission and as a result she drove her car overfilled with oil and without transmission fluid for about 30 miles.

Cashing out my 401k so she can get it fixed. I found a cheaper reman unit and probably could have gotten installed this weekend but she wanted to have the dealer do it and I'm going to pay for it so FML.

TL;DR : tried to change the oil on my crippled sister-in-law's car, accidentally drained all the tranny fluid and left her and the kids stranded in 30 degree weather with a useless brick of metal instead of a gearbox. Paying to fix it by cashing ouy my 401k and paying taxes out the ass.

Pretty bummed out to be honest. Not doing great financially and this is going to hurt a lot.

in case you're wondering what the setup looks like I've included this picture.

Anyway, I called around and found a good used one with a warranty, new filter and fluid for 950, and a shop to install it for 1,400.  She didn't want to do this, went to the dealer instead and It's almost 5k.  


Wife says I should just pay the money, I think that's bullshit.  Pretty mad about it.  She says it's her sister's car so she should be able to choose how to fix it.  I think it's fair to pay for diagnosis, and a good used one to be installed, to make her whole with what she had before.  Not to pay a dealer to install a brand new one in an 11 year old car.",19Dec2018,1

162,"BACKGROUND: I'm having an issue right now. I struggle with a couple of mental health issues that make it hard for me to be outgoing and take risks and for the last 3 years I haven't asked a girl out. 

One would say, ""Ok, that's kinda weird a teenage boy isn't going after every single girl that goes by"" but my first ""real"" relationship was an incredibly abusive one. I was constantly manipulated and lied to and couldn't break up with this girl because she threatened to commit suicide if I did. This has really turned me off to the of dating anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also kinda a quirky guy and there are certain times that I just want to shoot myself when I stay stuff because people will look at me like I'm a complete idiot when I say stuff so I'd say I'm kinda a hard person to like. 

&amp;#x200B;

THE QUESTION: Essentially, to ask or not to ask. There's this girl who I'm pretty interested in and she's super sweet and most importantly she doesn't find me repulsive. The only issue is that we don't talk a whole lot. I don't know if I should start trying to talk to her or text her or something or if I should just say ""screw it"" and just ask her out. Another issue I have is that Finals are this week and end on Thursday. Do I wait till after finals but then either see her once (if she says yes) and then not see her for two weeks or ask her and wait two weeks until I actually go out with her?

163,"So I need some advice. When my roommate and I first moved in, we once said “no girls are moving in” and that was the last of that. It quite possibly could of been a joke. Recently my Significant Other and I have been discussing a future and the topic of moving in came up. We’re both very considerate and my roommate does not mind her being here 5-6 nights a week. She doesn’t stay while I go to work but she pretty much is here from the time I get off of work to the time I leave for work. How do I bring this up to my roommate? It wouldn’t be until May so also, when should I bring this up to him?",19Dec2018,1

165,"Back story: Just looking for some genuine advice. I got dumped about a week ago, or rather “ghosted” from a 3 year relationship. We got into a huge fight and he just left, blocked me off everything, got new social media accounts and completely erased me from his life. I am at a complete lost. We had plans, a future, we really planned this. However we were toxic. It is difficult for me to actually go out and move on as he was my best friend, my ride, my source of friendship and social groups. Pathetic I know. Well, I have one more semester left before I graduate from university, and I wanted to start fresh, leave the city completely. 

I am from Vancouver and would like to move to Toronto for jobs and just start new. I was wondering in these 4 months what my genuine chances of for physically leaving this place is, or if it just sounds like a hope and useless desire? Is it possible? To get a job, to get a place, to actually carry through with this? I feel really insane already, but this is what I know I want. I can not stay here. If I were to find a job in Toronto how would I do interviews? I’m really not sure if it’s possible in 4 months and would like some advice from someone who’s gone through this or actually thought of this? Anything helps. ",19Dec2018,1

I moved across the country a few years ago and we've kept in contact through monthly e-mails and the occasional gifts she would send during the holidays and on birthdays. As Christmas approaches I've been feeling worse and worse about our relationship. It's been years and she still keeps up contact, I feel like I haven't put enough effort into the relationship and I don't understand why she continues to show such love.

168,"So to start this off I guess I should say I’m not suicidal currently. This may sound like a ramble but I promise it all plays it part in the end. I’m a 20 year old guy who’s a 8/10ish and lives in a decently sized city. My life hasn’t been long but it’s been very convoluted. I had grown up with mostly a single mother while the man I thought was my father spent most of my early life in prison. I was an only child up until my parents had another when I was 7. After that I started to become second fiddle and it was very clear everyone liked my sibling more than me. This trend continues btw I hold no resentment on my maternal sibling, she’s actually my favorite person. When I reached what my parents thought was a mature age (13)  they informed me my dad wasn’t my actual father. It was devastating and I think it was the trigger of my depression. After that my mom dated my non biological fathers bestfriend for 4 years and immediately moved him in. It was hell being caught between a love triangle that I don’t care for or participate in.  There was fights between all 3 of them and of course the kids were used as negotiation terms. My biological father had completely disowned me and never wanted anything to do with me because my mom was white even though the man has over 15 kids. I never to this day have seen him but have encountered my paternal siblings. I unknowingly almost dated a sister and fought 2 of my brothers. I only got to interact with them because of public school. It’s also pretty unlucky because his kids range from now 5-32 in age. I’ve always been more intelligent then most of the kids around me so I never struggled in school, I just lacked motivation. My first girlfriend ever was in my senior year of highschool she took my virginity and lied to the school saying I raped her. No one believed her because I was a nerd who showed close to 0 interest in sex at that point. My family who are now super religious constantly try to shove religion into everything, they don’t know I don’t believe. My leading theory is that they would ostracize me if they found out. Makes the anxiety pump. Soon after all that I went to university much to my joy on a damn near full scholarship for engineering. I fucked this up by enjoying the independent life too much, smoking too much weed which I still do, not wanting to study in my room because of a really shitty roommate and constantly being bugged by family while I was away. I admit that I let those bring me down. I dropped after a year and returned home. Now 18 I started to work at a Dunkin’ Donuts and a shoe store to save for a car. Remember inner city family, single parent, 2 kids. I saved up 10k for my car and bought it. This started the downfall of my relationship with my mother however as she’s very controlling. I finally had the freedom time and money to do what I want. My mother and NBfather were not on good terms but I loved the man cause he chose to be in my life even though I wasn’t his. He was also diabetic and had just recently gotten a leg amputated. I would go and hang out with him, drive him around and smoke with him since he was stuck in a nursing home. My mother didn’t like this. We argued about this and she kicked me out and I decided it was enough. She didn’t let me take anything beside what I had in my car, which was my DD uniform and a north face. I went to live with my NB fathers mother on a much worse side of town. This side of the family is primarily drug dealers also. After quitting the shoe store cause I no longer had that uniform I spent all my remaining money on clothes because I had none. I was extremely broke with a minimum wage job working 35~ hours a week. I was and still am young so I spent money on dumb stuff also. My NB uncle told me that if I wanted to continue living where I was I would have to start selling since he pays the bill for that house. I had already had debts from Uni and I needed money so I agreed. My mother logged into my Facebook from my computer at her house and caused a shit storm when she found out. Rightfully so. A little after I started selling I met a girl who also had a traumatic past and we clicked everything was all good there until it suddenly wasn’t. I had other females in my life in between the first and this one but they’re not really consequential. We dated for 9 months and she cheated and would constantly berate/ belittle me. Right before we broke up I moved back in with my mother because my NB father was threatening  her life because she wouldn’t let him see his daughter. Prior to this me and my mom came to an agreement and we were cordial. I moved back in with her and a month later my NB father died( happened this summer). He wasn’t always a great man but he was my dad. I still haven’t recovered from that. His side of the family always treated him like a piece of shit, they had reasons but still he was family. No one bought anything for him at the funeral besides me, my mother, and maternal grandmother. His own child wasn’t fond of him since he was in jail most of her life and was arguing with my mom he rest. so she was unphased. Since then I’ve kinda been filling the void with more weed and women. I usually use protection beside for 3 instances. All of them tried to pin pregnancy because of what I think is this factory job where I make 60k a year. I recently started working here actually around my birthday(end of summer). I also hate everything about this job besides the money. I’m half black and work with conservative red necks for 13 hours a day. It’s a dangerous job where management treats you like shit. Every girl I’ve tried to date since only wants me for sex, which perpetuates me filling the void with more weed and more women. I feel myself becoming disconnected from the world and just trying to recede into my head which doesn’t help.
I have like huge trust and abandonment issues now from friends, girls and family. It’s becoming too much ,how the hell do I become happy and accept my past and build off it. Sorry if this is too long and sloppy I’m on 3 hours of sleep 7 hours into this shift.",19Dec2018,1
169,"It's been on my mind for awhile now, but lately I've been feeling that a close friend of mine has become very materialistic and shallow. In the past, I may have let it slide but as time passes you find less patience for these kind of things. I used to get all excited to hang out, and to share my news with her. However, it's just not the same anymore as I feel she can be very judgmental. She tends to look down on people from lower professions and although she tries to hide her disdain you can see the look of disgust on her face. For example, I used to be in an Arts degree and she would make fun of me saying what jobs can you get from that degree. Currently, I am now in Engineering and I really enjoy it and I tell her that. Unfortunately, I don't think she is happy for me and in fact is jealous now maybe because she's afraid I'll eventually surpass her in terms of salary.  

Most people would think she's sweet, but that makes it even worse when you realize deep down she's not as sweet as she tries to portray herself as. Another example of her shallowness is when she constantly complains about her boyfriend. When I reassure her that any guy would be lucky to have her, she just does a 360 degree turnaround and admits that he would never leave her because she's beautiful and caring or some shit like that. In the end, she just wanted someone to stroke her ego. 

I've been debating for awhile whether or not to stay friends with this person. I don't want to burn the bridge, but at the same time I don't want to hang out anymore either because I know her personality won't change. ",19Dec2018,1
170,"So my girlfriend’s dad took out student loans under her name. However, due to a medical condition he has some mild short term memory loss to the point where he cant’t even remember the company name where the loans came from. She’s tried calling the financial office at her school and everything but they just tell her it’s a personal issue. The real fear is that during this time the interest is just building and her credit is possibly getting ruined. Loan forgiveness offices keep calling her phone but they don’t have any answers as to where she borrowed from. Any advice on how to figure it out would be much appreciated ",19Dec2018,1
171,"So a bit of background: I moved out when I was 16 and dropped out of high school so I could pick up day shifts for extra cash. I’ve wanted to be a medical doctor since as long as I can remember and I’ve spent the last 10 years doing everything I can to get to that goal. 

It’s taken what feels like forever because I was flat broke for ages, got into a super abusive marriage at 18, had a kid, my spouse committed suicide... it’s been a whole thing. 

But this summer I finally completed a Bachelor’s in science. I’ve done research and presented it, I had good grades, I volunteered, I have my letters if recommendation, I’ve shadowed physicians, I took the MCAT... I have my whole application ready. 

Annnnnnnnnd, suddenly I’m dreaming about being a teacher. I’ve finally made it, I’m ready to apply, and instead of feeling excited I’m dragging my feet and feeling guilty for daydreaming of teaching an elementary school class or older kids as a science teacher. I’m looking up things on how I would make that jump. And this isn’t quite so suddenly... I started thinking this prior to my graduation but pushed it to the back of my mind. But now, it’s front and center and on my mind constantly. 

I’ve tried to casually share these thoughts with some of my closest friends and they all tell me that I’m just tired and medicine/science is my real passion. I’ve worked too hard. I should consider going PA or nurse practitioner if I’m deciding I don’t want to try for medical school, etc etc. A couple have even expressed surprise because they didn’t think I liked working around kids all that much. 

And now I’m so confused. I know I’ve worked so hard for this one route and many days I do still think I really want it... but I have a lot of reservations cropping up. I know how intense I get about school and work and I feel like I would lose myself in this field. I’ve looked at how I was in school, how I think I will be if I continue this route, and I don’t think I will be the type of person I want to be. There are a lot of things I’ve learned recently that I enjoy outside of this ONE BIG DREAM I’ve had that I think I can highlight and share through teaching. 

But I’m terrified of making a big change like this. I’ve built the entire last decade on working toward this one goal and now I’m considering an entirely different route. And all of my closest friends are telling me I’m wrong and giving up on my passion/dream. I’m worried they won’t love me anymore or will think I’m a failure or a quitter if I change course. Or what if this IS a mistake and I regret this later on? 

I have no idea what to do but I need to make some sort of decision soon. I want to get started on a real career path soon. I can’t dick around forever. I’m so lost and confused. I never once doubted I wanted to be a doctor until now and now I feel like I don’t know who I am/what I want. ",19Dec2018,1

He was telling me how he had been drinking litres of alcohol a day lately, how he hadn't been going to work and also about how he had smoked meth and heroine. He also told me about how over the last couple of years he has spent £15,000 on cocaine.

I know one of these days my parents will find out about my drug use and they will break down as they have done in the past when I nearly quit my job one time.

I can't live with the pressure that I have to succeed from my parents. And I can't bare the thought of knowing that my brother is destroying himself, I love him so much, this world was not meant for him or me.

I wish I wasn't born, I would kill myself, but I know that if I did it would completely ruin my parents lives - 1st son a junkie, the second killed himself. They would likely kill themselves too.

202,"Earlier this year I was fired from my job as an overnight stocker at Walmart after getting in trouble with the law (was found in possession of marijuana and paraphernalia).

All charges were misdemeanors and I ended up paying off all my fees by using up my entire tax return. Now I'm flat broke and living with my folks without any sort of income.

I've applied to many places with little to no results. I've had 4 interviews in the last few months but never landed those jobs because I assume they don't like what they see on my background check.

To my knowledge I'm not eligible for unemployment pay because of the circumstances of my termination at Walmart. Is there any alternative financial help I can get while I continue looking for a job?",19Dec2018,1
203,"He is not happy unless the conversation is about him, he has a large and looked after beard that he grooms constantly and does not stop talking about it, and if he is not talking about his beard then it's either his weight training and how he is ""getting back into form"", either of these are the main topic for his discussion, and if it's neither of those then it's his ""anxiety"" or his daughter.

I know I sound like a dick, and I probably am, but I keep to myself for the most part - I can't tell him just to stop talking about himself all the time, cause he is sort of (?) nice and he is also pretty beefy, plus that approach is not really my thing.

She tells him her room number without thinking and gives him the wrong idea by accident. He says they should hang out and that he leaves tomorrow. Being non-confrontational she brushes it off and goes back to the table to eat with you and the guy sees you two eating together.

&amp;#x200B;

A few minutes later he comes up to both of you at the table to tell her about some food she was waiting for at the buffet. She follows him back to the buffet to get the food and he again says they should hang out. Still not being confrontational she doesn't confirm or deny and goes back to eat with you.

&amp;#x200B;

Later in the day, the guy actually calls your hotel room using the room number. You pick up the phone, say “hello?” and he hangs up. You know it was him because she told you his room number and its on the caller id. All 3 of you will be in the same hotel for the next 24hrs and can cross paths at anytime.

205,"So, I’m not the best at distinguishing this stuff. When I love someone I tend to love them immensely and fully invest myself into what they care about, being around them etc. 

In particular I love this girl. We’ve been friends for years now. She’s originally from Budapest and myself from Co. Kerry. We met in an American high school. 
How I feel about her is a fathomless love, something I’ve never felt with anyone before. And I know it’s mutual. We tell each other “I love you”, we hold hands publicly, are extremely touchy-feely (but we are both from Europe so touchy-feely for Americans). We’re inseparable. She’s the light of my life, my anchor as well as my *kedvesem*. We have pet names for each other: I call her my kedvesem, my Honey Bunny (I’m Pumpkin to her, after the opening scene in Pulp Fiction). And so on. 

As I said I love her intensely. But I’m not sure if it’s romantic or just very strongly platonic. I’m not even going to mention sexual attraction because it goes beyond the physical to me - also she’s straight so that’s a hot chance in hell. She’s the person I’d want to spend the rest of my life with. She herself even said “I wish we were the last two people on earth. Then we’d be together all the time and have everything to us.” 

I feel what she feels. We may just be friends but I swear on the gods, my own sanity and my Nana’s tea pot that she is truly my other half. 

I’m just afraid of ruining our relationship if I mistake friendliness for romance. I can’t lose her. So I just need some closure. Are my feelings simply platonic? Romantic? I never got the hang of their difference so any advice would be brilliant.

209," 

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 10 years now. And he know's the one thing I have always been dreaming of since I was a kid was getting married and having a romantic proposal.

My boyfriend is a good guy, but terrible at things like choosing a ring and such. So he asked for my help, and I ended up choosing the ring he would once buy for a proposal. In a way it felt kind of uncomfortable for me, choosing my own ring, so it would not be a bing of a surprise for me when the proposal ever happened. But if he really needed this, I was glad to help him out anyway. Still, this felt very unromantic for me.

He also asked me for advice in the way I would like to be proposed. I said I would love it to happen in a romantic setting in nature or something of that kind. Like we have been mountan climbing some times, and it would have been nice if it happened when we reached the top and had an amazing view, But other ways were just as fine as well, als long as the nature and scenery was beautiful and the moment was kind of romantic.

So a couple of months ago our ten year anniversary was coming up, and I kind of felt in the air that he was going to propose then. (He was not so subtly hinting from time to tome) So to celebrate our anniversary we booked an especially special holiday to Norway with all of the excursions possible: waterfall, mountains, beautiful lakes,... any place there would have been romantic, so to me it was just perfect and my dream was about to come true. I confided in my friends and colleagues, because I have been dreaming out loud for years that my life goal was this romantic proposal, and every one was just cheering me on when I left to Norway with my partner.

Alas, when we woke up in the morning in Norway, he was just lying stretched out in bed and holding out the ring for me. There was not a very special speech in front of it, he didn't go down on his knees,... we had just woken up, still with sleep in our eyes and lying in bed.

To me at that moment it felt like I had a brick in my stomach and something was clenching my throat. Inside my head I was panicking so hard (Is he really asking it here? In the hotel room? lying in bed? Did we go all the way to Norway for this?) but the shock was so great for me and all I could do was to stammer an uncertain yes on auto pilot while forcing a smile on my face.

For the rest of our vacation I felt sick all the time, I got nauseous on every bus ride, got a very painful throat from trying to stop me from cyring, and I had no appetite for anything anymore.

On some of the last days I thought things could maybe still be saved. So I told him the truth about everything, that I actually always wanted a more romantic proposal somewhere outside in a beautiful landscape (like he asked me before, you know), and that just lying in bed (instead of the normal question on the knees) didn't really feel like a proposal at all but just 'giving me a ring'. So I asked if he was maybe up to it to ask and surprise me again on the holiday, since we were still in norway with some tours to go. But all I got was ""seriously??"" And my confidence just broke right then and I said on autopilot again to maybe forget it then.

Now we have been home for a couple of months, and we have been telling this big story to everyone that it happened on a very romantic place in Norway. The lie makes me sick with regret. Because I never got that beautiful proposal and we can never turn back time to make it right, and I feel very bad about lying. I proposed to say to people that I just wanted to keep our intimate moment a secret between ourselves, so in that way I wouldn't have to admit my dissapointment but I also wouldn't be lying. But it was his wish to tell another romantic story.

We are a couple of months further now and I still feel broken about it. It has been this dream I had for too long, and I probably had expectations that were too high, but I can't fight the sadness and regret and disappointment. Me and my partner talked about it for some time, but it always ended up in a fight, so I don't bring it up anymore.

Every day, when I drive home from work I'm crying in my car. Making sure that when my partner comes home in the evening I stop crying, wash my face and take a calming pill. I can't seem to find a healthy way to overcome this. I need to talk about this with people, but I feel I would rather die than admit to someone how our proposal really happened. I don't feel engaged at all. And I hate thinking about the wedding.

What can I do to fix my mind again? I try not to think about it too much, but I'm wearing the ring so every time I look at it everything comes right back up.

I don't want to hurt my partner. And I can't really talk about it with other people. I had never imagined this would have such a great impact on me.

216,"Okay, background information first for all you wonderful people;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Long story short - 2018 has been an awful year. A mental breakdown, hospitalization, girlfriend break up, etc. 

I am on medication, going into therapy and most importantly; on the road to recovery (slowly).

I used to get on extremely well with my auntie, me and my twin brother would visit every weekend and we loved going over. She would always have a clean house, good food, all the best auntie things - she was also known for having a dog, 'Glen', who was very well trained. My auntie has had about 8 'Glen's' in her time. 

As time passes, she has gotten unwell, Glen has passed away however she has a new puppy called 'Jocky' who is just adorable, every time I see him (or any dog really) i'm just filled with joy, I love dogs.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I really want a dog, a puppy (a **Border Collie** specifically, as that was Glen's breed - see above for details).

I feel having a dog will encourage me to look myself more and the house I live in, which is a 2 story maisonette/flat. I also feel that it will give me something to look forward to coming home from work, I work MON-FRI 0700-1530 and I think it would work with my sister who lives close by and also my brother and mother who would be able to help out now and then with feeding etc while I am away.

What are your thoughts, do you think this is a good idea or just another irrational decision of mine?

Thanks

So a little background here, my now ex-girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years. About 2 years ago she moved in with me and my parents because her parents were being shitty. About 3 months ago we moved in to an apartment with a coworker of mine. When we moved in she didn't have a job and he was working two jobs. She got a job that paid more than mine. About a week and a half ago she basically dumped me out on the curb, took everything I had except my computer and my bed, and forced me to move back in with my parents. I've tried to make the breakup amicable, despite having no idea why she was doing any of it. She has since taken the petty route and blocked me from every possible avenue I had to try to talk to her, even though she asked me not to and I haven't even attempted to.

  


And basically my question is... How do you move on from something like this? I already have a plan, so that I can improve myself and I guess on a physical level move on. I'll have a replacement car in a couple weeks, I just got a full time position at about twice my previous pay, and I fully intend to move back out before the end of the year, on my own terms this time.

But I can't sleep for more than a little bit at a time, I can barely eat, I honestly have no reason to continue living or improving myself because for the last 3 years her happiness was my only reason for existing.

What now, I guess is my question? How do you recover from this? I'm scared that I'll never get over her. I'm already beginning to feel incredibly lonely, even though I can't even begin to date while still living at my parents house.

231,"Things haven't really been going my way since I graduated highschool and I'm having a rough time moving forward with my life.

I need to give some backstory to give context to my current situation, but I'll try to keep it brief. When I graduated highschool a year and a half ago I took a long series of L's  in some ways due to my own actions and in other ways to forces outside of my control. 
1. I lost my admission to the university I had commited to going to because of a D I got in my last semester of my senior year in high school.
2. Because I lost my admission, instead of moving out,I continued to live with my toxic family and attended community college the following Fall. 
3. Because of questionable financial decisions, my family could no longer afford the house we were renting so we had to move from our home in southern California, where I had lived most of my life, to a small town about an hour outside of Atlanta to live with some other relatives until we could afford to rent a house. 

This all went down 5 months ago during my first year of CC in California so I just had to unenroll, say goodbye to my friends, and figure shit out once we got to Georgia. I just rolled with it because I didn't really know what else to do. My whole gameplan as a kid was to endure my school years until I was able to move into some dorm a thousand miles away from my folks. Getting hit by all these setbacks hurt pretty bad not just because I had to keep living with the family that I wanted so badly to get away from, but because I had to actually start earnestly thinking about what I wanted out of life and that scared the shit out of me. 
I honestly didn't want to go to college in the first place, it just seemed like something I had to do. My dream for a long time has been to make music. Now that I'm an adult that has to actually start earnestly considering what it takes to accomplish that dream, I'm starting to get overwhelmed by the reality of how far away my goals truly are. I have no money, no car, I'm slowly becoming disconnected with the friends who were there to support me, and I'm honestly barely an okay musian.I've spent the last 5 months sulking in my room all day, working on half assed tracks that I never released. I know things can't stay this way, I'm not just gonna sit around and pout because things aren't going the way I wanted, but I can't help but feel a bit defeated. 
I'm not exactly looking for specific advice on what steps I need to take to accompish my goals or anything, though I wouldn't mind it. I'm already going to interviews for jobs in my area and I've been practicing way harder to hone my skills as a musician lately. I'm guess the advice I'm looking for is how to be okay ( emotionally I guess) while working my way through adulthood? Like serious advice on how to not get crushed by exestential dread and anxiety and the like while I'm navagating my way through a shitty situation. I'm sorry if my phrasing is a bit wierd but I hardly understand the feelings I'm trying to convey... and I'm typing this at 4 A.M. while I'm half asleep. Ty in advance for your advice.

I think it's safe to say both of us got a bit fucked up after we got placed into foster care, I myself suffer from depression and anxiety, but after 4 years of therapy, it's starting to get better. I know my brother isn't ok since his personal hygiene is bad, he rarely cleans his apartment, he doesn't function in social events. There's been a few occasions where he has hurt himself intentionally and I'm afraid if he keeps living the way he does he's going to kill himself one day so I'm really starting to worry about him. 

I guess my question is, how can I help someone who is severely depressed, but also doesn't realize they need help? ",19Dec2018,1

236,"Sorry but I am going to sound like a jerk but here goes..

Recently I have been arguing alot with my parents especially my dad. It has come to the point where it’s completely disrespectful like ignoring them or answering back. Now, I have only been with him for the past three years, I only got to be with him when I was fifteen when me and my mom got our papers done and migrated to this country. Along with that came different ideals, ones we never agree on and usually argue about but I have learned to diffuse it a little bit by just staying quiet and not responding. 

My dad has flaws but is a good man. I never really liked the way he always talked shit about his pther coworkers and about how everydone did him wrong. He always had to blame someone and when he’s in the wrong, he can never even say the word sorry. Admitting he’s wrong is just not his thing. I admit, I resent him bc of this. Sometimes when I speak in English, he will imitate me and mock me and I get really annoyed. When I am trying to lose weight, he told me that it would never happen and tells me that I am stupid and close minded.  On the other side, he’s a good father who always finds ways to support the family. He always gives me advice on growing up and being in the real world. He always is patient and shows his love but I don’t know how to open up to him. 

Now, I also have my flaws. Like what I have mentioned above, I mostly dont respond to them when they’re asking me questions. I push them away and take everything for granted. My mom tells me I have changed and that is true. I just dont know what to feel anymore. I feel numb inside sometimes. I dont know what I want put of life. This is not an excuse but my parents dont deserve this.  They scold me, i say sorry and things calm down for a little while, but then it starts all over again. I need to change myself but i really need help on where to start. 

Again im sorry for being a jerk. I really need help on how to change this attitude of mine. ",19Dec2018,1

240,"I don’t really know how to start this but here we go.

About 8 months ago,I (F16) met my best friend (M17) and current boyfriend (M18). We became best friends instantly. We 3 started hanging out all the time and I don’t know what I would do without them.

Things have started to change recently tho. My best friend started taking ecstasy and other stuff a lot more frequently. I know that he had been smoking weed and stuff even before I met him but I haven’t really had a problem with that. 

My boyfriend has had a life of child abuse,a horrible home life and bullying. I know that he has been doing some drugs on party’s and stuff for like 2 years but not a lot. When we met 6 months ago we started out as friends,became best friends and then started dating. I know that he’s a good guy that deserves so much better than what has happened to him. He is one of the kindest and most caring people I know.

My best friend (M17) stopped going to school this semester and started doing drugs (mostly ecstasy,weed and some LSD) almost everyday. I feel like I’m  am losing him. He has changed so much and he’s lost his personality. He and my boyfriend has been friends for like 2 years. Recently my best friend started telling me that I have ruined my boyfriend because he doesn’t want to do drugs as much since he know’s that he’ll lose me if he does. He told me that I am a horrible person because I made my boyfriend “stop doing something he thinks is fun”. IT’S NOT FUN! It’s something that will ruin his life and brain forever.

I don’t know what to do. I am constantly scared of my boyfriend doing drugs because of he pressures of our best friend and I don’t want to lose him since he is the only thing I have. I’ve already lost a lot of friends to drugs and if I lose him I don’t know what to do. I feel completely lost and out of control. I can’t focus on anything besides helping the person I love most in this world.

243,"I just got destroyed on a final exam today and I'm feeling extremely down. Just a bit of backstory, I'm currently in an competitive major with a very small class size (around 24 people) and this exam was for one of my core courses to my major. I'll admit, I did not manage my time efficiently studying for the exam and basically crammed the entire course in 4 days (this was a pharmacology course); however, this is the first time that I couldn't perform as well as I wanted to despite cramming. I feel like there were high expectations for me to do well based on my previous performances on exams prior, but now I just feel inadequate compared to the rest of my classmates, and I feel like I don't really deserve to be where I am right now. I basically have zero interaction with the professors in my program; however, I know that they are quite proud of the prestige of the program itself, and I feel like I should at least apologize for my performance on an exam that was designed specifically for us. Not only am I feeling really disappointed in myself right now, but I also really feel like I've disappointed the expectations of the professors who hand-picked us during the application process. Is it appropriate to send an email to apologize for my performance and tell them that I'll work much harder next semester? I've never experienced this feeling before and I really have no one else to talk to about this because I don't want to lose face within my peers (I realize that this is a really toxic mentality, but my pride prevents me from doing so).

We had a toxic relationship, which honestly I see how I could be viewed a psycotic but it definitely goes both fucking ways. During the time we dated I stuggled with opiate use, stealing prescription drugs from my mom's safe and really awful shit like that. I've been clean (sorta) for awhile now. I wouldn't call it a problem anymore.  Maybe like once every 6 months now from after the problem. I just hate that I felt alone and isolated for sometime from people I don't really know.

247,"Ive known this guy for about 10 or so years, we've been pmuch through everything together on and off those 10 years, during this time he was thrown around a lot, being forced to live on europe for a good part of 4 years, and another 2 on asia, while i remained home, we still talked and hang out through skype and later discord.
He's helped me through a lot, my father's suicide, my mother's breakdown and depression, and other personal problems of my own, and I helped him through his time away from home too, the days where he told me every birthday he'd cry because he was just too far from the world he knew, and how he'd lost hopes of being able to go back home.
Point being, we've been best friends for a solid long time. And as best friends we have  a lot of inside jokes, some that we shouldnt joke about, like our experiences, or things happening in the world, but thats just how our humor went back in the day. I never thought anything of it, but due to time, we've grown a lot and in some ways, apart and in others, together, it simply happens, but I cant shake the fact that, lately he's said some things that resemble a few videos i've been watching about the alt-right and how they act on the internet, being in a country that recently elected an alt-right president i started trying to learn as much as i could about the subject to not fall onto any traps on the comming years, but my friend? I dont know what to do? The other day I noticed he made some very off-hand comments that are incredibly racist towards african-americans, and that rubbed me off the wrong way so much.
Im worried he himself might be falling onto a trap and starting to get these circular thoughts about racism and other things that sometimes perpetuates through the alt-right, how could I possibly help him?

249,"I just graduated from high school, and next year I'm planning to really take a break from academia and have that year to explore my other interests. 

I used to be in love with science, but I've found that senior year has... Put it to sleep. I want to do other things for now and take a break, however it seems like science might come back into my life eventually. 

In 2019, I am planning to sign up for a course for commercial cookery, while also working (maybe 16 hours a week or so) to earn money so I can move out. 

I also want to explore my love for acting as well and I want to take a part time course (not sure which one to take yet, I have yet to choose a school that seems right for me). I have also signed up as a volunteer at my local theatre company. 

How can I choose a way of living that allows me to explore all these interests without spreading myself too thin?

250,"I've always identified as straight. It's not because I'm super into guys and I just know. It's just that I appreciate men and hot men especially, and I've never really considered myself to be anything other than straight or even really given it much thought, I just assumed you know it was 'straight until proven otherwise' sort of like the legal system I supposed. 

The girl I have a crush on is a bit over a year older than me and also my manager at work (which isn't an issue in this situation). As far as I know, she is straight, although we did have a brief conversation about our sexualities which I will detail to the best of my very poor memory, later. 

My feelings for her were completely out of the blue though not entirely unprovoked. I had known her through work for over a year when it suddenly hit me. She'd always been my senior at work and somewhat condescending, initially, I didn't even like her at all because of this. 

However, as I became more competent in my role and made less mistakes, essentially becoming self-sufficient, we became friends, as she no longer found the need to be condescending or annoyed by mistakes. 

After a while, I genuinely like her back, and she was one of the only people I actually like hugging - I am not an overly touchy feely person.

This was the first thing that I noticed about her, that I actually like hugging her, the way our bodies fit together, her short enough that I could just wrap my arms around her neck and rest my head on top of hers. Anyway, none of this was in a romantic way, at this point, I still just considered her a friend.

We stayed in this 'friend zone' for quite some time, months I guess, and she regularly hugged me, nothing weird at all. I should also probably mention, that to this day we don't hang out outside of work, sometimes one of us will come into the shop when we're not working, and we'll talk or whatever, but it's not like we chat on social media or hang out with each other outside of work.

And as for the hugging, I'm not the only one she hugs, but she doesn't hug everyone either - I should also mention that I've never seen her hug a guy.

Now, to move onto the more interesting part. 

It was a busy weekend, we'd both been pretty flat out the whole day and I suppose we were just done. She'd been sitting in the manager's office and I'd been out on the floor, she came out, walked right up to me and said 'I love you'.

It wasn't the first time she'd said it, but it seemed different, like it was just a fond 'I love ya' in response to some action, joke or story on my part, it was a direct statement with no reason whatsoever, she just walked up to me and said it. 

If I remember correctly, I was confused but still not suspicious. I just responded with ""Aw I love you too."" 

And then after a moment of thought I asked, 

""Why'd you say that?""

""Because you're a star."" She replied to me.

I can't remember what I said after that, but it hardly matters anyway. She started helping me prepare orders and I recall a few light brushes, most memorably she brushed my ass lightly with her hand as she walked around me. 

Not intentionally but not unintentionally either. She could have easily avoided brushing my ass with her hand, but maybe because we're friends she thought it'd be fine and nothing meant by it - after all we were both girls and what's weird about a little girl on girl contact between friends anyway? Girls are naturally a bit touchy feely anyway.

Either way, neither of us acknowledged it because it didn't seem weird, in fact, in the moment (for me anyway) it felt more flirtatious than anything.

And I suppose, that was the moment everything changed. It wasn't even that I found her attractive when I met her, I didn't even think she was very pretty, maybe cute but I only really noticed that after I started to like her.

The next time I came into work, I think she hugged me and told me ""I missed you."" She did this quite often actually, even though we saw each other at work every few days and at least once a week. What actually happened over the next week and the order it happened in, I cannot remember for the life of me, so I will make a list of what I do clearly remember. 


 She was sitting in the manager's office - which for future reference can I just tell you, is very small, about 3 metres long and maybe 2 metres wide, a big electronics cabinet and a bench running along the length of one wall, taking the actual standing space down to maybe 2 metres squared. 

Anyway, I was early for my shift and so we were talking. She asked me if I'd had any boyfriends before and I told her - awkwardly - yes, I had. She asked me 'just one?' and I said, 'no a few' which wasn't entirely true. 

I'd had a couple of sort of boyfriends and only one actual one which even then only lasted like two weeks way back at the beginning of high school. Now days I get sick of people too quickly to be into dating.


Anyways, at some point when she'd been asking me about boyfriends she'd asked if I had any girlfriends, I think it was something like 

""Have you had any boyfriends *brief pause* or girlfriends?""

I'd been asked if I'd had 'a boyfriend... or a girlfriend' already that week and so I asked her

""Why does everyone keep asking me that? And no, I haven't?"" 

As you can see I can't really remember the order these questions were asked in or exactly how it shaked out, but I do remember the order of the conversation that followed. 

""Wait, are you straight or...?"" she asked.

I hesitated, I had been confused about feelings for her lately after all. Plus, I was just an awkward person when it came to these conversations.

""Yeah I guess... I mean I don't know."" Then I shrugged and said, ""It's 2018, anything's possible right?""

By the way the ... is a hesitation during which I was thinking, and I wanted to say ""I don't know I've never tried being with a girl"" but I decided not to, for the best I think. 

Without much of a pause I then asked her, 

""Why? Are you gay?"" 

She just smiled and shrugged and said, ""It's 2018, anything's possible.""

Now, let's talk about what this felt like afterward. The thing that most stuck out to me was why she was asking about my sexuality, and to be honest, it seemed a little out of place in the conversation. I mean, it sort of came up but mostly it felt like she just brought it up.


Later that week, there was some sort of security technician in the store fixing up cameras or whatever. I arrived as he was finishing up, he was just an average looking guy maybe early twenties. After he left I walked into the office where she was scrolling through Facebook on her phone and another of my managers was talking to her. 

""As if you're going to find him."" The other manager was saying.

""I can try"" she told her. 

""What are you guys talking about?"" I asked.

""She's trying to find the security guy on Facebook when she only knows his first name and where he works."" The other manager told me.

""Knowing my luck, he's probably got a girlfriend anyway."" She said.

Anyway, this made me remember that she was still straight and had the ability to be quite forward, she'd also made a complaint that she was 'sick of being single' or something to that effect. 

I still had hope however, that maybe she was into me considering the slightly flirtatious nature of our relationship. 

I knew that most of that could just be chalked up to being comfortable around me considered we were both girls and she could just be being friendly.


I had come to work at least 20 minutes early for almost all my shifts that week, mostly because my mum was busy and had to be places so she couldn't drop me off when I actually started. However, I did encourage her to drop me off early because I wanted to talk to the girl I liked. 

I was sitting in the office with her and another manager before the beginning of my shift and I made a comment about how I'm always here, way before my shift. 

She said, ""because you want to come and talk to us.""

She was spot on, but I made a sarcastic joke to cover it up and said, ""yeah, I know that you guys are here, so I come early just so I can talk to you."" 

She might have nodded or something, I can't remember but she acknowledged my response neutrally and said nothing. 

She liked talking to me and being around me as much as I liked being around her. I also might note that during one of these 'before shift' encounters I was leaning against the wall (There's a section of wall maybe 30cm wide between the bench and the door) and she was sitting on the stool on the other side of the office which was about a metre away from me, counting cash from the registers.

Because I was leaning my legs were most of the way across the tiny floor space and just resting slightly unnaturally against hers which were turned toward me because she was counting the cash which was spread out across the bench between the two of us.

Neither of us acknowledged that our legs were touching, and neither of us made comment about the slightly awkward nature of how we were positioned, it could be easily passed off as a natural position by passers-by and maybe even she didn't notice but I definitely felt like I was making a conscious effort to be close to her. 

Either way, it felt like we were both just enjoying being close to each other. 

During one of my breaks she told me to come talk to her in the office while I ate, so I did. I asked her if I could sit on the stool and she said yes, so I sat on the stool and faced the door (and more to the point, her), with my arm on the bench. 

She was counting cash again and so she stood, facing the bench. There wasn't a lot of room in the office and the far side of the bench was mostly taken up by a computer, so she had to stand pretty close to me. Either way, she ended up standing between my legs, as she counted the cash and my right knee grazing her ass gently, but again, neither of us said anything and I felt as if we were both just enjoying the closeness and didn't want to ruin it. 

Maybe it was just my imagination though and really, we were just two friends hanging out, and girls are pretty touchy feely, so it didn't mean anything from her point of view, it would have been more awkward for her to try and count the cash from the side rather than just standing in between my legs where she was right in front of it.

A few other things happened, she invited me to sit on her lap (my friends sometimes do that, does that mean she just sees us as friends or is she trying to be close to me?) either way, I declined. 

She hugged a girl she doesn't usually hug then me, it made me wonder if she maybe hugged the other girl just as an excuse to hug me also.

And she hugged another girl but not me and I was pretty jealous. 

One time, when I went on break, she asked me what as I was doing as I clocked off for my break. 

""I'm on break"" I told her.

She was happy and said, ""come eat in here with me, you can sit on this crate.""  Which managers don't usually invite crew into the office unless they're actually friends (outside of work generally).

She pulled out a crate that was in the back corner, right next to the stool but on the wall side not the bench. 

I got my food and came back, squeezing awkwardly into the corner and facing the stool which she was sitting on, my knees brushing the bottom of the stool and occasionally the underside of her thigh. 

Anyway, we talked about my school friends and how I don't really like them. She asked me if I was friends with more girls or guys. I told her mostly girls and she was surprised. 

""I can't really imagine you being friends with girls."" She told me. 

It made me wonder if she thought I was gay and that was why I would hang out with guys more.
It also made me wonder, if she couldn't see me being friends with girls, then what were we?  

I also told her about how I wanted to move out, but my mum wouldn't let me, mostly because she didn't approve of the people I had proposed to move out with. 

She said, ""You can move out with me, I'm moving out next year."" ""But not until a little way through, I have to save some money first.""

I can't remember exactly what I said but I told her that it was a good idea. 

Although, I'm pretty sure there's nothing more like the friendzone than offering to live together.

I didn't really want to live with her, because that would pretty much take the cards off the table for anything actually happening between us. I mean, who offers to move out with the guy they like? No one. 


And just the other day, we were talking to someone else we work with, about who to choose over her Ex and her best friend who both like her, and the girl I like said out of nowhere 'you should get with a girl'

Just recently I came in early for work, but I walked past her and went to talk to some others out front instead of talking to her like usual. She came out the front and said 'come talk to me'. She likes talking to me as much as I like talking to her? I should also mention she completely ignored the other staff members who were starting at the same time as me, including the girl who I was talking to. The girl I was talking to doesn't understand the situation or whatever it is and said 'wow what about me?' The girl I like just looked at her as if noticing her for the first time and said 'you can come too if you want'.

When we were talking I told her I had no idea how I was going to get to work next week because my parents were away and I was too young to drive (I live out of town so I can't walk either). Anyway she said 'You could probably stay at my place'. Does this mean she just sees me as a friend? 

What's more, she recently shared a Facebook post about some guy who was super nice to his girlfriend or whatever, you know the ones, with the caption 'I need a man like this'.


So, my question is, does she actually like me or is she just friendly straight girl and I'm reading these vibes all wrong? ",19Dec2018,1
252,"Hi Reddit. So I bought a Surface Laptop off of this website called T-Dimension, all was fine for the first 2 months until all of a sudden it stopped booting up and got stuck in the UEFI Boot Loop due to a faulty SSD. This is a complete nightmare as it died 2 weeks before my finals and it was my main source of study. I have emailed the company and they are happy to \*repair\* the laptop if I send it back to Hong Kong within the warranty period. The thing about the surface laptop is that you physically have to rip the keyboard off to get into the motherboard, then somehow remove the SSD, replace it, and reattach the keyboard? I have emailed them to tell them this however they have replied saying "" Since it is not the DOA 14 days, we can offer free repair if it has manufacturing defect. We are so sorry that we cannot offer the new replacement on the case."". They also mentioned that the laptop is not covered by Microsoft warranty and only by their warranty.

253,"First off, I just wanna say I feel so fucking stupid for this. 

But off we go. 

So, I've got a very close friend who I met via Discord. Lately, they've been really busy with life, and helping other friends deal with their own lives, etc. I started to feel like they don't care about me, and after a small fight because they seem to not really get how to be supportive when I'm feeling down, they reassured me that they do care about me. All seems well. 

But then I wake up the next morning and I can't get a response out of them, despite them being online, and trying several times... and I start to worry if things didn't really smooth out after the night before. And I try some more to get them to talk to me, but they won't, despite being online for quite awhile. Eventually, I go to sleep, slightly worried.

Then I wake up again today... same story, no responses, online all morning. And now I'm really freaking out that things were actually not smoothed over, or if i'm being tested somehow, or something, and it's driving me a little crazy

**TL;DR: I have an internet friend and I get bad separation anxiety when I can't get them to talk to me. Help?**

Last night I dreamed of her losing her job at the college so in the dream I was writing her a long letter confessing myself. When i woke up, I still though she was actually leaving so I actually sat down at my computer, about to write something to her until I realized it was all apart of the dream.

Edit: I thought this was important, my dad has recently brought an engagement ring for my mum and my mum promised that she would forget everything. And the threats would go away if he brought her that ring, obviously she didn’t stop threatening him. Also my mum has been abusing HIS money, saying “he was the one who cheated, so this is karma”. Just today my mum told him that she would be so happy if my dad hung himself, that she would celebrate.

My father, I would say, was a genius. He was always having new ideas about businesses. He was always \* riding the wave, being on the trend etc. \*. 2 to 3 years ago he created ( I would say, the business of his life). It was all good untill more and more people got involved. 7 digit numbers involved. I'm a kid so I don't really know much. Yesterday, he just went missing. Without  money. There is not a reason for someone to  murder him, he isn't involved in those types of things.. He just ran away,I'd suppose stressed, thinking about work or something. He has done this once, before I was born. He literally equipped all his clothes and went to the mountain for a week. Then he came back :&gt;D.  
I'm shaking, thinking about what happens if he does disappear, for a longer period of time( or...forever).His coworkers are going to the police to put him as missing at the end of the workday. Our rent is paid untill the end of January. My mom has worked before as an accountant, but after I was born she stopped working. We're low on money. The first thing on my mind thinking about this was... ending my life. But I know I must not do it. My mother should be able to start working after the new year. She could borrow money from a friend of hers before her 1st payment. I think about selling my computer and all tech stuff I have, so we can survive. I'm gonna cancel my gym sub/city travel card and try to save up as much. I can start working 4hour jobs legally at 16 years old I think. My mind is foggy, I'm scared to tell any friends because of gossip. The only people I can talk to is online friends/reddit and my mom currently. No siblings.

258,"I work at a place that’s in my field, however I’m doing something completely unrelated to what I’ve typically done in the past. Imagine you’re an ice cream man, you’re happy doing your job and satisfied with how carefree it is. Then one day you get a job for a new ice cream truck company and suddenly instead of ice cream man, you’re just the person who oversees the billing and ordering of the ice cream. That’s what happened to me. I’m miserable. 

I’ve got my own business I’ve been running successfully for over a year now and am ready to go full time. 

My current boss, who’s the owner of the company, discourages me from my own business and wants me sacrificing the success of it to work OT. I’m guilt tripped constantly and have been in the situation where the only way I can learn to do my job properly is if I do something wrong because I’ve never actually been shown to do my job, just corrected when I do something wrong. 

There is also the issue of my “manager” who is an alcoholic who’s worked there for 20 years. He is infatuated with me and has constantly asked me to get drinks with him, I repeatedly turn him down. We’re likely on attempt #8. Regardless, he is a complete disaster and fuck up. The owner is constantly, and I mean constantly, yelling at him. The owner yells when clients are around, yells when we’re on the phone with clients or different companies placing orders. Cursing and screaming, but only at the “manager” and never the other employees. 

We’re in the same industry, but my business seems like a joke to the owner. They’re stuck in 1996, don’t have a website, still use AOL for their professional email, and no records are kept of anything except written on paper. This is never a place I will want to associate myself with professionally or personally again. 

I’m past it, I’ve mentally checked out. February 1st is my last day. How should I quit? Should I bother giving a notice? I know I will be strong armed by the owner and guilted to not leave. This is a bridge I’m very very willing to set alight and watch burn.",19Dec2018,1
259,"What made me (14 years old) want to write this post is that I realised one of my friends (14 years old) lives near my house yesterday. He's literally walking distance, we live in the same complex.

The fact that I even have _any_ friends is already amazing. For the last two years I didn't have any friend at school or in the neighbourhood because of my anxiety.

I was in the car with my mom when I saw him and said hi to him from the car. He told me he lived ""past the playground"" which is really close to where I live. I told my mom ""he lives really close, I could go over his house if you get to know him and his parents!"" she said no. I'm not going over his house. He can come over here, but I'm not going over there.

And at that moment, I was so pissed and upset I wanted to curse her out and cry. She does this all the time ""no, don't do this. ""People are out to get you."" ""You'll get kidnapped."" ""We're black, you can't do or say this because then people will try to harm you."" She wants to protect me, but keeping me locked in the house isn't helping.

I can't walk the dog around the neighbourhood, I can't walk or ride my bike to school, I can't walk to the playground alone, I can't go inside the store alone. Nothing. Freaking nothing. Because she and my grandma (I live with grandparents and my mother) both think I'll get hurt or someone will kill me. 

I've been lonely, depressed, and had real bad anxiety for the past two years. I finally start making friends, and I can't hang out with them. 

I wish I still lived with my aunt. She let me do all that stuff. I was allowed to ride my bike around the neighbourhood with a friend, I could go over to a friend's house, I could walk up to the store with a friend... That was back when I was ten years old and less.

I had more freaking freedom when I was ten years old. I've never done anything to betray their trust or do something that would make them not want me to leave the house, and I don't ask for a lot. Just be able to hang out with friends like a normal life that's all. What am I gonna do with my friends? Probably play videogames or go to the park. Not like I'm gonna go do something stupid.

And this isn't teenage rebellion or anything like that. I'm not over exaggerating stuff or complaining because I want freedom from them. I could care less about that. I just want to hang out with friends. Once a month. Once a fucking year for all I care. Just something. 

I can't take it anymore, always being kept in the house because of their paranoid asses. How do I get them to actually let me do stuff outside of the house or at the very least deal with them? It's driving me nuts.

**TL;DR Parents keep me in the house all day, won't let me do jack shit. I'm old enough to do stuff but they won't let me for fear I'll get killed or kidnapped. I don't ask for much, I just want to hang out with friends or go to the park without them over my shoulder every 24/7.**",19Dec2018,1

I’m 24 y/o middle class male engineer from Venezuela and as many of you know,  it had (and continues) been very rough for us Venezuelan to live here, as we say here “we aren’t living, we’re surviving”, but even if my country’s situation is affecting me and my family very hard, is not the center of our problems.

My core family is my mom (whom I live with) and my older brother who I consider as a father and sister-in-law (they have their own place); I also have  2 more brothers than went abroad as well as my dad, but sadly I lost connection with those 3. 

So.. bad financial decisions (accentuated by the situation of my country) have let us all in a depress mood. Since I graduated almost 2 years ago I haven’t had real work, sure I help a bit in the family business (my brother partly owns a restaurant and my mom have a bakery) but never fully compromise, Now both of those businesses barely give revenue and we are slowly spending our savings. 

Ok, I can point out different excuses that I tell to my self and others that let me to not mature and get a job here where i live but,  now i need to do something fast before we get merge in debts.

267,"So I’ve only had 3 jobs, first one quit on good terms, second my position was terminated, so I’ve never like stormed out in a glorious “fuck you,” but after this past year I really want to.

My boss is an ass. He’s the owner of the hotel and I’m the manager next down. 

Few examples of his dickishness: 
-Had to borrow ten bucks for gas to literally get home, I couldn’t have otherwise. Now, he’s a bloody millionaire, but he held that ten bucks over my head, asking every day for it. Wouldn’t be as bad, but couple of my male employees have talked about how he’s given them hundreds of dollars or bought four brand new tires for them with no expectation to be paid back. He definitely plays favorites, and I suspect he’s sexist.
-I had this charity ball to go to FOR WORK, we were helping promote it so a representative from hotel needed to be there. But for whatever reason, he would not take *$30* for a ticket from hotel finances (and hotel makes millions each year), even though it was for charity, so could have written it off! So I had to pay out of pocket for the damn ticket I needed, again, FOR WORK.
-Reason I complain about money so much is I’m flat broke, mainly because he *pays me almost half of what I should be.* I work three positions, two are management positions. I should really be on salary instead of hourly, since I work at home so much, pretty much for free; and should be a salary of at least $40K a year. But he only pays me a little less than $25K a year. Which, okay, would be enough for just me, but my fiancé is out of work right now recovering from an injury with no income. Could really use a pay raise to get through this tough time.
-He found out I was looking for another job because I applied to a hotel where owner was his buddy, and even though I said not to contact employer, he called him up to tell him I applied. So boss tells me he knows, and says “You can leave if you want, I don’t care. But I want to let you know, you’re not good enough to work for anyone else.” 

So anyway, I already had a phone interview with this other hotel for either Front Office Mgr or Executive Housekeeper, either position he said he could pay “much much better” than what I make now, so pretty excited. I have the official interview this morning, but I’m 99% sure I already got it.

277," BACKSTORY: I \[F/22\] have been friends with this fratboy \[M/22\] for 6 years, even before he joined said fraternity, and we recently developed a thing for each other.

One night he invited me to one of their frat parties. It was sort of his gesture of introducing me to a big part of his world, which I get and welcome since we're developing this thing for each other. Beforehand he even told his brothers to ""take it easy"" with their jokes, since he knows how these type of parties can get. He even introduced me as his girlfriend to his mates once we got there, so they wouldn't hit on me or anything.

Cut to the point were one of his brothers was having far too many to drink, but not really enough to get drunk. He started saying comments and asking questions I wasn't really comfortable with, a bunch of them were more on the sexual side. I didn't really want to go running to my friend like some sort of child who couldn't handle these type of things, and ended up talking to him to what seemed like forever. He even noticed I was getting uncomfortable with our conversation but actively ignored it, and even made fun of me.

Long story short, my friend ended up hearing about it. I tried to steer him clear from engaging a fight but the guy was really persistent. They went fist to fist, until they both agreed to stop eventually. My friend ended up with different cuts and bruises all over his face. He wanted to leave the party but a bunch of his brothers wanted to mend the situation so we stopped by burger joint together with the guy he just had a fist fight with. Said guy won't stop and still continues to taunt me with comments like ""I hope your happy"" blah, blah. My friend just pulled me close, and asked the guy to stop.

I walked him home that night, tended to his cuts and bruises and decided to spend the night at his place since I didn't know if he suffered a concussion during that fight and I felt worried and kinda responsible.

I really felt helpless the entire time, and frustrated that I could do anything myself. I even wanted to take self-defense classes after what happened but my friend advised me to just buy pepper spray since taking a class does cost money and time.

280," 

TL;DR I'm a consultant (in a mid-size firm) about to quit and it's right before a major multi-month client project. Should I do a two week notice or give them longer (perhaps six?).

I'm about to leave the consulting firm I've been at for about a year and half. No need to get into reasons for leaving except I'll say I am regarded OK (say a 7 out of 10) but have had trouble breaking in with the established people.

I'm very specialized. We have very few resources who know the policy area I work in.

I've been on the bench (no client paying for my services) for HALF the time I've been there (the other big reason for leaving). We've finally won a big project in my focus area starting mid-January. My resume was in the project proposal the client has seen. In the way the universe works... I'm suddenly entertaining two really excellent job offers with a January or early February start.

I think my options are going to be one of...

A). Get the new employer to start me in two weeks and I basically tell my boss right away so she can basically tell one of the few other people with my knowledge to expect to work like hell in my role plus whatever they are doing already.

B). Get a start date in four weeks and tell my boss right away to give her some breathing room (but, this is a sensitive client and I think perhaps she would not want me showing up for two weeks and then replacing me). So, risk here is my boss just cuts me and I am out of work while awaiting the new role to start.

C). Do A (two weeks) but if my boss wants time try to renegotiate the start date with the new one.

D). Other ideas?

As a premise... I sincerely believe you do not give your current employer notice until you sign an offer with a new one. Also, I think this may look bad because I basically was on the bench eight months getting paid (overpaid according to my boss) and now when there's work I leave.

The more detailed longer version will be below as well if any of you wants to read it. The longer version might give you more insight and help you come up with better advice so I would appreciate if you read that as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction:**

I am 21 years old right now. I love animals and dogs are actually my favourite. I am not afraid of any other animal that I can have an encounter with. I have a turtle and a parrot, I also do horseback riding and have no problem with hugging a giant horse. I have always been good with cats as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Short Version:**

9 years ago (I was 12 y.o), I got hit by a car while running away from a dog (it's owner actually made it follow me by command). I didn't have any major damage to my body other than some muscle aches for a few days, but it made me change my way everytime I saw a dog (with or without a leash). There are a lot of stray dogs in my city and this was kind of a big problem for me. Last year I had almost overcome it. I didn't do anything special, kinda just grew out of it. Then the owner of the parking lot I parked my car decided to get a guard dog. I had several encounters with that dog as well and they all ended with arm/knee injuries because I fell on the ground every time I tried to run away from it. Right now I can not go near a dog bigger than an average sized cat. I know dogs generally think I am playing with them and they are not attacking me but I can't stay calm and I always try to evade situations like that. Please give me advice other than ""sit down when a dog is coming towards you"" because I hear that a lot and it's impossible for me to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Long Version:**

9 years ago (I was 12 y.o), me and my friends used to go to a park to sit down, chat and have snacks, after school. One day we saw a reasonably big Husky, which had an owner with it but it didn't have a leash, casually kill a kitten. The owner didn't really care and they just left the park after a few minutes. A few days later, they came there again and I started to get a little nervous. Even though I wasn't afraid of dogs back then. He took the dog's leash off and it started to sprint in the park, sometimes it came towards us and I was getting behind the bench when it did. The owner saw that and he came up to us. He was around 35-40 years old. He asked me if I was afraid and I said yes just for him to take his dog and go away but he said ""I can help you overcome that"". I said ""Thanks but I don't want you to"". The dog was following me at that point and we were running circles around the bench at that point and I said ""can you please leash your dog, I don't want it to follow me"". He didn't say anything for a few seconds and just said ""Get him boy!"". The dog started to run after me and I started to run as well. I was able to run away from it for about 20 seconds. I did 2 laps around the park and then I changed my direction towards the exit of the park. The exit had stairs and it was perpendicular to a narrow street. At the last step of the stair I felt the warmth of the dogs breath at my ankle and looked back. Then I found myself on the floor. I got hit by a car going on that street. Luckily I didn't have any major damage to my body other than some muscle aches for a few days, but it made me change my way everytime I saw a dog (with or without a leash). There are a lot of stray dogs in my city and this was kind of a big problem for me. Last year I had almost overcome it. I didn't do anything special, kinda just grew out of it. Then the owner of the parking lot I parked my car decided to get a guard dog. That dog was leashed most of the time but everytime it wasn't it came towards me and ran circles around me and that made me nervous all the time. I told the owner to leash it because I was afraid and told that car story and he said ok. One month later in the middle of the night I parked my car and saw the dog staring at me, unleashed. I walked towards the exit and he started to walk a little quickly towards me and I lost my shit and decided to run. He quickly got past me and kinda tackled me and I fell down, injured my arm. At that point I started screaming and shouting and the dog run away. (I am aware it wasn't trying to attack me btw.) After that incident I talked to the car-park owner and he said he was sorry and that's not gonna happen again. But literally the same thing happened 2 months later and I am now unable to go near a dog bigger than an average sized cat. I know dogs generally think I am playing with them and they are not attacking me but I can't stay calm and I always try to evade situations like that. Please give me advice other than ""sit down when a dog is coming towards you"" because I hear that a lot and it's impossible for me to do that.

287,"I’ll try to keep this succinct.

My SO and I have a roommate who got busted earlier this year for driving drunk. He lost his license for 7 months, and is about to be done with his seasonal job for the winter.

He announced to us that he was moving out because when he’s on unemployment for the winter he can’t afford to pay his portion of the rent and still be able to buy the things he likes - he specifically mentioned cigarettes, and he still drinks regularly despite getting in huge trouble for driving drunk. He also has to pay monthly on his court fines, which weren’t minimal to say the least.

He insists he’s not screwing us over, despite knowing that we might get evicted because we can’t afford the rent on just our incomes. Our lease is up in March, and he says he “feels bad” and will give us whatever he can for January’s rent. However, he also admitted that he’s going to be saving up money for his insurance when he gets his license back - in June of next year...

He says that it’s okay that he’s not paying us his rent because “everyone is telling him to not do it” (i.e. don’t pay rent and worry about himself). He seems to be in denial about the fact that I’ll be getting a *third* job working nights so that we can afford to pay the rent and take care of ourselves.

We all got this lease (his name isn’t on it) with the understanding that all three of us would be paying rent. Am I in the wrong to expect him to pay for his mistakes himself by sacrificing the optional things in life like cigarettes and alcohol and whatever other shit he’s doing? Or for expecting him to get a damn job instead of sitting around on unemployment? I am pissed beyond belief and can’t seem to conjure up much empathy for him, because he’s willing to let us possibly get evicted so he can pander to his own laziness. He insists he’s not making us pay for his mistakes and I don’t get his line of thinking there.

Advice and insight needed because I wanna just punch this guy in the damn face. He’s moving his shit out on a day this week that he knows I work because he knows I am *so* very pissed at him lol.",19Dec2018,1

290,"Currently trying to figure out what to gift someone important to me for his birthday. Got two gifts that are worth exactly 31$ in total - one of them is a fun one based on an insider joke, and the other one is more significant. Giving just one of them feels weird to me because on their own they are a bit...underwhelming. They also do work well together, but I am afraid it might look like I'm trying too hard to please. Can someone tell me if it's still ok to give both of them? Thanks!",19Dec2018,1
291,"Hi this will be a long and messy story but here it goes.

I'm 20F living with my mom(not US). I have to explain about my mom first. My mom and dad are separated and I've seen my dad only once or twice in my life.  My mom used to be a dancer but she went to the US to study English to start a new life and met my dad there, got married without loving him, got pregnant, and came back to my home country thinking that she can't raise a child in the US with my dad. Since I was little and till now still she constantly tells me her regrets of her life and hatred towards her parents and my dad. She says her parents shouldn't have made her start dance, how her mother and father weren't good parents to her, how my dad is a horrible person. 

When I was little I used to feel so sorry for my mom and hated my dad and my grandpa cuz of what my mom told me. I used to send emails to my dad and had such a good relationship with my grandpa but I started being mean to them and now it's been years since I contacted with my dad and I'm awkward with my grandpa. I have nothing left. Now I realized that she shouldn't have told me those things and it's her business, not mine. 

Anyways my mom still is clearly unhappy with her life. Whenever she sees women on tv who has married nice men, is successful, has highly-paying jobs, she says why did I marry that man, why didn't I learn to do that, why didn't I study to become a doctor etc. She often says that she ""doesn't want to wake up"", or ""want to disappear"". She doesn't say it to me directly, but says it clearly enough so I can listen.  Whenever I heard that before, I felt horrible and felt like I was responsible for her happiness but now I just don't care whether she feels so or not but I hate to hear it.

On the other hand, she also has this narcissistic personality. She often brings up how everyone admired her, what a good dancer she was, her top grades in university, etc etc. She has never ever apologized to me once in my life even though she did wrong, because she can't admit that she did wrong. Last time when there were a bunch of mosquitoes in the house during summer, she kept saying that they must've come in when I opened the door, and when I said that it might've been her, she got mad. I still find that bizarre. She can't stand it when people having different opinions with her. Everyone opposing her is stupid, uneducated, lowbrow according to her. She always judges people on the tv, on the street. I usually am quiet when she is judging other people, or saying negative things, but last time she got mad at me and said that she doesn't feel comfortable being herself around me and that I'm the only person making her uncomfortable to be herself. Her being herself is being negative towards everything and I just don't want to listen to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways my mom was unhappy with her life and I was supposed to change it according to her life plan. I was the thing that was supposed to turn her life around, an accessory to brag around(When I was little, she literally told me that I was her accessory. I liked that when I was a kid but now I'm grossed out). Anyways she repeatedly told me that I shouldn't leave her alone when she gets old, and when she gets mad she says that I'm the kind of person to leave a dying parent alone. She wants to control my life so much and it worked till I was in middle school but since I was in high school I started to feel severely depressed and my scores dropped a lot and she became furious. She told me that I'm selfish, worthless, even said that she has nothing to brag about me when she meets her family and friends. She said that I'm the only person that makes her miserable blah blah I don't remember all of them now. I brought a sick feral cat and went to the vet and raised her with all my money and she used my cat to force me do something threatening me that she will throw my cat away. I didn't go to university right away and she was so so so so much uncontrollably furious that she just couldn't control my life as she wanted it to be. She cried angrily and yelled at me randomly during her sleep and that made me so anxious. When she gets mad she yells, throw things, say things that she can't remember later, pushes me and it terrifies me so much. 

The funny thing is after the episodes, I decide to set boundaries with her but I always forget about it later. Like when something good happened to me, I can't help but tell her, expecting to get a praise from her. I just can't help but expect her to change and be the loving mother I always wanted. She uses the things I tell her to insult me later.

Every time after hearing all the things she says to me, I feel so exhausted. I feel like I have no one to lean on and I feel so alone. But I really don't want to be like her and that means I need to heal myself, I need to make myself stay healthy and I don't know if I have the capacity to do that anymore. 

However yesterday she told me that I want to make her die. On my college essay I wrote something like how I was pressured by expectations from my mother and teacher blah blah and she read that and said that I just can't accept her, and why her existence gives me so much pressure. I regretted showing her my essay. Her saying that I want to make her die made me feel miserable but also I'm glad that she said that because  I don't think I'll ever go back to her anymore. It helped me make my mind.

Today when she came back from work she yelled at me again for not greeting her.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I can't just move to another place and be away from her is because I really really want to go to university right now and I can't afford it. My plan is to go to college and start setting boundaries while paying her money back. I don't know how that will work.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this long long long story. I don't know how to end this. Thank you

293,"I’m (F15) currently on holiday, and am quite concerned about my friend (F15) - let’s call Angelica - and her relationship with a boy we’ll call Johnny (M16).

Angelica met Johnny through a friend of ours who was Johnny’s girlfriend at the time who we’ll refer to as Tiffany. From what Johnny said, Tiffany was extremely controlling and high maintenance. She wouldn’t let him speak to any of his friends she didn’t like, she had planned to cheat on him with his best friend, and overall she was spoilt and entitled. One night Tiffany and Johnny got in an argument in which Johnny called Tiffany a bitch, which lead to their breakup.

Johnny wanted to know what Tiffany was saying about him, so he’d ask Angelica to act as a spy. Angelica did so and she was so committed and loyal to him. Eventually she ended getting feelings for him. He would always be sort of flirty with her (lots of compliments, witty playful responses, etc) which in a way lead her on. She confessed her feelings for him, and then he told her that: “Maybe if you weren’t so chubby, and lost a bit of the facial hair I’d be into you”. She stopped eating for about 5 days - and ofc I intervened, and spoke to her parents (ik snitch move but trust me you’d do the same) - she also started waxing (something she didn’t normally practice which leads me to believe she’s doing it for Johnny).

This is kind of where the situation escalates. Johnny said that he’ll be Angelica’s girlfriend as long as she sends him nudes. She did so (at the time I didn’t know). He then sent her pics to his entire friendship group. One thing lead to another and they even managed to get to my boyfriend (he goes to a completely different school) and all his friends. Johnny didn’t end up being her girlfriend. He instead went back to Tiffany. No one told the school about this bc they’d both be charged with possession of child porn.

After nudes spread, she confronted him, he apologised, and then she forgave him (dumb ik). It gets worse, a week later at a party Johnny makes out with Angelica whilst still being in a relationship with Tiffany. 

I’ve told her time and time again that the way in which she’s going about this situation is toxic. I said it would be best to maybe not try pursuing Johnny but she’s super persistent. Tell me if I’m looking at this situation all wrong, and possible steps I can take. Because right now I’m swaying towards the path of cutting ties with her.",19Dec2018,1

The response I got back was basically a fuck you. The person said that they are still coming, and I don't know what to do.

I always screw everything up and make my father even more disappointed as the days go on. By the end of next year, he'll hate me for sure. 

I'm also gonna be a failure at life. A massive one, at that. I hardly make anyone proud anymore. Not even my own mother, and her standards are pretty damn low. Might be because she's absent from my life at this point.

So, any advice on what I should do? I suppose stop being such a stupid bastard would be the most obvious, but being the absolute retard that I am, I wouldn't have an idea as to how I'm fucking up. It always seems like, in my eyes at least, that I just make a mistake every now and then...but now I'm slowly realizing that my father is right. He won't outright say it of course...but I know deep down he's disappointed in me and views me as a massive failure. Maybe even a regret of his.

I've been going to this good school because my dad had to move to a new country for a couple of years for work and this was one of the english speaking schools (at least, with an american curriculum) there. Basically, my dad has to move back to our home country (which is not the US), but my dad told me I'd be the one making a choice about my education, and said I have to choose to either stay here with my mom, move back to my home country, or propose a new idea (which he implied to be a boarding school in the us). 

Pros of staying in my current school would be that my current school has a very good education system and would probably get me in a pretty decent college.

Pros of moving back to my home country would be I would feel at home (when I occasionally visit back I feel really calm and at ease) , and even though my current school is good curriculum-wise, I don't necessarily have a nice social life here. (its shitty) Sure, I would miss the friends I did have, but it would be nice to have a fresh start.

I didn't even think of the final option as I'm introverted in unfamiliar conditions and would probably be a loser there or something, I don't know.

319,"I am really really uncomfortable around my aunt, to the point where i feel really anxious around her. She lives in another country so we usually only meet once a year.  

She and their mom bullied my mom when they were younger, in a way that wasn’t just “teasing” it was cruel, my mom hasn’t told me everything that they said to her but from what she did tell me, it’s not something a sister or mom should say to their daughter/sister and hearing what they said to her made me so upset. The comments were things like “can you really sit there with your fat ass?” which caused my mom to develop anorexia and eventually having to be put in a hospital because of it. She has also apparently stolen things from us a couple of years back, razors and something else i can’t remember. There have also been other things that she has done or said to my mom in recent times that has just been, weird. For example, my brother struggles with depression and when my mom was trying to vent to her over phone about it, my aunt completely dismissed my moms feelings and blamed my brothers depression on her.. which is absolutely ridiculous! My mom is an amazing woman and an amazing mom. Moms and hers relationship is a little better now that it was growing up, but i can tell there’s a lot of tension between them. They are complete opposites in personality. My mom even admitted to me that she’s not exited to meet her sister next week. My mom also tends to be too forgiving of people, like when my aunt said that about my brothers depression being her fault, she didn’t really question her much from what i understood. If my sister said that to me, i would be so angry and disappointed!.  

She has never been “mean” to me, but there was one thing happened last year that made me really angry at her, and i felt extremely embarassed about what happened.  I have social anxiety and i struggle with panic attacks, so even though i love most of my family, big family gatherings make me nervous and i’m sure most people with anxiety can relate to that. So last year we had a pretty big family gathering, and when i get a little nervous my hands usually shakes a little. So a couple of minutes after everyone had arrived we were sitting outside in the sun so i was putting my hand up to my eyes to shelter my eyes from the sun, and i saw that my hand was shaking a little, and then i look up and see that my aunt is looking at me and notices my hand shaking, and then she just shakes her head and looks away. I felt so embarrassed, i didn’t want her to notice that i was anxious, but i was also angry because you just don’t do that!. I didn’t tell my mom about it, i didn’t feel it was necessary.  

I get extremely bad vibes from her and she makes me very uncomfortable. We do not connect as people at all. I hate saying this, but i hate meeting her and i try to avoid it as much as i can. If anyone has any advice on this, please let me know",19Dec2018,1

I'm 28 now, and I still get abominably nervous. *It's like my brain takes all the raw excitement I feel for the event, and converts it to pure anxiety.* Weird thing is... I am hyper comfortable with speaking in public! I regularly do public speaking, and don't really worry about talking to crowds. It's almost as if I see an ""audience"" as one giant entity, and it's easier to destress about it.

These kids tend to throw things into our backyard and even taunt our neighbour’s dog. 

There have been many times where I complained to the supervisors who are in charge of the kids but they respond with such hate and unbelievable hostility! These people are supposed to be teaching these kids manners but they themselves have horrendous behaviour.

329,"I am in my late 20's and I am trying to rent a house with my best friend of over a decade as well as another good friend who I trust. She was on board and has been telling me this is what she has wanted for months. Yesterday, I told her and the other roommate that we would need to submit their applications over to me by 3 PM so I could get everything over to the manager. The other roommate submitted everything on time. I did not receive anything from my best friend. She said she needed to go to her work computer to do it that night. I said okay that is fine and told the landlord it would be a bit later and we would drop everything off at the office. She still did not send it and claimed that both the signal and the Wi-Fi at her job did not work correctly so that is why it did not send and that she would send it once she completed a task at work. She has not said anything to me at all regarding the application since yesterday evening and it is now the next morning. I told her that she could even text me photos of the app with her information and that would be acceptable and this morning I asked if she was okay, but did not receive a response. 

It seems like she is just not telling me some things? I would have much rather had her tell me ""hey, I need a day or two to gather info."" which would have been fine, but the lack of communication is making me really second guess if I want her to live with me. I sent her a string of text messages last night asking when she would be able to submit everything. I can be paranoid about things sometimes, so I am asking Reddit to have a second opinion.

I think for both of us it’s just for fun, even though he told me he likes me and tells me very often that I’m beautiful. Anyways the other day we were texting and joking with each other and then he said that if I was a guy no one would sleep with me because I finish quick ? 
I know it’s a reference to guys finishing very quick and that’s not fun for the girl, but it made me kinda annoyed. I just thought to myself that why does he sleep with me if he thinks that way about me. 
And idk if this is TMI but I think it’s important to add that I always make him finish, and always down for a round 2. However he wants me to finish too, and I just can’t with this guy.

331,"Hey guys.

&amp;#x200B;

My son is 3 years old, and my niece is almost 7. Everyday, it is my job to pick the both of them up from school, take them home, dress them, feed them, take them to Tai Kwon Do, make sure my niece does her homework, etc. On top of all this, my niece is a *very* spoiled child. My wife and her family are from a Southeast Asian country and simply raise their children differently than what I'm accustomed to. She has become a highly sensitive child and throws tantrums literally every day until she get's what she wants. This works with literally everyone except for me. I refuse to give into any of her demands when she's acting up. This even gets to the point that she cries until she vomits. It's heartbreaking to watch, but I am too stubborn to give in, and I feel it's what's best for her.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I began watching my niece in the first place is because she was having trouble in school. She would hardly start any of her in-class assignments, and she was not doing her homework. Being from another country makes it difficult for her parents to assist much, so I saw an opportunity to help. After several months of watching her, she now does very well in school and completes her homework efficiently and independently. The issues she previously had with school are virtually gone. The only thing that lingers is her inconsolable tantrums and bad behavior when she's with me.

&amp;#x200B;

For months, it has not improved, and recently it's arguably gotten worse. I've had conversations with my sister-in-law, along with her husband and my wife. It's clear to me why she has these emotional issues. Her father even told me that he doesn't think discipline is necessary while she's this young and that he's going to wait until she grows out of it. I feel like any progress I make with her is immediately reversed by the way she is raised. In the most recent case, I had a surgery that put me out a few days, so I wasn't watching her. Once I was back to watching her, she reverted back into an absolute nightmare.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I finally submitted to the reality I cannot help my niece without support from others, and I am ok with that. This came after a major blowout by my niece yesterday. Watching the frustration and exasperated faces of my wife and sister-in-law were enough. They work very hard as well, so it's exhausting for them to come home to this after a long day of work. I've never been a ""not my problem"" kind of person, but I need to make it work in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long winded introduction, but here is my concern and what I'm asking for advice about.  I will still be picking the two kids up from school and bringing them home. It's clear that issues will arise from treating one child differently than the other. I do not plan to change the way I raise my son, but I don't want to confuse him as I let his cousin get away with things he is not allowed to do. I'm also afraid her bad behavior is going to rub off on him as well. The whole situation is very ugly, and unfortunately I cannot tell my sister-in-law that I refuse to watch my niece anymore without disappointing or upsetting my wife. She's even made it clear that raising her is not my problem, and agrees there is nothing I can do if her parents aren't on the same page. The only reason I'm giving up is because the situation is really stressing her out and need a new strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I supposed to do here? Am I missing something? Am I the problem? 

&amp;#x200B;

I need some help guys. Please, and thank you.",19Dec2018,1

334,"Hello good folks of Reddit! 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - After 'divorce', can't write, I feel like shit, money issues, debt and not enough willpower to keep me going on a daily basis. Advice pls?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a pretty tough situation rn and could really use some advice or some freash pairs of eyes.  I'll try to keep it short, but it's a pretty long story, so bear with me.   


I'm a 25 guy from Europe. I like to think of myself as someone who's clear thinking, open minded, emotionally stable, positive and clever. I'm a real ENTP or debater personality.   


//My relationship with my ex

My story starts this September, when after like 2 years of constant shitshow we finally broke up with my ex. We have a 2 years old son, who is a really cool little guy. His mommy and me, we were separated for some months before, then tried to move in together again, didn't work. We really tried to save the relationship, but it was going downhill real quickly. 

It became an emotionally and at points physically abusive relationship (not on my part). I was a really stable person before, but this whole thing clearly left it's mark on me. Even tho I know that not even half of the toxic bullshit I got from her is true, I still feel like a piece of shit after living like this for 2 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

//Starting over

So this September I finally decided that it was enough and I moved out. I had a crushed soul, 0 savings, a lot of debt and a job that I don't like doing that much. I spent a few weeks at my mom's, but she doesn't have any spare rooms and my father is living with my grandma. So I didn't really have anywhere to go. 

Luckily I found a lady who rented her small town house for me for a real cheap price. But this way I'm really far away from my son, so I can only see him like 1-2 times a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

//Money issues

I'm working as a freelance writer, but with all the stress and everything... I have the worst fucking writers block ever. There are days when I'd rather shoot myself than write single a word. Currently I'm working with a few great clients, on topics that I can't give a single shit about. So that doesn't help either. 

This work could pay pretty well in my country, but I can barely make myself write for like 1-2 hours a day. Some days nothing. I tried everything. I tried gamification, turning it into a game, racing against the clock, writing fun little easter eggs or puns into the boring articles about refrigerators. I tried to set a schedule for myself. 

Now I might need to give you a little background on this. I make like 150 coffebeans a month with this shitty 1-2 hours a day. If you get a job without any qualifications in my country you will get 160 coffebeans per month for 40 hours a week. If you get a good paying job (which I'll probably won't, since I have no education), you can get like 250 coffebeans a month.   


My expenses are like this: 

\-The bare minimum I have to pay for food and debt - 170 coffebeans

\-A croom costs - 70-90 beans/month

\-A one bedroom apartment - 120-150 beans/month

&amp;#x200B;

So I clearly don't make enough money rn to stay alive.   


//The end is near

So I'm in a pretty urgent situation too. Because by the end of the year I have to pay like 300 beans in taxes. If I can't make it, I'll lose my right to work as a freelancer. Also my current place is rented 'till January. 

Currently I have like 1 beans in my pocket. And I billed one of my clients 150 beans today. 

&amp;#x200B;

//Escapism

Yeah. I like video games and series. I guess I don't have to tell anyone that they are great escapism tools. Sadly tho when you use them like that, there's no fun left in it. Just guilt and regret. 

&amp;#x200B;

//No friends

When we were together with my ex I pretty much abandoned all my other relationships with anyone. So I can't really talk with anyone about my stress or my job. 

&amp;#x200B;

//Hopeless and broken

Seriously I don't have any idea what to do in the short term or in the long term. I feel like I have to vomit if I have to write. But I know rationally, that it's a great gig and I could really make money here. 

I also feel like shit, because I feel weak that I can't just hold on and do this writing thing decently for a few months. 

I have no idea how will I move out at January or where will I go. I don't know how to pay my taxes. 

Meanwhile my ex is telling me constantly that I'm a shit. I can't see my kid rn. 

And I don't even know how I could get out this in the long term or how can I hold on on a daily basis.   


Okay. I got pretty dark at the end. Sorry about it. :D   
I'm optimistic and all. And I have some ideas, but I just can't seem to pull my shit together enough to start anything. I spend my hours trying to escape this constant stress and anxiety. And if I can make myself write 1-2 hours a day, that is a good one.   


Thanks for reading this long ass text.

335,"Alright, so I’m feeling pretty upset at the moment. My ex-friend is furious because I politely told her to stop texting/talking to husband because she decided to cut me out off her life because I’m toxic. She’s only saying I’m toxic because I didn’t like how much she constantly texted my husband. 

She texted me all night until the point I had to block her and after she realized I blocked her she had a mutual friend text me. Her texts were about why I feel the need to control my husband’s life and why I think it’s okay for me to tell her to leave him alone all because we’re not friends anymore. Now, the reason I feel like I do is because she use to have feelings for my husband before she met her husband and now her and her husband are having issues. She seeks the attention of my husband because she isn’t getting any from her husband. FYI, my husband doesn’t go out of his way to talk or text her, she’s always the one starting the conversation.

342,"Hi, 

I've had great close friendships throughout my life with a few people who share the same interests. I have a slightly introverted personality, but it hasn't caused me much stress throughout life. I've been able to converse and make friends with others in high school and college without a problem. But at work, I feel out of place. There's really only one person with whom I can enjoy a conversation without stumbling or giving curt responses. Most office talk is small talk, or what they do to relax, or pets, or whatever. I guess I just don't do the same things day to day? I like music and art and stand up comedians and philosophy, and I've been able to connect with friends and family about that stuff pretty well. 

Is this something I should work on? I find it odd that I really don't fit in with almost all of my coworkers, though I do go to work infrequently compared to many of them. I don't get this anxious outside of work, and can usually carry conversations with people about anything, but for some reason at work I feel more out of place.

Every morning, I park and lock my bike at a parking lot.

I feel like from the beginning I’ve been making sacrifices to show him that I really like him, and I never really thought of it as sacrifices until I noticed that he is unwilling to make the same sacrifices for me. I drive him around and he never pays for gas, we go out to eat, he never insists on covering my meal, he never spoils me, he never shows interest in learning more about my interests and these are all things that I have literally done for him. Not that he’s never bought me anything; he bought me a kit kat bar once, but only after I bought him his favorite chocolate because I knew they were his favorite and I knew it would make him happy. And he paid for my sandwich once, but later admitted that he did it only because the line was building up and he didn’t hold it up for too long. I spent the last two weeks of out semester paying for his meals because he ran out of dining pass, and I had some to spare. Granted, they were dinning passes, but I still didn’t have to do it, I did it because I care about him. He also doesn’t want to change for me.

My significant others family talks about what a “whore” I am, how I stole his son away from his bio mom, and how I’m garbage. I’ve never been invited to any family gathering or even acknowledged. Basically, all I’m good for is providing for their grandson. 
So this Christmas holiday, my boyfriends brother and his girlfriend of three months have been invited to Christmas Eve dinner. I’m not even acknowledged- this is really tearing me up and I don’t know what to do.

And even when I can tell people are getting annoyed about me not shutting up I just carry on going and annoy them more. And the nervousness makes me smile so much to the point where it’s creepy and I’m so awkward and ugh idk 

Also I’m so lazy. I’m a bright person with academic potential but I just can never get myself to do anything even close to homework or studying for tests or doing anything even remotely academic or helpful..

Unfortunately last night I discovered that one of the cans had at some point popped a tab and leaked, and the other was empty and I could not locate any penetration points on the cans (probably aliens or my cat). I had been storing the remaining cans wrapped in a plastic grocery bag, which was then wrapped in a reusable Lulu Lemon shopper. This was kept on the floor of my closet.

359,"Hello everyone, this is my first reddit post ever, and I am in need of some life advice. 

My name is Emily, I live in Philadelphia, and I am currently finishing my B.S. in Biology. I will be graduating in December 2019. I am 24 years old and my 25th birthday is coming up in April. I am getting married in November 2019, one month **before** I graduate, and I have some questions...

My dream is to go to Temple University for a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree and become an outpatient physical therapist / sports therapist / some combo of the two. I am passionate about exercise, find the human body fascinating, and I think physical therapy is a good fit for me. It is a great combination of job stability/good salary, mental/physical stimulation for myself and my future patients, and not-too-demanding work hours (like a physician working 70 hrs a week/holidays/weekends/overnights etc). 

There are some drawbacks to this plan, IMO:

1) I don't come from a wealthy family and I would need loans to pay for this program, which is three years long. 

2) It is a full-time type of deal, so I couldn't work during it - might be able to work part time, like I do now, but who knows. On one hand, I get excellent grades so I could get some scholarships; I live in PA so I would get good in-state tuition with Temple; and they just redesigned their program so that it is comprised of 117 credits and costs \~$10,000 less in total. This is helpful, but still. Loans r scary, y'all.

3) The earliest I could start the program  with respect to my graduation time of Dec 2019 is June 2020 (yep, programs start in mid-summer time). This means I will be 26 when I start and 29 when I finish. 

Because I am getting married in November 2019, I of course will be anxious to ""start my life"". It took me a while to get my associate's degree after graduating high school, because I worked all throughout (still do as I complete my Bachelor's). I tend not to compare myself to others who graduated college at 22,  did a 2-3 year master's, and have long since started their career, while I'm 24 and haven't even finished my undergraduate education. I try to just focus on my path. I do, however, wish I could have figured things out sooner. My fiancé and I both want children and it has always been my dream to buy a house. I know that's a lot of people's dream, but I LOVE houses. I love the process of making them your own, I love doing home projects, gardening, painting rooms and rearranging furniture, shopping for antiques... I also love cooking, I just love nesting and the feeling of home. I want a lot of things related to the home, because that is like, my other passion besides biology/exercising ET CETERA. I want financial freedom, essentially. 

One idea I had is to take some time off after graduating in December 2019 with my Biology degree, to be productive by getting a full time job as a Research Coordinator or Research Technician (which is basically a class of well-paying jobs in various research departments at Children's Hospital of Philly) for a year to make some money for our savings, and postponing PT school until June 2021. 

There are of course drawbacks to this plan as well. 1) what if I get too comfortable making money and working full time that I never go to PT school? 2) If I push it back a year, I'll be **30** when I graduate. For a long time I have really wanted to have children, at least my first child, before age 30. A friend suggested I stick with doing PT school sooner rather than later, and time my first pregnancy with graduation. To me this would be a tradeoff because I wouldn't be able to start my career right away with a newborn in tow. I am really scared/hesitant to start PT school *right away* without being able to work and contribute significantly to our savings at least a little bit first. (For reference, I am a full-time student currently on winter break, and I work part-time at an optometry office while I finish my BS - 12.50 an hour working one day a week...sucks).

I adore anatomy. I love working with others and the idea of educating people about strength and mobility and healing them with that is just amazing and a dream come true to me. Being a Research Coordinator is not the big plan. It's cute when I'm 25, but I need something stimulating and enriching to give my life meaning, beyond my home life, which is also important of course.

SO TL;DR: MY OVERARCHING QUESTION IS THIS...

Should I go for it right away, go to PT school as soon as possible after I graduate, or take a year off to build up our savings and then go?

Help me!

364,"Long rambling post warning:

Background: I'm a half Pakistani, half White guy, 23, who lives currently in the U.S. I was raised both in the U.S. and Pakistan (School year in Pakistan, summer in U.S.). My Father and his family is Sunni Muslim, my Mother is Roman Catholic. While I grew up as a very devout Muslim, I was still baptized at my Mom's request and did my Rosary and went to mass occasionally with Mom and Grandma, etc. I was so interested in studying Islam, however, that my local mosque here in the states wanted to start a fund to send me to Turkey or Egypt to become an Imam (equivalent of a priest I guess). Islam and being Pakistani was my identity. 

Everything was simple, until now. 5 years ago I found the love of my life, my fiancee. She is American, a Midwestern girl born and raised. Since all my family Except my Mom and Dad are in Pakistan, her family has sort of become mine. I participated in Christian and American events and activities that I never had before and I loved it. In the beginning of our relationship, we both discussed religion, as we were both pretty devout in our own faiths at the time, she was a youth pastor. We decided that we'd just teach our children both of our traditions and let them what they wanted to follow. We both said this, but later we both confessed to each other that we secretly hoped that one of us would convert to the other's religion. 

After some time, I decided to leave Islam. Partly because of my own convictions, but also because arguments about religion and the future were starting to come in between us. So I became a Christian, a Catholic. When my Dad found out,  he threatened me with being disowned by him and my family, and reminded me how it could effect my whole family in Pakistan if it became known I left Islam. He made me take the Shahada, reaffirming my belief in Islam, but I continued to try and be a devout Catholic. 

The problem I guess is this. There's things about Islam I miss. And I feel my fiancee since she knows I'm Christian now feels like I'll also give up my culture. She's stopped trying to learn anything like Pakistani cooking or my native language, which is very important to me because that is something I definitely want to pass down to my children. Also, on so many Catholic pages, forums, and discords, they make crusade jokes, ""remove kebab"" jokes and just generally say awful things about Muslims, which really turns me off from the faith. Meanwhile, my family in Pakistan has found out and won't talk with me, and has made it clear I shouldn't go back. So now I can never safely return to the place I always considered my true home. (The threat of an honour killing is there). So I just feel lost. I feel like I'm not a Muslim anymore, but I feel other parts of my identity being taken away too, and as much as I love my fiancee and new family, and all the new traditions and customs, I feel like I can never be a ""good old boy"" like my Father and Brother in law. I feel lost, with no true sense of identity.  Any ideas and what I should do? Have any of you guys been in a situation like this?",19Dec2018,1
365,"I'm (m) 32 and my wife (f) is 31. We have been together now for about 10.5 years, married 5+ years. No relationship is perfect by any means, and we have our own issues and ups and downs, but I am honestly a happily married man; I love and adore my wife. About 4 months ago, I started my first IT job at a smaller school. I am happy where I work and proud of what I do. The issue arises with one specific coworker, let's call her Sara, who I am having feelings for, but I really don't understand why. When I see her she seems to put a smile on my face/brightens up may day kinda deal. Is she attractive, smart, funny, nice, hard-working, etc.? Yes. So are plenty of other women that I have worked with in the past and at this job, but I have never really thought about them this way, just Sara. Another thing is, is that I am not thinking of her sexually, but romantically; thinking of going out on dates, out dancing, meeting her family, that kind of stuff. The other day I saw an ad on T.V. about The Nutcracker coming to near where I live. My first thought was if I asked Sara out to the show, would she would want to go. I went to pick up lunch out last week, and I thought that Sara likes the same food I just got so maybe I should have gotten her some. (It was fettuccine alfredo  from a local Italian place, I knew she liked it already as she had mentioned it was her favorite Italian style food a while back). And these thoughts aren't like I'm daydreaming either, more of just that they popped into my head, kinda like intrusive thoughts.    



I feel guilty about it too. I feel like I am cheating on my wife even though I am not intending to. I don't have the slightest clue if I should tell my wife, because of her self-esteem issues, nor even how to tell her how I am feeling. Being honest, there is a weird part of me that wants a relationship with both my wife and my coworker. I've tried avoiding her as much as I can, but I am not going to not my job. (For instance, this week we have Christmas and winter events, and since I'm the only IT at my school, I am the one in charge of sound and technology so I am setting up/tearing down during events. She and I have been working more closely during the last few days). Leaving my job isn't really an option as no one else I have graduated with has been able to find work in the area I live in and it's not like jobs are booming around here.     



What do I do in general? Why do I feel this way about Sara? And where to go from here?

369,"Hi! I typically refrain from posting on Reddit, much less post about my personal problems, but I believe that this morning was enough to bring me to a conclusion to inquire.

I'm 18 and about to move out for university in another city. My best friend and I have spoken about moving out for a while, ever since we've known each other (freshman year), and he's only recently upgraded to the role of boyfriend within the past year. However, that is not my concern, but instead, just another piece of information to add to my story. 

As per my mother's request, I am staying on-campus for the first semester of my junior year (jumpstarted, have an AAS degree). My boyfriend and I have requested to room together, and we have both been accepted into the same 3-room suite in the dorms. I forwarded this email to my mother, seeing as though she refuses to be ""left out of the dark"" - which, rightfully so, I understand. However, her response to my email that states when my move-in day would be, who my roommates were, what to bring, etc. was nothing short of aggressive.

She has this hang-up of being seen as stupid or a fool, which is stupid in itself - I respect her and her accomplishments, and she's risen to the top of her game back in the day. She's smart, capable, educated, and so much more. However, whenever an argument arises within the family, not only will she bring up the fact that everyone thinks she is stupid, but also influence everybody else's perception of her target victim (i.e. whole family not talking to me, being cold, so on and so on).

I will be moving out in less than a month, and I am absolutely tired of dealing with her and her emotions. She's overbearing, overprotective, and cannot deal with the fact that her first child will be ""leaving the nest"". She stated that she called up my university and found out that we had requested to be roomed together (and this is a three-bedroom suite, not a whole apartment to ourselves).

At this point, I'm just too tired to deal with the instability of her emotions towards this subject matter - whether it's me going to university or me moving in with somebody she was perfectly fine with, prior to changing a mere label.

So, my inquiry: how would I go about this situation?

I do not mean to cut ties with her, but I am extremely tired of being treated differently by everyone else simply because she is pissed off at one decision, of being subjected to following each and every request that she makes of me, and of being treated as a child - not a teenager who has curfew at 8pm and not a human being who has to ask permission to even take a morning jog. My safe place is work, not the ""home"" that she has built ""for us"".

370,"Hello everyone. I [25F] have a co worker that seems interested in me. He always asks me personal questions (about my boyfriend, family, my life in general— but MOSTLY about my boyfriend “does [boyfriend] like to do this?” etc). If I miss a day of work he will ask me the next day why I wasn’t there, or has even got someone to text me and ask me why I wasn’t there. I’m a pretty private person, and I definitely did not appreciate any of that. When we’re around each other, I keep things short and civil. I’m new to this job and thought we might be friends when we first started, but it didn’t take me long to realize I didn’t care to be around him because his personality is just downright annoying honestly. I don’t feel like I show that I’m interested in him at all, and when I’m around him, I try to stay busy as possible to avoid conversation. Also he is overly generous— he tries to offer me things all the time, for example, one time he brought me breakfast from the break room, and I was just like “umm no thank you, I don’t eat any of that. Thank you though.” His response was “I was just trying to be nice.” I could go on, but that pretty much sums it up... To top all of it off— he is married! 
    Anyway, today he gave me a Christmas gift— a gift card to a restaurant. I did NOT want to accept this. I don’t care how big or small, I didn’t feel comfortable accepting a gift from him. But, he gave it to me in front of a bunch of people so I felt really bad to say “no, I can’t accept this” in front of everyone! So instead I said “you really shouldn’t have, I appreciate it. Thank you.” A few minutes later he said “you should take [boyfriend] out tonight haha.” Like WHAT THE FUCK?? I just acted like I didn’t hear him. What the fuck do I say to that? I don’t need your fucking gift card, my boyfriend takes me out? I know it’s considered really rude to decline gifts, but I honestly I didn’t want it..

She is a religious muslim, and quite frankly idk what I am.  


Thirdly, she's told me a few times that she's not sure if her parents would allow her to select her own husband or if they would have her have an arranged marriage.  


Obviously if this was the case it would mean that not only did I waste my time in the relationship but I can't do anything about it because she lives in another country.  


Because of these reasons, I've seriously debated breaking up with her in order to save us both the trouble.  


I need advice on 2 things:  


Should I break up with her  


How I should break up with her

380,"I want to make a video for my parents using various clips, i.e. from movies they like and stuff I've shot myself. It'll be super lame, but most home videos are. I've only had experience with Windows Live Movie Maker, but that went kaput and I don't know how to use any other programs of similar complexity. I'd like to be able to add music and text and some decently complex video effects, and like for the program to have more complicated features I could use later on when I wanted to go for more difficult editing work. I know of some programs that are used by professionals, or at least I think, but I'm no professional and won't have a lot of time in the coming years to figure out how to work a program like that.

There is a couple living in the apartment below me (I am on the third floor of a 3 floor walk up) who have gotten into numerous loud fights over the past several months. I have had to anonymously call the police four or five times because the fights eventually escalate to the woman screaming for help or being chased out onto the street or up onto the roof (yes, up a rickety ladder onto the roof!) During these fights there is slamming of objects, breaking things, noises that sound like the guy is beating her (I haven't been able to confirm that it's actually physically abusive) but it often sounds like they are remodeling their apartment with a sledgehammer. In fact, that's what I thought was actually happening the first couple of times.  I have called the police every time I have been home when this has happened as it sounds violent and is very emotionally disturbing and I was always taught to look out for people who may be victims of abuse. Unfortunately the police usually show up too late where the boyfriend has either chased the woman out of the apartment or the woman hides from the police in the apartment after the BF has stormed out. On one occasion one of the police officers blurted out loudly to his partner that someone on the third floor had called the police while they were standing outside the couples' door (myself and my roommates are the only people living on the third floor). 

I hit a bit of a breaking point early this morning. I was woken up to smashing and screaming at 3am (I take my sleep very seriously as I am useless at work the next day if I can't get a few good hours). The screaming and smashing became louder and more frequent so I finally, yet again, called the police. This time they showed up quickly and were able to confront the couple together. I cracked my door open naturally to gauge the situation.

I was a little shocked as they both LIED and acted as if nothing had happened and that they had been ASLEEP! The woman was being very assertive with the police that she was fine and didn't seem to be in the slightest bit of distress. She went on to ask something to the effect of ""was it that guy on the third floor who called you?! You know he's a racist, he called you because he's racist."" \[My jaw hitting the floor\]... the police officer then said something to the effect of ""oh ya, the whole hands-up-don't-shoot thing."" The officers concluded by casually asking ""so everything's ok then?... ok have a good night."" The entire interaction lasted less than a minute, there wasn't even the slightest intimation of any investigatory procedure.  It felt like both the couple and the cops decided *I* was the bad guy for calling 911. 

I've never dealt with a situation like this first hand and I'm wondering what the normal reaction should be. I'm naturally disturbed when I hear verbally and physically violent behavior and my concern has always been for the woman in the situation. However, it seems as though she doesn't need help in the situation (I am aware that victims of abuse will often times try to cover for their abuser) but if she is willing to tell the police that I am RACIST for trying to help her then I feel as though I should just stay out of it. Although I believe at the very least, no one deserves to be subject to their disturbing behavior at 3am. Am I overreacting in calling 911? I am afraid to personally confront them as the boyfriend is a big guy who I've heard become very violent so this option is definitely off the table.

387,"Hello, so throwaway account here for advice.

So my partner was driving into work earlier this week and someone pulled out in front of him at the roundabout so he beeped and flashed his lights and left it at that.  He was then behind the car and it turns out the woman driving worked in the same office. 

Come today he gets called into HR and this woman has reported him saying he drove aggressively behind her beeping and flashing the whole way to work then was aggressive towards her.  

Luckily he has a dash cam and was able to show that none of this was true.

If he hadn’t had a dash cam he may well have been fired. 

Once he showed the video, HR agreed nothing had happened and just let the whole thing go.

My issue is that there were no consequences for the woman clearly lying to get someone from her office she didn’t even know into trouble.

Apparently it’s not the first time she has lied about things at the office that turn out to be total fabrications.

What would you advise in terms of what he should do at the office and how I should try and make him feel better?

388,"Okay, this might seem ridiculous and at first I thought it would be not a big deal but it seems to be getting worse.

My boyfriend is apparently extremely sensitive to smell. Anything remotely chemical smelling will make him sick. When we met I was a huge bath &amp; body works freak. But he can't be around the smell of candles, perfumes, lotions, body washes. etc. Okay, not a huge issue, I needed to stop spending so much money on stuff like that anyway. Next though it was cleaning supplies. I can't clean my house with anything that has bleach in it or any other fruity smells. He uses straight rubbing alcohol to clean anything and everything as it's the only thing he can handle. 

It's getting worse though lately. He uses one particular brand of soap, shampoo, and conditioner, all the ones I like bother him now. If we go out to eat and they're mopping or cleaning the tables with something that he can smell we have to leave. Oh also detergents &amp; fabric softener, if I wash my clothes at my own house instead of his I can pretty much count on him complaining about the smell of them when I come around.

I've tried to be patient, I've stopped using all the things I like, perfumes candles etc. I have started using unscented deodorant. I use his brands of shampoo and conditioner, but his sensitivity seems to be getting worse. I need A LOT of conditioner for my extremely thick and long hair, so now that's started to bother him too. He says he gets nauseous when he can smell my hair.

We've been together for a year now and it hasn't been that bad until recently... but within the last couple months almost every time I see him there is something he is smelling that's making him feel ill. Is this an extreme sensitivity? Like not normal? I suggested maybe he needs to see a doctor but he says that's ridiculous and he's just ""in tune"" with his body so much that he can't handle man made smells. Yeah, that's just as annoying as it sounds.

I love him a lot and this is our one and only issue... I'm just starting to run out of patience because it seems like no matter what I change or do differently to help the situation, there will always be something else that he is smelling that bothers him. It's making me not even want to be around the man that i love. What can we do to try to work around this? Would him seeing a doctor possibly help?",19Dec2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

I've been living with mom when I moved to a new country, for almost 15 years. I'm now 26, and she's been with me through elementary, middle, high school, as well as university. She helped me pay for my tuition fee, and I'm grateful for that. Now, I have a good job that pays well, and in return, I give her monthly allowance. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's not considered a citizen or a permanent resident. She's on a visa. I have my permanent residency that I applied and received after I graduated from uni and gained work experience. She has no way to get it unless I sponsor her. She does not have any income other than my allowance and my sister's allowance to her, which results in about $1000 total monthly. Even when she gets permanent residency here, she's not eligible for welfare of any kind.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is, she's a lot of time upset at me about money. She's being too cheap and we fight quite often. I also pay her  a bit less than $200 for grocery a month and if I buy some chips with my friend and bring it home, I can't include that into grocery fee, and she got all mad at me when I talked about it. She's worrying about spending $3 on xmas wrap roll, and instead decided to only buy $1 gift bag.

&amp;#x200B;

I know how much money she has, as I have access to her bank account. She lets me do all the transfers because she's old and doesn't know how to. Sure, she doesn't have a lot of money, but she owns a nice house as I helped her with my mortgage, and I don't think she should be worrying about money that much.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a lot of things that I am upset about my mom, and there is a lot of reason I always feel she actually loves my sister (who's been living abroad for a long time) more than me. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I moved to this new city, I made a friend, now we consider each other broskis, and I feel like I value him more than my mom and sister.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is, I don't have a dad, and due to that, I've been living with mom all my life. However, I want to move out and be independent, just like other people in my age. Even though I live with her, I pay her rent, I give her grocery fee, and also give her monthly allowance, I pay for both of our cellphones, and I pay internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like she doesn't appreciate me and she does not know the importance of me. Without me, for sure she will suffer, as she does not know how to do a lot of things, and I feel like she should experience that. That's why I don't want to sponsor her for permanent residency and I would rather her go back to our home country, where she can freely speak our language. Then she might be able to deal with a lot more, as here, I have to do every single thing for her because she can't speak english. I gave her my netflix account to watch english series to learn english, and I don't see her watching it often from the history on the account. I feel like if she's dedicated she should be watching it every single hour. I told her to learn english, so that if I sponsor her for a permanent residency, I'll help her get a job at our company, as they prefer family members a lot. She's all excited and stuff, but she's not very dedicated to learn english. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason I feel upset about my mom and sister is, I have a chronic neurological illness, and when I search online to find information to make my symptom better (medication doesn't fully help), all these moms, dads, and family members post online to find solutions for their child, but my mom and my sister doesn't do any of that and don't really care about my illness. My sister until a few months ago, didn't even know my illness was a genetic thing (from dad).

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't have a car so it's hard for her to get to anywhere or meet her friends here. So I was trying to help her by a used car, and our opinions are conflicting, which is seriously making me upset. We were looking at pretty new VW for $14000, and I told her I feel like $2000 off will be a good deal (it's certified used from VW dealership), and she's like that's what regular person might be able to get discounts on. Unless she gets $4000 off, she won't buy it. I tell her it's impossible to get that much off on a car that cheap with low mileage, and she's just stubborn. We've looked around buying cars a lot already, and everytime, she wants the best deal in the world, specially for her. I'm asking her, are you the mayor of the city??? Why would they give you more discount that other people get??? This kind of conflict really makes my relationship with mom worse, and I would rather not get married with anyone if this kind of stuff are what married couple has to deal with all the time, conflicting opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

I know she sacrificed to pay for my tuition fees, and live with me a support me, but I don't want to be living with mom forever.

395,"A little backstory, I am currently in high school. I am in a very low level academic class that I am only taking because I need the credit. There are a couple well, special ed kids in the class. One of them believes that we are best friends or something, I am nice to him everytime I talk to him because I'm not a dick and he is now suddenly very attached to me. Not in an attraction kind of way but he just always talks to me and show me stuff he has done and while I have no problem with any of this, I kind of got led into making a promise that I can't keep. I was sitting in class doing the work on my computer when he came over and started asking me about the laptop I was using. He was saying he wanted one just like it and I started asking him if he asked for one for Christmas to which he replied ""no"". Then my ""friend"" thought it would be funny to say to me ""hey why dont you just give him yours"" I said I couldnt cause I had all my files on the computer to which the special kid agreed. But then my friend decided to say ""well, then why dont you save up and buy him one"" and I kinda got caught up in the moment (and in my head I sort of thought it was a joke) so I said ""uhhh, sure I guess I could try"" which I was hoping the kid would just take as a 'yeah its not gonna happen' but the special kid just ended up getting all excited. I knew at that point I had fucked up big time and I felt terrible because there was no way I was about to buy this kid a $1,500 laptop when I can barely afford to put gas in my car. I tried to get my way out of it so later on in class I talked to the special kid about it and told him that I wanted to make sure he understood that I couldnt keep any promises and he said ""but you can still try right"" and I said ""I can try but I really cant make any promises"" and he said ""Ok I understand but I really dont care how long it takes, just whenever you can is fine"" so now I feel like I am stuck. I feel like such an asshole even though I didnt mean for it to get like this. Today was our last class before our winter break so I'm hoping that he will just forget about it by the time we get back but something is telling me that he likely wont forget. I really fucked up this time and I need some help getting out of this without making the kid upset.

I was happy and i think everyone could tell i was doing well. I lost my job and place i was living, and tried to handle it positively. Tried to bounce back as quickly as possible    and jumped into a new place and new job...even though financially wasn't the best move. I left my self vulnerable..and the stress was getting to me.

Anyway...the stress really messed me up and started having panic attacks and went on to a medication that i regret taking becuase it made the panic and anxiety worse. I moved back home and completely mentally and emotionally regressed, broke down, lashed out towards my family, have been angry, ruined a relationship with a girl who was important to me, and the riff between me and my dad opened back up.

I know that it's sad and whatever but I honestly don't enjoy being around him and would be 100% okay without him the way that he is know. I would love to have a better relationship with him but the way I feel when I'm around him prevents me from pursuing one. Let me explain some stuff... 

I'm a university student right now which adds enough stress to my life as it is. I have a little office setup in my bedroom where I do my studying. He usually keeps to himself because he has quite the gaming addiction so he spends most of his time in the basement playing fortnite. The problem arises whenever he surfaces. He makes huge messes in the kitchen and always leaves the basement a total disaster. This is particularly annoying because after a long day I would love to relax on the couch and watch netflix or play some games with friends but who would want to do that with dirty clothes, day old cheeseburgers and candy wrappers strewn about the room? Don't even get me started on the state of the bathroom down there. I've complained about this multiple times to my mother who doesn't seem to care. I feel like she lets him have his way because it keeps from throwing tantrums and acting out. 

There are problems at night too... his room is right next to mine and the walls are incredibly thin and definitely not soundproof. He literally carries the TV and his system from the basement up to his room and plays on his bed until the early hours of the morning (which often prevents me from sleeping). He's broken televisions before from his little nightly routine. Even worse, he's really nosy and snoops around my room when I'm not home. It wouldn't bother me so much if he were rooting through my desk or something innocent but last week it seems that he got into my sock drawer. This might be a little TMI but I definitely know he's repeatedly taken my sex toys and even opened some of my birth control refills. He's always been curious about everything but it makes me incredibly uncomfortable to know that he gets into my *very* personal belongings. I haven't brought it up with anyone obviously. 

All of these things have made me very eager to move out with my boyfriend and get the hell away from him. I want to bring up some things with my mom and try to really get through to her so she can hopefully start understanding what she needs to do better as a parent. What should I do?",19Dec2018,1
402,"TL;DR: I've (32 M) realized much in my life until recently has been done seeking the approval of others.  How do I confirm what I really want from life, and how do I put in the hard work now in near-middle age?

I (32 M) am finally getting to a place in life where I look after myself, which is still a learning process.  When I look back at my life, I see now that most of what I'd done was for other people.

I finished high school, and went to the same University my parents and brother attended; I'd been interested in attending, but in retrospect they pressured me to go there, and to be in certain living situations while there.  I was so unfulfilled in my studies and the situation-at-large that I ended up dropping out never to return, something that has been a heavy shameful weight on me for the past twelve years.

Shortly after failing school, I started a relationship with a wonderful woman who would later become my Fiance.  We were together for nearly ten years.  She suffered from cancer, and passed away several years ago.  I don't regret any of my time with her.  However, I wrestle with the feeling I didn't have  options to pursue my own path, as I needed to keep working and being there for her (which is infinitely more important).

After she passed, I moved to another State to attempt to restart.  Part of that move was staying with my family again; I maintained the same job I'd had remotely, and have lived with my Brother for several years now.  I so appreciate the support my family has given me, but sometimes I feel that I am still being influenced - That I'm still being pushed in directions or tied down based on others' conceptions.

I've made some enroads: I left my old job for something new (still in Tech), I'm working to purge myself of everything physical I used to hold on to from habit.  I just entered a really great relationship (my first since) with a woman who is strong, independent, beautiful and who pursues what she needs from life.

I still have lingering issues with identifying what I want from life: Career (do I even want a contiguous career?), friends, skills to cultivate, future plans.  I want to feel as if they're all mine, but I can not continue to let others  enable me in compromising my own ideals.  How did you know what you want was really from you (besides just directly taking the risk)?  And has anyone gone through a similar process (I dislike this phrase, but 'finding yourself') at an older age?  Thanks!",19Dec2018,1

I have done some pretty groundbreaking stuff for Business Development within my region (title and escrow specific type things-how to convince the local Association of Realtors to give me access to MLS, how to use the MLS to generate reports to find market activity, compare this market activity with my company's activity to see penetration rates,  get on tour, how to get away with training agents on how to generate leads via social media without violating SB-133, farming, re-designing existing marketing material via the apple effect) and I was just asked by our district president **if I could train the next region over on how I do my job.**

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't want me to train my own region, or even my existing sales team. He is asking me to travel three counties over and train in a totally different market than the one that I am currently working in. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think? This sure doesn't sound like entry-level business development work. This sounds like Corporate, **Business Development Executive** work. Could this be a test to see what the outcome would be if my business plan could work on a larger scale, and if it shows successful, would i potentially be getting a promotion? OR is it possible that I am just being ghosted (Mariah Carey's Glitter type ghosted, where someone else is getting credit for my work).

410,"(Throwaway account, given the subject matter)

I work for a small company and have for just under 2 years. I'm one of those 'fluid' positions where I do a little of everything. My main job is purchasing. I used to assist Accounting too, but got pulled away to do executive assistant stuff after they realized I used to do project management. 

I still do purchasing, and I still have access to the accounting software. Mostly because I manage the vendors, purchase orders, etc. 

When I first started, I would assist with A/R and A/P. However, our controller is... a control freak (surprise surprise) and I was slowly revoked access over the first year. It was an issue, and I was asked not to make it into a big fight. 

Well. Back then I saw red flags for how this small company is financially managed. I'm no controller, but certain red flags were quite obvious. I noted them, and passed them along to upper management privately. I was told: ""We are aware of some issues and will be handling it accordingly.""

Fast forward to today. All of my POs for purchases were denied by A/P, stating: ""We have no money for that."" Including small, local purchases that were less than $100. (We deal with industrial products, so it isn't uncommon for me to get approved for $10,000 worth of steel at a time). 

I decided to go digging, and found a few areas where my viewing access wasn't revoked by said controller. 

There are outstanding invoices dating back to earlier this year. Not just a few. Dozens and dozens. High amounts. Multiple vendors. Tens of thousands owing. Way overdue. These are vendors I have working relationships with. I called a few of them to ask for the status of our accounts and net terms. A few were suspended.

I'm unsure what to do with this information, beyond going to the higher ups. 

I mean, I've told them before that there were issues with the books and was told they 'knew' and were 'handling it'. But, no one in the company has access to the accounting software except me, the controller and one sales guy. 

Unless they know about it and are trying to keep it quiet? In which case, would going to them be a risky move? 

I also now wonder about my job security, and the financial status of this small company. 

Do I try to go to the owners, who I meet with weekly, to bring this all to light?

Is this a normal thing to be so behind on invoices, pushing 120+ days PAST net terms? 

Should I be looking to protect myself, in case the company is struggling? 

Do I just sit and mind my P's and Q's, believing that they will 'handle it', as they've told me before when I brought up red flags?",19Dec2018,1

I got really confused and said As, and he said that he wanted to make sure we were on the same page because something that I might consider awesome might be something he doesn't consider awesome.

426,"I don't know if this is the right place, and I feel kind of funny telling strangers about this, but I really don't know what else to do. I'm gonna try to keep this as short as I can, but I doubt I'll be able to, so sorry in advance.

Basically, my stepfather is a great man. He's my mother's third husband (my birth father left when I was 2, and she divorced my siblings' father when I was about 19 because he did horrible things unrelated to this post), and he's the only person I've ever viewed as a father. My mom knew him growing up and kept in contact with him over the years. Christmas morning of the year she got divorced, she had a near-fatal heart attack. Husband #2 didn't say anything or do anything, he didn't even say anything to us about it, but my stepfather drove halfway across the state to be there for her and us.

My youngest two siblings view him as their actual father, not at anyone's encouragement but just because he genuinely cared about them and spent time with them, unlike their birth father. They call him dad and their birth father by his first name, despite my mom and stepdad's intial encouragements otherwise. He and I fight because our politics are completely opposite, but we still love each other. When I was hospitalized for attempting suicide, he stayed there all night and never left my side. I'd only known him for a year then.

And he's extremely sentimental. My other sister (who's close to my age and lives with me) and I try and make him cry every Christmas, which I promise isn't as mean as it sounds. He's just surprisingly easily moved by sappy, sentimental stuff, and I guess we like seeing that he cares and making him feel loved. Last year we got him a big photo frame and put pictures of all us, his parents, and their pets in there and wrote him cards. He didn't make it through the first card without breaking down. You can only imagine how he handled the year before when my sister got him a shirt that said ""best stepdad ever"" with the ""step"" part crossed out.

The point is, I really love him and believe he's a good father, and I don't want my siblings to be without him. But he's addicted to narcotics, and it's really destroying his relationship with my mom. She can't handle stress well at all and isn't exactly the healthiest person. He first had issues with this years ago, and it was really bad. Like, he stole stuff from my grandparents to pay for painkillers and lied to doctors to get prescriptions and it was just a huge mess. My mom kicked him out, which pissed me off because it's a health problem. It's not like he's a bad person; he's got a disease, and while he needs to try harder, I don't view it as a moral failing. So she talked to him and let him come back and supported him. He went to a support group and has been clean for years.

But this year he's fallen off the wagon and has been really defensive about it. I don't live near my mom anymore so I don't seem them very often, but we talk a lot. Money keeps going missing, he's acting bizarre, and then a couple weeks ago she found an email he sent to a doctor asking for a refill of painkillers and later a bottle of them. But he denies it and is very, VERY defensive and ugly when she confronts him. I asked her if she wanted me to talk to him when they visit for Christmas, but she said no because he'd be mad that she told me and she doesn't want to hear it. She's considering divorcing him because the stress is too much for her.

So I don't know what to do. I can't tell him I know, but I think he's lost sight of what's important, and I want to know how to make him get help. My mom's just refusing to talk to him because of his attitude problem and her low tolerance of stress, and I know I can't solve their marriage problems for them, but I don't want to lose another dad.

I bought a 2018 Honda Civic EX back in March. Two months after I bought it, there was a puddle of coolant and it turned out that my radiator was faulty. It was covered under warranty but I had to pay out-of-pocket for a rental car for 3 days. 

Today I opened my trunk and it was FLOODED with rainwater especially where the spare tire is. I know it’s not because the trunk was open because the left side of the trunk is dry but the right side is drenched.

I'll come out of a conversation having raised my voice maybe a little, but noone seemed disturbed. But for me everything from the conversation was a foggy haze and I cant really remember anything. The fuw times I got into fist fights (all before the 5th grade) it was the same, no memory of it at all. It's difficult not being able to remember what I've said or done after an argument with my boyfriend. As a child (5-8 or so) I made adults in my life cry multiple times with the things I've said, and then I resented them for being week. I just want to be the kind person everyone thinks I am, but I'm not. How do I control my rage if I notice I've started to black out like that? Again, as far as I know as an adult I've never said anything too cruel or yelled at anyone, I know for a fact I've never been violent. Even if I'm not black out angry I still am quick to get defensive and sassy and react almost immediately to any perceived threat which effects my personal relationships a lot more.

438,"Hi. I’m concerned because I’ve been working now for about 5 years and I have never had a “full” day of tasks for work.  I’m on now my fourth job and I’m in a pretty decent position as a consultant at a big firm (next promotion is to middle management). I have always done extremely well on performance reviews, and my bosses are always super happy with me. 

However, all my coworkers always complain about how much work they have. They all brag about how they can’t get it done and they’re staying late. It comes as a shock to me because I’m usually done with my work day around 1pm. I have legitimately never stayed late for work once. Many of my coworkers have fewer tasks than I do. I accomplish all my tasks in my job description and have even assumed half the responsibilities of another role, so I do the work of 1.5 FTE. 

I’ve tried on multiple occasions to ask for more assignments/work but it’s always met weirdly. I don’t think I’m a superhuman by any means, but I can read extremely quickly, never procrastinate, and I usually simplify my own tasks. For instance 15% of my role was completing a bi-weekly report....it was done manually in 8 steps so I made a macro and now it takes 10 mins to run and 30 mins to quality and spot check.  

So now I spend about 3 hours a day “working” and 5 hours in the gym/Reddit/lunch/Espn.

Seasonal depression has hit me hard this year. I’m questioning my relationship. I’m wondering if I’m giving to much and receiving too little. Time, money, everything feels unbalanced. I’ve talked with my bf several times in the past to let him know that I need more sex in my life. He always has some excuse, usually that he’s too tired. I know that sex isn’t EVERYTHING in a relationship, but for me we’re not having it enough. But because we have this issue, and because I feel like if I bring it up again he’ll just be upset with me, I’ve been dreaming about my friend. Really, very vivid dreams about us together. Vivid dreams about my bf cheating on me so that we break up.

I probably sound crazy. I feel like I should be just appreciative of what I have in my BF. He’s a really nice guy and I feel he does his best, but at the same time I can’t get my best friend out of my head. What should I do? ",19Dec2018,1

448,"Hi everyone,

So I lost my job 3 weeks ago and my wonderful boyfriend thought that he would be a great idea not to spend much on my Christmas gift this year because he knew that I wouldn't be able to buy him an expensive gift. 

He told me that he spent approximately 50$ on my gift. The thing is, I just received money from the government and guess what? First thought that came to my mind was to buy him a NICE gift. He asked for a turntable which costs approx $250. 

He knows I received some money and now he told me that he feels bad about buying me something cheap. I told him not to worry but the truth is I am fucking pissef off. I'm thinking of buying him the turntable just so he feels cheap. 

Btw I when I work I make 40K per year, and he makes 80K. He bought a 300$ gift for his mom. All of his gifts in his wishlist ranged from 75-300$.
He never asked me what I wanted, but felt free to make a list for himself. 

I usually don't care much about gifts but what pisses me off is the way he thinks. Because I lost my job he thought that I wouldn't be able to offer him something nice, so he thought that it wouldn't be worth it to splurge a little on me. Like I didn't deserve it. He also never takes me on dates. We split everything. We'vw been togwther for a year and a half. I will already feel like shit this. Christmas.

“You have a D in that class because I’m such a bad parent”

She’s right about somethings I shouldn’t have a D in that class, but is that reason enough to start acting like that? I didn’t help you bring the stuff to the car because you didn’t ask me too. You said I’m in line.

450,"I am a pre-med student at a large public university. Basically, I have told my parents that I have been studying for the MCAT (the standardized test for medical school) since freshman year, and when I came home from school every month or so, I would be on my computer for hours at a time, ""studying"". The truth, however, is that I have not been studying at all for the MCAT - I would just be surfing the web, or doing school work, or studying for other classes, but I have barely gotten started on the MCAT preparation. In addition, I reported to them the scores that I got from practice MCAT tests that I bought, but these scores would all be bogus - I just made them up. Unfortunately, because my parents think that I have been studying for nearly 3 and a half years now, they think that I should be more than ready to take this exam, even though I am nowhere near where I need to be right now. I only have about a month left until my scheduled MCAT date, and I still do not know what to do. I am studying now, but for me to reach around 500 hours of studying and prep (the recommended amount of time), I would have to study for around 14-16 hours a day, which I know I do not have the discipline nor willpower for. If I confess to them about my lies, then they would probably disown me, and I really need their support to get to where I want to be. I just feel like I am caught in between a rock and a hard place right now, and there doesn't seem to be a way out. In addition, I have talked to them about delaying the test to buy myself some more time, but they are against it (in fact, they wanted me to take this a few months ago, and I managed to delay it to the date I have now). They think that I am just nervous because I am burned out and have studied for too long, even though I know I have not. What should I do?

So I remember this guy named Ben who was new at this job. Everyone hated him because he was always working slow. I was always standing by he’s side and I even told colleagues that they should’n’t act like that towards Ben because he’s new. 

Me and him then became friends outside of work. We were hanging together (no homo) like friends. 

I remember he always was asking me about my opinion on things everywhere from work related to other topics like football. I then noticed that he went behind my back and was telling other colleagues at work what I think of them. Which was totally manipulated and fake as I didn’t even tell him my opinion on other colleagues. 

So in short he was a fake friend and I supported him. 

The situation I’m in now is that he is still talking shit behind my back. I didn’t really know but everytime I talk to someone at work he comes after me, take them to private places to talk. I was not thinking much but someone at work told it to me and gave me advice that I should just let him talk. He didn’t want to tell me what Ben said about me. He just told me that Ben is talking negative things.

457,"Hey all,

I underwent a pretty extensive assessment with an educational psychologist a while back. This included WAIS to assess for learning difficulties. 

I was given a copy of the report and was satisfied with the data I was given. I was given the subtest scores for each part of the WAIS and decided I was happy without calculating an IQ. 

I know a fair bit about IQ and how it's a flawed metric, doesn't determine my worth as a person etc but I'm curious to see how I tested. I'm not expecting it to be anything other than average - I know I'm strong on some areas and was diagnosed with learning difficulties based on other cognitive areas I'm barely capable of

Googling around I wasn't able to find out how to calculate ""the final result"" 

I've attached a screenshot of the data I think is relevant. Does anyone know how I'd calculate an IQ?

458,"This ongoing holiday season has proven to be a very stressful one for me for a lot of reasons.  So much is going on and it’s getting to be a little overbearing.  I’m not sure what to do.  I’ll try to describe it as best I can by kind of summarizing the different factors below.

* **New Job** - I recently started what is essentially a stone’s throw away from my dream job within the past month or so.  It’s not 100% there, but it’s close enough that I can work my way into exactly where I want to be within a year or two.  Plus it’s for the organization I’ve always idolized, and the pay is really nice too. That sounds great, but it has really messed with my head.  Over the last five or so years, I’ve become accustomed to just scraping by and having to just blindly hope for a better future.  Now that I’m here, I feel like I’ve merely fooled or tricked someone into giving me this opportunity, or that I’m just destined to screw it up.  While I know I am good at what I do, I otherwise feel out of my league, like I don’t truly belong here or that something will inevitably screw this up for me like so many other things in life have.  It’s really messed with me and has made me question my worth, not only here, but elsewhere as well.

* **Family Drama** - My parents had a very nasty divorce almost a decade ago, and both sides of my family have been engulfed in drama ever since.  Obviously, I dread the Christmas season because of this.  I really have to attend a few different get togethers because my grandparents are not doing very well at all and this is likely their last Christmas.  I just know that the majority of my time spent at these things are going to be full of awful rumormongering and guilt tripping.  Everyone hates each other and they continually question why I stay nuetral and don’t wallow in bitterness like they do.  I can’t stand it and it stresses me out so much.

* **Friend Drama** - This could be another advice post on it’s own.  Long story short, a good friend really screwed my wife and close friends over this past year.  His girlfriend at the time was a big factor in his decisions in that regard.  She’s now dumped him and I know he regrets a lot of what happened.  I want to reach out to him, but no one else really does because he did choose to really betray us in a lot of ways earlier this year.  I feel awful about it, and it’s led to our big circle of friends to be split into two, and I truly hate it and am depressed about it and don’t know what can be done.

* **Worthlessness** - A lot of different things that I’ve laid out here and others that I haven’t just generally make me feel like a worthless and awful person.  I feel like everyone in my life has distanced themselves from me for reasons that mostly seem outside of my control, and I really can only trust my wife and a handful of close friends.  And even then I question if I am truly worth anything to them anyways since evidently I am trash to everyone else.  Feeling so isolated makes me question everything about myself, I hate the way I look, I hate what I am, it’s hard to describe and I don’t know what to do about it.

I know I need to take some personal time and take care of myself, but I just don’t have that option right now.  I’m working a new job and don’t have any off days to take, and the holiday days I do have will be taken up by obligatory family, church, or other Christmas events.  I just feel worthless and pinned against a wall and I don’t know what to do.  Anyone have any advice?",19Dec2018,1

466,"So my husband is friends with a woman he has known since college. It was never a romantic relationship, although my husband wanted it to be at one point when he was young and flighty-free-spirit-girl was still an alluring archetype. But they have stayed good friends over the years. What can we do to help her that does not involve her living with us? Because we are also not in a position to take her in long term at the moment. We live across the country and are currently renting part of my father’s house (he lives there as well) while we dig our way out of a healthcare induced financial hole due to a medical issue of my husband’s. We are truly fortunate to have a supportive family willing to help us out while my husband has undergone multiple painful, extreme surgeries and spent extensive time wheelchair-bound.

This woman is a nice, good person, truly, but has mental health issues that are only occasionally treated and under control. She is very bipolar and possibly schizophrenic with a myriad of other issues thrown in as well. She is about 40 now, but comes from a very dysfunctional family that is completely incapable of supporting her in any meaningful way. She is divorced with one grown son and another that her ex has custody of. For the last two years since that separation she has been for all intents and purposes homeless. She has moved all over the country, lived with a few guys (one of which was abusive) for short spans and at at least 2 different communes. She also spent some time volunteering for an aid organization for hurricane relief in Florida. But she never stays in one place for more than a few weeks and she has slowly exasperated all of her friends and anyone willing to help her. She has not successfully held a job long term in at least 4 years. She smokes cigarettes and occasionally weed, but is not addicted to booze or hard drugs thankfully. However, her mental health issues cause her to have wild mystical delusions where she will become convinced that spirits are guiding her and other such things.

I think the best and most stable she has been was this fall when she was working on hurricane relief, but obviously that was a short term thing. She does well and is a hard worker when she feels needed like that. Especially on a short term project basis. But she never seems to be able to stick with something long term. Her default response to her problems is to find someone to take care of her for awhile. But eventually goodwill wears out, she is on her own again.

For now, my husband has set her up with his parents who are in poor health and homebound in their hometown (which is unfortunately across the country in Pennsylvania). She is going to help them out in exchange for room and board while she looks for a job. I’m not super hopeful as their hometown is a rustbelt city with a depressed economy. The public transport is pretty much non-existent as well. But it’s a start I guess, and better than being homeless in winter.

I can’t help but feel that this is how most homeless people start out. They have some medical/mental issue that prevents them from taking care of themselves and “adulting” as it were. I mean if it weren’t for my family we would have been in dire straits during my husband's illness as he has not been able to work, and I have had to take time off on more than a few occasions to care for him. I also struggled with depression in my 20’s quite a bit, and my family always made sure I survived. So what happens to you if you have no support system? Do we as a society have any responsibility for those people, or do we just let them fall through the cracks into homelessness and become one of the forgotten?",19Dec2018,1

Though I am sure I’m not the first, and certainly not the last, I still feel like I have cheated my school and that karma will come to haunt me (perhaps this is how). Despite knowing how wrong it was, I was somewhat desperate for money to make ends meet and I thought this was a quick solution. 

My classmate approached me two days before I had two exams and 4 projects to complete and asked if I could write his paper for him. I told him it was extremely risky and that I’m super strapped for time, but I could sense his desperation and felt bad. After bargaining for about an hour, I said I could do it for $300. We made the deal and he said he’d pay me right after he submits it (first red flag).

476,"As I typed this out it became a lot more rant than question -- the TL;DR would be that due to depression my mom doesn't take care of her stuff, I know it's not my place to get irritated about it (live and let live) but I am irritated because I'm going to have to deal with it when she passes. The point that I realized I needed to deal with this was when I saw she had ""repaired"" my dad's mid-life crisis car in a way that ultimately did more damage than good.

---------------------------------------

My dad passed about 3.5 years ago and my mom hasn't been the same. Dad's last year or so wasn't great -- they fought the cancer head on but chemo, hotel stays and medicational side effects all took their toll. In doing all this Mom took a few long-term absences from work. Shortly after dad passed her company let her go.

All this left her in a pretty hefty depression that she's been working to get out of. She's doing a lot better, she's made some of her own friends, she gets out and does things, but she's still depressed. I try to help with this as much as I can, but when you factor in other things in her life I don't think she'll pull out of it completely. I'm working with My brother to help with that, but I have accepted internally it's going to be an uphill battle and my mother only has so many years to go uphill.

Currently I go over for a few hours every Saturday to hang out. Sometimes we tackle chores, sometimes we play scrabble or go shopping or something fun. Additionally, I usually make it over a few extra nights a month to help with other things.

Unfortunately in the interim she's not taking care of her things. Her house is generally very cluttered; she can't seem to muster the desire to come up with an organizational system that works for her. On top of that, when something breaks she doesn't seem to be interested in fixing it ""right"". She'll use tape on surfaces that will get damaged by the adhesive, she'll come up with weird off the wall ways of doing standard DIY jobs that would wind up ruining (or at least reducing the value of) whatever she's working on, and other assorted quackery. I try to intervene when I can, sometimes successfully sometimes not. 

I know the primary root of this is her depression, but she was always kind of a slob. I don't want to talk to her about it because she has a massive inferiority complex; trying to suggest she's doing something wrong would just lead to more depression and anxiety (She doesn't take criticism of any kind well). I will help her where I can, but I need to get my own issues in order -- that is to say I need to not be upset at her for ruining her stuff. Some of that being upset comes from wanting her to not live in a depressive pit, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't also concerned with having to deal with all of it someday.

This came to a head this week. My dad, like most older gents will, bought a mid-life crisis two-seater with an irresponsible power to weight ratio. It wasn't brand new, but it was his baby and he kept it in great shape. I don't want to sound like an absolute asshole, but I'm looking forward to it being my baby -- if it isn't destroyed first. It may seem inconsequential, but last summer I replaced a bulb and the housing snapped due to plastic wear and age. I told her I'd get a new one (which is sitting in my toolbox for $10 from a local salvage yard) and could install it next time she came over in said sports-mobile (as opposed to her jeep) 

Fast forward to now. My car is in the shop, so I have borrowed the aforementioned irresponsible two-seater. I went to pop that lens in last night and found she'd used aluminium tape to secure the old one in place. I know if I try and take the tape off it's going to pull the paint with it.

478,"Hello, 

I work as a potwash in a kitchen and have signed no contracts or absolutely any written agreements regarding my job as I only work as part time for a family friend who works as the chef in a small family pub on the outskirts of my town. I am only 15 so I'm not sure which laws change due to my age etc.

I worked last Sunday and I was the last person to take out the rubbish bags as of Wednesday when our kitchen group chat was sent a message by the manager saying ""Leaving this sort of mess outside the bins is disgusting and unacceptable. I will find out who it is and dock the wages accordingly."" I would understand if it was a bad mess, but it was literally a few potato peels? And it 100% was not me because it was pitch black and I had dropped my keys outside the bins when chucking the rubbish bags away and used my phone torch to find them, and there were no potato peels. This sounds like a lie because it is such a coincidence and probably will not believed but it was definitely not my fault. However, no one worked Monday or Tuesday and so I will get the blame?

What should I do and is it even legal to dock my wages over such a small issue?

Thanks,

he will bash his mother over things that are clearly out of her control. this man is 26 years old and still blames his mom for everything. his father was very destructive growing up his mother tried her best to keep dad in the right path, and to shield the kids from their owns fathers issues and struggles. his father also suffers from the same issues and is to blame for his children inheriting the same mental health.

he believes that his mother was never there for him even though she clearly was, his sister was put through the same ringer &amp; has the same mental health problems and is on the same meds as him but doesn't have the manic or depression that he does. i believe that this is because his sister chooses to better her life.

he try's to justify his tantrums by saying things like ""if you didn't put me on all the meds as a kid i wouldn't be the crazy person i am today"". just like his father he refuses to acknowledge his own mistakes and blames others.

I am studying full time at a place I didnt choose. Additionally, I am working two freelance jobs and volunteering at a scientific network and I also take part in research, try to exercise, and have somewhat of a social life. 
I have been working non stop for a year and a half, and worrying about applying to new places constantly and feeling like a complete underachiever. 

Lately, I have had no will or power to do any of that work. I don't worry about anything, I don't do anything, I feel empty on the inside and all I'm doing is refreshing my social media every 5 minutes (and I recognise that that is quite unhealthy), I feel lonelier than ever and all I want is a relationship (I think it is rather intimacy) and even though I had a couple of chances with some nice guys I don't want to get involved in something right now and in this mental state.

493,"Social media has destroyed my relationship and is significantly contributing to my depression. 

I’m in a long distance relationship of over two years and my insecurities have pushed my soon-to-be ex-boyfriend farther away from me. I became a tyrant and my anxieties made me insufferably curious and angry every time he’d follow/friend a beautiful girl or a page with provocative pictures. I tired of seeing him “like” other girl’s photos and seeing pictures his friends would post of him enjoying his life without me there. I am a jealous person and social media exacerbates it to a degree I can no longer handle. 

I am so unhappy with myself and my life that I can’t stand seeing pictures of happy couples or sappy posts about wonderful SO’s. It has made me bitter about feeling so alone in my own relationship. 

I know the answer is delete my social media, but it feels like a double edged sword. I feel very lonely on a day-to-day basis. If I delete my social media, I’ll feel even more irrelevant and invisible to everyone than I already do. I will struggle with how to fill my time. I don’t have many hobbies because of my profound depression. I cry at home, I cry at work, I cry in my car in the parking lot of places I need to go to.  I really don’t do much else, to be honest. I am at such a low point that I question my existence every single day. 

I know social media isn’t all to blame for my emotional issues (I’m just venting at this point!), but I guess what I’m asking is how you all deal with the negatives it seems to have? Today was an especially rough day with my boyfriend. I saw him follow a page that made me feel very insecure about a lot of things in our relationship and it blew up into an argument. All over text, of course, because he lives in a different country. 

So, I know this post took a lot of different directions, but any advice or maybe even some kind words would be really appreciated. I am already aware that my insecure behavior is toxic so suggestions on how to change this behavior is welcomed.

506," Sorry in advance for my absolute essay of a post.

Little bit of backstory here. I live in Florida and just started my freshman year of high school. My school only has a varsity hockey team, as there aren’t enough players for a JV team. However, everyone basically automatically makes the team, although most freshman do not play in games. Now I have been very hyped to join this team for over a year, and a few weeks ago the first practice day finally arrived. And I have heard amazing things about this coach, which only made me even more excited.

First practice day arrives. Then a week passes, then two, then three. During these first three weeks, I quickly realized that I am not performing at all as I expected for myself. I don’t like ever talking myself up, but objectively, I am probably the most/second most talented freshman on the team out of six, and definitely one of the overall hardest workers on the team out of everyone.

I am making this post because I am just slightly upset at my coach for the way he’s treated me since the season started.

Basically, even though I have been performing at about \~40% of my actual talent level, the work ethic is absolutely still there, and my coach has just absolutely not noticed/completely ignored this. I am always the first one on the ice before practice, and the last one off. And I don’t do this to impress him either, I don’t give a shit if he sees this or not, I just get on early because I love hockey, I would stay at the rink for eight fucking hours if I could. I have also spoken to him and the other coaches about ways to improve my game, and I am always busting my ass during drills. 

It just seems that he doesn’t even notice this though, and has repeatedly told me that I need to work harder and “focus up”. He has also basically never complimented me for doing something right during practice, even though he does that for most other people. In fact, he is always yelling at me for screwing things up and today he called me out for doing a drill wrong when I was doing literally, LITERALLY, exactly what I was told to do.

I don’t know, I still like him as a coach, I just feel like I am being treated unfairly. Maybe I’m biased, maybe I really do need to work harder, but I just would appreciate it if someone could help me figure out what the fuck is going on.

Thank you",19Dec2018,1

My older brother, when he used to live with us (2 years ago), got himself into debt with a loan shark. £80 is the amount he owed but he couldn't afford it so he moved out across town. 

2 years went by and we heard nothing of it. Tonight, however, the loan shark turned up at my brother's house (no idea how he found his address) and now says that, because of the delay of him recieving the money, my brother now owes   £300. 

To me the debt is irrelevant; my brother got himself into it. It's more what the loan shark said to him whilst he was there:

Loan shark: ""I heard your mother has been in a fire""

Brother: ""No, I just spoke to her on the phone""

Loan shark: ""oh don't worry then if haven't heard about it just yet""

&amp;#x200B;

I never know what to choose, which sucks for making life decisions.

It is a long read, I hope all of you don't mind. I wanted to ask you guys want you would do if you were me?

&amp;#x200B;

Some information about me:

&amp;#x200B;

1)

I have finished my college in Graphic Design.

Its cool and all, but I don't really want to peruse it with a job. It pays bad and I’m not really passionate enough about it. Also the education was quite bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

2)

When I was in college I used to trade crypto and made good money. at one point I had 400K euro, I sadly lost most of it now i have around 150k, which is still nice. 

Now the crypto market is down, so I thought about trading stocks. 

But I have no idea if this is a good choice or not. I'm quite intelligent so its not crazy to think I can become successful at it. 

If I become successful trading stocks, it will be a dream job because you can work from your laptop and travel the world while making money. And I can become financially independent!

But there really isn't like a school where you can learn it, so I have to teach myself everything, which can be quite stressful. Some days I just don't know what I could do to improve my skills. There isn't a guide I can follow or something for creating your own trading strategy.

So I don't know if its stupid to try it, or its a waste of time (and possibly money).

  

3)

Also my dad offered me a job.  He owns a DataCenter. He asked me to lead a new, very small company. 

Its about software development, I have to make sure the company runs, other people will develop the software.

I guess its cool, but the problem is the company is in a German village (I live in Holland). I have been there a few times and its SUPER BORING. Only old people. And I basically have to live there for a while. 

Also I don't know how good the idea of the software itself is. 

So I really don't look forward doing this, but maybe its stupid to refuse, since if it becomes successful I have my own company. And once it is setup I can just work from my laptop. 

But no idea how long it takes to setup a company, and if it will become successful. 

&amp;#x200B;

  

4) 

I could go and try to find a job in IT. But that just seems like a safe option. I don't really like IT that much, but I know I can do it.

&amp;#x200B;

  

5)

I would like to travel the world, especially Asia, for a longer period.. Already went to Bali and Thailand.

I feel like when I travel I meet the coolest people. Also life in other countries seems so different.

In my city I don't meet that much interesting people. I have trouble connecting and meeting new people here. 

Also my friends are getting older and more busy, and I see them less. so I feel like I really need to broaden my social circle. 

But I don’t want to take super long trips right now because I know I will just worry about what I’m going to do after. I don't own a house or anything, and right now there is no new money coming in.

Another reason why I want to travel is because I want to work on my social skills. 

Im quite introverted. Some people, I can easily talk to. But I really hate small talk, or talking to random strangers. 

Nevertheless I want to improve my social skills so I become better at those things. It’s important for meeting new people. I applied for this job in an electronics store, so I can work on these skills. I have a job interview next week.

But maybe is getting a minimum wage job a waste of time, especially at my age. Also I have to quit it if I decide to go for my dads offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay this is the end, I hope you could follow it.

&amp;#x200B;

What who you guys do in my situation? ",19Dec2018,1
518,"This is a big sub so I'm hoping to get some kind of input/advice here, pretty please. Sorry for the word vomit.

My circle is really small. I have two people I consider my best friends and that's about it. I have other friends, but not as close. I'm sure a lot of you get it, those friends who when you see them it's awesome and they're great, but not so close that you talk on a semi-regular/regular basis. I've been friends with these two since 6th grade. I'd just moved and thank god they befriended me because I was socially ostracized basically for being the new kid. It sucked. Whatever, fast forward 12 years later we're all still friends which I'm grateful for. We've been through a lot together, as one can imagine growing up through puberty and personal life events. Bonus, we all lived on the same street. Friend 1 and 2 were neighbors and friends before I came along, and I moved in 2 houses down. It was awesome. But since graduating, our lives have changed so much. Friend 1 went to college, graduated and is now in a full time career (SO proud!) and the other moved over an hour away to live with current SO and now works full time. I moved 40 mins away from where we all lived/grew up, friend 1 still lives in that area. 

I know life gets in the way, we're adults now with more responsibilities and things to take up our time, but we've always been each other's closest friends, and now I wish I branched out more when I was younger. You ever see those friendships where girls are super close, hang out a lot, can call each other on a whim to either vent, cry, or just talk? Where they hang out even just to kill time, or go on drives, all that stupid fun if not corny shit that I frankly, would absolutely love to have/do with my friends. But they don't like really going out to begin with. And on top of that, our conversations are incredibly sporadic now. It just makes me so sad. I feel so alone sometimes. I live with my BF who is for real my best friend and I love hanging with him and talking to him, but sometimes you just wanna see your girls now and then, ya know what I mean?? If I'm able to get them both on the group chat at the same time for 10 minutes I get so happy. But it's short lived. When I try to make plans I always *always* initiate and will work around things or make it work into my schedule no matter what, I always accommodate to them. But they barely make the effort back of planning things. It's usually just ""I have to work"" ""I have to check my schedule"" and never actually giving an answer or not even make the effort to schedule a day far ahead of time to make it work with all of our schedules. And the conversation just ends with us complaining about being busy. Rinse and repeat. Despite me pestering them to figure it out with me. I'm a busy person, too. I work over full time and have had a busy schedule even since we were in high school and they didn't have to have jobs or worry about anything like that. I've always made the time and the effort. And on more than one occasion they've been known to read and not respond to messages (mostly friend 2), which hurts because I can see that you've read my messages/attempts to have conversation/to plan a hangout, and you're not going to respond? Sigh.

So I just feel like I've always sacrificed and made that extra effort because I truly feel like maintaining friendships and making time for them is so important. We all deserve that in the midst of this crazy hustle and bustle life. It just all feels so one sided and I feel like a jerk even saying that because I'm sure they're just busy. I don't even know how to approach this and how I'm feeling with my friends because how can I be upset when they, too, have other things to do? I just feel like even feeling this way is wrong. And it's not like we have to see each other a lot. I guess it'd be different if we all at least talked and kept in contact on a semi-regular basis, but it just feels like our friendship has fallen so flat. When I bring it up they'll agree and be sad about it, but that's really it. But we're still so young, and it literally feels like we're all in our 30s or older, settled down, with children and families of our own, and we have to try like hell to get together. The process of trying to set up a date takes weeks or longer, and it's always months and months apart. It just really gets lonely. Should it truly be this hard to make time for each other, or is it just an excuse?? Also they're a lot more introverted and always have been, which is fine! I love them regardless, but it also plays a huge role in our dynamic in general. So I guess I couldn't really have the ""call on a whim in tears or just to chat"", go on a drive just for the fun, go shopping or grab a couple drinks friendship with them if I wanted to. But I've always wanted that. I really wish I branched out more when I was younger and maybe made more close friends that would reciprocate the effort. But I'm in my 20s now. And yes I'm still so young, but people today, they already have their little friend groups. I don't care what anyone says, most people in my age group aren't eager to meet new people and welcome new faces into the normalcy of their groups. It's an isolating feeling to try. And I've tried.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what exactly I'm looking for here. How to express my feelings to them without coming off like a jerk or guilting them? How to branch out and make new friends? Are they actually not making the effort they could be making or I'm just being selfish? Are we just outgrowing each other? I just need to be able to see this from another perspective. I want to talk to them about it in a healthy way but don't know where to start.",19Dec2018,1
519,My boyfriend and I have moved into an apartment together for the first time. We are on the second floor and there is one more floor above us. Our upstairs neighbors are extremely heavy on their feet and don’t seem to take their shoes off when they get home (female often wearing heels). We don’t really know what’s to be expected when someone lives above you but we are starting to feel like this is just obnoxious and that we probably don’t sound like that to the people below us. They are also up at all times of the night stomping around and it’s waking us up. What should we do? Is this expected in an apartment? Is our building just poorly insulated? Is it ridiculous to mention something to them and does that make us look like jerks if we do? Thanks! ,19Dec2018,1

This is mostly aimed at women but men who are in/were in similar situations are welcome to chime in.

I've been dating a girl recently, to be honest its the first time actually ever dated in my life and is a big step for me. As i start to get more personal with her I am beginning to worry that my financial situation might be an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

She's well established with her father working at a bank and she herself working as an engineer. I am also an engineer that makes around 75K a year, but I also have a mortgage to pay and family (mom and sister) to support so it trickles down to exactly half of that. On top those expenses, I live on my own in an apartment, with rent and living expenses (food, internet, gas, utilities). This leaves me with around 200$ or less to spend on luxuries like dining out/gifts/events that I do with her.  

While I know this situation wont be forever, and I am always working to move up the ladder as fast as I can at work, I am worried the wait might make her feel that I am not ready for a relationship with her or she might think I'm not rich enough for her.

Then as I grew older, the jokes became more frequent. I was called hot dog face, big head, etc. I’m not ugly, my ratios are completely equal when you vertically break them into 3’s. A plastic surgeon told me that once... not like it means much because my thing is, it may be equal ratios but it’s a lot larger than everyone else’s. I hate seeing myself in pictures next to everyone- which is why I avoid being photographed. 
It makes me feel masculine and ugly. I hate that I have to look so different.

The surgeries they mentioned I would need non-surprisingly fall under FFS (for trans people looking to feminize their facial features).

535,"TL;DR at the end.

**BACKGROUND:** I promised myself that I would not focus on relationships until I’m financially stable with a stable career. However, I broke this promise when my boyfriend and I started dating. I don’t want to see this as a mistake because he’s really great, but I’m starting to feel that way.

I’ve know him for some months prior to officially dating. He’s always known about my work ethic and independence since I told him about my occupation and future plans when we were just acquaintances.

So he’s been incredibly nice and I thought we could just be friends, but one thing led to another and now we’re in a relationship.

Early in our relationship, I repeatedly told him that where I’m at right now, I won’t really have time for fun, and asked him if he can handle this for the next several months, which he said yes. He knows I’ve been set to launch Spring 2019. My daily job is as a remote programmer, so my weekly schedule is pretty much wake up, start work shift, end work shift, work on side business, sleep, repeat.  I have some serious long-term goals so that I can make good money while having a lot of free time.

So I make time for him during my breaks and on weekends.

**NOW:** I’m sure he has a problem with all of this, because he always gets sad when I tell him, “Babe, I have to focus on work.” A couple of days ago he was like, “It’s always work, work, work.”

This pisses me off because I made it very clear in the beginning what to expect. Now he seems upset about it, and it’s honestly making me consider breaking up with him not only so I can have a peace of mind, but also so he can get the girl he wants, because I’m clearly not. 

What pisses me off more is the fact that I work from home, but he thinks he’s free to just call me randomly while I’m on the clock. He tries to talk about important things that requires planning and in-depth discussions, but I always cut him off like, “Um, I’m working right now. You’re gonna have to tell me this when I’m free.”

And then he gets upset! Dude! I’m on the clock, regardless of the fact that I’m at home. It’s really inconsiderate and rude. 

**TL;DR** I work a lot as a programmer and aspiring entrepreneur. Early in the relationship, I told my boyfriend I won’t have that kind of free time to focus on us and he was OK with it. But now he has a problem with how often I work.

**ADVICE REQUEST:** How do I politely tell him he needs to suck it up or we can break up? I’m starting to get frustrated and I can’t even find a clear mind to respectfully tell him this.

I have a bunch of stuff on my plate right now, as I’m making a big move and career jump within the next few months, and it’s annoying me that I have to add saving or ending this relationship on the plate. I hate sounding selfish, but I’m 23 years old and I’m just not happy with where I’m at right now.",19Dec2018,1
536,"So about 6 months ago this girl, let’s call her bel, broke up. Previously though, we both sold clothes together on the internet. After the breakup she never made an attempt to collect the clothes she had personally added to our shop therefore I proceeded to sell items as business as usual. 

Recently she asked for all the clothes back and I said ‘sure whatevzeez’ because I don’t need them to make money, but she specifically asked for this one jacket with flames on it. Well, I gave this jacket away to my sister because she liked it who then proceeded to sell it because she’s a lil entrepreneur. 

I told her about the whole situation and she was really upset, not because the jacket was worth much or something because it wasn’t. Anyways, just today I met with her and gave her everything but the jacket. But I threw in a few items of mine that she could sell to compensate. She totally flipped though, screaming at me for either the jacket or the money my sister made by selling it. 

I feel like her rejecting the new items really goes to show how much she wants the money. Her not even attempting to put effort into something as simple as posting clothes and shipping them seems a little ridiculous.

When I got in today, my coworker on my team (who has been training me for the last 3 months) got me a gift card for Christmas and my boss got me a super thoughtful gift based on things she knows I like. 

I got them nothing :( I’ve never worked anywhere that gave gifts and only ever exchanged gifts with a coworker I was super close with. I feel so awful, even though neither of them seemed to expect anything in return. 

The office is closed for the holidays now but I want to do something nice for them that isn’t obviously just based in my embarrassment. They’ve been so wonderful to me. It will be too late for a holiday gift come January. What should I do?!?!?

My only idea right now is to handmake 2019 cards with sincere messages about the last 3 months/excitement for the new year and everything we will achieve, and then I thought I could bake something. Please help!",19Dec2018,1
541,"On December 4th, my Apple ID was hacked. To be safe, because my iCloud has personal information, I deleted the Apple ID associated with the iPad because that ID was hacked into once before. 



On Sunday, I called Apple to help me with a ""Find my iPhone"" issue I was having. My old Apple ID was still displayed on my iPad, requiring a password to disable ""Find my iPhone"". I wanted to restore my iPad because it was being slow, and I needed to disable ""Find my iPhone"" so that I could restore my iPad. I couldn't do that unless I log into the account and when I tried to do that, it would say that this Apple ID does not exist. 


Anyways, when I called them, the Apple advisor told me to restore it anyways. Shitty Advisor, if you ask me. She locked me out of my iPad. I would not have minded it before without restoring it as long as I could access it. So now, I'm locked out and Apple sent me an email saying to send them proof of purchase so that they can unlock it. After I sent them my proof of purchase, they said it was not enough. I sent them the Invoice which has the serial number, the price, my name, my last 4 digits of my credit card, address, and basically all valid info. 



Originally, I bought the iPad off Amazon from what I assume was a company with a warehouse, they sell multiple iPads within the same listing. So the iPad was refurbished, which means neither me nor the Amazon seller is the original owner of this iPad. It is an issue because now Apple says the iPad is locked (WITH MY DELETED, NONEXISTENT APPLE ID) and cannot be used, for it is considered stolen.

550,"Hi all, I'm an 18 year old and I've noticed that my 80 year old grandad is constantly on his phone, like beyond the realms of what I'd consider to be addicted. 

For context, I live in the UK but he lives in India so I can't talk to him in person. 

He's constantly browsing and posting on Facebook, WhatsApp, even Twitter somehow, to a point where he's uploading photos and stuff at 4 in the morning.

Meanwhile, he has also been struggling with sleep issues and deprivation, he struggles to fall asleep at night and wakes up extremely tired. 

I haven't been to India myself for a couple of years, so I don't know how bad this is, but my grandma's told me some things and my judgement tells me it's pretty damn bad.

My family (uncles, aunts, cousins etc) are adamant that his sleep issues are not due to his smartphone addiction, but due to his old age. I strongly disagree and can see a clear link between them, but don't have the authority to make large decisions and don't know how to get my point across.

I want to help my grandad overcome his clear addiction and sleep issues, but how? What can I say? What can I tell him to do over text/call? How should I approach this without making things worse?

This is the first time I'm dealing with something like this, and I have no idea what to do.

One thing that sorta interest me is Graphic Design but I heard it's not really worth the degree There's also game development but like Graphic Design, it's not that worthwhile either.

552,"My brother is a drug addicted, psychopath. And I dont mean that in a sarcastic way, I mean he literally has a psychopathic personality disorder. He constantly does things, blames everyone else and then will convincingly lie to everyone, even if we witness the situation. My father has severe violent anger issues. He believes everything he reads on his political conspiracy websites which makes him snap at everything even more than he did before. And you can't calm him down or ignore him, that'll make him angrier. My mother has severe anxiety and depression, which gets worse when my brother does something or my father will randomly yell at her for no reason. I've seen her cut her wrists years before, she drinks wine all the time and pops anti-depression pills daily now. All three of them will yell at me simply because they need an outlet. These things will include anything from ""You're lazy"" to ""You're ugly, no wonder no one will ever love you"". While I generally ignore it, it does get under my skin.

Today, my brother and his ex-fiance got into a screaming argument in front of the house. My mother had a mental breakdown and started severely shaking and crying. My father then got angry at her for doing so and started screaming at her. She just wanted to leave and drive somewhere to get away, my father wouldn't let her leave. Meanwhile, I am in the middle of all this, telling my father to calm down, trying to push my mother out the door to leave and trying to ignore my brother. My mother is hysterical, my father is angry just because and starts with the whole ""everyone should feel bad for me instead"" and my brother is acting like he did nothing wrong and everyone's freaking out for no reason. And then when no one believes his story, he'll start fake crying until everyone believes him and then he goes back to being an egotistical asshat. When anyone brings up anything, he'll avoid the question by bringing something else unrelated up. No one seems to even notice he's doing this or if he is, they dont say anything.

I wanted to put this all in context because this is an almost everyday occurrence lately. And I can't stand it anymore. I have my own life and my own job. I try desperately to stay out of it. However, it's gotten to the point where I can't even leave my room. This is my only day off from work this week and i'm spending it in my room, listening to people screaming about things I have absolutely no control over and have nothing to do with. I am a happy, kind person by nature but living here makes me feel cold and bitter. I hate not being me. I hate not being able to be happy. I hate having to hide in my room because things i'm not even involved in. I hate having to shut myself down mentally just to live.

561,"Using my lurking account for this. I recently started a job at a very prestigious company in my country (I'll explain why that matters later on), in a position which required minimum 15 years of relevant experience, but thanks to some aggressive networking I managed to land it with only 3. It's a huge project in the field that attracts me the most and an opportunity of a lifetime. I'm only 23 and this can make or break my career. 

I've only been working there for two weeks, but there is this girl at the reception (that is exactly my age) that is unhealthily obsessed with me. She keeps following me everywhere: when I go to the coffee room, when I go for lunch, when I finish work -- everywhere. I tried to be polite which ended up with her basically inviting herself to my flat. 

I bought some wine which we shared and I told her the truth: that I wasn't really feeling it and also that I want to be alone for some time, honestly so fucking tired of relationships and everything that comes with themz, I just want to enjoy life for a bit ffs. When she was in my apartment she saw my bong(s) and multiple bags of weed, which is really illegal in my country. And now she is threatening to tell my bosses to drug test me if I won't fucking date her. 

So the reason I said my company is ""prestigious"" here is that they are basically a government company. If I get marked as a weed smoker, my career is ruined. I never wanted to stay in my country for too long, having lived abroad, but if this happens I won't even be able to get a visa. This girl, whom I know for two weeks and haven't even slept with, wants to ruin my life simply because I don't wanna date her.

 So some background.

I called my mother to try to talk to her, and my grandmother refused to go back and kept me awake all night.

568,"My freshman year of high school I had a ELA teacher that was biased against some students, but I was probably the worst case. I was constantly getting marked down in essays and speeches for illegitimate reasons, I'd gotten points off for things like having a boring voice, or  not writing enough on assignments that he'd stressed were for credit. (There are more examples but I don't want to be recognized) With my lowest score being a 4/60 that ruined my GPA a month into the year. Most of these critiques he gave to me verbally and I couldn't prove that it was biased grading. 

A couple of the kids that I talked to in his class mentioned to me that they had gotten pulled out of class by him only for him to tell them to reconsider their friend choices. Since it was his first year of teaching he gave us 4-5 surveys throughout the year in which we were allowed to critique him ""anonymously"", but after each one I would get pulled out of class and yelled at for insulting him in my survey. (I never actually said anything bad about him in the surveys, because I wanted to avoid him coming after me). I also got yelled at for not contributing to an optional charity that our school was doing. (I did contribute, it was just through a different teacher). I also got threatened to get sent to the principal because I challenged him on a grammar rule in class for my insolence. I never used to have any form of stage fright or fear of public speaking but since I had him as a teacher I've sometimes been to reluctant to even raise my hand to ask questions in class. I can't really prove this though.

That year I had gone to my counselor/administrator to ask for help but since I couldn't really prove what was going on. It was really just me and some other kids' word against his. There are a lot of other kids that he messed up the GPAs of, I'm just the most extreme. Also, going into high school I had aspirations to be a lawyer, but he destroyed that dream by wrecking my GPA and giving me an inability to preform when in front of a group of people. I got kind of depressed for most of my freshman year and my friends ended up avoiding me in school because some kids who talked to me in front of this teacher saw reductions in their grades (It wasn't big, they mostly just dropped from As to A-s for dumb reasons). 

It's been two years and he recently got fired for having sex with one of his students. His current students got their grades reset in his class because there was an obvious difference in the grades of the girls and the boys. I went back to see if the administration could do anything about mine, but there were a couple of issues. First, the administration(principals and assistant principals) that was in charge when I first came to them about this issue had all gotten fired and replaced in the last two years (they weren't really doing anything bad I'd heard it was because they couldn't solve the drug issue we had), so the only person who knew the issue was my counselor and at my school counselors don't have any real power. Second, since he wasn't allowed back on school grounds, we couldn't hear his side. Third, since the course was ELA, his grades are really subjective and we couldn't prove bias much at all. 

Recently, I looked into his case through the county website, but since no one could prove his student was underage while their relationship was going on, he's not getting tried for it, the only case is a divorce case with his wife. So he really has no criminal record, so he can probably get another job as a teacher and maybe mess up more kids' lives. I'm stuck with a bad GPA from him, I can't prove anything to anyone, even though he destroyed my dreams and social life. I never told my parents what was going on and its too late to tell them now. Meanwhile this teacher isn't really suffering any consequences other than losing a job and a wife. Is there anything I can do?

This subreddit seems pretty empty and most people don't seem to get many comments, but I don't know what better subreddit to post this on because I'm pretty new to reddit. 

Tl;dr My old teacher broke me pretty bad, he's since been fired for inappropriate conduct but not really suffering that bad. ",19Dec2018,1
569,"A quick background: we've been together for almost 2 years. He's an ex-alcoholic and he had a very rough upbringing, where holidays like Christmas weren't warm and fuzzy and happy. He's told me that many of them were very dark and depressing and they are not fond memories. He's also told me that before we met, he didn't really celebrate holidays because it reminds him of the countless friends and family members that have passed. I, on the other hand, do like the holidays, despite my rough upbringing. I still like to spend time with those I love, and, although I don't like it to be overly cheery and holly-jolly and have kind of a forced happy feeling, I do like to take all the bad that's happened in my life and turn what I have now into good memories.

This year, I told him that I'm looking forward to spending the holidays with him, as my family will be in another state. Last night, we had a conversation where he basically said that he can't wait until the holidays are over. He mentioned that he wants to be with me on that day but it isn't a good day for him. He's often sad and introspective on Christmas and spends time in any bar that he can find that is open and is playing college football. These places have very few people in them. They're often getting drunk and trying to forget it's Christmas, and he fits right in. He told me that he doesn't want any pressure on that day, which confuses me, because it's not like I gave him an itinerary or told him that I expect it to be the best day ever. In fact, we had really just planned to watch football, and relax, so I don't know where this came from. It made me feel like he was trying to tell me something without actually saying it.

After our talk last night, I came away feeling as if I don't understand him at all. I'm really trying my best, but I guess I just don't. It isn't my decision how he spends his holiday, and if he feels better spending the day by feeling sorry and down, then I want to support him. But that doesn't make it hurt any less. I suppose I just thought that me being here means he doesn't have to be alone. I'm not asking him to sing Christmas carols and bake cookies with me, but I thought us spending time together would be a bit more welcome to him. It doesn't seem like it. I get the feeling that he is telling me we'll spend the day together because it's what I want. But now I just feel like I'm taking something away from him, and it kind of ruined how happy I was about Christmas. I don't know what to do. If you have any thoughts or advice, I'd appreciate it.

570,"My long distance bf is going to propose over Xmas and I already know which ring he picked. I have tried it on. It’s not my dream ring. I don’t hate it but I don’t love it. I am absolutely leaving space for “maybe it will feel like ‘my ring’ when he actually proposes and attaches a meaning to it beyond its appearance.” He has said he has no problem if I want to return it for something else; for him, the important thing is a symbolic “giving of a ring.” I had encouraged him to just pick one out with me when he came for the holidays but he really wanted a physical ring for the proposal. 

But... 

I ordered a ring I think I’ll like more, in my exact size (his ring I know is a half size too big but whatever). I would NEVER have done this, except that he is here from abroad for the holidays, is meeting my elderly Grandma for the first time, spending time with all my family and friends, and we both wanted (altho would accept not getting this wish) me to have a ring to show everyone that we are engaged and getting married - we’re thrilled. It was a miracle that I was able to get the exact kind of ring I wanted with such short turn around. 

My thinking was: if I just am not in love with the ring he will present me, I will immediately have a backup so we can do our family and friends visits with a ring I do love (HOPEFULLY - it arrives tomorrow. The point is moot if I don’t like it once I see it.)  If I do end up loving the ring he has chosen, I’ll return the one I ordered. 

How in the world, though, can I possibly spin this? I probably can’t. “Honey, I thought your ring might not work out so I got us a backup without telling you.” It SOUNDS horrible but my intention was really not to steal his thunder or insult him. It was a means to an end. I obviously will not move forward with the plan if you, people of reddit, tell me that I am a giant asshole and risk hurting him. So... thoughts? Halp. 

TL;DR: I bought myself an alternative engagement ring in case I don’t love the one he picked out for me. Is this going to blow up in my face or can it somehow work out, should it need to? ",19Dec2018,1

Normally I would just say no and hope that would be it but I see this guy everyday at college and I know he will absolutely get angry and pissy if I say no. I don't want to give it to him but I don't really see any other option if I don't want to potentially end a friendship over a controller. I'm just really annoyed that i've been put into this position and think its completely unfair.",19Dec2018,1
576,"Over the past year, my friends have slowly started to not hang out with me anymore. It was once every few weeks so it didnt really bother me, just brushed it off. But then more recently it has started to become more frequent and after it happening for three months I decided to tell my friend about it. Lets call him Jake. I told Jake and he tried to kinda argue it but I think he understood what i was saying. After telling him I assumed it would go away and we would act like nothing happened and we would all be friends again. Nothing changed and it started to get even worse. So then he asked me to hang out and go grab something from the store with him and I was like sure just text me when you wanna go. He didnt respond for an hour so i said whats up. He said way later “sorry i got what i needed nvm” And i saw that he was on xbox with one of my other friends. I was like oh whatever he went to the store with him, idc, i guess ill play xbox with them. And then they didnt invite me when i tried to play with them, so I texted him and was like, what the fuck man. And he told me that he didnt wanna hang with me recently. So i was trying to understand what I did wrong and apparently because i told him how I felt about the situation I was bitchy and annoying over the past few weeks. I didnt understand because I thought my friends were supposed to listen to how i feel and help me. Im not sure what to do anymore, Not sure if I have any friends. ",19Dec2018,1

578,"Basically title. I’m a senior in a medium-small private high school. I’m pretty mediocre in social situations but I definitely have a group of people I’d consider my friends. Recently I’ve had a lot on my mind dealing with emotions and stress and stuff. I can’t go to my parents because they’re frustrating and my school’s counselor is catty and incredibly unhelpful so that’s the two obvious emotional go-tos out.

It’s not like I think my friends hate me or anything, I understand that everybody has shit going on in their life and can only be someone’s shoulder to cry on for so long before they need a break. I just need people to open up to (I have people online but it’s really not the same as having irl friends) but don’t know how to get people to approach me without hating myself for being emo on social media or whatever. Any advice?",19Dec2018,1
