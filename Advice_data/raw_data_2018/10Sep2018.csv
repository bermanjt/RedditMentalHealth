0,"8th grader here, I have a 4.0 gpa and am an all A student, but I ain’t always the perfect kid.

I give a lot of answers to kids next to me, it’s not like a “ I’ll kill you if you dont” kinda thing since I don’t do it on tests or anything, ussualy it’s like study guides.


But will this affect my acceptance into a collage if I’m caught? I don’t wanna do it but it seems like a good deal. Many of the freshman I give it to offer to protect me if I ever get into some deep shit I need pulled out of ( it won’t ever happen but it’s there).


Should I stop doing tis, and if I decide to stop, how do I not get my ass kicked ? 


Is it even that bad? And what are the repercussions of getting caught giving someone answers?",10Sep2018,0
1,"I work for a fairly large company. I'd say we have 4000 people on site at any given day. We have a large cafeteria and I've noticed a very attractive woman. I think she's noticed me too, because, while we haven't spoken to each other, we've made prolonged eye contact with each other. It's hard to describe but I'm probably just being hopeful. It's eye contact where it's not just eye contact and immediately break. It's make eye contact, kind of linger for a second, and then break.


If this is a bad idea, I'll ditch it. If not, i'll see if I can somehow start a conversation with her and ask her to grab coffee with me one morning in the cafe. 


Disclaimer: I'm freshly broken up. I find this girl super attractive, but I'm worried I'm just looking for a rebound. My mind is telling me that I'm not, but I don't think I can trust my state of mind right now either.",10Sep2018,1

4,"I'm a 15 year old boy, and I asked out a 15 year old girl to our high school football game. She said yes. I usually get kind of nervous when I talk to her at school because I really like her. I'm pretty sure she likes me to some degree and would consider going on more dates and such. We honestly don't share many of the same interests though. There were many times when there was silence, though we talked more than we had ever done in the past. I learned quite a bit about her, what she wants to do after high school, and her family and such. I'm not a very talkative person and apparently she isn't either. I would ask her questions and we would talk for a few minutes before there was silence. Then I had to restart the conversation. After the game was over, we talked some more before being picked up and I felt some rapport. She said she had fun and I told her next I would be more consistent with my plans. She also messaged me afterwards and told me she had fun and I think she honestly did. 

When we were dropping her off, I opened her door for her but saying good night was kind of awkward and I regret not hugging her. Also I didn't hold her hand during ""the date."" Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. I think next time we will go bowling. If we were to do that, would I invite my friends and tell her to invite hers or would it just be the two of us? What is the point of the second date? I honestly feel like I have learned pretty much everything about her, mainly because her friend sent me a long list of questions and her answers to those questions. What else is there to talk about?

She is the most selfish person I have ever met (hence the ex part).  I have literally seen her stamp her feet because her mom refused to take her to McDonald's.

Story:
Me and my Husband (32M) have been married for 6 years.  We desperately want a family, but I'm chronically ill at the moment and it is just not the right time. It breaks both of our hearts when I take my birth control in the mornings, but the most important thing for now is getting healthy.  Add that to the fact that I have been told by the Dr that we won't be able to conceive without help due to reproductive problems on my side.  That's OK, we'll do whatever it takes to have our family.
Ex friend is pregnant.  Turns out she has been casually sleeping around with several men, without birth control, to deliberately get pregnant, as she wants a baby so bad.  She doesn't care that the man doesn't want/isn't ready for a baby, she only cares about herself. She lives in a tiny one bed apartment, works about 15 hours a week, and is massively in debt.  Husband and I both work hard, own our house with several bedrooms, and have everything ready for our future children.

She's thrilled that she is pregnant, and I should be happy for her, but I'm not.  As soon as I found out, I began to hate her.  How do I live with this guilt of not being happy and resenting her?

TL;DR:
Me and husband of 6 years are financially stable and are ready for and want a baby, aren't able to have one yet due to illness on my side.  Selfish friend has been sleeping around without birth control to deliberately make herself pregnant, despite the men not wanting kids, and despite living in a tiny apartment and being massively in debt.  I want to be happy for her but I'm not, and I hate her now.  Feel guilty as hell for hating her.",10Sep2018,1

9,"So lets get right into it, I've always felt i was meant to do big things. When i was 19 i started my own roofing company, bought a house, lived with my girlfriend, and bought a truck. Making good money, 0 partying. Working non stop and saving money. I just focused on the future. Fast forward 3 years, we decide to move. We sell the house, and move to a neighbouring city. Still running my business. Long story short, we had a falling out my parents, shut down the business because it was in my home town.. Took my eye off the prize and it put my in some debt. Ended up having to sell our newer house to pay the debt.

So now to present day.. Im a 26 year old male, with the same girlfriend 25. We are living in a rental place. I've found a new job making well over 100k a year. Practically debt free but im un happy. Im unsatisfied with my job, unsatisfied with my finances and truly just everything.

I trying to figure out my next move. Ultimately im looking at commercial real estate. Saving lots of money and ultimately career wise and money wise i am confident. 

Where im stuck is, im 26 years old. I want to start another business and push my life higher but here's where im stuck. I have hardly partied, I've never done any drugs other than smoke a little weed, I've only had sex with 2 girls. Im stuck, im torn between doing what I've always done and following natural progression and getting married... Or breaking pattern going to the bar and trying to hook up (after we break up of course). Or just take the money i have saved up and travel the world. 

Im just so stuck and i don't know what to do, i want to move to another city, travel, meet people, party. I just feel like im missing out and im only going to be ""young"" for so long. 

Im not sure what this post is looking for but i need to get my feelings out before i pull my hair out..

10,"So I'll do my best to explain my situation but it's tough bc there are so many raw emotions that just can't be explained in a simple post. I'll try though. Recently I've had an ex come back into my life, back when we dated (a couple months ago) we loved each other but she left me bc she was extremely depressed and wanted to fix herself. I was upset but overall it ended on good terms. Fast forward to about a week ago, we hadn't been in contact since we broke up and she texted me out of the blue. We started talking and she mentioned she had a boyfriend but she was still very clearly into me. I still love her more than anything and I just wasn't strong enough to resist her advances. So our relationship kind of sparked again but she told me we won't be official bc she still has a boyfriend who she claimed she was going to break up with soon so I stayed and we flirted and sexted and talked all day every day. Things were good for a while but I still feel extremely guilty bc she was seeing me behind his back. So I asked her when she's going to break up with him and shit hits the fan. She tells me she thought I was going to give her time and she thought that I understood and she blocks my number last night bc I was getting upset that she lied about breaking up with him. Now I'm thinking it's just over so I should just screenshot some of these texts and send them to her boyfriend. She was cheating on him and he never knew so why shouldn't I tell him?

18,"I'm so sorry that this is a very long, confusing and maybe boring thing to explain but i'll do my best and I hope you stick to the end because I really need advice.

So i've been very conflicted with my school schedule since the year started and I still got time to change to the classes that I want until the end of next week.

The school has two lunches: A lunch and B lunch, so basically half of the students go to A lunch when 4th period ends and 5th period starts for certain hallways, lunch time ends around 10 minutes before 5th period ends and then the other half goes to B lunch so the cafeteria doesn't pack up, whichever lunch you get depends in which hallway you are during 5th period. In this case If you are in the B hallway (where my spanish class is) on 5th period, you'll get A lunch right after 4th period and then you go to 5th period, If you are in the F hallway (where the tech theatre class where i really want to be is) on 5th period, then you'll go to your that 5th period class right after 4th and then you have lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

As i said, my 5th P class is spanish (which is in the B hallway which means that I have A lunch) and I really do not need it because I am already fluent in spanish so I really don't have anything to learn in that class so i get soooooo bored, but since this year my school messed up literally everyone's schedule and of course everyone is mad about it, I decided I wanted to change to from spanish to french, there only 1 french teacher in my school so there is no beginner french class in 5th P, only advanced, and switching two classes to different periods is not an option because the mandatory (and maybe some elective) classes the that I got only happen in those periods, so the only second option that I like and had enough space for more students is on 5th P was tech theatre (Which is on the F hallways which would mean I would get B lunch)  

Now here is my problem: Literally ALL my friends are in A lunch with me, and I sometimes like to spend time with them  before next class but sometimes I like to be alone. If I choose to switch from spanish to tech theatre I'll have B lunch so it would mean that I won't be able to hang out with my friends during lunch anymore and I'll be bored and lonely when I do feel like hanging out for the rest of the year, but if I just stay in spanish, i'll get very bored and i'll just waste time in that class with nothing to do since I don't need that class while I could be in a class that I do like.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I either be bored and lonely during lunch or I get bored and waste time during spanish class, what should I choose?

&amp;#x200B;

Ps. I MAYBE have to option to switch tech theatre with another elective class from another hallway so I can stay in A lunch with my friends, but idk if it is possible and I will talk to my counselor about it.

Ps2. One thing is that I happen to be in 1st P class with 4 of my friends in my group  and 2 of them in 7th P so I do get to hang out with them there but I also have some other friends that I don't have in ANY classes with me so I only get to hang out with them during lunch, BUT MAYBE we will get to hang out on the monthly halfdays were we get to hang out playing board games or watch movies for 1-2 hours (yes, my school started doing that this year), or at the end of the year when my school is either sending us to the gym to watch performances or when we have half days more frequently.

Ps3. I also thought that I might make friends in tech theatre and we will go to to lunch together but idk if that will happen. Still, after typing all of this im leaning a lil' more towards going to theatre class but i'm still very indecisive.

19,"I started a new job yesterday. The girl training me and working with me the last two days has been very nice. I thought we were getting along great. But it seems like whenever I leave the room or any of the other employees are in a room with her I am being talked about. I’m not on the schedule and I like to know what time (or about) that I will be off of work so that I can make my plans for the rest of the day around those hours (doctors appointments, running errands, etc) and so both yesterday and today I asked what time I was going to be off. Today at work I saw my coworker pick up a phone call from my boss and step outside to talk to her. And then when she came back in told me that I was free to leave for the day. It’s been a few hours since I left work and I just got a phone call from my boss asking if I’m serious about this job and that my coworker told her that I kept asking if I could leave and felt I didn’t want to be there. Which is not the case. And now what I asked at all. I informed my boss what I DID say and reassured her that I wanted my job. 

Basically I feel extremely unwelcomed by the receptionist that I’m training with and there was even a stylist yesterday that asked me if I could handle this job because it’s really stressful. Almost as if she were trying to talk me out of it.

23,"I really didnt want to post anything about it, or even think about it, afraid that i would validate my feelings and allow it to worsen. 

Lets call him William. William and i have been friends since the beginning of high school. I never had these feelings about him, ever. I never looked at him romantically or sexually ever until about less than a year ago. He started to kind of 'notice' me. He would make comments about my body sometimes (specifically my ass) and would always say something if i was getting ready and changing while he stayed in my room. I believe he purposfully stays in when i say im changing because he wants to stay. He even called me cute sometimes, which made me feel sometypaway bc i don't really get that attention often. 

He gradually started to touch me, specifically grabbing my ass and pressing himself against my back, and who doesnt melt from that shit. He always says shit about being confident enough in his sexually that he just jokes about that stuff, so i always am hesitant to reciprocate in any way. But i still like the attention a lot, even if he doesnt mean it in any way. 

He started to get interested in my sex life and asked me who ive had sex with. Im a virgin and he knew this. I told him i was frustrated, but not desparate to lose my virginity. He subtly said, ""if you dont have sex and i dont have sex this summer, then i could take care of your problem."" Those werent his exact words but it had the same meaning. I simply laughed it off and gave him a 'yea sure' not to think about it again until the next day he asked me when ""the bet starts"". I questioned him, not knowing it was a bet or that he was being serious. When i asked him if he was serious he responded, ""i mean, kinda"". I told him it started graduation, when my summer started. I knew well that he would have sex with a lot of people in this given time range, but i just wanted the feeling it gave me. Then i really starting thinking about it.

Often, he would make sexual requests almost? Asking if i wanna fuck, but coming across in a joking way bc were around other people. After a while of this i started responding with ""you say that buuut.."" and he would just stop. Once we were alone in his room one day i finally got the courage to ask him why we would wait all summer if we could just say fuck it and do it now. Summed up, he told me that he couldnt bring himself to fuck another man. My heart broke. Not because i couldnt have sex with him or anything but bc it hurts to know that someone could feel or have felt something about you but let such things get in the way. So i directed my thinking back to the way it was before: theres nothing there. I ignored my feelings for him and almost blocked him out for a bit. We both hit hard times and stopped talking bc we were just fuckin each other up emotionally. 

Fast forward about 2 months and he calls me out of nowhere and asks if i want to hang out. Of course i said yes, this is one of my best friends. I asked him why now, he said ""you know we couldnt be around each other, right?"" And immediately i felt like i understood, but didnt know whether to be hurt or comforted by the fact that the gap in our friendship was over. 

He didnt give me any attention that he used to, and i didnt expect him to, as i didnt give him any either. Its beeb about 2 months that weve been hanging out again. Within about the past 2 weeks, hes been being like he used to. I told him that it turns me on when people drive fast but that i only trusted him, and every time we drive since, he puts me in the front seat and asks if I think his car is fast as we go 120mph. I know its risky but fuck. I love it. He plays great music and sings along in the car and it drives me crazy, all i can do is just smile and listen, and avoid eye contact.

Last night he was playing his electric guitar for me and my brother and he played a song i said would be amazing if he could play (jesus of suburbia by green day, he hates green day). It made me the happiest ive been in a long time. He turned his music up all the way bc he knows i like my music loud. I could feel the music around me, and just watching him play was... Undescribable. Later in the night i was resting, getting out of a 9hr college class a couple hours before. He came and sat close next to me and had his arm on me and whatnot. Then he kept telling me to get out of his seat, and i didnt want to so i just didnt. He came back with a belt and spanked me with it about 10 separate times. I moved, and he never even say down. Later in the night he spanked me with hairbrush while we were waiting for the uber driver. That hurt a lot more than the belt, and made me feel more emotional than the belt. Im growing attatched again.

All of the music i listen to makes me think of him in some way and it kills me. Because i dont really know whats going on in his head, and even if he did feel something, hes not going to give in.

What should i do to stop this mental torture? I dont want to ever stop being friends with him but i have to do something. I never get attatched to people or have crushes or anything, but this has me in my feelings.

TLDR; my straight friend is teasing me with affection and attention. Its distracting me, and i dont want my emotions to be played with like this if there really is nothing there",10Sep2018,1

27,"Sort of a 2 pronged question.

Roommates aren’t mean or super loud, just basically spend almost all their time in the rooms and no communication. They mind their business which is good, but I wish we could sometime talk. 

Also helps to talk about chores, sharing expenses, etc. I seem to be the only one that cleans. 

I am in the process of getting a new job and will want to move places. To leave, I only have to get roommates to sign a form releasing me from monthly lease. But since they hardly ever talk to me, I am sorta worried they literally won’t sign the form, even if I have a replacement.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 25M and am thinking about going back to college. I graduated in 2016 with a BS in Business Administration (Majored - Marketing, Minored - History) from the University of Nebraska (Go Big Red!). I didn't have the best GPA when I finished, around a 2.7. My last 4 semesters on campus I finished with around a 2.9. I have looked into some graduate programs, but I am not sure my GPA is high enough to get into the ones I want.

I currently am making decent $ at my current job, but it's super unfulfilling and I know this is just a place holder for whatever my next step is. I currently do not have any obligations in my life beyond 1 dog and my car is currently being leased. I do not have a significant other or any kids. 

I have been thinking about going back to school and getting a Bachelor's in a STEM program, specifically either Mathematics or some type of IT program. I am siding more on the mathematics side, because when I'm like 40ish I wouldn't mind transitioning into a high school teacher. My brother is currently getting his PhD in Applied Mathematics and Statistics and I think it runs in our blood. I have always loved and been very good with numbers mathematics, but when I was younger I never appreciated school. I was lucky enough to not have any debt after the first time I went through school (my parents helped.) I know they'd be willing to help again if I asked, however I would like to do this on my own. 

I am trying to figure out if it's worth going back to a 4 year university or if I should maybe look at one of the many online programs. When I first went to college I never truly appreciated the environment. I don't drink/smoke/etc. so I always used that as an excuse to not go out. I am also afraid that the online programs do not carry the weight of a 4 year university and I do think I'd be pretty employable if I took this route with a Business and a STEM degree. But I am not sure it's worth taking out student loans to go this path.

I'm actually getting liked/matched with a lot more girls than I thought I would. My issue, I think, is that I mentally treat each girl like they are the only one I'm talking to. Today, I realized I'd asked for 3 different girl's numbers and only actually remembered to message one of them. Now, I kinda feel like a dick if the girl is expecting me to message them and I've blown them off like this. But, I also looked at it that I'm not the only guy they are probably talking to on these apps. 

I guess I'm just curious as to what ""proper"" etiquette for casual dating entails. Like is ghosting a normal occurrence? Is it normal to be seeing multiple people at once? Things like that. ",10Sep2018,1
31,"HI So, long story short, I am going to court tomorrow to reopen a previously closed case on a speeding ticket that I got in May. Previously I had pled not guilty, went to court, and ended up having to pay about half the ticket, so not too bad that day. However, It's come to my attention that another ticket for me may mean a suspension on my license :( (Confession, I got 2 tickets before I was 25, and in Connecticut that means that I'm on probation for 3 years...) I can't afford to have a suspended license. I'm just making ends meet as it is, and I hope to tell the Judge or prosecutor tomorrow my dilemma. I guess I'm just looking for advice? Have you ever pled out of a ticket? Is there anything I should say/keep in mind/not say? Little bit freaking out, but I'm working through it :P For the record, I realize that its kind of a lot my fault that I'm in this situation, but to be fair, he did catch me in a speed trap.",10Sep2018,1

Anyways I kept saying I’m just not interested in smoking I don’t like to hook up with people blah blah and bare in mind this guy smokes all day and flunks in school. He seemed a little interested in me at first but the more he got to know me the more he didn’t like me. I’m focusing on being a better version of myself and I love helping my friends but he took it as wow she thinks she’s better than me? like no I don’t. I never did. Today he replied to my private snapchat story and told me “can u take me off this shit” where I would post my motivational things and I was thinking to myself wtf??? And he called me condescending prior to that because we were talking about how I don’t smoke? Like whyyyyy is he being so rude??? ,10Sep2018,1
35,"Some backstory: About a month and a half ago, I (24F) moved to a new area across the country, leaving my old job and all my friends, to get a new job. I have absolutely no connections in the area, and since money has been tight I haven't gone to any restaurants, bars, or anywhere social to meet new people. I've basically been at home with my cat and phone for weeks.

This past weekend, I got into a big slump and started wrestling with the idea that I'll die one day. I happen to really enjoy life, and I don't want it to end. But it has to, at some point. It got pretty existential, mixed with some depression, I'm sure. I couldn't sleep very much due to the thoughts and fears suddenly coming back, got my adrenaline going, all that. I feel like I've been able to work through most of it, thankfully.

But now I feel like I can't enjoy life, in a way... I went to the grocery store, for example, and the whole thing seemed pointless. ""I'm just spending money that doesn't matter on food that I'll eat to keep this body living for a few days, then it'll run out and I'll have to do it again... just a big, useless cycle. I'm gonna die one day, and it'll all be for nothing."" I was in a fog the whole time, like I was dazed. I had hoped some human interaction would help.

This ""pointless cycle"" thing keeps coming up, even in things like petting my cat. ""I'm in my physical body, petting my cat, and one day she'll die, and we're all just spinning on this ball of earth out in space, in this one insignificant slice of time in the middle of eternity, and this one tiny moment doesn't mean anything, really.""

How do I deal with this? If the details help, I'm a Christian, but have been out of spiritual practice for a long time. I feel like it's good to have eternity in mind, but I also need to be able to live life and enjoy it while I'm here - not walking around despondent or in fear.

TL:DR - I was dealing with the subject of my own, inevitable death over the weekend, and now it feels like nothing ultimately matters. How do I live in balance of enjoying life while knowing it will end one day?",10Sep2018,1

38,"I'm currently a moderator of a gaming subreddit which will remain anonymous. I didn't start my subreddit or currently maintain with this end goal but I'd now like to find some way to turn my passion into a career or experience I can use toward a career. I'm someone who likes to create and maintain game communities. I'm usually ok with doing this hobby/volunteerism for free if I have the passion, hence why I became a moderator and operate the subreddit in the first place. I'm also at a point where I need financials to support myself and my dreams. I spend a lot of the time on the subreddit, both answering user questions about the game and curating topics, almost as an unofficial customer support. In the real world if I were helping a company for free I'd be considered a sucker. 

If I have a line to the developers should I ask if they're hiring, even just part-time employees or would that be considered taboo. How do I do so in such way where it's not awkward or effects the community in any such way? I'd also like to know if there has ever been a moderator of a gaming community or any community who went on to work for the company as a Community Support, Customer Relations or any type of employee.

Also, has any subreddit ever had a small donate button somewhere on the subreddit and does reddit allow it? Like somewhere unobstrusive and downplayed like in the sidebar? If reddit doesn't allow it, what is the reasoning behind this?

To be clear, I'm not being negative towards reddit or trying to disrespect the moderator duty or volunteerism as a whole but I have a curiousity that I'm sure others have or have had in the past.

Thanks for your read and your time.

41,"I've always had a pretty troubled relationship with my dad. I'm a junior in college and moved halfway across the country to get away from him, but the catch is he pays my tuition. I have (had? not so secret anymore) a secret boyfriend who wants to marry me once we're at a more stable place in our lives, but I've always kept it a secret from my dad. 

My mom and stepdad know about my boyfriend and his family and they 100% support our relationship. My dad, on the other hand, I was always scared to tell because he might cut off my tuition and my job can't support the weight of my tuition and books. 

Here's where it gets weird though: Suddenly, my dad knew everything about my personal life. He said he found my twitter, but he doesn't even know how to work social media. My twitter is very private and there are no indications that I was the person behind it -- no pictures of myself, no location, no phone number connected, etc. My dad suddenly comes out of the blue saying ""I know you have a dog, have been dating since at least October of last year, etc."" He knew everything about my boyfriend, too. It scared me like nothing has before.

I think this is an insane breach of privacy, mostly because he won't tell me how he found my social media page. His argument is that if it's out in the public, he doesn't need to tell me but to be completely candid I think that's manipulative and not a mature way to carry a relationship.

I need help. I don't know what to do. Should I cut my dad off completely and risk tuition for my mental health's sake? I already deleted all of my social media and anything that could remotely be traced as mine. My friends are jumping to  the ""He probably hired a private investigator,"" which I think is a pretty big jump but I wouldn't put it past him. I just need help, I feel so paranoid and vulnerable. 

Am I expecting too much by not wanting him to find my personal matters? I know that in an increasingly digitalized world this is becoming commonplace but... I just think there are boundaries that people in a healthy father-daughter relationship should have, especially now that I'm 20.",10Sep2018,1

44,"Hey Buddies, I'm looking for some serious life advice here. I'm not sure how to best articulate my story and what I want, but here here's what I got; I'm a 33 year old dude born and raised in Indiana, with my own online business that has done decently well over the past few years, but recently things have kind of come to a crash and I don't have the passion for it anymore that I once did. I'm not married, and I don't have any kids ,  but I am in a 2-year relationship with a girl who is  a few months away from becoming a nurse. There's really nothing more I enjoy in life then a Sunny warm day hanging out in a vibrant out doors community, and there's nothing more in life than she enjoys then traveling ( she convinced me to go to Amsterdam, Paris, and Germany with her next month, I've never travelled internationally so it should be exciting). My main struggle right now is between living a kushy easy life here in Indiana where I already have my mortgage paid off (270k value) and my car paid off (50k value) and a good quarter million in cash savings (which even though right now it feels like it could never run out, it will eventually run out if I don't get off my lazy ass and make something of my life)..... verse the big alternative, diving in and pursuing my ""California dream""...
I have always imagined myself ending up living in California since my college years, and I feel like there has never been any other time in my life I've been better positioned to be able to make this move then now. Ideally I would like to stay debt-free, however it won't be as easy to do in California as it is here in Indiana for me. For starters my estimate is the real estate cost there is about four times as much as here. When I look at properties I think that about $400,000 would be about the top of my budget for the San Diego area, particularly Cortez Hill, or a small spot in Gaslamp District, or maybe even Pacific Beach if I stretch the budget a bit. I would really like to pay cash for my next property, because I really like being debt-free. 
I really enjoy living in the particular part of Indianapolis that I am from May through October, but the other half of the year in the winter months are pretty much terrible and depressing and it really sucks the life out of me, I think I suffer from a pretty significant case of seasonal depression.
I really don't know exactly what I would do with my life living in California, but I do know that I absolutely love living in a city environment with a vibrant Community, and I absolutely love Sunny warm days where I can be outside on my bicycle or walking the dog or anything like that. In fact, it's basically what I live for here in Indiana, I really have not done much work at all in the past 2 years, I just wait for a nice days and then I go out for a bike rides, or to the pool, or walks, or I take my BMW M2 sports car out for a spirited Drive.
I know I'm kind of rambling a bit here, and the way I'm describing this makes it seem very simple from an outside perspective, but I'd really appreciate any sort of feedback that I could get from anybody with another perspective, weather you be older reflecting back on what you wish you did earlier in your life, or if you're younger and you're envisioning what you would do if you were in my position. I think one of my biggest fears is running out of cash, and having to do something with my life that I don't want to do to be able to pay my bills. One way of looking at it is pretty much any job here in Indiana that I would have to have, I definitely would not want to have. If it ever came to the point where I needed to have a job to provide income here in Indiana I would be very unhappy about it. On the contrary if I paid cash for a condo in San Diego or somewhere where the weather is freaking perfect all the time I don't think there's any normal job that I wouldn't be okay with working. As long as I could get my daily fix of riding a bike outside in perfect weather and not have to endure the brutally cold Winters, and months of dark dreary overcast rainy and snowy weather and being surrounded by folks who have had the life sucked out of them by enduring this for their entire life I'd be happy, but I really don't know since I haven't experienced life on the west coast yet. It's honestly a bit overwhelming when you have a ton of options, and almost infinite amount of possibilities on what you can do with your life, I have no boss to report to, I barely even turn on the computer anymore to work on business related things, I'm just stuck in this infinite Loop in my head looking at properties on Zillow in California and what I could afford to pay for cash and move to, but I can't seem to pull the trigger. 
Please leave your comments below, or let me know any additional information you would like to know from me. Thank you in advance, I appreciate you and all of your replies.",10Sep2018,0

46,"Hi reddit, I'm a 17 year old asian male currently in my senior year of high school. I am at a bit of a crossroads in my life, so I guess I came here to seek out some tidbits of advice that might help me in my decision making process. 

Firstly, lets go over the first thing I want some advice about: following my dreams. For most of my life, I have considered myself to be an artist. As a child I found myself obsessed with legos, origami and the like. Early on in my childhood, I discovered a particular knack for drawing and traditional art styles. As an elementary school kid I was always drawing my favorite pokemon and dragonball characters at any free opportunity I got, using this practice as a means of self-teaching myself art. In middle school, I took a two years of art classes, but I didn't really enjoy them for some reason. By this point my drawings had drawn the attention of my parents and peers, which made me feel urged to continue pursuing art in high school. My parents wanted me to continue art, ""because it made me stand out in college applications."" Typical asian parent shit. In my first three years of high school, I took three years of beginner and advanced art classes; however, none of them were really enjoyable to me. 

In the summer going into my senior year, I began to have a couple of realizations. Now I should mention that these realizations were caused by a bunch of crazy shit that I had gone through the past year. In my junior year, one of my friends that I had known since 6th grade committed suicide. My friend's death changed my outlook on life completely. I won't go into the details, but just know that it was a catalyst for some of my most recent realizations. Now, my friend's death brought me and a couple other guys really close together. We became the closest of friends in mere months because of the tragedy that we all fought through. Also, at around the same time as when my friend passed, I dated an extremely suicidal and depressed girl. You can just imagine how fucking hard that was for me lol. I really liked her, but yeah. Also, my family began going through a ton of trauma, which I'll explain more in depth later. For what I realized over summer, was that I found a passion for rapping and making hip-hop music. With my close group of friends that I mentioned earlier, we began to make songs and post them online together. 

Shameless plug here's our soundcloud and youtube lmao (https://soundcloud.com/cmgthegang, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXeEEuEfElDqt3FeR-tuLsA) 

We don't have many followers yet, but I know for a fact that I have found a passion in making music. My love for art, writing, and music has found the perfect combination in writing hip-hop music. I think that rap is the perfect medium for me to portray my emotions and ideas through, because he process of writing and sharing music makes me excited and gives me joy like no other. I can genuinely see myself doing this for the rest of my life, and I think that I have a good shot at making it a career. All of my friends have the same mindset as me and are devoted to our craft. I feel so blessed and lucky to have friends that are as hardworking and motivated as myself. As a couple of asian-american kids, we are unique in because we're rappers, and with the way the internet works in our society, if we leverage media in the correct way, we hope to grow an audience for ourselves. As I see more and more asian prevalence in american society, such as Crazy Rich Americans, Fresh off the Boat, and asian rappers like dumbfounded or rich brian, I really think that we have a chance of riding this next wave to something big. I know that the road there will be full of hardship and pain, but I'm willing to 

We all have unique personalities that I know that the world will love if we find the right way to get ourselves out there. I really want to make this music thing into something that I can do for the rest of my life, because why waste your time sitting at a 9-5 job which you only partially enjoy? Why not take a risk and follow your dreams? Why should I follow the path that society sets out for me? Go to college for 4 years, get a normal job, marry a normal woman, have a normal family, then die? Why would I want that? Why wouldn't I want to stand out and use my dreams to make a lasting change in the world? Of course taking that risk is still scary for me. My parents don't support what I want to do with music, because they think that colleges will find my content, hurting my admittance chances apparently. Keep in mind that I have a 4.1 cumulative GPA and a shit ton of extracurriculars including clubs, leadership, and sports. 

So the question I have for my dreams is: Am I just a delusional stupid 17 year old kid who will end up broke? Or should I follow my passion like all the kiddy stories told me to?

Now onto the situation with my family. My family is fucked up. So fucked up. The dynamics in my family are kinda weird. We're asian, but not really. My parents are 2nd and 3rd generation chinese and korean respectively, and only speak english. On my mom's side my grandparents only speak english also. Anyways, ever since I was a little kid I'd get yelled at by my mom. Now this isn't just normal yelling. This is the type of hysterical yelling combined with slamming doors that made me hide in the bathroom and cry for hours. Every time one of my mothers outbursts happened, it just broke our family a little more. My dad became tired of trying to console me or my mom, and my innocent little brother always ended up the blunt end of everyone's anger. I'm not really sure if this thing traumatized me or not, or if it counts as abuse even. This type of thing went on for years and years, until high school, where I began really arguing back against my mother. The arguing got to it's worst point in my junior year of high school, while all that other crazy shit was happening at the same time. 

These arguments were horrible. It's kind of difficult to explain the extent of how bad these arguments are. My mother and I said many hurtful things to each other, essentially destroying our relationship. I can't even remember specifics because they occur so often, and it seems as if every week somebody has a breakdown. The communication in our family is extremely bad, so actions of affirmation and love are nonexistent. I know that somewhere deep down, we have some care left for each other, but the main problems are trust and comfort. For myself, I feel no comfort whatsoever from my parents. I can't remember the last time they said good job to me. 

For my parents, they have no trust in me. This is mainly my fault, because during junior year, I began lying profusely to my parents. I would make up lies to go smoke or meet up with my girlfriend at the time. I think I did these things because I was a stupid teenager, but also to cover the pain of losing my friend earlier in the year. I'm not quite sure if my parents ever understood that, because they punished me heavily for lying to them. My mother did things such as going through all of my emails, texts, on my phone and laptop, which I felt was a completely unfair intrusion of privacy. My mother told me again and again of how bad of a son I was, telling me that I was going to be a failure in life. These words were thrown in my face again and again on the daily, so I began to fall into a slump of depression. I tried telling my parents that I was feeling this way, but then they attacked me for trying to make it seem like it was their fault - even though that was not my intention at all. 

Fast forward to today, where I am not depressed anymore, but just extremely distressed from my family situation. I'm tired of being kicked out of my house, berated by insults, and being treated without respect as an individual. More recently, my parents have been telling me to do things without reason, just using their authority to manipulate me. In some ways I have put myself in this situation by lying to my parents so much, but I can't help but be upset. I'm tired of seeing how sad and angry everyone is in the presence of each other at home. I hate being at home so I just stay out with my friends everyday, and my dad spends most of his time in the gym after he gets home from work to let his anger out. My little brother barely has any friends because he is so shy, so he plays video games all day. For my mother, I don't even know what she does to cope. Maybe that's why shes on the verge of going crazy? I know family is important, so I would like to fix my family's problems before I leave to college; however, the situation is so bad that really I don't think anything will help in the next couple months before I leave. We have done therapy in the past, and it didn't help much. 

So I'm asking for advice on if there is any hope left for my family before I leave for college? Or should I come back to fix these problems later in my life?

Thanks y'all for anything you have to offer to my situation. 

TLDR; does an asian american kid have a chance at following his dreams of being a rapper? should I still try to fix family problems before I leave to college, or is it a lost cause?

My thought process was that I worked my ass off the past 6+ years and never took a break in the middle and now was the opportunity where I had the most time in life off. I experienced burnout a lot over the past year as I have never been the one to sleep 7-8 hours a night and spent all my extra time outside of classes working at my mall job. I still have my part time job at the mall but I go there once every couple weeks. My basic thought process was that others like my brother can relax a lot and not worry about things. I feel as thought ever since I have been on this ""vacation"" I have been stressed and I have not been good at being able to do nothing. I guess what I genuinely wanted was to relax, as I really want to take some time before I jump into a full time career in financial services. I am slowly beginning to hate being at home all the time, and it has only been 2 weeks. I am maybe looking into part- time jobs or volunteering, but what others suggestions can be made? Is it a normal thing to be the kind of person who can never relax, or can it be learnt?",10Sep2018,0

56,"Hi, so for as long as I could remember, I’ve never given that much of a fuck about school. I’m not the type who cuts class and goes and smokes, I’ve never been that, I’ve never failed a class, I’m respectful of my teachers and other students, I’ve just never been too enthralled by school. I read a lot on my free time, I have a number of hobbies, and I like having fun. I’ve always thought it was a stupid institution, I think the idea that your life can be determined by your high school grades is complete and utter garbage, but nonetheless, that’s how it is and there’s not much I can do about it. I took the SAT in my junior year, got a 1080, and got placed to take it this coming October. In terms of studying, I’ve never been one to study, I’ve got it in my head that I could care less about studying and that it’s only for nerds(I know it’s not for nerds but teenage hormones are something else). I worked all summer so I was mainly focused on that and not studying. How can I get it etched in my head that I need to focus on studying for these SAT’s, what are some good study tips or habits for someone who generally just doesn’t study?",10Sep2018,1
57,"My best friend (24f) lives with her boyfriend (38m) of 16 months and confides with me that he hits her when she starts picking a fight over tedious things. Their most recent fights, they were in the car and she says he grabbed her by the neck and slams her against the window and slams her head again another time. He then justifies that every woman who’s ever been physically assaulted by their partner has it coming because they’re the women who never shuts the f up or never listens  when something is said. I know my friend. She’s paranoid and over thinks a lot so she probably takes things out of proportion sometimes but I see how terrified she is of her boyfriend when he’s mad.

60,"9 months ago, i've left the navy after 5 years of service. 

It was a liberating feeling but soon it was accompanied by a feeling of lost which carried along a sense of de ja vu from where i finished my highschool education and same as now, have no idea where to proceed from now. 

My hobbies are niche at best with no proper avenue to explore into and my education doesn't provide a proper firm ground to start a career upon. I've been hopping on part time jobs to perhaps expand upon my horizons but none have bore proper ripe fruits.

61,"So My friend and I have known each other since freshman year of high school. We graduated in 2010 and have remained close since but recently she moved about 3 hours away for school. When she first moved we stayed in touch pretty regularly, texting, calling, sending care packages etc. lately I feel that she has been less interested in our friendship. I visited her August and we made plans to spend my bday together at the beginning of this month since she’d be home. I planned everything out and let her know the details and didn’t hear anything. A few days before my bday plans she texts and says she can’t go because she “couldn’t afford it”. It wasn’t a total tragedy because I had others who were planning to come so it was still a lot of fun, but I was still hurt by the fact that she offered no explanation other than she couldn’t afford it. So fast forward to today and I see on social media that she treated our other good friend (who’s she known a little longer) to a bday trip to San Francisco. So now I’m pissed. Basically I feel like she ditched my bday to go have an extravagant time with our other friend. I don’t blame the other friend at all because honestly she does deserve a nice bday since she’s been really stressed with school lately. But I just feel the way my first friend went about it was wrong. Like she could’ve told me and I would’ve understood. Idk I feel like I’m rambling but I’m just upset and honestly don’t know if this friendship is worth continuing. 
Also friend 1 just texted me and asked how my bday was, I’m sure she’s trying to feel out whether I’m mad.",10Sep2018,1
62,"This might seem stupid to a lot of you, but please help me out. For reference, I’m a girl and a junior in high school.

I used to have a very close friend. We had similar interests, a similar sense of humor, and she was good company. We first met almost three years ago. Back then, I had a crush on her. She came out of the closet long after my feelings had faded and we were never anything more than friends. 

My friend, who we will call Rebecca for the purpose of this story, had her flaws. She had a tendency to pressure me into doing things I didn’t want to do, although it was never anything terribly dangerous. She would unexpectedly slam me into lockers for her own amusement. She would make fun of my insecurities and called me every name in the book, but it was all in good fun, of course. She would hang it over my head that I used to have a crush on her and sometimes she’d hint that she thought I still liked her. I suspect she used it as a confidence boost. She was narcissistic and only cared about her feelings, never mine. I could write a small book of shitty things she’s done to me. She was controlling, had a short history of physical violence, although never directed at me aside from locker-slamming, and was overall an abusive person, but clearly I’m easily manipulated because I continued to hang out with her all the time. 

Rebecca introduced me to my current boyfriend almost a year ago. She forced it out of me that I was interested in him, told him the next day, and pressured him into asking me out in front of everyone at our lunch table, despite the fact that he was planning on doing it after school. After about two months of successful dating, Rebecca suddenly decided that she didn’t like my boyfriend anymore. He wasn’t good enough for me. Every hiccup in the relationship was a reason for me to dump him. But thankfully, I ignored her. 

Last April, Rebecca hatched a plan to get us to break up. Or maybe it was just to watch us fight? I don’t know her exact motives. Regardless, it was unsuccessful and ended with my boyfriend calling her a selfish bitch. She then got upset because I didn’t stand up for her when my boyfriend called her a selfish bitch. We had an argument and I cut off communication. 

I should’ve blocked her on social media, but I only blocked her number. I don’t know why. But now she’s tried to add me on snapchat again and I’m pretty sure it’s because she wants to rebuild our friendship. Trust me, I don’t want to be friends again. But I’m tired of having this feeling of panic every time I see her, which is quite often. We have a class together and I also see her every Friday night football game, as I am a cheerleader and she’s in the marching band. If I told her we can’t be friends but we can be civil, would the panicky feeling go away? It feels like the effect of her presence on my emotions is the last bit of control she has over me and I want to take it away from her. My boyfriend doesn’t want me to do it. He thinks she will drag me under again. Advice? 

Also, are there any subreddits for abusive/manipulative friend stories? I could make quite the contribution. I only know of r/raisedbynarcissists.

64,"TL; DR will be at the bottom.

To give some perspective: I am a junior in high school, 4.5 GPA, coasting. I want and need this to change.

I’m going to list out with bullets some of the main problems that come to my head and elaborate on them. 

• Working and Motivation

I work at the typical fast food place and the problem here is my want to work/not work. I work about ~10 hours a week on average, and on days that I do work, I think “Hey, I could work about 20 hours a week and make some bank, let’s pick up some shifts.” Long story short, this doesn’t happen and I stay mediocre.

•School

While I do decent at school, the motivation and drive is not there. I am able to coast most of the time, doing all the work that is asked and doing well. The problem is that I feel as if I should have a drive. I haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate waking up for school (coming up) and this is one of the main problems with it.

•Waking Up Early

I would like to wake up at ~5:30 each morning, workout, shower, eat, and out the door. Again, this does not happen. I wake up around 6:30, shower, eat, and step out the door an hour later. And trust me, I hate waking up that early, let alone 5:30. 

•Working Out/Healthy Eating

Now this is a hit or miss. I sometimes have the time and motivation and sometimes don’t. I would love to make this a priority and change my body for the better, but school and education come first.

•Social Life

This is the one I have been actively combating. I have joined multiple clubs, activities, and other social things to boost my interactions. My only wonder is how I could keep this up for the future. (I do still suck at talking and any other interactions).

Overall: I know this is all a matter of discipline. I just do not know how to go about it. I want to be somebody. I want to be successful. I just get lost in the endless hours of scrolling we have available to us.

TL; DR: I have many issues involving discipline. I need to know how to change my life for the better and how to gain a drive for life.

74,"I'm currently a high school junior thinking about college apps, majors, degrees, and the like. My parents are immigrants, and I have a very large family that I am expected to please.

I've been assailed by the stereotypical Immigrant Parent Guilt Trip (""We came to the USA to give you a bright future and all the opportunities we never had!"", which is blatant exaggeration, and yet, I still feel quite guilty). I am expected to become a doctor, lawyer, or scientist like my parents, siblings, and extended family members. Whilst I'm sure I could make a respectable career out of one of the aforementioned paths, they all sound terribly dreadful for someone of my particular disposition.

I've tried the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test (INTP), several career aptitute tests, the military ASVAB exam, and have even used the information given to me on my pre-ACT and ACT score sheets to try and figure out what kind of major would work for me. The corporate world would annihilate me, working in a lab or behind a screen would make me miserable, and I don't have the patience required to be a doctor or lawyer.

I'd love to do something with history, sociology, anthropology, polisci, or literature — teaching at a university sounds lovely. If I could manage to get into Berklee or a similar music school, becoming a music therapist has been my dream for years now. My parents vehemently disagree with these choices, and they are going to be paying for my education. 

Is there any way I can find a major that suits my tastes and my family's expectations? Is there a magical way I can convince my Sudanese parents that I want what's best for *me* and my happiness? Do I have to, like, stand up for myself and be my own person?

75,"Hi I live in New York City and something I deal with a lot is men who think they’re pickup artists and I don’t know how to deal with it. Cause a lot of them start out nice and I want to let them down easy because it’s hard to put yourself out there. But find that being nice just leads to them taking advantage of this and being overly persistent, not taking no for an answer, and asking me why I won’t go out with them.

For example, today a guy put it out there immediately he thought I was cute and wanted to get to know me very nicely. And when I said I’m sorry but I’m in a relationship. He says he wants to be “just friends” I say I’m good and he asks why I don’t want to be “just friends” even tho it’s clear he has no interest in being my buddy. He then gets closer and closer to me until I’m up against the door and he’s inches away and asked me for a hug and won’t back down. Asking me for any form of social media until I see the train stop and take that as the opportunity to say it’s my stop and run off as quick as possible. 

This happens quite often.

Any girls, or anyone who’s had success with this, have any ideas how to shake someone off you? Should I just start being all out mean or start ignoring and walking away as soon as it starts? I have a really hard time being direct and upfront especially if I’m uncomfortable and it really scares me sometimes when a guy won’t leave me alone.",10Sep2018,1
76,"
So I have been married for 5 years, we have been together close to 14 (since age 16). Anyway, I can’t initiate sex. I want to, I mean I really want to, but my body literally freezes and I can’t move. 

A little background... Yes, I was abused (every type you can think of) No, I did not have any positive role models or parental figures. I raised myself and got the hell out when I turned 16. I met my husband and about a month after running away. He is a year older than me and was best friends with my brother so he was always around. He is kind, attentive, patient and just thoroughly amazing. 

I have always been a little sexually “immature”. He is the only person I have been with. I love him so much. I’m very attracted to him, all of him (body, mind, and soul) but I can not touch him. I am allowed to, I know this but I am terrified. I will spend all day preparing myself for something as simple as a kiss or saying I love you. 

As I said I can’t initiate, I try but it’s like my body is working against me. Like if you were terrified of dogs and one approached you foaming at the mouth, you would go into panic mode and freeze - this is what sex is for me. 

I don’t know how to get over it and before you say “just go for it” be courageous” remember I FREEZE UP, LIKE CANT MOVE OR SPEAK FREEZE. So as much as I would love to “just go for it”, I can’t trust me I have tried. I tell myself to do it run your fingers through his hair, kiss him or caress his face and while I tell myself to do these things I’m laying there unable to make myself do them. 

I’m sure therapy is the way to go, but I really do want to talk about what I went through. I’d rather shove it in a box and do my best to cope without ever opening the box. Anyone have any suggestions?

82,"Hello. So to start I currently work part time at a small local movie theater. Only 4 movies can be shown each with only 4 showings on weekends. 

Anyway I’ve been working there since October so almost a year. I’ve gotten to the point where I know most stuff that happends regarding concessions and basic things. Since working We went from 2 managers to now three. One left the other stayed and they bumped up 2 workers who’ve been there for 2 years. And all is fine. 

It’s just the main manger who’s been there the longest keeps saying he can’t wait for May to finish college and try to get an internship. Keyword on TRY. Other manager is trying for an internship and just waiting on the call back it’s for a job in her degree field so that’s great! Last manager works at Best Buy and legitimately only works Mondays lol. 

The next worker is a girl who’s been there nearly 2 years and has said she wouldn’t want the extra responsibility but you do get payed more and guaranteed hours. 
The worker below her is going to the air force sometime this year just don’t know when. 
The people below him is yaa boi and another guy which apparently he’s leaving to later not sure when or where never asked. And below us is two new people we hired this month. 

I never cared to think of what happends when a manager leaves till we started talking about how it seems every one is going to leave after the semester. Because of this i moved up to a higher level and was able to close with the manager and sell tickets in the front both are upgrades above concessions. The higher ups said they don’t wanna train me and the guy I’m equal to because we are too new. 

Again it’s not that big of a deal but it did get me thinking this weekend since it seems like everyone is leaving. I don’t plan on going anywhere I couldn’t take more hours I worked to much one weekend and paid the price with rushing my art project. School &gt; Work. My dad says it’s not my problem it’s the owners problem but I don’t know what I would or what to do. I like where I’m at..just chilling and working. Not all these responsibilities. Idk what I’m asking for again this is still 3-4 months from happening if it does even happen. I’m not losing sleep or anything but just thinking far ahead.

84,"Yesterday I [20F] met up with a guy from Tinder. He was upfront with me and just asked if I was dtf, I said yes. I like having casual sex, this guy seemed hot, so I agreed. Before going over he asked if I was on birth control, i said I wasn’t, and he asked if I minded if we didn’t use a condom. I said i would much rather use one and he said okay. I show up and we go to his room, he asks if I can give him head, I ask if he’s clean, he says yes so I did it. He then puts on the condom and as soon as he does he goes soft. He says its because he hates condoms, so he asks me to give him head again, and I do, but he takes off the condom. After that he gets hard again and he tries to put it back on but he no longer can. We kinda laugh and I say we should just use another one and he says that was his only one. By that point, I wanted to stop. No condom= no go. But he’s persistent. He says “cmon i promise I’m clean” and I say “thats not the only thing I’m worried about”, I’m referring to the fact that I’m not on bc. He goes “i have excellent pull out game” to which I respond, “How am I supposed to know that?” After that he continues kissing me, he gets on top of me and goes to start having sex with me. My head is screaming “NO” but I don’t stop him, I just let it continue. My mind is in a million places, I thought I was a smart girl, I always make sure I use protection, why was I letting him keep going??? I couldn’t make myself tell him to stop, all that could come out of my mouth was to tell him not to cum in me. Then one of his roommates comes home, he hasn’t finished so I think this is the perfect excuse to say we should stop and get the hell out of there. I tell him “I think we should stop” he says lets just keep it quiet” i say I don’t think its a good idea and that we should stop. He says I should let him finish, to which I don’t respond, he turns me around and keeps fucking me. I want him to stop, i felt extremely uncomfortable at that point, more than when we started. He ends up finishing and he does so all over my stomach. It felt so disgusting. I cleaned off, got dressed and got the hell out of there. He tried to make small talk with me as I got dressed. He apologized for it “being so quick” and that his roommate came. I just responded quickly and didn’t make eye contact. I feel super ashamed in myself. I feel disgusting. I’m usually safe with my hook ups. I thought I was smart. I thought I would be able to say no when I needed to say no. I thought I wouldn’t let someone fuck me even though I didnt want to. I feel empty. But I can only blame myself for not speaking up. I should’ve made myself more clear. I don’t know how to proceed. I took the morning after pill, and I plan to get tested this week. This has made me delete Tinder. I don’t want to have casual sex anymore. I feel like a complete idiot for putting myself in this situation and I’m not sure what to think or do. 

TL;DR: I feel empty after letting a guy from tinder have sex with me without a condom, not sure how to move on. ",10Sep2018,2

She’s caught between just keeping it to herself and telling her parents and facing the consequences. She feels her parents won’t look at her the same way and won’t let us see each other and maybe will even disown her. I selfishly just want her to keep it between us but she is very guilty and she doesn’t know if she can look in her mothers eyes again, she thinks she will go to hell for lying. We agreed earlier today that from now on we will wait until marriage to have sex again. I love her so much that I would sacrifice anything for her, I told her that family is most important and that she should tell her mother. She is caught between. What should she and I do? Please help!!!",10Sep2018,1
88,"So, here's some background info. I'm a 15y/o male and I've just entered high school. It's almost certain that I may have light aspergers, so you probably know where this is going. I've been bad at talking to people for a long time, and improved on that just about a year ago. I have many things that have been bothering me, and I hope the people of Reddit can give me some advice (After all, that's the whole point of this subreddit). If something sounds confusing, it's because I myself am confused. Also, sorry if I go off a lot of tangents.

1- I sometimes don't feel like I support my friends. I feel that their lives would be the same if I wasn't involved. There have been several instances where a friend gives me advice on just about anytings, mainly relationships. They always are the ones giving the advice, and I want to be able to give the favor back, but they seem to know so much more on almost everything. I should not forget to mention that I am younger than most of my friends by several months or more than a year, so maybe it's normal for them to be the ones giving advice? I just want to be of help to my friends.

2- I'm a mess with girls. This is tied to the first point. Most of my friends already have had a casual relationship, if not more, and seem to get along very easily with the other gender. They give me advice like: ""Text her saying this"", or ""just treaat women like you would treat your mother"". I feel like I have followed their advice correctly, but nothing seems to have changed.

3- I have a kind of ""enclosed"" mentality. I keep too many things to myself. I haven't told anything here to anyone, not even my phycologist. I feel like my problems are nothing compared to other people, which has made me extremely reserved regarding deep matters. Even while writing this, I felt it wouldn't be useful of helpful. I also have many  ways to distract myself from these thoughts, like my ""romantic motto"": *""Nobody likes you, and you don't like anybody.""*, which got me through my last year of middle school, but I don't think can hold much anymore. I have burried my desires deep into my mind, but I feel like they're coming back, and stronger than ever before.

4- Though I've only been in highschool for 1 month, I feel like I already blew any chance of getting along with a girl, but others seem to be capable. I knew no one in my classroom in my first week, but there were evident groups of people who had come from the same middle school. I don't think I want any romantic relationship, but I just feel an irrational anxiety to be friends with a girl. I don't know what I want from high school.

I don't know what I wanted to accomplich by writing this. Maybe I just wanted someone to hear my rant, IDK. ANyway, if you've made it this far, thank you for ""listening"".",10Sep2018,1

92,"Yesterday, I go to make dinner after coming in from work, when my brother comes down. I am speaking with him and tell him why the room was so smokey as the pan still had leftover oil in it. He goes off, he says something about needing to use my computer but I won't lie, I don't really listen to it and continue making my dinner. 3-4 mins later, he comes back through, telling me quite aggressively to enter my password, and swearing at me - not directly in a ""fuck you"", but tells me to ""I haven't got all fucking day"" and stuff like that, seeming really pissed off. I oblige and go to enter it then, but as he's being really aggressive, I tell him to fuck off - probably isn't a very good choice of words, but I was not pleased at how I'm being talked at. I sit down at my chair and he asks me what I just said and of course, I repeat back to him my exact words. He says ""don't be getting fucking cheeky with me"", grabs me by the ear not harshly but then he pushes my head away. 

Now, it doesn't seem much, but I seen him attack my own father one time a year or two back when he didn't do anything to provoke it. He also works in construction and so is quite strong. My anxiety raised right through the roof, I don't want to be hit by my own brother - I didn't grow up in a household of any violence, and neither did he. I enter the password and go back to making dinner. I'm a bit shaken by it but I focus on dinner. He later comes back and says ""here I'm sorry"" but I'm not very good at keeping in my anger and do this sort of crazy jump and slam my tongs down, and tell him to not ever do that again. He gets enraged, tells me to calm down and I say no because what he did was wrong. He begins walking outside, and tells me to come fight him, which I obviously do not go and tell him no. He comes back coming toward me when my mum n dad come into to see what the commotion was. 

He starts yelling about it, I tell them he hit me and he denies it - hes yelling why I wasn't quick enough, I say I had my dinner on which he goes on to deny. I tell him if he mentioned he was in a hurry and talked to me like a normal human I'd come, he doesn't like when I say that, pulls up I failed 2 exams so intelligent him he didn't even make it to his final year of high school, he then calls me a fucking wee dick and storms off. My mum tells me to go have my dinner and so I go to my room. I can't really deal with any of this strongly and of course, I become teary eyed. 

Later, he comes in and apologises, which i immediately say no. my mum comes to my room and makes us discuss it with her. He later brings the argument that I am lazy and I contribute nothing, whereas he pays 40 quid a week to live in the house and has helped with some tasks like installing the washing machine, building the wall in our garden etc. whilst I just sort of help around the house and don't pay anything. He then brings up all that to throw in my mum's face when she begins speaking about all that, but stands her ground that everyone in the house is at an equal level of respect, regardless of what they do in the house. He later storms off, fed up of arguing with my mum.

She tells me that if he ever does it again, to shout on her as shes the one who will calm him down. She tells me it was okay to be upset in the way I was because I am not experienced in anything like confrontation or fighting, and that I had acted as any regular person would have done. 

I really don't know what i should do now. I will not accept that apology as i think he thinks that once it's said, everything can go back. I felt physically and mentally intimidated by him when he hit me, and it brings back other memories of similar situations such as the thing with my dad, or when he's just shoved me around and things like that. I want to ignore him, not see him for a while. But what about the long term? He hasn't learned a single lesson from the past and I know he will do it again. I am not very strong both mentally or physically to deal with him right now. I should mention I am about to start university so I'm not that young - pathetic or not, that's up to you.

I feel betrayed as he is one of the people in the world I thought I could trust most, I feel angry at allowing this to happen. 

I just have no idea what steps to take to deal with it in the short term and long term. I've tried to make it as accurate as possible, from my end anyway - so if you read this, if you have any advice for me at all, please say so, I dont know what I should do.",10Sep2018,1

97,"I’m a person who tends to take stuff way more seriously than I should which makes pretty much everything a high risk high reward emotionally. For instance there’s a girl I really like and even though talking to her makes me much more nervous than it should, it makes me very happy to even have a simple conversation with her. Another example would be tests in school. I feel lots of pressure to do well on tests as I have high expectations of myself (and my parents have high expectations) so it makes tests stressful but I feel very accomplished when I do well on them. This applies to other aspects of my life as well, such as video games and competitive swimming. Basically, lots of things cause me to feel unusual pressure (nervous energy, if you will), but it usually results in me feeling unusually rewarded afterwards.

The problem is that recently, I haven’t been feeling very rewarded from doing these things lately, yet I still feel pressure while doing them. I had a swim meet yesterday and during one event I slipped on the dive block, hit my leg on it (which resulted in a very large and painful bruise), and started the race very far behind. It was a short race (only a 50yd free) but even with my bad start, I managed to beat two people in my heat. I also got first in my heat on the 100 free and beat my best time by over 2 seconds. I felt nervous going into these races and, although I did well, I felt very little satisfaction in these accomplishments. It’s the same way in school—I had a quiz in world civ last week that I thought I did really badly on and ended up doing really well, yet I didn’t feel very accomplished. Even talking to that girl I mentioned earlier doesn’t seem to make me happy anymore, although I am still burdened by an incredible amount of nervousness while in her presence.

I was wondering if anyone had any ideas/explanations on why things still seem like high pressure situations to me but they don’t feel rewarding when I accomplish things. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks :)

TL;DR There are lots of situations in which I feel lots of pressure to do well, and this used to result in me feeling very rewarded when I did them well (basically the stress paid off), but now I am still feeling the pressure without any satisfaction at the end.",10Sep2018,1

99,"I'm genuinely confused as to who's right and wrong in this situation.

Basically, my family and I recently went on a trip that I'd been dying to go on forever.

The trip ended on a bad note as we missed our flight and my mom was being a bit difficult with the airport employees about the fee we had to pay to rebook the flight. I made a smartass comment which was totally wrong on my part and she ended up yelling really badly at me in front of a close family friend which I know embarrassed her.

For a few days after that she ended up not talking to me, which happened once before when I made an offhand comment about her being irrational sometimes.

However she did start talking to me again even if it was yelling at me that broke the silence. (Sidenote: When she was giving me the silent treatment, I didn't really bother talking to her because I knew from prior experience she wouldn't care if I did say something to her.)

After we started talking again it was pretty easy going and light and nobody really mentioned it.

Until she did bring it up this morning and I pointed out how one of the airport employees was really only blunt with her because she was being quite rude to them and how when I asked them calmly they were able to get us on the earliest flight available instead of a later one. She got really pissed off again but since we were going to church she had time to calm down.

We went back to normal again until I made a joke about how since the airline was so cheap we didn't realize we had to pay for baggage. I thought this was an ok joke to make considering both of us had made jokes about this before and she never seemed to have a problem with it.

This time though, she went off on me and started crying about how I was so ungrateful for the trip and how I should've been happier since we didn't have that much money to go on the trip in the first place. I apologized for offending her but I told her multiple times that it was just a joke and then she told me that I have an attitude problem.

Mind you, I'm 16 and I've generally been pretty respectful to my parents. Only recently did I realize I have an unhealthy fear of them because of how strict they are and I've been trying to overcome it by defending myself a little bit more. Even my younger brother isn't as afraid of them as much as I am and he's given them much worse attitude than me.

However, I really do want to know other people's opinion and see if I'm being a brat or if my mom's being overdramatic? I know I make inappropriate comments and I'm working on it but was it worth my mom's reaction? If I am in the wrong here I'd totally apologize to my mom again but I'm really confused right now as to how i should be acting.

She feels uncomfortable when It comes to talking about herself and I respect that, but I think I found a reason why.

103,"So my ex-girlfriend is leaving the country in a few months to do volunteer service for 3 years. The only reason why we broke up was because of this- we both know it's unfeasible to do long distance with limited communication for 3 years. We both clearly still love each other and care about each other and even though we broke up about a month ago we still talk and meet up for meals and what not and plan on being friends until she leaves (as well as when she's gone, and of course theres always a possibility of getting back together when she gets back but thats a long way from now). 

Anyways, I want to get her something for when she leaves. We both already wrote letters to each other detailing our love and appreciation for each other but I still want to get her a small present when she leaves (I'm assuming she'll have to pack lightly). I want to give her a memoir about travel and reflection, but I also want to give her something more sentimental like pictures or a photo album or something to that extent. Does anyone have any ideas? It can't be that bulky, and that I have to remember that we are broken up and she's my ex.... That's why i'm having such a hard time thinking of something because is it stupid to give someone a special gift of memories when you're not with that person anymore?

On the day of the initial viewing prior to applying for the house, the house was advertised as 4 bedrooms but one of the bedroom doors has been taken off to make a second loungeroom. The real estate agent immediately advised that the doors would be put on if requested. Once I was successful in obtaining the property I asked for the doors to be put back on, and the real estate agent advised me 2 days later the owner was happy to do it. 
On the day of initial viewing, she also advised that there was a large broken piece of decking out the back that would also be fixed (its quite dangerous and I have covered it up since moving in, but it does need to be fixed)
Also, while it was not mentioned to me, I noticed myself, none of the fire alarms were working. They’re actually not installed at all. I mentioned this to the real estate agent and was told that of course, they’ll be fixed. 

I have lived here now 2 weeks, I have emailed twice about the fire alarms and have not been responded to, although she was responded to be about my rent receipts. I cannot get a hold of her over the phone either. 
I have mentioned the doors being installed to the fourth bedroom and she said that she will let me know when it can be done. That was a week ago now. 
I haven’t heard anything about the outdoor deck being fixed either.

To make a long story short, it destroyed me and my self esteem in the long run and even months later I still feel the damage. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months after the break up, I ended up meeting my current boyfriend (21M). We have been official for 3 months but exclusively together for 7 months. I am so in love with him. He is the most amazing guy, I am so not used to how well he treats me. Due to my self esteem issues, I feel like it is too good to be true. I can't shake the feeling that this won't last, he can do better, he feels sorry for me and doesn't want to break up with me, he doesn't actually like me. CUrrently we are 1 week into being long distance because we go to different schools so naturally, my mind is racing. HOW can I stop this from ruining such an amazing relationship?",10Sep2018,1

125,"I’ve been dating my girlfriend for just over 2 months. I’m 25 and she’s 20. We live 2 hours away and have talked about moving in with each other.

From the beginning I have trusted her and had no real reason not to. She told me her previous boyfriend was very abusive. I believe this was of a verbal sort.

Recently though I’ve came over and found out some stuff she didn’t tell me. Kind of like telling you stuff but cutting corners.

Her last boyfriend who I didn’t know when we met she was still in the midst of dating. She broke up with him the day she thought we had officially began dating. I wanted to do something special for making it official but since everything was clicking just right it happened just like that.

When she told me this she got very upset by how my facial expression had changed. I mean I don’t know how else I was supposed to take this. I didn’t let it bother me cause I just saw this as she told me when she felt she had to. Some other things with this ex is he messaged her and asked her about her new guy and now I had posted pictures of us on Instagram and how she hadn’t posted a thing. A few days before this she made an excuse that I couldn’t tag her in stuff on Facebook because her coworkers said it was unprofessional. Then she went out of her way to make it so MY instagram was private because this EX had been stalking my profile. Honestly fuck this guy and it’s just irritating that she would give her dumbass immature ex this kind of power in her current relationship that I feel very deeply about.

Then well there’s more. We met through tinder and once we started dating we both deleted it. Then when I was with her she was on it with a new account. I was like why do you have that. She told me that she had it because her friend who is a guys roommate who used to be her BF (a different ex) was checking his phone and she needed another way to speak of her friend. I said there really isn’t any other way for you two to contact and she said she’d delete it. I tried not to make a big deal out of it but yet again why let your ex have any control over this.

I guess I’ll get more off of my chest here. She absolutely hates I have female friends. I don’t care that she has male friends at all. She has one who is a best friend and has gone away to the army. She told me straight up that they both lost their virginity together. I honestly saw this since I had friends who had, had this happen as something normal.

I know she has a few guys friends here and there she talks to. It doesn’t bother me but she completely shuts down on me if I even tell a story that involves one of my friends that are girls. I never even have had any relations with my friends that are girls. EVER. One more thing with all of this she tells stories involving her ex’s or she was dating so so at the time. I know if I did that, that I would be crucified. It just seems very immature and hypocritical.

Thanks for reading. I don’t know how to bring this up or go from here.",10Sep2018,1
126,"Throw away account but I need advice. 
I’ve been suicidal for years even the littlest of things have me thinking of how easy it would be to just end it all. But I don’t really want to die. I just hate that my life has been so miserable. 

This is going to be long so brace yourself. 

When I was a baby my biological dad wanted to kill my mom and I. She was a teenage prostitute . From my understanding they were both druggies. My biological father died a few years ago..
I got put into the custody of my grandparents who hated me when I was about three. Everything was fine as long as i remember up until first grade. I very clearly remember everything going downhill. They hated me with a passion, mostly my step grandmother who would punch and hit me and tell me I was going to end up like my biological mother.  Some days were good but when things got bad, they got really bad. 
Around the same time my step grandmother found her long lost brother. He came into our lives and during a fish fry we had he told me to come to his motor home he had parked in our driveway. That was the start of years of sexual abuse.
When my step grandmother found out she cried and told me I was the reason she couldn’t see her brother anymore. At that point i felt as though I had no family. I eventually left for college and only returned home a couple of times before I eventually decided I’d never go home again.
In college I started heavy drinking. I slept around and did a lot of regrettable things. I met a guy who I ended up settling down with..but his family and I have issues.
They didn’t want him to marry me. My first flight out to see them was a nightmare. I tried to be on my best behavior but coming from the home I did and growing up poor I wasn’t familiar with their cultural ways. Upon returning, his mother called and told him to leave me. He didn’t and we ended up getting married. His mother cried on our wedding day. Not from happiness.
 
My step grandmother died about 5 years after I left of pneumonia and I didn’t return to see her even when she was sick. However, through the years I did help her financially. 

fast forward a couple more years and I had my child. I was so happy and so were my husbands parents. I vowed to be the best mother I could. I almost died two weeks after having him from a DNC surgery I got because I had a late PPH. (Loss of blood nearly resulted in my death) I started sinking into depression due to lack of sleep because I was the one caring for my child even just after surgery. I could barley walk after getting winded and just generally not feeling well. I was in tears daily.

My son has been and always will be my entire world. I think if it wasn’t for him I’d have offed myself. But I feel he needs me and I tear up thinking about how he would feel if I ever did go through with it.

Three months ago I lost my grandfather to lung cancer. He begged me to come see him in his final weeks..but I refused. I told him I couldn’t. I do feel guilty for not going to see him. My family fought over who would get what but i wasn’t interested. I told him to send me what he wanted and I’d be fine with that. He did. But my family kept calling to bitch me out because they thought I wanted the house -which I never did. His death haunts me. I cannot get over it..

Last month I went to visit my in laws. They might not like me but I want my son to have a
Family so I suck it up. But one night I got black out drunk on accident (father in law kept pouring and I kept drinking) and I ended up barging into their room at night and vomiting. I had a ptsd episode while I was drunk and I vaguely remember screaming and his mother telling me to shut up. I ended up pissing the bed. I slammed doors, etc. my child was safe with his father sleeping in the living room but the guilt has been eating away at me. I fucked up. I came out of the room in the morning and showered and everyone seemed forgiving. But I cannot forgive myself. 
I can’t act that way around my child. It was never intended. I never get that drunk. But I did make the choice to continue drinking. 

I want to get my life together but I don’t know how. I don’t have a routine. I don’t take care of myself but I do take care of my son. I have little motivation to do anything for myself. Any advice? What should I do? How can I become a better person? A better mother? A better wife? How can I set myself up to have a better relationship with people who’ve I’ve been so ignorant around? 
I’m lost. I want to get better. I just don’t know where to start.

And I’ve tried therapy and medications and all that and it doesn’t help. I don’t want to go back to trying that. I just need some help figuring out how to better myself on my own.
Sorry this is so long. ",10Sep2018,1

I was sitting alone at my table and this kid sat across from me after a while and didnt say anything until he finally asked me if I was new at school. I could tell he was super shy and I used to be this way too so I was friendly and sat next to him and talked for a bit. I dont know if this is ignorant of me but I kind of assume he has some sort of developmental disability because he had a lot of trouble with his words and I had some trouble understanding him. We kinda stumbled through a conversation for a little bit and then about 5 mins into the conversation he asked for my number. I dont usually like to give out my number to people after knowing them for a few mins but I kind of felt bad saying no so I gave it to him....heres where the issue comes in, this entire week he has been texting me a bunch and when I dont reply to texts within a few hours he'll call me repeatedly. Im a decently social person but I am someone who also needs a lot of personal space. Im cool with being friends and all but the simple truth is even  my best friends dont text/call me on the phone 3 times a day, and I barely know this guy.   


Does anyone have any advice on how to go about the wording or how I should tell this to him? I dont wanna hurt his feelings but I also want to make it clear that I'm not really up for this constant level of contact when hes just an acquaintance at this point.

130,"This is my first reddit post so please bare with me. 
I’ve been friends with her for a year now and she has always been there for me and I have always been there for her. 

I’ve been through a lot this year, I broke up with my ex boyfriend that I’ve been with for a year and half, I’ve dated two dudes after that, i cut off some of my family on my dad side (including my dad as well) I going through money problems that I need to take a semester off in college. Yeah, in other words a rocky year for me. 

I’m currently dating this guy that is apart of our friend group and my friend believes that I shouldn’t date anyone and focus on myself. She suddenly became annoyed with the both of us because we both jumped out of a “situationship” and dated each other afterwards, but we both agreed to take things slow and not jump into a relationship quick. 

One night I went out with bunch of my friends to a House party and got drunk and she blurted our saying she wanted to talk shit about  someone etc etc, and somehow my name was brought up. She said “I don’t want to talk shit about (me) I wanna save it for another day. “ 
I told her “I feel like if you have something on your chest about me just say it. “
She said something along the lines of “ I don’t wanna hurt your feelings, let’s save it for another time, its better to be said when sober” (safe call)  the morning after my friend she texted me when I was work, apologizing of how she acted when she was drunk the other night and also still wanted to talk to me. I just told her to just say what she had to say. Basically, she’s annoyed with me and the guy I’m dating because we didn’t know what we wanted and that I always say that men aren’t shit, that I need to pick a side but I still in a way want male attention. She’s not wrong, and I’ve had this talk with her couple of times of how I’ve been hurt from dudes and how dudes “ain’t shit” I run back to them like an idiot etc etc. and of course everything is on text, I told her I didn’t know what to do with this information and that I’ve heard her talked to me about this numerous timed and that obviously made her upset, she went off saying Im ignorant for not understanding how friendship works. I’m so stupid and don’t know how to word things right, I’m really bad at articulating shit and normally don’t have friends that cared for me and confronted me. She’s my only friend that is able to tell me straight up about shit, that’s why she’s my best friend. We both agreed that we need to save this conversation in person to talk about before we both say something wrong. Im nervous to say anything yet and feel like I need time to talk things with her because I don’t want to screw things up. 

I just don’t want to lose her as a friend and I’m bad at articulating my feelings. I never really came across these kinds of situations, so I wouldn’t know what to expect. I’m normally the kind of person who kind of jokes all the time as a self defense mechanism, so for me and her to have this argument is a little different for me. I just don’t want her to look at me differently or don’t want to lose her as a friend. I care a lot about her and I just understand that she values friendships a lot. 

I’m new to posting things on Reddit, and this is my first post, So apologizes if my format is choppy. 

Thank you ",10Sep2018,1
133,"So I've been going through a lot of mental blocks in my life lately. I grew up with parents who never put any effort into helping my growth development. I was never encouraged to pursue any kind of skill or hobby. Sometimes I resent them for it, because there are a lot of skills that I dream of having, but sometimes I feel like I missed the deadline to actually have the mental capacity to learn new skills.    
    
As an example, I've always wanted to learn how to draw, but I have this mental block saying that no matter how much I practice, I won't get as good as I want because my brain isn't in that stage of development anymore. I know this sounds ridiculous, and that's why I'm trying to fix it. The people I grew up basically conditioned me to believe that hobbies are a waste of time, life is about being miserable, and that growing old means you lose the ability to do anything.    
    
I think what I want the most is for reassurance that it's possible to get good at (or even master) new skills as an adult. I don't want to give up my dream of drawing, as well as other skills. If you picked up a skill as an adult, and managed to get good at said skill, please tell me about it. And if you have any advice for getting past this mental block, please share.

136,"Tl;dr grandma getting phone scammed often and I want to make it stop! 

Every time I come to my grandma’s house throughout the course of the day I realize she’s receiving more than her fair share of scam calls. By scam calls, I mean people calling and saying they are working for Microsoft and that they need to do something with her computer. Or that they are with the credit card company and need her information. 

After getting significantly pissed off (because people are trying to scam my 79 pound, 80 year old, wheelchair bound grandmother) I tend to start answering the calls. I thought if I asked them to please remove her number from their call list that they would have to comply. Nope. Every single time the caller realizes that I am not going to give them any information, they hang up. I’ve even gone so far as to call the numbers back and they are either busy or (get this) they are directed back to a completely different business or person. 

For example, someone called asking for credit card info a couple of days ago. Once I asked them to stop calling, they hung up. I dialed the number back and some Indian man answered “hello?” I told him that someone from this number had called and keeps calling. He said he had no idea what I was talking about. It sounded like a genuine response. So I’m not sure if these scammer companies use fake numbers or what! I’m so confused. 

But the point is I want it to stop, she shouldn’t have to deal with this shit several times every single day. It’s annoying as fuck. How can I get it to stop if the people keep hanging up on me but won’t stop calling?! Please help! ",10Sep2018,1

Coming from an extremely poor background I never wore nice clothes, never owned more than one pair of shoes at once, never had backpacks or phones that weren’t outdated or worn out, and just generally never appeared well adjusted or professional. 

This has caused me to feel very disconnected from my peers at my (very opulent and high ranking) university, and my colleagues at past internships.

But I just simply cannot stomach paying more than $20 for shirts and pants, same for shoes. I’ve always gone to thrift stores but things seem to never fit me properly. The times that I wore expensive hand-me-downs from friends I felt incredibly self conscious and out of place - imposter syndrome if you will.

Last week I asked if he could cover one of my shifts and same with today, here are the conversations.

Me: Hey, good morning. Emma just bailed on covering me this Friday after she already confirmed and now I already committed to a meeting at my new job. I literally asked everyone...What do I need to do to get you to cover me this Friday? Literally will pay you (not kidding).. Or anything. Please let me know!

Him: I can't, sorry

Me: No worries

And then yesterday...

Me (yesterday): Hey. I'm flying back home next weekend..trying to find coverage for my Friday shift...I see you aren't on the schedule. Any way you could please cover? I've literally asked everyone. Down to cover for you when I'm back, lmk.

No response...

Me (today): You're my last hope! I already booked my flight and I actually can't find anyone to help me out, please let me know. I'll cover for you, trade a shift, or pay you, I swear! Haha

Me (two hours later): Just kidding, Oliver last minute said he could!

144,"First of all, he might not have done much wrong. In the end, I think my feelings and reaction is all my own. I don't feel like I can change. Rather, I don't want to change. For some additional context to my wall of text: I'm currently struggling with my anxiety and depression, which has resurfaced after a year an a half. Yes, I see a physiologist and have discussed this with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Some months ago, my boyfriend visited me- long-distance relationship, and it was a great disappointment for me. To put it short: He made some rude remarks about my family, instigated an argument with my sister and basically complained about how I 'forced' him to be around my family (I did not do that, he KNEW before flying out that it would be a family oriented week, we discussed it). His attitude had soured my feelings for him. Why do I put in the effort for him (such as asking for the well being of his family, text his mom when she does or when he asks me to, etc.)? He never asked me if I felt comfortable with him setting up dinner plans, random drop ins and such with his family. I never complained about it regardless of how uncomfortable I felt.

&amp;#x200B;

Point of my rant is: My family is important to me. He knew his before we dated and throughout it. I never asked him to date my family and never would I purposely make him feel uncomfortable. I would never pull my family along with me if I ever did decide to move in with him. My whole ordeal with why I wanted him to familiarize with my family is so they could be content and relieved to know I'm dating a good man (Who I might've one day married) and for him to just talk to them (About his thoughts on me moving in with him, and about someday getting married). The same assurance I give his family, by just talking to them and getting to know them, texting them, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The months after his last visit, I have been in a downward spiral. I started to nitpick him (noticing things he said or did that would really bother me, ex. being disrespectful to his family, throwing bad words around, being too sexual when with me (especially in person). It made me uncomfortable. I suddenly started to feel disgusted, to the point of wanting to rip my skin off if I had the stomach too. I think of anything intimate done with him and I feel ashamed of myself. I currently feel empty. I can no longer imagine myself by his side. I don't want to move in with him or plan for a future together anymore. I'm just confused, heartbroken and disgusted. I love him, but not like I did before.

&amp;#x200B;

I had this urge to just break it off. So I can rediscover myself, pull myself from my anxiety and depression. To do things I want to do, and make friends. To continue working hard, so I can travel to places and just explore. To not worry about hanging around a friend that he might be jealous or insecure of me being around. I feel restrained and want to let go. In doing so, I don't see him by my side.

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: I feel like, even though I truly loved him. I feel like I settled down into this relationship because I felt like no one else would love me like he did and that I wouldn't deserve anyone else or anything better. Basically, I have very low self-esteem. I don't see myself highly, even though family likes to say otherwise (but that's what family is for, they love you no matter what).",10Sep2018,0

2. I can illustrate logos for companies/brands - I can say that I have a creative mind. I can illustrate modern and simplistic illustrations in my free time using basic programs like Microsoft. But to go further, I need to learn how to operate Adobe Illustrate to create quality content, which I'm sure will be easy for me. 

3. I love playing games, so I can make commentaries over blind gameplays. But making a living from this is going to take a really long time

5. I can play instruments such as guitar, piano, drums, etc. And I consider myself to be a skilful player (I write Canadian English btw)

6. I can teach simple things like Solving the Rubiks Cube, or How to Pen Spin, etc.

And more... But I don't know where to put these skills into, and how I can earn from them. Any advice from people who are knowledgeable in this field? Thanks ;)",10Sep2018,3
149,"My high school is having us (the students) send applications to the colleges we want to go to. It’s not happening yet but will be soon. I would do it and all, but the truth is that I don’t want to go to college. I hate school and being told what to do and always having to worry about grades and tests and dealing with bad teachers. I have been telling my parents my whole life I want to become a doctor, but knowing that I will have to go through 8 more years of schooling for that turns me off of it. 

I want to play music instead. I have lots of good ideas that blow people away (as they have said in their own terms) and I have decided I want to do that instead of being a doctor. I really don’t want to go to college just to appease my parents, then get a job I’ll hate and go to work reluctantly every day for the rest of my life like everyone else appears to end up. My family doesn’t have a lot of money either so I think I can use that as an argument against theirs. Again I really don’t want to go to college just to appease my parents and hate it the whole time. Any advice? ",10Sep2018,1
150,"Hello, this my second time ever posting on Reddit but I really hope to find some advice regarding this situation as I am having second thoughts over everything.

[The situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/9cp4kn/advice_my_friend_and_a_suicidal_manipulative/?st=JLVW19JN&amp;sh=2577689b)

To summarize what's in the link : my friend got with this guy at a period when both of them were in bad situations and helped each other out etc.

The guy started treating her like trash, she was hesitant to leave him as he's suicidal
 
His physical health gets worse,making her hesitate more,during one of the breakups he attempted suicide

Relationship keeps going on and off,he treats her like nothing one moment the other begging her to stay as she's the only thing keeping him alive

So I once I learned about it I was urging her to break up with him as she has her own baggage to deal with etc I told her to break it off on a positive note telling him to go back to professional help and wish him good much and to tell his mother(only family that cares about him) that she's breaking it off with him and to monitor him closely and to cut all sorts of relations with him.

He's a very toxic individual who doesn't actually care about her at all

His physical condition is getting worse by the second and whenever she tries to encourage him he keeps saying that there is no way for him to get better and he wished that she would've just let him die the last attempt.

They live in different countries and such

I almost entirely convinced her but she's waiting a few more days before she does anything

She's very heartbroken now after learning that atop his stomach disease he also has heart arrhythmia too,and she's scared that leaving him would mean pushing him over the edge

She promised me that she'd break it off with him but she's still so hesitant 

Even I started doubting if this is the right thing to do…I am genuinely scared of something happening and she's just start crashing down too

Sorry if this is kind of word dumping but I am at a loss for words I don't know what to tell her anymore.

He genuinely seems like a person who is set on his decision of not improving and I honestly see that she has done all she can,she can't do anything more to change him.

If you have any advice please do tell

152,"WARNING: I’m going to be unreasonable throughout this whole post, but it’s going to be 100% honest and I hope that you at least respect my confession. 

I feel my life is boring. And I hate saying that because I feel ungrateful when I do. But there’s no other way to phrase it. 
I’m an avid reader, and just a complete sap for any storytelling. Whether it be movies, books, or even cartoons. 

My imagination has been stretched beyond what I’ve even thought possible. 

But I only enjoy these entertainments because I can escape reality (which I think most people do as well.) 

I’m not unique for feeling this way. I’m aware. 

But I’m so tired, I just want an insane adventure to happen. I want to meet Lucifer and annoy him until he sends me to Heaven. Or find a world of evil spirits who are after me for being the chosen one. Or sarcastically banter with a childhood friend until we realize we have feelings for one another. Heck, I wanna be a wizard! 

Just anything...

But I know it won’t happen. I know I’m just a regular 5 foot 17 year old girl who wears normal clothes and the same hairstyle to school everyday. 

I know that the most exciting thing that’s happened all week is that my librarian said since I’m a library aide that I can check out as many books as I want. 


Honestly this thought process has left me with some depression. Not anything major, but it doesn’t motivate me to do anything. 
I want to be an animator when I’m of the age. I want to tell other people’s stories because it’s something I find so fascinating.
But it’s only a distraction, and I don’t know how long it’s gonna last.

And I don’t know how to explain to my parents, and my friends, that I want something completely unrealistic to happen. 

I don’t know how to solve this, and I know for I’m not the only one. 
Maybe you won’t have any solutions. And that’s fine. But if you have opinions. Or you have your own story, I’d love it if you shared in the comments. 

Thank you for your time.
I feel much better getting this off my chest.",10Sep2018,1
153,"I decided to live with my friend and her boyfriend. I have known my friend for two years and her boyfriend for around the same amount of time. I don't really know her bf too well, just things she tells me and short interactions. I decided to live with them because I thought my friend and I would be really compatible roommates. And we are!! I love living with her!! However, I think one of them is abusing the other. I'm pretty sure my friend is the one being abused but I'm not 100% sure. I often hear them bickering. I sometimes can't tell if it's teasing or if it's legit. Lately I've been hearing a lot of banging with the arguing. Lots of sudden, loud thumps and bangs. I started noticing this about a week ago. I didn't pay a lot of attention to it until tonight. They didn't realize I was home and it sounded pretty bad...

Anyways, I don't know what to do. I don't have any soild proof that one of them is being abusive. However, I have always been one to have very strong intuition and my gut feeling tends to be correct. I don't know how to bring this up. I don't know how to handle it. What do I do if I hear something like this again? How do I know if abuse is even occuring? I don't even know what questions to ask.

Hi guys, so I have been fixated on this girl for 3 years. I began to be obsessed with her in 2015, when my boyfriend cheated on me with her twice and the started texting me telling me how I could never be as beautiful as her. I look her up on IG Twitter FB Have added her on snap through a fake account... I have a cloud full of screenshots of the pictures she posts Like a billion. I even have every picture or video of her her family posts on FB. I have hacked my boyfriend's Facebook to see all the pics she's in and saved them all (they have lots of friends in common) I have went through my boyfriend's Facebook and I mean 99% of his posts were about his love for her. He never posted about me. She was his cover pic etc... I'm obsessed with the bitch. 

I have pics of her her makeup her clothes... I copy everything and buy everything she buys even If you can't find it in store or it's been discontinued I find a way to get in my closet matches hers 100% I find old pics of her with my ex and buys the same exact outfit. Do my hair the same way. I'll only be happy the day I am her. Because she is better than me it's true. And overall I think I'm becoming Ill. Seriously who stalks someone on the basis for years?  

I found a disc my boyfriend kept stashed withh over 1500 nudes he took of her and sex tapes. I have a copy of them. It's insane.

I have lost 60lbs got tanned bought her closet... I'm telling you guys. It's nuts 

I need help I don't know what's going on with me

I haven't stalked her in 2 weeks instead of multiple times a day. I used to be able to tell you exactly what she did in a day on the daily (she posts records herself 24/7)
I'm trying really hard. I want to be normal again. But it's so so hard.


TL;DR - I stalk my boyfriends ex girlfriend, How do I stop being fixated?",10Sep2018,2
158,"I've been thinking of posting for a while, and have decided to go for it. I've been hesitant because I'm not one to air my business, and I worry that I'll be putting myself out there with no responses. But here I go.

In college my dad suddenly died. He was a big influence in my life and pretty much had a say in everything I did and didn't do. His passing caused a lot of problems personally and with my family as they were going through their own issues. After he passed away, I felt totally lost. I felt like a train with no conductor, but since I was in college, I felt like I was still on track and had a plan I could follow.  Though I was pushed back a semester, I was stumbling through and approaching graduation.

About a year and a half later, my mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Soon after, I was accepted into a master's program set to start the following semester. Her illness was sudden and she passed away some months later. I thought about dropping out of the program, but I felt like I had a plan and worried I would never go back. Though I was kind of checked out through most of it, I did graduate.

Almost two years later I'm working two part time jobs and still lost. Time and several rounds of medication have stabilized my mood, but I know there's more work that needs to be done. I used to be driven and goal oriented, and now I don't know what I care about, what I want to do with my life, or how to even do ""it"".

Early on after their passing, all I wanted to do was run away. I would fantasize about living on a bungalow on the beach or in tiny village in Italy living off cheese, bread, and books. I wanted to get away from responsibility, decisions, and all the pain. I don't fantasize about it as much now, but one mention of serious life issues, illness is a really bad trigger for me, and I'm back to wanting to get away. Sometimes it's so bad that I go into full panic mode.

I have younger siblings to take care of and help through college and life. They were even younger than me when everything happened, so I can't even imagine what it's like for them. But sometimes I feel like I'm doing everything for my family alone because the bills pile up and the responsibility of a lot of it falls on me. I've told them several times that they need to help, and they have to an extent, but I still feel like I'm drowning, and I don't know how to make them understand.

There's just so much going on that I don't know how to even approach it, so I just shut down. Choosing a career, finding a real/full-time job, working on myself, managing my family's finances, processing grief, getting into hobbies, getting into shape, etc. I feel overwhelmed with some many thoughts and end up deciding on nothing over actually perusing something. I'm paralyzed when I read about people in any kind of pain (chronic, emotional, mental, etc), at jobs they despise, living pay check to pay check, or in relationships that drain them. All I can focus on is the bad and the suffering. Part of me fears that there is no hope and that more unbearable pain will follow until I'm dead. I'm just having a hard time getting out of the destructive state I'm in. 

I've tried therapy, and I still am, but it feels like just a talking session. I know that I have many blessings that I should focus on, but I'm just so afraid. Even things that I love to do like writing, I haven't done in years because I'm afraid I'll suck or won't have any good ideas or wont be published, so I don't do it or give up soon after starting.

I know this is super long, and I appreciate everyone who's read this and who responds. I don't have many older/more experienced people in my life to ask, so I'm hoping to find some help here.",10Sep2018,1

160,"My husband and I have been together for 27 years.  We were teenagers when we fell in love (I was 14), and we married after dating for 3 years.  We have two grown children.  

I have had major depression for as long as I can remember, and have gone through many bouts of questioning my feelings for him.  He is a good man and wonderful father.  I don't know anyone with a better heart than he has and the thought of losing my best friend scares the shit out of me, but I also believe that there is someone out there that could make him happier than I do.   I have been honest about my question of feelings twice in the past 20 years, and it has hurt him very much, in which he just says that he would rather live in a loveless marriage than live without me.  My depression blocks joy, makes me want to be alone, and makes me hate myself, which tells me that logically since he is the best man that I know, (I'm not interested in any other men)  it's got to be the depression.  At the same time though, I have been feeling this way for 20 years and medication, therapy and regurlarly seeing a psychiatrist is not making it better for either of us.  I feel like I'm stealing years from him in which he could be happy.

I also sometimes wonder if we have stunted each others emotional growth.  26 years later, we are still living paycheck to paycheck, having the same stupid arguments over money.  Hell if we split up tomorrow we couldn't afford our bills and two apartments.   We have nothing in common.  I am an introvert, so after work I  would rather read, play video games and learn online than interact with anyone.   He wants to watch old movies and play board games with me.   When I met him, I was a jealous girlfriend, I enjoyed going out and doing exciting things, spent years trying to get him to spend more  time with me, (games and movies) was creative,  and I had dreams.  He was the exact opposite.  I don't know when it happened,  but we completely changed roles in every single thing mentioned. .  I think that I just gave up on those things, and can't get myself to where I was, and my wanting time alone is hurtful to him.

This is a throwaway.  I'm not very active on my regular, but I have never shared this all with anyone else but my husband and doctor, and the doc just says I'll know what I need to do  (I don't fucking know!) and  I am afraid to open that wound with my husband again.  The last time I proposed seperating, he said that he wouldn't go on without me, and for fucks sake, I don't understand why.  He could do so much better.  

I look at my future if we split up, and I can't imagine having another person I could feel as comfortable with as I do him.  I imagine some good years holed up in my room, reading and doing my own thing without the guilt (and him sulking all of the time)  I also accept that my final years will be pretty damn lonely.  However, I see him meeting someone that can show him the affection he deserves, do things he likes to do,  Hell, maybe he'll find someone financially responsible to counteract the bad money habits we have.

Do you think I should trust people not to judge me behind my back, because by being open, I am welcoming them to laugh at me to my face? Is that how it works?

**STORY**

Recently, at work, we got a new captain. I spoke to her the other day, and she said something weird. She said she was hearing some very unpromising things about me, but that she was excited to see how I work first-hand and maybe prove some people wrong. 

She said that people have been calling me lazy, saying I have been dragging the team down, et cetera. I asked a couple of girls I work with. One of them was quite angry about it and said that she couldn't believe people would say things like that. She also pointed out that we all work in different sections for most of the night, so it would have been hard to determine someone's performance anyway. 

The other said the following:

&gt;Yes I have :(. I heard it a lot actually.  Its basically a running joke with that team.  I hated it.  They did it to me too.  I never cared how you worked.  You were always nice to me so it never bothered me.

She has been around for longer. I found it interesting, the fact that she used the term ""running joke"". I was bullied for eight years at school, but after that, one of the things that would give me huge satisfaction was the ability to make people laugh, so long as they didn't feel the need to do it behind my back, so to speak.

So I was happy with being open and loud and fucking weird sometimes, because I trusted people to be honest about how they felt about it: I wanted to make them feel welcome to laugh at me WITH me. ",10Sep2018,0

Now I can't judge too hard because I know when I'm not in a good place mentally I can let things like that go. So when we hang out I typically suggest my place or somewhere public, because her personal hygiene is usually pretty standard, if not she smells strangely sometimes because she uses apple cider vinegar in her hair, but I don't really know what the benefits of that are.

However lately I've had the very real problem of her farting. Non. Stop. 
It's honestly disgusting, but I try to be polite about it and not embarrass her. And it wouldn't be an issue if it was one time, but the past several times we've hung out she farted almost every other minute, with only the slightest bit of relief between them. And distance doesn't seem to matter much because they are just that potent. It travels so far, she farted in my bedroom and I could smell it in my kitchen.
The other day she came over and she was hot so she turned the fan on directly at her and facing me. And I don't think I have to describe how that went.
It's come to the point where I'm avoiding hanging out which sucks because she's a really good friend. But I just seriously can't hack it. I would approach her about it but she's very sensitive and I'm afraid I'm going to embarrass her. She can also get a little snappy if she feels defensive and it's just not a great situation.

I'm at my wit's end here. My neighbor is a very loud stomper who walks all over her apartment all day long while dragging and dropping objects. I don't know what she's doing with the abnormal amount of activities, it's none of my business -- but it's driving me nuts. I'm pretty sure I have misophonia, since I anticipate it and wait for it, get very angry when it happens, and stress all day at work/school about going home to the stomping. It has only been two months since I moved to this place and I have talked to the neighbor in person asking her to be more considerate, called the landlord about the issue but didn't see any improvement. I called the police just now, at 11pm, and they said they can't cite her because I'm the only one who can hear her and it's probably a building issue. It's past midnight now and she's still going at it moving every piece of furniture she owns from what it sounds like. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know therapy might help since I've gone through bad living situations before but I can't afford to see a therapist so I have to wait until school starts in a week to see the school counselor. Meanwhile I don't know if I can ask my landlord for more help.

It was so dumb too because the whole time he was hugging me and kissing me and making jokes and I think it’s so messed up to do that while telling someone you’re leaving them. 

After we went our separate ways he was sending me Snapchats of him eating and smiling and stuff, meanwhile I was under blankets crying my eyes out wondering where it went wrong. He told me we could still be friends and talk and stuff but in all honesty, why would I want to be just friends with him? I think he was just saying that to light the load he was putting on me. 

I feel like I’ll never meet someone like him again. I can’t stop checking my phone to see if maybe if I got one last text from him or maybe a snapchat saying he messed up or just anything that can change it back.

More and more useless the last couple of months.
Never turning up to work so I’m alone doing the job, more hours for me is a bonus but the client we have had noticed she’s never there, behind with stuff in general, late paying wages etc etc
Things at the clients have been fine though, and they’ve been more than happy with my work.
I’m a subcontractor to them too btw, my boss is self-employed and so am I, i contract to my boss.

Anyway, had to take a day off last week, Friday, due to putting my back out, let the boss know a day ahead of work i wouldn’t be in. found out last night that I now don’t have a job. The boss didn’t turn up to do the clean on Friday and the clients haven’t been in touch with her even though she’s tried contacting them on multiple phones and email. 

Essentially, long story short. Boss is a useless twat at managing things, has lost my job for me by not doing her job and covering my being off sick for a day.

What I really would like to do is email the client and let them know I enjoyed working for them and so on, and yes with the slight hope they’ll get back in touch to offer me the work without having to be employed by the boss who lost the job initially.

Everything was great but then when we went back to our respective home countries she started to get anxiety about missing me and had breakdowns. I didn't think that was normal initially but convinced myself that maybe that's what love was. In the last few months of our relationship we'd be spending 24x7 locked up in my room. Both of us had cut off our friends and were only ever spending time with each other. We didn't do any activities and didn't even bother stepping outside the room to attend lectures. Our grades were suffering and she lost all interest in studying. It often felt like I had to carry her and she too felt like she was holding me back. The month before exams was the worst. We had become complete slobs and were just disgusting overall. We fought everyday about something or the other too and I even asked if we should be together. She said she would die if I ever left her and I obviously chastised myself for ever even thinking that. She was completely dependent on me and refused to do anything without me. Moreover when I wanted to do other activities she would get panic attacks and worry about what she would do alone without me. We still loved each other though and when we went back home for the summer we recognised that we had to change a lot of things and living apart would probably be good for us. We had made a lot of future plans and knew we would be a part of each other's lives. But then one day she finally decided to tell her parents about us, which then led her to telling them abut our fights too. Soon after she texted me asking for a break and broke up a week later. She also proceeded to block me on everything. All of this was super unlike her. She yet hasn't communicated with me directly but I had figured that maybe she realised that we had gotten bad for each other and were too attached and dependent. I thought that maybe she broke up because she realised we need to grow on our own and be self sufficient. I always thought she was super mature so this reason made sense to me and only made me respect her more. But a few days ago I saw an anonymous post, which I am sure is by her, talking about how I (not mentioned by name) have ruined her life. She went on to put some quotes from ever fight we have ever had and said stuff like I controlled her and manipulated her. She called me emotionally abusive. She called me Satan I agree that I can be insensitive at times and have said some bad things in fights now that i think about it but I do know that I didn't manipulate her. She has said that she wishes my life gets ruined and that I have destroyed her and have manipulated her into liking me. I don't understand where this hatred is coming from. i still decided to write her an apology email last night where I apologised for being insensitive and said she deserves a much better person than me. But then 1 hour later I see another post with things I've said in the past and how I have tried to manipulate her into making me the sole source of her happiness. I don't understand how I could have done this unknowingly. I don't understand how I could have done this even though I loved her so much. I still care for her and cannot hate her even though she hates me so much. I am scared of ever being close to someone after seeing the how much I have affected my ex's life. All I want to do is apologise to her for everything and tell her that I did always love her but she refuses to believe me. I don't even know what my next step should be. How do I tell her anything if she believes that every word out of my mouth is carefully formulated to hurt her?",10Sep2018,1
174,"This is going to sound SO silly and is not a genuine problem like others have here. I understand if this post is skipped. I apologize in advance for how silly this is compared to real life problems. But I care about my internet friend, and I'm just genuinely confused at how to respond.

I run a server/chat room for people that have a shared interest. A and I were the admins. I own the server and made her admin, I consider her to be a co-owner. I took a break for 3 weeks to focus on my mental health and disconnect from the Internet, I was on it too much. Everyone was amazing (her and the mods) and keeping the server awesome. It's a great community. Anyway, another mod was promoted to admin at her suggestion to others, which is fine. I was/maybe still am slightly annoyed I wasn't talked to about it but I realized it wasn't a big deal, it's just an Internet server. I was actually the one to change that user's settings to admin because I ultimately agree she's a great mod.

I put another mod who I think is also a good mod on our voting sheet to be an admin. I didn't talk to A about it because I figured it wasn't a big deal if she didn't talk to me.

She got extremely upset and sent me a long message saying she didn't want that person to be a mod and implied I had been gone for months, so it was fine for her to not run it by me. She said she is very hurt and I made her feel very poorly and that me putting who I put on the sheet isn't comparable at all. She made me feel guilty for taking a break.

This was all because I said ""We've all had our moments (about her saying the mod I suggested wasn't fit due to being argumentative at times), though I do wish you had told be about X."" (X being the new admin). A also said ""she thought we were a team."" The irony is she's more argumentative than all of us.

I love her and I don't know how to respond. I want to respond with empathy. It's kind of awkward now for me, I already told that the mod I'd put her on the voting sheet and I did. So uh... Double standard from A? Was she just having a bad day? I know the answer is to just communicate, but I am having trouble empathizing and am not comfortable responding until I figure out a good response that won't inflame the situation.

tldr; Internet drama. An admin to my server (that I've been online friends a long time with) started a vote for a mod to be another admin while I was gone without talking to me. I added someone who I think is a good mod without talking to her and she got very upset. I don't know how to respond.",10Sep2018,1
175,"So late bloomer is perhaps putting it simply. I grew up in dysfunction and have been trying for the past few years to pull myself out. I was Homeschooled as well. Now, at 23, I am well enough to attend school. I live in the US, and South Texas specifically. I have a little over 3 months of work experience under my belt (retail, bakery), and had to leave because of panic disorder. I feel I'm doing a little better and I'm applying for work again. 

Here's the thing. Because of my limited experience in the real world, I'm not sure what my limits are. There is a program in my city that will pay for an associates of nursing, but with my mental health issues (ADHD, depression, anxiety), I am unsure if I can cut it. I don't want to limit myself, because I do have a spark and willingness to get better, but I can't afford to waste any more time testing the waters of my mind. I need to start on professional development. 

I would love to get a bachelor's degree. I was considering social work as an option. I'm not sure I'm suited for research academia or working with computers. In truth, I'd like to move and work in Norway, at least for a while, which is part of the appeal of nursing. It would be the most affordable because of the program that would pay for it, it could become a bachelor's (allowing me to work abroad), and I really do find medicine and helping people interesting and rewarding. But I have no allusions it's an easy profession. 

Okay, it is 3 am, and I feel I lost the plot on this post a bit, but I am looking for advice. Even if it's telling me I need to chill and wait on nursing (it would be really painful to put Norway off for another year, but I'm totally aware I am putting the cart before the horse). Stories of succeeding in school despite ADHD and mental health issues would be nice. If you know of any programs that would help me fund a degree in something social work related, without SAT and ACT scores, and that has an equivalent bachelor's in Norway, I'd be interested in that too... Quite the request, I know, but for reasons I'd rather not spill in this post, it's hard to budge on Norway.",10Sep2018,3
176,"So I (19f) am a person who doesn’t have an issue getting relationships but usually I get pushed/pressured into them (by family/ and or the person trying to date me seriously).

Anyway, I’ve found that I’m always happier when I’m just going on dates (not more than a few dates with the same person) with multiple people, I don’t do it to hurt people’s feelings or to be a “tease” or anything, I just like going on dates and meeting people. I just wanna know if my want to keep things going like this is acceptable or just straight up rude and I should either remain single and not date or try and date seriously (I usually end up feeling overwhelmed and my anxiety worsens but maybe I just haven’t found the right person??)",10Sep2018,1

I always worry about her and how she’s doing... I catch myself all the time making a noise that we used to do to each other, I used it as a tension breaker when we first met, it’s almost like trying to get past someone and a gun noise.

Okay, there's me. I'm browsing Omegle looking for someone interesting to talk to. Now I was recently banned from the regular Omegle sight (mistakes happen, I didn't do anything wrong) and they only last for about a week. So I'm stuck in the unmoderated section where everyone is asking to see my tits and whatnot, y'know, regular Omegle behavior. 

Then, I come across someone who doesn't skip me and I say hello. Their screen is entirely black. After a solid minute the camera turns on and they say ""Hey"". There's a small girl, probably about 5 years old walking on a couch in underwear and a long sleeve shirt. In the middle of typing ""aw is that your kid? so cute!"". Just then the camera shifts down where another girl, in a similar outfit to the other is laying down, sleeping or drugged unconcious, being fingered by an adult.  

Immediately after seeing that I skipped this person as I was in such shock. I started sobbing and it was horrible. 

Now I feel so guilty. I should've called the police right? But what would I tell them? ""I saw a little girl being raped online...No I dont have an address.. a state... country or anyway to help you find these kids."" 

I wish I could've done something but I was so shook by that scene that I exited out immediately.

179," 

First off, I am really uncomfortable with publicity.  My partner was involved in a news story a while ago and he agreed to  speak to a lot of tabloids. The first thing that made me uncomfortable  was that the foundations of his story were dishonest. I don't want to  get too specific, but there was a fundamental lie in what he was saying,  which would have attracted a huge amount of criticism if found to be  true. I believe in karma and that lies eventually unfold, so I  disapproved of him speaking with the tabloids because I thought it could  only be bad in the long run. I also personally think tabloids are cheap  and generally for cheap people, so I didn't agree with the idea too  much anyway. The first time, I was upset but he said there would be no  more publicity and it all blew over within a week. Just to be clear - I  am not in the public eye at all. It is only him. 

​

But here we are again, he is back in the news again, sharing some of  his personal details that I feel uncomfortable with. In the past 2  weeks, he came to me for advice about whether he should update the press  or not on the story, and I told him definitely not. It involved sharing  another personal detail which I believe could put him at potential risk  of losing his job. But alas, he went ahead with it. It makes me feel  like he doesn't care at all for my opinion or he doesn't respect it. He  told me that a woman from the press (who he keeps very close contact  with) betrayed his trust and published details about him, but from the  news articles it seems he was engaged in an interview. I asked him to  break contact with this woman today and he replied that he would instead  have a serious talk with her. 

​

On top of this, he is very aware that having him in the publicity  DESTROYS my mental health. I don't know if I'm being reasonable or not.  Like today, I had a whole day of work planned but I feel crippled by  crying and panic attacks. Whenever I try to express my feelings, he  accuses me of trying to start a fight or not supporting him. Maybe I  should care a lot less than I do but it seems he doesn't respect how  strongly I feel about this. Another reason I feel so strongly about it  is the fact today is also the annivesary of a friend who was killed in a  fire and he is also in the news and tabloids. I keep thinking that my  friend would never want to be in the tabloids even if you paid him, but  he had no choice after his death. But my partner *chooses* to put  himself in the news and attract lots of (some good, some bad)  publicity. It just makes me feel sick that random people in the comments  are voicing their opinion about my partner and my friend's private  situations. I feel like the solution might have to be just stepping away from him for a while.

I become mentally exhausted trying MY BEST to help him, and it feels like I’m  going in circles. There’s just no progress and it’s been over a year now. He also refuses to see a psychologist.

It is so mentally exhausting up to the point where his girlfriend had to break up with him because he was “ dragging her behind” and it was too much for her to handle. So now, all the pressure is on me. I stress so much about it because I care for him so much. But it’s just hard to always be there for him 24/7- I have a life I need to live too.

Question(s): Do you recommend/not recommend I serve? Should I quit university and  serve now or wait until I graduate? Is it worth serving for 4 years instead of starting my career? What benefits do I earn? Does the military help me with graduate school? What branch of the military should I join? Is it probable that I die?

185,"English is not my native language, please excuse any errors. 

We've been friends for almost 4 years. Fairly early on he told me that he had social anxiety and that he would understand if it became too much for me to handle. At the time, I wasn't quite sure what I was in for and it didn't really matter all that much. 

We've spent almost every day together, with, of course, the exceptions of holidays, etc. I had encouraged him to come to me when he would feel anxious, and that I would do my best to try and help him through it. So I was there every day, listening to him rant/vent about everything that bothered him, offering some advice here and there, and just try to do the best I could to distract him from it all. 

I had been diagnosed with a condition that left me feeling depressed and very self-conscious. It made me isolate myself from almost everyone, except for him and a few family members. I wanted to tell him about it, but the few times I would try to talk to him, he wouldn't let me finish, told me I didn't have any issues, kind of laughed at me (it wasn't mean spirited), and went on to talk about himself again and his issues. Due to his anxiety, I would brush it off every time. Then things started to get worse, I just wasn't in a good state. I had spent 3 years avoiding any conflict to make sure that he was ok at all times, I just needed him to be there, but he would constantly leave me hanging. 

I was ready to walk away from the friendship. I told him this and he told me that we considered each other family, and family does not give up on each other. This, of course, made me feel really guilty so I stayed. There were no improvements. Attempts to improve the situation were futile. He said he couldn't be who I wanted him to be. He couldn't deal with other people's problems, and that his anxiety makes it hard for him to even send me a text saying hi. Fair enough, I know social anxiety is a pain in the ass, and now that he confirmed that talking about serious stuff spikes his anxiety, I decided to drop the issue and start over with a clean slate. 

He then gets excited and tells me about how he made new friends. How he became friends with another female, that they don't go longer than half a day without talking to each other because she needs someone to listen to her vent/rant, and obviously he is that person she does it to. He also tells me that he goes online, seeks out others who have anxiety to let them know that it's going to be OK. 

I'm not trying to knock his good deeds. I am glad that he is able to help those in need, but wasn't I someone who needed a listening ear as well? I express this, and he gets defensive,  says he is trying, that it's his anxiety, that he avoids me because he is close to me, etc. I do not know all that much about social anxiety, but sometimes it feels like he uses it as an excuse to justify his shitty behaviour. 

Should I just move on from this friendship, or stick with it and hope he comes back? If not, do I say anything even if he doesn't talk to me anymore or just change my number and move on? I should also add that I have offered him a place to stay. This makes me feel guilty for wanted to end the friendship. I feel like I owe him for promising to help him out. ",10Sep2018,1
186," Hey all,

Some background - I live in the Middle East where there aren't many roles in what I do. I started a new job in April that was a step up in both level and money (I doubled my salary). I felt perhaps that I was slightly under-qualified for the role, but nevertheless, the money was too good to turn down and I could manage the role.

So in July I sat down to have my 3 month review with the GM of the company and it went terribly. Basically she said that I'm really bad at the job, offer no value to the company, lack the knowledge and skills required and am not good at managing my team. Of course I know that I'm not perfect and can never stop learning, but I felt that the review was slightly unfair, based more on personal reasons as I do not manage in the same way as the GM, who rules by fear and flies off the hook at any opportunity. Another point is that the GM doesn't understand anything about what I do! After the review, I took a day and replied with my thoughts about the review (in a very politically correct way) via email, cc'ing HR.

However, it's now September and I'm yet to hear back about the review, it hasn't even been acknowledged, which is very awkward. I have noticed that my knowledge is being undermined and I'm being left out of meetings/discussions and it's quite obvious that the GM simply doesn't like me. Furthermore, I live in a country where I need to be sponsored to live, and the company keep giving me various excuses like there's an issue with my visa application. So I've technically been working illegally since April on a tourist visa, which means I have to leave the country every 30 days (Not a major issue as I travel a lot, but sometimes I need to show evidence of a return flight out of the country).

So, my question is, should I address the performance review again, potentially getting fired, or should I simply keep my head down and not draw attention to it, in the meantime continuing to collect the nice salary until it's brought up, or goes on long enough that it's forgotten? It is affecting my mental health feeling undermined and that I'm thought of as useless, and it also isn't nice that the GM basically ignores me!

Any advice would be great!",10Sep2018,1

Basically what happened was, 2 weeks ago, a guy in class showed interest in me. I came home excitedly telling my friends about it.

Had a fun time bla bla bla. But when i got home and updated my friend about it. I was from genuinely happy to suddenly disinterested in the same conversation. Like the emotions just vanished... completely. I feel pretty bad about it because now it feels like i lead him on but i was seriously interested at that time. Just not anymore.

192,"On Friday I went out with my friends to the local carnival then out drinking . Everything was great til I left with the guy I like to get everyone food. ( he was with us all night too) . It seems like every time we get in the car together , some kind of fight breaks out. Usually he is the one who instigates it, usually saying something along the lines as I’m mean to him. Well this particular night I was TRASHED so I basically said what whatever was on my mind . 

Here’s a little back story on our history :
About a year ago him (let’s call him Jim ) and I met ( we have mutual friends ) and hung out with all our friends . His best friend told me Jim thought I was cute, and later that night Jim and I hung out and kissed all night . Okay cool. Well within the next couple days I start hearing things about jim having a girlfriend , and when I ask Jim’s best friend about it , he never confirms or denies it. So I take it as Jim is a piece of shit and I don’t talk to him for a while. 

Then about six months ago I see Jim at a friends birthday party. Jim starts trying to talk to me and buy me drinks and obviously is trying to spit game and talk to me. I decide to leave early , and Jim’s friend comes to my car and tells me that Jim likes me . I say “ I thought jim has a girlfriend ?”  Jim’s friend gets weird again .

A couple weeks after that , Jim’s friend is on a hanging / dating with my cousin .  Jim is there 
Too one night because my cousin said I might come . I decide not to come and Jim leaves immediately when he hears I’m not coming .
Jim moves away for a while . 

So flash forward to today.  Jim moves home and I guess just broke up with his girlfriend . The first night I hang out with him he starts asking me why I always am mean to him and call him a player . That night nothing really happens except we watched a movie and he puts his legs over mine. 

The next time he talks to me he says how he doesn’t want to lead me on and how nothing can happen with us right now because he just got out of a relationship and doesn’t know what he wants.  He still hangs out with us all the time though and flirts with me. 

Okay so last night I’m TRASHED in the car with him and we fight. I’m pretty sure he said something to provoke me because I like him so I don’t see myself trying to go off on him when I’m drunk , I see myself trying to be flirty . 
So finally I say “ you say nothing can happen with us because you just got out of a relationship , but where was your girlfriend all those other times you tried to get at me ?” And he started to deny he ever tried to . 
Then we go home and he’s texting my friends telling them to come get me out of his car. I try to talk to my friends but even they made me feel like I was being too dramatic about it . I know I was probably drunk and over the top but I also feel like my feelings are valid . I texted him the next day to apologize but haven’t heard back. So now I just feel like shit . ",10Sep2018,3

196,"I'm not exactly sure how to apologize given the events. If to keep it brief or be honest and especially how to bring up the fact that in his job ads he's offering $10,000 than my original salary.

2 months ago I quit my job to sort of ""focus on myself"" as I had been working nonstop for a long time. No bad feelings between us it seems. He just wants me to apologize for walking out without notice or warning. I realize I was selfish and reckless by quitting without a warning, specially since I always felt I would someday move on from this job in the best way possible. Up to now I haven't spoken or texted to him at all which is another thing. I've only seen the one text he sent saying he's willing to hire me back. I know because I still see his job ads.

Truthfully I was going through some mental health issues back then. I had been since May but I kept it to myself. I didn't ask for time-off instead of quitting because I wasn't sure how much time I needed, so by quitting I felt no restriction. I felt better after 5 weeks. The job wasn't perfect but in an improved mental state it would be no issue, plus I'm unemployed and sending out resumes anyway.

The job posting that I mentioned has a salary that's **$10,000 more** than what what I got paid, *and* fewer responsibilities.
I'd  have no issue returning for $10K more but how do you negotitate that big increase WHILE you're apologizing? He hasn't found a replacement all this time. A few weeks ago the job salary difference was $7K now it's $10K so I suppose he must be kind of desperate. Before my issue happened I planned on quitting at the end of the year if I didn't get $12K so if I could get that I'd be satisfied, highly motivated in fact. It would be a win-win.",10Sep2018,1
197,"I have been working at my job for 11 years and my coworker 5. When she started, she sucked up to me and was very nice, I trained her. Then maybe after a year she started copying me a lot and not admitting it. For instance the way i do my hair, two phone cases, five pairs of my shoes, a bunch of tops, i showed her pics of an engagement ring I wanted when she was trying to figure out what she wanted and she bought one almost identical the next day. Then i got engaged a while after and though my ring is bigger it still bugs me they look similar. She copies outfits, jackets ,makeup its endless. When I joke and say ""oh I guess we are twinning I have that too"" she wont admit she copied me, she will say she saw it on someone else in the building or on tv. I stopped wearing a lot of things because of her. Then I also found out she likes to point out minor mistakes I make to management. I dont understand what her problem is. I have always helped her with her work and have been nice to her. What would make someone want to copy you and get you in trouble? Either you like me or you don't. I dont like going to work now.

My supervisors know to pass off all questions to me because chances are, I know the answer. While I've stayed in the same career field, I've relocated several times, once for a slight promotion and twice for general transfers.

Now I'm in a place with a brand new supervisor and the only other lead relies on me for any technical questions or issues on his section. He is actually a friend, but its finally getting to me since I'm certain I'm getting no credit when it comes to our boss. 

Today I helped my co-lead again with some things he should've known, and I felt a rush of regret soon after. Multiply this situation hundreds of times and this is essentially my situation. This isn't right, and this isn't who I want to be. I don't want to feel terrible after helping someone, but that is what its come down to. 

Honestly not sure how to go about this, maybe I just need some words of wisdom from a different perspective because right now I feel like I'm always getting the short end of the stick, being one of the most valuable assets to my workplace yet not receiving due credit. 

It just feels terrible after a while. Thanks for hearing me out.

I spent the last four months in my bedroom because of it. I only left the house once in June for a gaming convention and a few times I can count on one hand to see close relatives. It probably made it all worse. 

I start college tomorrow. This is what I want to do but I’m afraid of any negative outcome. What do I wear? What do I say to peers and teachers? What if I stick out like a sore thumb? What if I spend the next two years of college hiding in the bathroom to avoid everyone, like I did in my last year of high school?

We were extremely close and it has been the worst break up ever and we keep running back to each other but it just keeps getting messier. About a week or two ago we started talking again (this was just as I was finally doing okay and we haven't spoken in a while) and we started to work things out and things were amazing but then we had a massive fight last night and it all went down hill. Now he doesn't want me at all and it's destroying me. I have always forgiven him for everything but he won't give me a chance and let me back in. I know it's all so so dumb but he's someone I love and I can't help that. As well as that I have just deferred from university and my parents did not like that and don't support me now and I feel extremely lost.

\- Of the people who'll have the appointments, each should not be able to apply to specific type, e.g. Lucy Smith can plan a type of appointment A,B,D but not C. (This might come down informing Lucy she can make an appointment on Monday, Tuesday and Friday morning, not Wednesday because D).

209,"I am not here to sound like a privileged jerk but could use some advice nonetheless.

I normally work from home on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. This began a couple of years ago because my employer's building causes me some respiratory difficulties (certain parts more than others) and I found that staggering the days I spend there aggravates my breathing a lot less. They did consider trying to find me a dedicated office in which they could install air filtration, but opted to just let me WFH instead. Last Friday, our desks were all moved to a newly renovated part of the building (still just a regular cubicle). I get the sense that my boss would like me to try coming to the office more but doesn't want to ask me. I absolutely do not want to give up WFH.

Because of the move last Friday, I went to the office on a day I wouldn't normally be there. My dilemma now is that I have an important midday appointment tomorrow that, because I live an hour away, absolutely won't work unless I WFH. My thought had been to simply swap WFH days (go to the office today, WFH tomorrow), but I'm worried that coming to the office two days in a row that I normally wouldn't be there will give my boss the wrong idea and make him think I've decided to start working at the office full time again in light of this move.

So as I can see it, my options are:

- Swap my WFH schedule: Work at the office today, WFH tomorrow
- WFH today and tomorrow
- WFH today and call out sick tomorrow
- WFH today and go to the office for a very short time tomorrow before leaving for my appointment
- Something else I haven't thought of?

216,"Some background:
So, I've been living with this woman for about 2.5 years now. First 6 months we have no problems. But after that, she just stopped contributing to house work COMPLETELY. She wouldn't clean the dishes, she won't take out the trash, she won't clean the house... Nothing. She spills water on the floor, she won't mop it up till I tell her to, she buys stuff in the beginning of the month and fill up the fridge and then leave it to rot and I have to tell like 2-3 times to clean it out. .. The list can literally go on forever. 
But I put up with it. I cleaned a freaking 3 bedroom house all by myself (now we have a Maid thankfully!) and did all the house work, all this while working nearly 10 hours Mon-Fri, sometimes on the weekends too. The only relief was that sometimes, after a lot of nagging, she does what she is told. 

But now... I just can't overlook one thing - she has a bed-wetting problem.
Okay, before you guys crucify me, let me tell you very clearly what my problem is. The bed-wetting is not the real issue. I had similar issues when I was around 12-13 years old so there is absolutely no judgement from me at all. It happens to a lot of people for a multitude of reasons and it's okay. But my issue is with how she handles it. 
She pees on the mattress, but she won't air it out. It just sits in her to room and it stinks up the whole house. On particularly hot days, just walking past her room makes me gag. Every single time she opens her room, the house smells like a public toilet. 

I mean, there are so many things available that can help her manage this! Adult diapers! use-and-throw sheets! Medication! But she does nothing! It's just downright unhygienic! 

Now how do I even begin discussing this with her? We don't talk much... Some days not at all.  How do I tell her to get some help without sounding like a bully or something. She's 25 years old for f sake! 

This has been going on for months now. Please advise!!!!! ",10Sep2018,2

225,"First off, this is was my closest friend that I’d ever had. I’m 16M and she is 14F.

(Here’s some context to our relationship): I used to tell her everything about me and she would tell me about her. Our relationship started off with her having a crush on me and me rejecting her because I didn’t want a relationship that fast with her. After half a year of constantly talking to each other I started catching feelings for her but she had already moved on and found someone else. I still talked to her and helped her with another other guy she had feelings with which I didn’t like but I did it so she would be happy. I’m a very secretive person so I only told a couple of friends about her. They told me she was manipulative and I shouldn’t talk to her. I didn’t listen to them and kept talking to her. Eventually I fell in love with her while she was in a complicated relationship with the other guy. I forced myself to keep helping her with this dude and helped her to become his gf. After awhile I was very mentally exhausted and sad and then I got news that he was leaving my town and they were breaking up. She was heartbroken and told me she would harm herself without him. So I did my best to save that relationship. 

After he moved they kept talking and she was very busy with him and barely talked to me. During that time I was very stressed and mentally exhausted. I harmed myself multiple times. I asked her for help and she told me she was busy with him so I gave up and stopped talking to her.

Fast forward to now, I have been much happier for the past month and have found other people who I can talk to. She recently tried coming back into my life and I let her. I told one of my new best friends about this and they told me to cut her off and that she’s a toxic person. Tonight I told her I didn’t want to be friends anymore and that she cut me off before. 
Her response was ‘well sorry to disappoint but (boyfriends name) tried killing himself and I knew if I focused on him you would live too’. 

So now I don’t know what to do. I feel like shit for cutting her off while she’s dealing with that and I need help. Should I help her? Or should I just move on with my life?

TL;DR:     I cut off one of my closest friends because she tried coming back into my life after cutting me off but she told me it’s because she was trying to save her bf from killing himself. What do I do?

231,"As title says. Also quite long. TL;DR at bottom

 Backstory: my mom was 18 when she had me. Met my biological dad who was 24/25ish and dated for like 4 months before she was pregnant. Bio dad had history of alcohol abuse and frequent drug use at the time and continued for many years after. 

I never knew my biological father and I believe I was about 2ish when he left. Never heard from or saw again. My mom told me when I was around 11 what really happened because that was the age I really thought about it and started asking some questions. My mom was very honest, showed pictures, told stories. Which was nice because I really wasn’t sure what to expect and it was great how open she was. Go forward to 17 when my mom found an old photo of a half sister that I hadn’t known/ forgot about. She swears she told me that I had one back when I was younger but who knows. Anyhow, now I have a sister. At the time I just left it at that. When I was 24 I saw an ancestry add and the thought came back. Searched her out, found her and connected via Facebook. It was nice to talk and get to know each other.  Later on it brought up a lot of darker feelings... I started to really reflect and think about how I never had a “father” in my life and became very bitter. 

Like why didn’t he stick around for me? Why didn’t I matter enough just to send a letter? Or phone call? 

After occasion phone calls and messages over 6 months, she told me that our bio dad left her at 7 and how it negatively impacted her life in high school. She offered our bio dads number to me to talk to him and reconnect. She said that he got sober and is starting over in life and how I guess a few years before I met my half sister, he reached out to her to reconnect. And they talk out of the blue from time to time. Hearing this I felt the sudden urge to want to connect with our dad and basically tell him off. 

Now I’m 27 and I want to send him a message. I’ve thought a lot about it since hearing that from my half sister 3 years ago. In a way, huge way, I’m very grateful he wasn’t around. I could’ve turned out a lot worse. Or a lot better. I honestly don’t know. I want to make him feel the feelings that he caused by leaving. But I also feel like it’s in the past and that instead I should forgive him. Because I’ve had a great life without him but yet I’m still mad.. how should I handle this? 

TL;DR :
Dad left at 2, no memory of him or talk since. Found a chance to reconnect after he’s sobered up for a few years, seems to be starting over and trying to live a better life and I can’t find the words to reach out and tell him how I feel. I’m angry and want him to know but I also feel I should just forget it.

234,"Hey all,

I think I have problem, in how i treat my mother. My mom is sort of a simpleton, the type that doesn't really want to improve herself, lack self awareness, always misunderstand the situation, talk/does things without having a thought first and sometimes a little bit too naggy.  I feel frustrated really fast every time i talk to her because of that, causing me saying things that are not very nice to her. I tried to be nicer, but i just get impatient really fast. I am generally quite patient dealing with everybody else, just not with her. 

The first thing that she will reply me no matter whatever that I told her is often negative, and it really lit my fuse. Let's say for example, I told her about adding chia seed into orange juice tastes good, and she will nag about orange juice is too sweet and that I shouldn't drink too much of it. And there's that time I treated my sister to roasted chicken and told her about that, and I got nagged about how unhealthy fried chicken is.

My mom is a kind person and I know she loves me very much. That's why whenever i burst out, I feel really guilty afterward. How do i stop getting so angry and frustrated and change the way I treat her?

What makes it worse is, not only did this so-called friend betray my confidence, but lied about it when cornered, and then got someone else to lie for them.

At this point, I know full and well that I am better off without this toxic friendship. But, just because this is for the best doesn’t mean that it doesn’t hurt.

I don’t understand...last year we had a school trip, (And in my opinion more dangerous than this trip. ) it was at an amusement park, took some convincing for me to go, but she did. Everyday could be dangerous.

245,"Hi,

I got my undergraduate in engineering this year and I am considering going to grad school.

For the record, I really struggled during this years with procrastination, lack of self esteem and an overall feeling of unhappiness. I'm probably depressed. The expectation of moving from my hometown after finding a job in another city made me push through and finish the undergrad. Finishing was very hard for me.

I haven't found a job in my desired field mainly because of my lack of knowledge. I can get a job fairly easily in another field but I don't really want that. This experience has weakened my mental health and I feel quite bad at the moment.  Basically the same way that I felt during the undergrad but without the motivation. My situation hasn't improved and that has been like a punch to the face.

This is where the idea of going to grad school comes from. I broaden my knowledge in the field that interests me and hopefully land a job in the field by the time I graduate. I could even work on myself at the same time.

However, given my actual state I have doubts that I can go back to the same old routine. I'm really lacking the motivation to do it and there is always the uncertainty of ending up in the same spot that I am right now.

What would you do in my case?",10Sep2018,1

255,"Not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I thought I'd take a shot.

Hello r/advice, I am a college student who has completed 3 years at a community college and an going to be starting my first quarter at UC Santa Cruz in about 2 weeks. For my entire community college experience, I have been declared as a Comp. Sci. major, and intended to transfer into a Comp. Engi. program once I transferred. That all went well, and while I'm not an exceptional student, I have managed my grades well enough (3.5 GPA), and I completed my classes without disliking them.

The main issue is that I don't feel a particular passion for  the work I'm doing, and haven't really enjoyed any of my classes except a few math courses. Like many redditors, I enjoy video games as my primary past time. UCSC offers a Game Design bachelor's, and I have been thinking about changing to that major because it is a field I think I will enjoy working in, and I am very passionate about games as a form of interactive media and expression.

However, I am not sure if there are many jobs in this field and have been raised very poor by a single father (deceased mother, alcoholism, you know, the usual poor people so story). As a result I become easily stressed when I think about a potentially financially unstable future. I chose Comp Engi initially because I wouldn't necessarily hate the field, and it has great security of job and finances.

What do you think? Should I go for the degree in a reliable field that I don't particularly care one way or another about, or change to a major that has more risk for the sake of persuing a passion. I only get one quarter to decide to change get my major, so it's become a point of stress in my life right now.

P.S. I initially became interested in changing my major because a friend of mine who graduated from UC Irvine as a Physics major is working as a free Lance camera operator of some kind to pursue his passion in film, and he loves it, despite the fact that he'll likely never use his degree in that field. He made me second guess myself, simply by being so happy, despite being financially unstable.

P.P.S. am on mobile so please forgive any horrible spelling errors.",10Sep2018,1

Anyways, about a month and a half ago I was texting another girl constantly, and like I said I took that as a good sign that maybe she’s interested. I ended up developing a huge crush on her, I told her after a while and she told me she wasn’t trying to lead me on and she’d rather be friends. Crash and burn much? Anyways, back to the first girl, we met up for the first time and it was super chill. Spent a few hours at the museum, and after that got tacos, and shot the shit.

259,"Allow me to explain whilst trying to remain sufficiently vague to protect identity: 

A few months ago I [25M] landed my first graduate job. The job was in a new city, and required relocating. The job itself is okay-ish, but not entirely what I envision myself doing long term. However, it's the only graduate opportunity I got afforded in my time searching, so I understandably took the opportunity. The people are nice enough, and it pays bills. 

In the interview, the general manager of the company made a point of casually mentioning something to the effect of ""it costs us quite a bit in time/money to train you, so it's expected once you're competent and out of the probation period, you stay for 12+months"". He more or less said the WORST thing I could do is leave after a few months. I obliged, and didnt think much of it. 

Long story short: I am no where near as happy as what I thought I'd be with this life change. Very underwhelmed with work, socially isolated, and just not really feeling it in a lot of ways. 

In my contract, it says that either party may terminate employment, with one weeks written notice, during the probationary period (which I am still in). 

Here is the twist: On account of a friend putting in a good word, I landed my ""dream"" job just last week. I am THRILLED. They told me the job is mine if I want it. The job itself is in a field I want to work in, it pays better than my current job, its back home around my friends and family. It's an upgrade in almost every way, and I am REALLY excited to start (I really had to fight tooth and nail to get this). I am excited to be able to ""settle down"" for a bit with employment and financial security. 

I start the new job in 3 weeks. My current employer I HAVE to give 1 week written notice. 

My question is: How do I quit? I KNOW taking this new job is the right decision. However, I'm doing the ONE thing my current employer told me not to do. They will be furious, to say the least. Do I tell them the truth? Do I bullshit a story about a family member with terminal illness? Do I tell them I want to move back for my own mental health (this IS true)? 

Has anyone been in a similar situation and can provide some assistance?

It has been one week since I moved to Taiwan for a masters degree (not in Taipei). I met several people who came from the same country as me, and we form a group of 6-7 people for going for meals, shopping, doing sports etc. Life so far has been fine. However, the problem is that group dynamic tires me out. I am fine talking and socializing with a few people at a time (one or two), but I feel awkward in group (4 people and more). and I know that the group also feels that I am an awkward addition, though some people are fine with me being in the group. So I gradually distance myself from the group. is this the right thing to do? normally i dont feel a need to belong in a group. it is just that i dont know the language, and navigating things around here are pretty difficult. i fear that i will miss a lot of things if i dont stay in the group, but at the same time, i dread doing it. 

one more thing, it is often joked around here that finding a taiwanese girlfriend is the most efficient way to learn the language. i dont dislike the idea. but honestly i just dont know what to do in order to find one. i never have a relationship before, and i feel pressured to make the most out of my chance of studying abroad. how should i approach this?",10Sep2018,1

I didn't want to pay thousands and thousands of dollars for the experience of going out and partying and not doing much else. I didn't have a great experience with my roommates, who had previously been my only real friends in my state, and it threw me into an emotional spiral of feeling anxious and distraught all the time--I'm pretty sure it was some kind of depressed anxiety, like i was kind of sad about life in general but mostly I couldn't figure out how to interact with people normally, I was convinced I was just an awkward little shit, and my friends didn't help.

I'm finding myself trying to get a job and a license and a car and all of that adult shit, and I haven't been doing great at getting any of those. I feel like a total failure in life, right now.

I've been trying to pick myself back up since I moved back here--I love being at my parent's house, we get along really well and I help out here and there and most of the time I'm alone in this huge house, so I can do whatever I want, really, and I'm naturally inclined to just relaxing, and I'm used to being alone, so I kind of love it.

I need a good cry, but when I try, I can't.  I would like some kind of physical contact, but it's always been weird for me to initiate it. I'm just very lonely and emotional and it's all stopped up, and it's been that way for years. How can I make things better for myself?",10Sep2018,1
271,"Alright. I'll try to make this unemotional because the reason this is tearing me up is all the little emotional details, and I just want someone to lay out for me how best to deal with this.

I (23f) fell in love for the first time ever with a man (30m) who was in a relationship. We became very close friends and I was really naive and innocent at the time about things.. We ended up having what amounted to an emotional affair, with some definite physical things sprinkled in. He never ended things with his girlfriend, despite resolving to on his own, because of complicating factors I won't get into. Their relationship was very unhealthy, and they barely saw each other, which doesn't make any of it right, but this is why it was marginally easier for me to avoid thinking about how wrong it was enough to actually fall in love with him.

This went on, however, for about a year. Us being ""friends"". After the time passed that he said he would end his relationship, I started to become horribly depressed. Things became increasingly difficult for me to handle on an emotional level, and we became in many ways distant. We became more of friends, even if we obviously still had feelings. When summer came, I went off to a different city for a temporary internship, and he went off on a trip. We went a period of a couple months with minimal contact, just texting on occasion.

During this period, I began to open up to the idea that I shouldn't be waiting around for someone like this. I was exhausted. Didn't want anything to do with love. I spent the summer working on myself, doing things I love and enjoy, etc. But I ended up talking to this guy (31m) online. Over the next several months, we wrote long letters back and forth, and feelings started to happen.

I came back into town, and for the next few months I saw my ""friend"" kind of sparsely. His behavior kind of confused me - when we hung out, he acted almost more serious and sweet than ever before (like he finally had no reason to hold back), but then he would go long periods not speaking to me. I took the latter as confirmation that nothing more would ever happen between us, and accepted it within myself. I started to just let myself grow deeper feelings for this other guy. Fast forward to now, we have planned to meet in December.

Then something happened last week. My friend met up with me after a couple weeks of barely any contact, and he told me he has broken up with his girlfriend a while ago, and explained to me that this is why he's been distant. He explained also that he's been super insecure and processing a lot, etc. Completely genuine and laying out everything to me. He told me he didn't want to act emotionally and so wanted us to have distance. We hung out again a couple days later and he's acting emotionally open in a way I always wished for. But it's clear that he's assumed, even after these months of emotional distance, that I'm still waiting for him.

Now I'm terrified because I know that I'm going to have to break it to him that I moved on, preferably before he pops the question to me that he wants to make our relationship romantic/official. I am still in love with him. Despite the former context of our ""friendship"", he makes me so happy just to be around and it's so obvious. He's been a good influence on my life in other ways, always encouraging my growth and happiness, etc. I say this to illustrate that his effect on my life has still been very good and to say how extremely hesitant I am to do anything to hurt him. The guilt I feel for talking to someone else and feeling potential love with this new guy is overwhelming me.

I think I would regret not exploring this new option, though. I also don't want to hurt the one I've been writing to! I feel a special connection there.. I recognize though that he would probably be significantly less hurt than my friend if things didn't work out, because we've not been involved near as long. He also lives super far away, and we'd have to have mostly a long-term relationship if we decided to.

I'm conflicted and don't want to hurt anyone, but it isn't fair to anyone to linger in this situation where two people are thinking I'm waiting for them.

Anyways. I need help with 1) figuring out what to do / which option to choose, and 2) how to do it without completely breaking someone's heart. I've never even been able to experience being in an actual relationship and yet I'm having to essentially break up with someone. I am torn into two. Help.",10Sep2018,1
272,"Hey everyone...

I am a man and I really enjoy wearing thongs. They’re much more comfortable for me and don’t bunch up under the khaki pants I wear everyday to work like boxers do.

I’m a little self conscious about wearing them to work because I’m always worried someone might complain about it.

You might ask why would I be nervous unless people are able to see my underwear in which case it’s my fault.

However, I work in IT and on the occasion I do have to kneel down and bend over to look at hardware.

So this is why even against my best efforts, moving in a certain angle and manner could possibly reveal my underwear.

Are my fears even rational? Is it really any of their business what I wear (coworkers)? If they can see my underwear in the first place does it matter if they see a thong instead of boxers?

Any guys/girls care to share any insight?

I would ask though that you please not judge me for what I want to wear. I am confident enough in myself and no I don’t think it’s gay. So please keep that toxic stuff away...",10Sep2018,1
273,"Not sure how much detail I should give so I’ll try and be as specific as possible. I’m in my mid 20s, working full time at a company that is not doing well. Company culture is extremely low  and turnover is incredibly high. It’s continually getting worse here so I am actively looking for a new job. The problem is my field is very specific, and while there are other companies that have a position that I would want, I have to wait until they have that position open because it’s so limited. 

Thus I’ve been trying to break into tech, for various reasons. But I’ve had trouble getting interviews though as while there are some jobs I am semi-qualified though, none are truly in my field/major and the field is competitive, so I assume someone else more qualified than me also applied and got it instead. 

However, I ended up applying to this position in tech that seemed to be in my field and got a first round phone interview that I had last week. Unfortunately I found out the position was not at all what it seemed. It’s essentially an incredibly repetitive job of answering online tickets, essentially the same thing every day with no possibility of additional projects on top of that. Without getting into detail about my field, this is completely unrelated to my field and tbh just sounds boring. She said there could be opportunities for growth but I’d have to stay in the position for 1 year+. The starting salary is less than I am currently making, but not by much. I got an email today inviting me to a half day onsite interview. 

I’m conflicted on whether or not I should go because on the plus side the company seems to be doing well, has a cool product, and maybe it be a stepping stone to something else in tech, which is what I want and have had trouble getting into. Worth noting though that this company does not have my field, so if I moved positions in the company I don’t know what I’d like to move to. My mom also thinks I should go just for the interview practice, and maybe I’ll find out more about the position I don’t know already. 

On the cons side, I don’t want to put in the effort of preparing for an interview and taking time off of work. I also feel like I’m wasting their time, because at the end of the day I know I absolutely don’t want this position. 

After writing this out I feel like I shouldn’t go but I’d love to know your thoughts.",10Sep2018,0
274,"I've recently moved out of an unfurnished flat and into a furnished one, so in the process I sold the furniture in my old place.  I bought it all from my landlady for about £800 (a couple of sofas, a kitchen table and chairs, bed, bedroom furniture.)  An itemised price was given for each piece.  Among the things left in the flat when I moved in was a mirror, which I didn't buy from her.  This however wasn't listed in the inventory of things associated with the flat, given to me by the letting agency and she never asked me to look after/store it for her in the flat I was renting.  I left it up on the sitting room wall anyway as I quite liked it.  I was under the impression the mirror was my property.

&amp;#x200B;

In anticipation of moving out last month,  I ended up selling all the furniture to the new tenant.  I got £255 total, of which the mirror made up £30.  I received a text from my landlady this morning asking me to return the £30 and the grounds that she never sold me the mirror.  I did offer to sell it all back to my landlady for half of what I paid for it, so she could let the flat as furnished.  She explained this would leave her liable for the council tax were she unable to find a new tenant and therefore didn't want to do so.  

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst renting the place, I got on very well with the landlady and continue to do so.  Her text was very polite and friendly.  I was also a good tenant (to the best of my knowledge), the couple of inspections over the course of the ten months I lived there raised no issues and the letting agent has no intention of disputing that my full deposit be returned on the basis of the condition in which I left the flat upon moving out.  In Scotland, where I live, the deposit is held by a third party by law.  I'm intending to start the process of getting it back this afternoon, though I understand it's quite painless and think it's unlikely this will change that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I hate confrontation and don't really want this to become an issue.  I don't need the money either, so it's really not a big deal.  This did rub me up the wrong way a little though, as I don't think I really did anything wrong and took an absolute bath on the furniture anyway.  I haven't got back to her yet and I'm not sure what to do.",10Sep2018,1
275,"I’m a senior in college, and the recruiting season for my field is basically all of September.  On Friday the company that I interned with this past summer extended an offer for a full time job starting in May after graduation.  The salary and benefits are amazing, and there’s nothing wrong with this company, aside from its geographic location.  It’s in my hometown, which I don’t really want to go back to.  I want a new adventure.  But I’m also scared to turn the job down without another offer on the table.  To add more variables to the situation, I’m currently in a long distance relationship.  We’ve been together for over 5 years, off and on long distance with attending different colleges for a year, and then him graduating before me.

I saw him on a bus while on my way home a week or so ago. He was asking questions about my wheelchair, which I’m used to from strangers, though it irritates me greatly. 

There was a news article printed about me a few weeks ago with my full name in it. He found my Facebook and LinkedIn (which I’ve blocked him on and deleted) and my workplace and he’s contacted me 3 times, including by letter that was delivered to my workplace. 

He gave me his business card and 2 phone numbers to contact him on and keeps asking me to go for coffee with him.

If he contacts me again, however, I intend to politely ask him to leave me alone. 

Like I say, I don’t think he’ll hurt me, but I am concerned about asking him to back off. There’s only one bus route through my neighbourhood and I haven’t finished learning to drive yet, so I’m stuck with the bus for now.

278,"To start off we aren't actually dating yet because we want to wait until we both get our mental health straight but we are very committed to each other. I have already gone into therapy and am on the right medication for my mental illness. However, my partner is at a standstill and procrastinating on getting any help. He says he wants to get help but says he gets stressed out every time he tries to do his paperwork. I asked if it was the fear of something related to the paperwork that has his stressed out and he said it wasn't. He asked if I could be with him while he finishes his paperwork, but every time we hang out he puts it off. His undiagnosed mental illness causes his a lot of distress and sometimes get dangerous for him (suicidal ideation) and I have talked to him with empathy and explained to him how helpful a voluntary hospitalization would be for him. He softened up to the idea and we briefly searched mental hospitals near us and he said that he wanted to research into them more but never did. He has episodes where he says extremely violent, angry, and hurtful things about people or animals and can sometimes be very rude to me. It causes me a good bit of stress (not as much as it used to though). For instance, right after I got off of a 7-hour shift of work he's driving me home and starts mouthing off about how much he hates his roommate's dog and dogs in general and how people that own dogs are useless and idiots as well as the dogs themselves. 

Let me clarify by stating that I obviously don't agree with him on this and this is not the person I fell in love with. Its like when he gets stressed, he takes on an entirely new persona.  After the episode was over he said, "" I actually like Finn (the dog) and I was just ticked off that (his roommate's name) didn't tell me that he was going to Savannah and leaving me to take care of him.""

I've done a lot to change the way I react to his anger and am now able to disarm him and validate his frustration while doing my best to not encourage this behavior. When things get to be too much I let him know that this is my boundary and I understand that he's feeling very upset but he needs to take a moment to calm down before we continue. I'm still learning new things and learning new ways to handle his episodes, but sometimes it makes me question If I want to continue dealing with this for years. 

Because of the he persona takes on I see imperfections in peoples teeth and look at large people in a different way. Allow me to explain. He used to be bullied about his teeth when he was young and they were crooked and then he eventually got braces and now they're straight. However, he now sees imperfections in other peoples teeth and used to be really be bothered by mine early on in our friendship and pointed that out to me which made me feel really insecure. He would even go as far as saying ""if we got married one day, I want to get you braces"" (the tone of this sentence was hopeful and said in a way that was meant to be kind). About large people, his mother was extremely abusive and a great portion of trauma for him and she would always spout out her negative views of fat people and this transferred to him in the form of thinking that all fat people are rude and inherently bad. I am greatly disturbed by this view he adopted from his mother and expressed this to him. He is slowly but surely changing his view since I had to explain to him on numerous occasions that It was not the fact that someone's weight had nothing to do with the fact that they were an asshole.

There are several other things he has work on, but my main point here is **I'm starting to wonder if his extremely poor mental state and the fact that I won't give up and leave him is the reason I keep having issues with depression and anxiety coming back after getting on the right medications and returning to therapy**. I hate when I come home from something stressful only to have him stress me out more when he has an episode. Or when I am having a great day and he is stressed out and has an episode.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I am not coming off as cold or selfish here. I really do love and care about him and he does work to make changes in himself. I can see myself with him in the long term, but it's frustrating to see him hold himself at a standstill when he has all the resources (including financial) and I am here struggling financially and still doing my best to take care of my mental health immediately.

My point is that both relationships I’ve been in I felt really attached. When I’m in a relationship or starting out I get infatuated easily. I’ve tried to dumb it down a bit but when I have experienced not much attention from girls when I was younger, it’s hard to not get excited over something new. But i get to the point where I focus too much energy in waiting for them to text back, I lose sleep, I lose my appetite, and I start to close out everyone else in my life except for the other person. As if I’m obsessed. But with my recent relationship I tried to work on that. I told myself to breathe, do what I enjoy and take my time. And even after the breakup I dealt with it way better than my others. I kept myself from substances and stayed healthy. I try to keep myself happy and occupy myself.

So now. It’s come to this. I want to prevent that. I want a long lasting healthy relationship finally. Because with all the shit I’ve put up with all these years I really deserve one.

I don’t know for sure who this message is from, but I do have one former friend that it could be.  I cut ties with this person for selfish but necessary reasons.  I don’t want to get pulled back into their stuff because it was terrible for me and the people I care about, but I also don’t want this person to possibly end their own life.

Other somewhat pertinent info:  this isn’t the first time the person this might be has done this sort of thing and that time wasn’t about suicide, it was about “having a feeling it was [their] time.”  

What do I do?  Can I just give the phone number to the police and ask them to intervene?  Do I answer the text as a stranger but try to talk them through it?  Do I answer with the number to the suicide hotline and just say “please call them?”

299,"This is the first step.  


I'll try and keep this as short as possible.  
I got kicked out of highschool for attendance 5 years ago now.  
I live with only my mum, though i am not dependant on her, she's more of a housemate, doesn't tie my shoes and make my bed or even cook for me or any other baby shit you would be expecting.  
For the past 5 years straight, literally, all i have done is play video games and go to the gym.  I had friends from highschool, but in the first year after highschool ended, they kind of drifted away, as well as the girls i knew, i haven't had a friend for about 4 years, which doesn't reflect my personality seeing as i get along with everyone and fit in easily. Now you're probably thinking to yourself, how the fuck have your parents not kicked you out? etc. Well i have 3 siblings, 2 older, 1 has a debilitating alcahol/gambling addiction and is a psychopath (literally), the other  is just a complete bitch and doesn't have much to do with the family, she moved out when she was 16, and the 3rd is following her footsteps, just a complete bitch. This doesn't reflect my parents though, 1 is a working IT professional who does very well for himself, the other is my Mum, who loves me the most out of the 4 of her children realistically. So with me being the only child that isn't either a complete shitstain of a human, or a psychopath, my Mum just lets me be and believe's one day i'll sort my shit out, today is that day.  


I turn 23 in 5 months and have never had a job, haven't had a girlfriend since i was 15 (have somewhat regular sex with girls off tinder, so im not an incel) and a few things scare the fuck out of me. The fact i haven't had a job doesn't really bother me, i'm quite smart (not smart enough to be in this situation obviously) and learn things very quickly, as well as being good at everything i do. For money, i bludge off the government (welcome to australia) as well as do boosting on video games which earns me a somewhat not bad amount of money for doing what i enjoy, anywhere upto $800 a week, but i am completely burned out of playing games. The biggest problem i have is the fact that i have no education and employment history and have a massively receding hairline which im extremely insecure about. I've spent 5 years ignoring my problems and drowning out any thought i have of my future with music and gaming. My 22nd birthday about 6 months ago my situation really hit me hard, i drove to a rather large cliff on the other side of the city and sat there for about an hour crying (which was weird, last time i had cried i was 14 or so..) and fighting the urge to just throw myself off it and end it all, though i very rarely have suicidal thoughts. Another thing i feel holding me down is my psychopath brother. He turned from someone i look up to, to someone i literally want to kill. He hast hurt my family emotionally and financially like you would not believe, my grandparents and mum live on antidepresants from his actions, and the thought of leaving my mum with him makes me feel subhuman.  


So i guess the advice im after is, what the fuck should i do? Because it's been so long that i don't even know what i, myself, want to do. I've been thinking starting university to study IT seeing as i spend 24/7 infront of a computer, but have no clue about the things i would actually be doing, or more so if i would be able to jump right in and be okay, so if anyone has any clue on if thats a possibility that would be cool. Or my 2nd option, obviously, getting a job..which is easier said than done. I would need to completely bullshit my resume seeing as im 22 and have 0 experience, and even then, what kind of jobs can i even look for when i have 0 qualifications? It would basically be pot luck, i would even start off at fast food places, but i'm too old for them to hire me, they can hire someone 5/6 years younger and pay them less to do the exact same thing.  


  
Any input/advice/anything is appreciated, even if its negative. I want a girlfriend again, i wan't the car i've always wanted, i want to travel the world, i want to fix my teeth, i want heaps of tattoo's, i want a dog, i want to be happy, and i want this to be the start of all that after half a decade of literally nothing.

300,"I have two half siblings, ages 11 and 13. Same mother, different father. I visit my father regularly, they choose not to have contact with theirs, due to the emotional abuse he put us all through over the course of 11 years. Typical cycle of abuse situation, it was hard for my mom to leave when there were good moments, in between the bad.

It hasn't been an easy road, this past year. He never liked my mom working, so she didn't for 10 years. He decided to make his exit just before every single bill was due, so he could watch us crumble and lose it all, and he could pursue his fairytale life he's always wanted. I didn't let that happen, I paid it all, and helped my mom find a job within the same week he left. He was furious.

Now, I get a phone call last night from a grown woman in her 30's claiming to be the daughter of this man (wtf moment). Long story short, she did some DNA test on some Ancestry site, and it linked it back to him. Now, she knows he's a deadbeat dad, she somehow got a hold of his prior ex to my mom (who he had a kid with), and basically has the same story as us.

This woman doesn't want a relationship with her ""father"", but she wants one with her ""siblings"". Right now, I think it's inappropriate, they're both still legally children, and in completely different stages of life.

I'm not sure what to tell this woman? Am I right or in the wrong for thinking she shouldn't try to establish a relationship? ",10Sep2018,3

I have been job searching for 2 month now in my hometown.  It is a large city, but I am not seeing much.  I was just offered a job working in the office of an independent manufacturing plant. The pay is a few thousand less than I was making previously.  They specifically mentioned in the interview that there was no room for advancement beyond this position. It is about 40 minute drive from where I currently am, not including rush hour or winter traffic, plus it is in a bad neighborhood. The paid time off is accumulated as 4 hrs per month worked.

My other option is to just keep working and invest like i have been and try follow hobbies, this is music for me and id love to work in music somehow wether that be managing events to being the dj though this is the much more difficult option in my eyes as music is such a difficult area to break into.

As far as i can see these are the pros and cons for option 1 and 2

Pro opt 1
High paying job
Early retirement (probably)
Easy to find work once graduated
Various different types of work in the field from building games to making servers work
Studying abroad at some point???maybe???

Cons opt 1
Big money investment
Minimum 3 yrs(4 if i specialise) 
Was never a huge fan of school though id like to think im smart


Pro opt 2
Possibly very high paying
Would love it
Lets me have free money to i.e travel,invest,buy things

Cons opt 2
Very hard to break into
Hard to build a lot of money to seriously invest with on unskilled wage


What would you guys do in a similar situation or what do you think i should do?

314,"Hey guys! 

I'm 16 and I live with my mum at the moment as well as my brother and sister. Just earlier she got aggressive with my 8 year old brother and I told her to stop handling the situation with a violent attitude and then she just made fun of the way I talk so I told her than she doesn't even speak english properly (she isn't fluent, i'm mixed btw and only speak english) and she got really mad.

Anyways she got violent because my little brother wanted to but some game dlc and I defended him when she was getting violent. This happens too often and she can be very abusive like that and really does take a toll on my siblings and I's self esteem (all 3 of us constantly get yelled at for having no confidence by her and others that she consented to them yelling at us and telling us that we are inferior to the average kid).

I would move to my dad's because he is nice but: He has very little money because he spends a lot on cigarettes and alcohol and when he gets drunk he gets extremely violent and sometimes when I stay there I end up in someone else's house sleeping that night. I'm very trapped and need to have a safe place to study. My education is the keys to freedom I feel and I'm so so close to them right now (2 years away!)

My dad lives near my school so I wouldn't have to take the bus for 20 minutes but he lives in a dangerous area. He cant give me lunch money to eat food or pay for my school books. If i go, I'll have to find a way to get my own wifi, pay phone bills and stuff (I'm struggling to find a job)

I'm too scared to talk to someone because I don't wanna have grown up with all the violence, bullying at school etc just to be taken 2 years to the end. I've waited years to get here I am so fucking close to the end right now I Just gotta wait 1.5-2 years now. What seems like the best option? would you rather emotional abuse or physical? 

Also I have no friends left anymore, my entire group flushed me, my current friends talk to me when they need someone to stay the night on the phone which i'm happy to do but i don't get that in return sadly so I have no one to talk to.

I've moved in with my really supportive boyfriend and love the little flat we have and I think i'm loving living in London.

I started work last week. It's a graduate scheme in a company that i've always admired and I worked really hard to get the job. It's not my first job as I did a placement year in another company that despite I really enjoyed chose to leave to follow my ambition.

By Wednesday of my first week I started getting these feelings i'm about to burst into tears and filling up. I can't put my finger on what causes it but it continued all week and after a lovely weekend I approached today with a positive attitude but still as soon as I was at my desk I felt overwhelmed and teary. I keep comparing it to the previous company and previous role where I had friends and built good relationships with people and this company just doesn't seem to have that.  I know that I need to give it time but currently every point i'm not actually working on something stimulating i'm on the edge of bursting into tears and when i'm trying to explain to my boyfriend why its happening, I can't.

326,"I'm thinking about calling CPS (Child Protective Services) on my sister.

So back story, my sister and her husband are on welfare and moved in with my grandmother (who is in her early 90s and let them move in with her because she felt bad for the kids). 

Both parents are lazy and my sister hasn't been able to keep a job for more than about 2-3 months in about 15 years. The husband has 2 kids from a previous marriage that he owes 12 years of back child support on and he hasn't had a job since long before he married my sister 8 years ago. Neither of them do drugs, they are just lazy and spend all day playing video games. Supposedly they make a little money from streaming themselves playing on 'Twitch' but any money they get from that apparently goes into paying for Internet and computer upgrades.

So here is why I am considering calling CPS on them. The oldest of the two kids is 8. He sleeps on the floor in the room with his parents. The youngest is 4, he shares a bed with his parents. 

They had CPS called on them previously and the oldest child was taken away from them for about 3 months on account of 'Neglect and unsanitary living conditions'. Please note that my sister and her husband are absolutely disgusting. They bathe maybe once every two weeks and their teeth are literally rotting in their mouths because all they eat is junk food, drink soda, and then they refuse to brush their teeth.

So the 8 year old, I can only understand about half of anything he says. He's a good reader but he's hard to understand. It's not uncommon for him to disappear over to my mom's house or my middle sister to pick him up and take off with him for an afternoon and his parents to have to clue until she brings him home. (My middle sister is great, she pays for him to take swim lessons, takes him to the park, etc. She just gave up on notifying the parents that she was taking their kid for the afternoon because they never pay attention anyways). One thing I found really sad was at Christmas after he was given a bunch of new toys, he wanted to go home with my middle sister rather than stay with his parents.

The youngest child worries me more. He's 4. He doesn't speak, he's still in diapers and they are making no effort to potty train him. We've caught him fishing a knife off the counter in the kitchen and rather than do anything about it, the parents just yelled 'No, don't do that' and went back to their video games. Didn't even bother to try and take it away from him. 

Apparently about a month ago he managed to make his way up onto the deck above the house (Something that has been banned since I was a kid like 20 years ago) and then fell 10 feet through the skylight because they weren't paying attention to him. He was fine, but that shouldn't happen. Every time I go over there his diaper is full and needs to be changed. Generally my grandmother will change it but she shouldn't have to.

On the point of my grandmother who they are living with. She is starting to get dementia. She can't keep up with the disaster and disgustingness that the two parents and the kids bring on the house is just an absolute disaster zone. Sticky stuff all over the tables and floors. Dishes that haven't been done in what looks like weeks. It's awful.

I live in a different state now, but I go up there and visit about once a month or so and I keep seeing the situation get worse. However, I'm not sure if I've got grounds to call CPS and I'm afraid of what will happen to the children if I do, because the foster system can be a scary place.

Any ideas?

- Course A is £4,000 nonrefundable. Course B is £3,000 but fully refunded if I complete a degree (plan to do it).

- I attended 2 days at Course A. I hated the fellow students. I was 4 years older than the oldest student. I have traumatic memories from school and this felt like going back to school. The students were rude and I'm probably going to spend every trip, lesson and break alone and hating it. Course B is only adults that are older than me and I have no problem.

- Course A is directly the career I plan to go into. However Course B will get me into the career I plan to go into no problem and give me additional options as it is a broader subject.

- Course B is 2 days a week so I can work along side study. Course A is 5 days a week including study so I cannot.

Both will get me into my degree but I'm not sure which one to pick. A really expensive good college with students I hate, or a free bad college that will give me broader options and let me work. Keep in mind I am far more likely to pass Course A so Course B is a bit of a risk.",10Sep2018,1

Fast forward a few months, I eventually got over the crush I had on him, but we're still friends, kinda distant, but still. Two weeks ago, on Saturday, I got invited by a mutual co-worker to play board games and he was invited too. Cool, great. He came up to me and said ""Hey, it'd be cool if you went with us on Saturday! I can give you a ride home later."" Weird, but fine. On Saturday, we had a lot of fun, I actually enjoy going out with my co-workers, to be honest. I was ready to call an Uber to go home but he insisted on giving me a ride, despite me living pretty far away from where he lives. Yeah, ok, I'm saving money.  


Since we're pretty good friends, I suggest that we stop somewhere to talk a little bit since it's still 2 AM. He parked in front of my house and... Well, long story short, we stayed inside his car, talking and laughing until we were almost sleeping beside each other at 6 AM.  


I didn't think too much of it at the time, since he always seemed to reject me so I tried to look at it as two good friends hanging out. Then I started talking about a few things he said: I'm taller than him, I'm 5'8, he's 5'2. He kept talking about how he's over his fear of tall girls, how he doesn't cares about looks anymore. He also talked a lot about being ready to be in a relationship again, even when that wasn't the topic. He used to be kind of a womanizer? Went out weekly on all sorts of dates on Tinder and what-not.  


Last Thursday, I was out with some friends and he invited me to play League of Legends with him, told him I was out and gave it no mind. On Friday, he asked me how things went at the party and I just ""yeah, it was ok"", then he hit me with the ""Well I bet if you stayed home playing League with me you'd have way more fun!""

335,"I'm 30, I'm a male, I'm college educated, not married, no kids, no debt, a pile of money in the bank. 

My parents started and own a pretty successful business that's been around for nearly fifty years. I got into the business after college because both my parents simply couldn't do it. Now I'm thirty and I can't believe I've been doing this for nearly a decade.

It's a hospitality related business. I don't have my weekends off. My job is pretty much the opposite of the normal 9 to 5 work week. Half the year we are super busy. It's not abnormal for me to leave work at two or three AM. I literally have no life during that busy season. I'm mentally, physically, and emotionally drained. I've never been an extroverted, outgoing, or super social person. This type of works demands all of those things. My days off consist of me doing nothing just chilling at my place. 

My staff consists of teenagers and college students. We don't have full time staff. Basically we generally have half returns and then we have to hire and train up new staff before the season gets into gear. We often have shitty staff and most of my job is making sure they aren't fucking around and doing their jobs. 

I've never had issues making and keeping friends. Apparently people like me and I have a somewhat likable personality. The problem is I am a horrible friend and boyfriend during my busy season. I don't want to go out, or do things, or see people during that six month span. 

If I could put my finger on the fundamental issue it's my father. He built the business, he enjoys working in the business, he's a loud, big guy, he likes to micromanage and have his hands in every aspect of the business. He's not super organized and doesn't like procedures, techniques, standards etc. He also has a big ego and doesn't take criticism well. He's got a bad temper. Any hints towards making changes in the business he goes crazy. 

He ran the business and was the guy who worked the most hours up until about fifteen or twenty years ago. My mom filled the gap of time till I graduated from college. Right after I started full time (maybe a year later) our competition went out of business. Our sales literally doubled that year. Nothing in the business has really been changed to accommodate the increase in business. Any time I bring up the fact our sales have greatly increased and I have more on my plate and we need to make changes it gets into an argument with my father as to the validity of that statement. He gets mad and needs to tell me he dealt with the same volume of business while he managed and I need to suck it up and nothing is wrong. 

My father is also super cheap. He's always trying to penny pinch on everything. The building the operation is in is literally falling apart and looks like a dump. Every piece of equipment in the business is old and barely hanging on. One example of this issue is the air conditioning system doesn't work. My father is convinced it works perfectly fine and me and my staff like to complain. It gets hot during our busy season. The business will easily get to ninety or a hundred degrees. My staff and I are stressed under the heat and can't do our jobs as effectively. Our equipment can't handle the heat and starts to shut down. I get angry, the staff gets angry, and customer get angry. ",10Sep2018,3

339,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this. This'll probably be a long post. Please bare with me.

I'm a 19 year old guy who's had kind of a rough childhood. With no dad around and mom working day and night to make a living. I was a lonely kid and I had (and still have) a difficult time making friends. I was bullied a lot and I was depressed. It wasn't exactly the worst childhood, but I don't recall being happy then.

Things are a bit different now. I go to university, financial situation is fine. I do have a few friends around. I'm not 100% happy, I'm still kinda stressed with studying and with money, but who isn't, right?


 No.

I don't want to sound unappreciative, maybe I am. But look around you, there are people doing literally nothing and yet they have the best lives anyone could ever dream of. All these celebrities, and all those ""stars"", who probably live the best lives on this planet, people who's lives are stress-free. I'm gonna take a guess here and say these people aren't worried about money, loans, university, or loneliness.

Now you can argue that these people worked hard to get to where they are, and although I disagree because I'm pretty sure the idiot who spends his time talking to a camera, making videos on YouTube, and gaining millions of it didn't even spend half the effort that I, and probably you, spent, all you have to do is look at those who were literally born with the opportunity. I'm not talking about those who were born to rich parents, I guess you can call that luck. I'm talking about those kids who were able to enter this crazy industry at a young age and basically, in a way, secure their future. How can you not imagine your younger self instead of that kid? How can you not imagine living the lives that these people are living? 

How can you not get sad and depressed every time you open Instagram and find pictures of this happy, rich, lucky guy who's... I don't know, traveling and meeting people and actually living? When you know that you're putting way more effort than him and you know very well that you'll never ever have the life that he has, you'll never ever have this happy, supportive family that he's got, and you know that you'll spend your life studying and then working and trying to cover all these student loans, and when you finally do that, you'll probably be old and you wouldn't have the same energy you have right now.

(The ""you"" in this paragraph is me, obviously. I don't know about your life. I hope it's better).

Am I the only one who thinks this way? I try to appreciate what I have, but the truth is, comparably, I have nothing.

Maybe now that was my mistake, but then I messaged her, ""how are you"", and she said she's fine, etc, some small talk evolved, I told her that I'm about to go on a two week journey. She said she would like to see me before I go, and I agreed to meet for lunch (on a working day). So we had lunch together and it was just fine, chatted a little, said goodbye.

Lately it’s been a struggle to discuss my problems with really anyone. It seems like anytime I voice a complaint or a concern it will always get upstaged. For example, I mentioned to my girlfriend the other night about how I have a few projects to finish in very little amount of time, but rather than comfort me or ask about/give advice, she went on to compare how her schedule is so much busier than mine and how I shouldn’t really be struggling. Same scenario just happened with one of my life long friends where I just sent a snap of all the readings I have to do for the night (200 pages split between a few courses) and he replies back instantly with how I shouldn’t be complaining because he just got dumped by his girlfriend. It just seems like everywhere I go, my problems aren’t heard and I just really don’t have anyone to talk to when I’m feeling a bit down. I’m fine mentally, but it never hurts to have a pal just say “I gotcha” or “I understand, anything I can do to help?” Rather than just be told your problems are minuscule. Any advice is appreciated.

I am ambitious and being around someone like this makes me really nervous because I am afraid their lack of ambition will rub off on me. 

I have another friend that always has my best interest in mind but I can't bring them anywhere because they are really insecure and always try to act like they are better than everyone else and are extremely rude toward people.

349,"My wife got injured in late January from her sales job at a plant nursery when they had her working in the green houses during their slow season (essentially doing things that weren't part of her job description).  She ultimately had to get surgery which workers comp covered.  When she returned to work two weeks after the surgery, she had work restrictions explicitly stating that she was to have sedimentary work only (desk work, no extensive walking or any lifting).  She worked for about a week before her boss let her know that they didn't have enough work to keep her busy, and as a result they had to let her go.

My wife just got all of her work restrictions lifted, which means that her worker's comp benefits ended.  My wife during this time has been unable to find new work and filed for unemployment.  The sign up for that went without a hitch until today when the person managing her unemployment gave her a call and said that her former boss is claiming that my wife left work voluntarily.

My wife has an email conversation where my wife asks her former boss to have a reason in writing why she was laid off (she specifically said, ""I'd like to have the reasoning why I was laid off in writing."").  The boss replies a few hours later and says that they don't have a place for her and that they don't have enough sales to warrant having 3 people.

Has anyone dealt with anything like this?  It sounds to me like the boss is trying to get out of having the company pay unemployment and lied to the unemployment case manager about why my wife was let go.  My wife has this email exchange, I don't really know if it's much to make her case about being let go, but it seems to me that because the boss never corrected her when my wife asked why she was let go that the boss was in the understanding that this was not a voluntary resignation.

351,"I get male attention on a daily basis, sometimes the guys can be kind of creepy or ""pushy"" but nothing really alarming and it's all generally the same typical kind of stuff to get my attention. But it feels different with this one guy who I've noticed showing up everywhere I go every single day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I moved to this city a year ago and in March, he was a customer at the grocery store I use to cashier at. I tend to be pretty sociable and outgoing, people sometimes think its flirty- especially men but I gave no real indication that I was interested in the least bit. Not in my body language, not in my tone or the things I said.. He was just a customer and was gone within ten minutes. He would come into the store every so often and greet me but I never paid attention to it. Then I started shopping for Instacart in the same store just a few weeks ago and I started to notice that I saw him in the store every single day and he would immediately say, ""Hi, nice seeing you again"" every single time. That store is pretty popular and we have regular customers who shop there every day without fail, they'll often say hi to me because they see me every day but it isn't like they're literally looking for me like this guy seems to be and today he nearly broke his damn neck trying to catch me as I walked by him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never talk to him, I just say hi and barely even look at him before walking away but he still hasn't really gotten the hint. Yesterday, he approached me at the gym and I was surprised and felt uncomfortable, not knowing what to do because I didn't want to talk to him and had no excuse like ""I'm working"" to walk away from him. I just said that I didn't know he went to this gym and he replied with, ""You kidding? I come here every day. I've seen you here before!"" But \*I\* go to that gym every day(except for Sundays) and it's not so big that I would miss seeing him in a sea of people. I've literally never seen him before since the very day I started going a year ago and if he \*had\* seen me there before, why wouldn't he approach me like he always did in the store until yesterday? I walked over to the machines my husband was using and started using the second one, I could see in the mirror that this guy was staring me down from behind the entire time I was on the machine. I know that the stereotype of guys is that they watch women while they work out and I've caught a few admirers but the way this guy was looking at me was like... the way a hyena might look at it's dinner?

&amp;#x200B;

 It would be one thing if the reason I saw him all the time was because he shops at that store everyday (he never gets more than one or two things and sometimes just has an empty basket, I barely see him at check out) but now I'm seeing him show up at other places I frequent all of the sudden. BUT the area I live and work in is very central and I run into the same people throughout my week, I see customers in that gym all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was about 10 or 15 minutes after he saw me in the store that I sat at my bus stop outside and he rolled up to me, stopping in the middle of the road and asked me if I needed a ride to the gym. There was no way I was getting in that car with him and just said I was going home to which he asked where I lived and said he was a lyft driver. I said I was fine with the bus and there were cars coming so he had to leave. The whole bus ride I was on the look out for him and was weary when I walked the rest of the way home, to the point that I had to share my location with my mom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that perhaps I'm being paranoid.. I do struggle with anxiety (possible PTSD) and get pretty jumpy but I never felt like people were following me. It would be one thing if he was just an awkward kid and trying to figure out the best way to approach me/get to know me but this dude is in his mid to late 40's and most guys literally just ask me out after a couple of times seeing me if not the first time,  instead of following me around for weeks gawking at me.  Most guys his age don't even pay attention to me anyway. And it isn't his age that automatically makes him creepy.. I tend to like older men but it's like.. if you want to talk to me or ask me out why don't you just do it? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if the guy is truly being creepy or if I'm just being paranoid but I'm kinda nervous about this situation and need advice on what to do as far as protecting myself without being an accusatory a-hole to someone who may very well be innocent. I don't have a car and often walk to my destinations, I can't really change my routes too much either. I'm considering getting a weapon as well. I have his license plate number but not his name, I don't know if I can look him up in a back ground check or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

He never approaches me when I'm alone (besides the time in the gym) but it's always in public and at day. I just don't want things to escalate and he gets more dangerous before I really am aware of it. I also don't want to accuse someone of being a weirdo when I'm just the weirdo.. All I know is that I felt scared walking home and I don't even want to go to the gym today.

When we were sitting in our hotel room, I started talking to myself. I was whispering to myself, so I thought they couldn't hear me.

My father asked me, ""Are you talking to yourself?"" I said, ""No."" I was, but I tried to lie my way out of it. I went into another room, and I was doing it again. My father caught me again and said, ""What the h*ll are you doing?! You are talking to yourself!""

358,"I’m a 24 yr old full-time student living in Canada with my mom. 

It’s not that I hate my mom, but I feel like it’s about time I moved out...but I came to that realization just a week ago, way after moving season. 

I still have 2 years left to my bachelors’, but I work 2 jobs (one as a cook at a pub and another one as a junior analyst). 

I live in the same city as my college, so it makes sense that I stay with my mom until I graduate (it also allows me to help her out with essentials since I also work). 

However, I feel like I’m missing out on quite a lot in terms of freedom (I’m a pretty introverted guy, but I never experienced things like having friends over or a girl). 

There is a student loan system in Canada that I can apply to in order to make myself fairly well off while studying, in addition to my two jobs, but wouldn’t it be smarter if I actually saved up some more money and made better preparations instead of rushing it right now? 

One side of me really wants to live by myself (or with roomies) and experience true freedom while the other side of me is more pragmatic and doesn’t want me to make a bone-headed move and end up way more worse off. 

What do you guys think? ",10Sep2018,1
359,"Hi all! 

Looking for a little advice, but first here’s some background:

I had worked at two part time jobs (let’s call them Job #1 and Job #1) for 2 years before making Job #1 (startup company) full time several months ago. I grew to hate the environment, and my desire to do something else with my career helped drive me to quit. Before I did, I secured other employment at two part time jobs (one being Job #2 from earlier). My boss was understanding when I told her, and then upset several days later as she felt like she hadn’t gotten the entire story (specifically in regards to me going back to Job #2 as she knows my boss there). I cleared things up, apologized for any misunderstanding she had, and I finished my two weeks in good graces (complete with a going away party my boss orchestrated). 

Until today. I was handing back in my work laptop after cleaning it over the weekend, and my now former boss wanted to speak to me in private. She explained that she was disappointed in the way I left, and that she felt that she was the last person to know and that honesty was always how I had acted and this was out of character. She was upset that she was in a tougher position then when I was there. She told me to think about my actions going forward as they could have effects. 

Do I reach back out to her and apologize? I don’t think that I did anything wrong securing employment before I quit, and her attitude being appreciative and happy for me the last week and a half has really thrown me for a loop in light of today’s conversation. 

Any thoughts on how to handle this moving forward?

I have this undying need to have really good friends.. I’m not short of support don’t get me wrong, I’ve got a great family and the best girl in the world for a girlfriend..

But I want friends man, people who like the same things as I do. 

I currently have friendships that are all greater than 3 years but jeez these people really suck. They used to be amazing but now they just suck balls. 

First group of friends used to talk shit about each other behind their backs, got tired of that and left that huge circle and that cut my friends in half.. the remaining guys .. well I don’t know what happened. 

I started listening to VaporWave and they constantly insult my current taste in music (I’ve never loved one genre for too long, my taste keeps evolving) 

I stopped playing league of legends for a bit to focus on school and when I got back they all talked down to me and insulted me about how bad I am and how they hadn’t realized before. 

In the group chat they usually almost always ignore me and pretty much laugh at each other’s memes, jokes .. etc 

So my question is.. should I cut this second half off as well? 

Should I look for new friends ? Should I just suck it up? Is this how friends treat each other ? Besides making new friends at this age is a MISSION !! I’ve tried..

My fiance is currently getting her PhD so right now my job does most of the heavy financial lifting, but once she gets a job of PhD caliber, I hope to step down and take a simpler job.  This is something she is aware of and supports.  I’m learning that an office desk job isn’t for me, and my interest in and desire to do IT/programming has greatly faded over the years.  Looking back, my favorite jobs I’ve ever had were working at a drive-in movie theater and doing park/road maintenance for the Road Department in the township I grew up in.  In both of those jobs I was outside, moving around, working with fun people in a non-corporate environment, doing very straightforward, simple work.

So the only things I can think of going into are back to a road/parks department or some sort of small business that provides a very simple service.  I really like playing guitar, video games, and pets (I have a black lab that I love having and caring for), so I've thought about working in a guitar shop, gaming store, or pet shop, whether it's a chain (Guitar Center, Game Stop, PetSmart) or a more local place.  Every time I go into one of these kinds of stores, especially the local ones, I get this warm, cozy feeling.  I’ve also thought about working in a library or book shop, as my interest in reading has increased and I love the atmosphere of being around books.  I also love doing parkour/Ninja Warrior and I'm pretty good at them, so getting a job as an instructor at a local gym could be fun too.

What are some other more straightforward jobs that I could maybe look into besides a road department or retail in a shop?

370,"I'm finally getting serious about college at 23 after a number of years of having it low on the priority list, and I'm finding it to be very fulfilling and pretty stinkin' easy now that I'm paying attention in class. It's going well, but it's slow. I want to take more classes, I want to knock out the transfer requirements and get to university asap.

But, I'm broke. I'm about $1200 in debt, I make anywhere from $200-$400 a week.

I work for a mom and pop shop that gives me extremely flexible hours, I can call out anytime for anything I want to do. And at the same time I'm given opportunities to work almost anytime. I also love this company, they're fantastic people. On paper it's the perfect college job, I'd make more if I had time to spare.

Outside of these things I like to keep active, my friends are important to me, and I have a weekend passion. Saturday and Sunday are dedicated riding time. I race motorcycles, have since I was 15. 

My dilemma is I have to sacrifice something if I beef up my schedule, and that feels really tough to wrap my head around. To get by while taking more classes it seems like I have to either:

*A*. quit this job, get a more traditional part-time job and sacrifice the free time in the week I use for things like socializing, exercise and mental health breaks, leaving the weekends for riding.

*B*. quit this job, get a more traditional part-time job and sacrifice one of my weekend training days for socializing, exercise, etc.

*C*. keep this job, take more hours and sacrifice exercise, socializing, etc

or *D*. keep doing what I'm doing and wait a couple years to get where I want to be in my college life.

These options that are in front of me seem like a simple ""what's more important?"" problem. *A* seems like what I'll choose, as school and riding are my biggest priorities right now. 

Though, money is main factor. I'd sacrifice work in a second if I had money to spare. And that leads to me to option *E*: Financial Aid. Take a student loan, pay off immediate debt debt, have money to spare not making monthly payments and leave future me the problem of paying it off.

It feels like making a deal with the devil, but it allows me to continue living the lifestyle I have now while accelerating my school process. I know it's entirely a personal decision, but with that information: Is there any advice you'd have for me?",10Sep2018,3

I recently just moved to a whole new city about 400 miles away from home to live with my boyfriend of almost two years now, who moved here to be with his now 7 year old daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

To give you some backstory about us, we are high school sweethearts who broke up during college and went on to remain friends but date other people. After college we both moved back home and happened to be freshly out of relationships. We began to hang out and started to reconnect when he found out his ex-girlfriend was pregnant. While we tried to stay away from each other, our connection was too strong and we tried to date. Because his ex-girlfriend is from out of town she had to move back home when she found out she was pregnant so that her parents can help support her. In order to be there for his daughter, my boyfriend would go back and forth to and from this town, which put a huge strain on our relationship.  He eventually decided to move down to where his daughter was and we had broken up agreeing we didn't want to do the long distance. But again, we got back together deciding to try the long distance which ultimately led to me moving here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm here I'm having a real hard time adjusting to life, more specifically living with his kid. Because she bounces from home to home she lacks a lot of structure and discipline and it's hard for me to accept her, especially since I personally don't agree with how she is being raised. I've never really seen myself as a maternal kind of person and having to all of a sudden move my whole life, live with my bf and his child is creating a lot of stress for me. The longer i’m here the harder it is for me and the more unhappy i feel. When do I know I’ve tried it all? What can i do to make this better? Or how long do I sacrifice my own happiness to know I gave this relationship my best shot? ",10Sep2018,1

382,"This might be a little long sorry in advance. 

A little background: about a week ago a friend and I were hanging out with family/friends and we got a little tipsy. I was tired so I laid across the couch she came to sit down and put my legs on her. As we were watching the movie, she kinda rubbed my legs a little. Nothing too crazy, I definitely noticed and I enjoyed it, but of course I didn't think too much of it since we're both “straight”. 

Flash forward a week later and we are both super drunk at a football game tailgate. I'm more drunk than her but we're both drunk. I tell her I need to go to the bathroom, and she takes my hand and we're holding hands to the bathroom. Which is typical of drunk girls so I wasn't really thinking. Ive held hands with my other drunk friends but we've never interlocked fingers-this time me and her did. So I use the restroom and as we're heading back we're holding hands again. We hang out at the tailgate a little longer and then head to the actual game. The whole time we're holding hands, interlocking our fingers. She squeezed my hand a couple times and is kinda leading me to the game. When we get there we're standing in line, still holding hands. As we get in and our waiting for our other friends she kisses my forehead and we don't let go of each other's hands. Then we take our seats and we're still holding hands. I have my head on her shoulder, she's kissing my forehead (one or two more times) and rubbing my knee. The game starts and we don't hold hands, then I sober up she sobers up and that's the end of it. 

I'm just a little confused cause we're both straight. Idk I couldn't tell if it was more of like let me protect you, or I like you. She's my friends older sister and we've known each other for years. She had one boyfriend a couple months ago but they broke up. Ive always suspected she was a little not straight but Ive never said it to anyone. I guess I'm just confused on her intentions and also why I really enjoyed it so much and I didn't wanna let go of her either. Could it just be the alcohol idk?

384,"My apologies in advance. This will probably be long winded...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, about three months ago, my then-boyfriend broke up with me. (Literally out of nowhere from my perspective. Things were great (again from my perspective), then he no showed on me and decided to end it because I ""go to bed too early"". Not joking. To be fair, there was a lot going on in his life, but still...) He mentioned wanting to stay friends (while I was like, ""Why bother?""), but only texted me once since, so I don't think he was exactly sincere. (He has, however, been liking one picture out of virtually every Facebook post I make since then. It's kind of strange because it'll be like one picture in the middle of a 10-20 picture post, not the post itself, usually a few weeks after I post pictures from a hiking trip or party. But maybe I'm reading too much into it. IDK.)

&amp;#x200B;

Then I saw him maybe a week ago because I'd bought some tickets for  him (prior to the break up).  I mentioned (via text) that I could probably sell them to someone else, but didn't want to ""steal"" his tickets from him...and he said sure, he'd like them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to meet up at the convention to get him his tickets....but he blew me off the first day of the convention (like, texted that he was coming then...completely no showed).  On the second day, he showed up, paid for the tickets  (like...$200, so a lot considering...), then asked if he could hug me (I said sure) and if I wanted to walk around the convention. So we did that, and not wanting to impose, after a point said I'd leave. (Since while I wanted to hang out, I didn't want him to feel obligated to hang out with me for a day.) Then as soon as I did, he left the convention, which was after maybe an hour of wandering/hanging out.(Again, it seemed *really* weird to spend that kind of money to be at a convention for...one hour. If he didn't want to be there, why not at least ask me to try to sell the tickets? I had takers!)

&amp;#x200B;

And gah, IDK. I still like him and want to hang out (and honestly, be together, although I'd enjoy his company even without anything romantic/sexual). But also don't want to bug someone who hasn't exactly acted interested. I also don't particularly want to prolonge things in my head by endlessly asking someone to do something that he's going to politely refuse to do. (Or just ignore. Or do while not really engaging.)

So IDK. My brain tells me just ignore him. My heart is like, ""Invite him to stuff! What do you have to lose?""

I have literally NO marketable skills, no job experience except for a movie theater when I was a teenager.

390,"My friend “Carrie” works for a major discount retailer where she's the stock room manager. She invited me to apply for a job back in June and I sent in my application. I never got a call back. Later she said the GM, “Linda”, didn't accept the application because I listed Carrie as a reference. Apparently these two don't like each other. I don't know the full history between them, but Carrie said that's why Linda ignored my application.

Applications are in-person only, so I met Linda the day I dropped of my application. She gave off weird vibes and showed no interest in me.

Carrie told me last week that Linda is leaving the company and I should reapply. Another manager called ""Jane"" is replacing her. Jane has been working at this store for a month already. In dropped off another application/resume last week. Linda took it and she was still acting strangely. (I document all my paperwork and I took pictures of my completed application... this is important later.)

Linda called me last Monday and sort of rudely said Jane wants me to come in for an interview. She threw out two scheduling options. I took a second to look at my calendar on the wall and she snapped, “What's it gonna be?” I gave her my choice, thanked her, and we hung up.

Cut to interview day. I come in ten minutes early and see Linda chatting with several employees at the front registers. She gives me a dirty look. I say I'm here for my interview and she acts like she has no idea who I am, which is bs, because we met before. She asks for my name. I tell her and I remind her I'm here to see Jane for my interview. She tells me to sit down somewhere and wait.

Jane comes out to greet me. She's confused about why I'm there. Apparently Linda never told her about the interview. I let her know, yeah, Linda scheduled me for today at 1:30. I figure it's a miscommunication and drop the issue.

We do the interview anyway and it goes pretty well. Jane says she likes my responses and she asks me to fill out a form with my references, even though they're already on my application. I pull out my phone and reference my application pictures and write down the same work numbers.

Jane says she'll forward my list of references to Linda to make the calls and do background checks.

The following day I get a call from Linda. She says there's a problem with my references. She says she called my former jobs and was told (by whom she didn't say) that NONE of them are working anymore. This sounds bogus so I say ""Really?"" and she gets defensive and says yes. She asks me to provide new work references, but I tell her I already gave her all the ones I had. She makes it sound like we've hit a dead end. I tell her I'll think about any other references I might have and give a call back.

Now we're up to yesterday night and I'm sitting there in disbelief. I call my most recent former workplace thinking Reference #1 quit just recently or something. She just had a baby so it's possible. I give the overnight manager her name and title and I ask if she's still working in the same department. He says yes.

Then I call the job I had before that. Reference #2 has been assistant manager for over forty years at this place and I knew she wouldn't leave, but I thought maybe she finally retired. Nope. The overnight manager said she still works there.

Now I'm thinking the only other explanation is I gave Linda the wrong numbers by accident. Did she even call the right stores? I go back to my phone and look at the picture of my application and I verify the numbers ARE correct. They're the same numbers I just called.

She had the right numbers. My references are still working. She had their names. I left my former jobs on good terms and I know my former managers would have given me their recommendations. If she had actually called, customer service or a manager would have picked up and they would have told her the same thing they told me. Apparently Linda didn't even bother to call and then she lied about it.

I don't know if I should confront her, as it's obvious she doesn't want me working there anyway. That won't help me get the job and I feel like she'd just lie to save herself. I have a recorder on my phone so I could catch the conversation. But I don't know if that's even legal.

I could go to Jane and present my side of the story but she might think I'm stirring up drama. It's my word against Linda's. The only proof I have is the picture of my application with the correct phone numbers and the names of my references. I also don't want to risk causing tensions between Carrie and Jane since they'll be working together from now on. What should I do?

TL;DR: My friend (stock manager) is trying to get me a job where she works. Got past interview phase and the general manager, soon to be replaced, said none of my references are still working. I called my former workplaces and verified that they are still working. GM hates my friend for some reason. I feel like GM lied and is trying to throw my application under because of that. Don't know if I should confront, take the issue to the replacing manager or corporate, or just let it go.",10Sep2018,3
391,"Today’s my first day back after a long time away, and it’s my third attempt at taking the course. It’s been different for me since I did pretty well my first semester but then came off my meds which helped focus but I wanted to try and prove that I could go through school without the meds. Turns out I was horribly wrong, and I just went downhill in school, failing courses, and feeling unmotivated entirely. I even failed an art class which I never have done even off the meds. I felt so disappointed and frustrated that I couldn’t do as well as I could on my first semester. I even went for tutoring in English but that went horrible, they showed no intention of further helping me after two minutes and never checked on me afterwards. (Might be noted, I have trouble asking for help, and don’t always know how to ask for it any further even after the first time.) I’m nervous about going back, and all. 

TL;DR; nervous to go back to school, school doesn’t have a good track record for helping. ",10Sep2018,1
392,"I️ spent a good part of my last relationship being selfish, self involved, self important.. every self you can imagine. I️ did plenty of lovely things for him as well because well, I️ love him very much, but ultimately my own stuff came first. If I️ was uncomfortable, it was his fault. I️t wasn’t toxic in the way that toxic things look, it was very subtle, and for that I️ think I️ had a lot of difficulty recognizing how subtly selfish I️ was being. He gave me absolutely all the patience and time I️ needed, but when he needed some I️ couldn’t give it. I️ regret that the most. 

I️ broke up with him a few months ago and I️ wish I️ could take it back every day. Unfortunately, with him also left my best friend who stopped speaking to me without an explanation the same week we broke up. I️m starting to think that I️ am a horrible person, that I️ am all alone because I️ don’t deserve to have keep the people I️ love in my life and have people love me back.  I️ learned a lot about how to love from that relationship. I️ learned a lot about how I️ don’t want to show up as well, and I️ wish it didn’t take watching it disappear for me to realize he was the one I️ wanted this whole time. I️ know he’s gone, I️ can’t chase him down and make him forgive me. I️ can’t change what I’ve done, I️ can’t take back anything, and now I️ can’t speak to either of them. They’ve either asked for space or blocked me on everything. 
So what do I️ do now? How do I️ make myself worthy of good relationships and happiness? It’s not a pity party, I️m definitely the ass here. Other people aren’t blameless, but ultimately if I️ wasn’t in the picture, two people I love wouldn’t be this hurt.

393,"I struggle with major depressive disorder. As I've gotten older and I lost my guardian and things have not returned to how they used to be. I was a much more resilient person and was very survivalist due to my upbringing. Because of the episodes, a lot of facets of my life just gone out of control. And I never seem to find a way to ground myself.

I've dealt with suicide attempts and being hospitalized. And usually my relatives have me stay at my dad's until I get used to medication. And under 2 weeks the expectation is that I leave and have another living situation lined up. Him and his new wife want me out because a fortune teller they sought out said I was possessed by demons. Sold my soul to the devil, that something is oozing out of me.

Then I do move out, secure an apartment I clearly can't pay for. I get stuck in a cycle where my ex and I try to make amends, I get kicked out for whatever reason. Then rinse and repeat.

I know I'm not alone but whatever support I do have makes empty offerings to help. Like they ask me to vent, only to disappear for hours without response 'sorry, I was streaming and went to a party'. Even now I don't have a place to sleep, it's like a normal day for them. Like I didn't say anything.

People get sick of hearing about the same thing, I know they don't want to hear it. Everyone thinks sending me to my dad will help, but usually he kicks me out asap. Due to superstition. I used to go to therapy, but due to the state of the company I work for, insurance covers less and less. So I stopped going.

I've exhausted whatever support I have/had. It is no longer viable to confide in anyone. My job doesn't compensate me enough for me to live on my own.

394,"In the past few months, we've had a leadership change and I've noticed significant direction changes where I work. Overall, fear is now driving decisions. 

For example, I oversee two departments that have free access to one another and share information openly. Both offices recently had their access restricted only their one department and when I enquired why, I was told ""safety reasons"". I had access to the data from last year, but when I went to check it, it had been removed from our shared drive. My bosses coworker was in charge of the data and got me access again, and as I suspected, my departments had the highest rated safety and security in the company. 

The company is also adding restrictions to some disability accommodations  (which I'm positive is illegal) and yet has some offices currently missing ADA accessible entrance ramps for customers and staff.

I believe in the work we do and in the customers we serve, but I'm willing to move. I just want to approach the issues diplomatically and in a way that won't hinder a recommendation when I choose to leave. 

Lastly, my boss is unwilling to advance or leave the company so they're okay with me job searching, so I guess is it worth bringing up the issues. My concern is for the welfare of my staff and our customers, but can I even make an impactful change?",10Sep2018,1

I touched my chin and realized the bone was asymmetrical and for 3 years I couldn’t stop messing with it, (to give you the image, it looked like how a man would stroke his goatee or something) and I always had bruises on my chin cause of it. 

But surprise, it went away. Thank god. &lt;&lt;&lt; is what I’d say if it wasn’t immediately replaced with a new compulsion. I thought my nose was too big so I tried to squeeze the sides of it right, as if it’d help at all. Anyways by doing that I got it again only this time being squeezing and messing with the cartilage in my nose. Now in my better mind I realize that my nose isn’t even big so this was caused for nothing and it lasted another 4-5 years.

Now, for 2 years strong, I can’t stop messing with my ears and earlobes. This started cause my ear lobes are actually big and I hate them, I constantly feel like cutting my ears off. Basically what I do is kinda fold my ears multiple times, fold my earlobe inwards or just pull it. This has cause my ear lobe to turn purple multiple times and just recently it’s been giving me “ear aches”

Everything began in junior school. There were a lot of bullying, focused on my appearance ect. , some kids even started to punch me out of nowhere. Pretty sure thats where I started masking my feelings. 

Jr. High School - Bullying continues and intensifies, I start to hate my life and depression starts to form. I falled in love for the first time. Well It didn't went well - laughted at and trashed completly. It repeated 2 times. 

Finally : High School - Depressed, Kind of an alien in my class, I prefer to stay by myself, shy af, alone,  I think nobody likes me (still don't know if that is true or not), Another love and another fail. Well I gave up on that at this point.

Now I'm sitting here and writing short story of my life (It could be longer but it would be too long). I gave up on life, basically hate myself and my appearance, cry at night, wanted to end my life 3 times already, trying to suppress every emotion that i have, given up on trying to find love. Basically I'm a emotional wreck.

And here I have a couple of questions about what should I do because I cant cope with things anymore :

* I've felt feelings for some girl, should i suppress it, and avoid being hurt by another failure?
* Should I see a theraphist?
* What can I do with myself, so I didn't feel like trash at the end of the day ?

407,"This is complicated, cannot provide tl;dr

So, both my parents are absolutely horrible people, my mother taking me abroad when I was 11 (despite never having to) and never being helpful to me drove me into a mental illness, my father was just always kind of a dick to me and never there. He just threw money at me every so often.

The first issue is with my dad. He never wanted to pay alimony to my mother when I was still a kid, and actually rightfully so, because she would spend it on smokes or her boytoys/husband, not on me. When I turned 14 he started paying alimony to me directly, a modest amount, but when mother stopped supplying the fridge when I was 17 it bought me food, so there are reasons to be grateful to him.

Because he didn't pay a dime to my mother for 6 years he owes me now 20k in polish zloty, 5400 dollars. I could withdraw this, but I don't want to, especially since he earns his money by dishonest means and he's not poor. I feel like he owes me a lot more than a joke of 500pln a month, when I was spending it on food in England for a year, so basically eating shit on that budget.

Now the second matter is with my mother. The law in my country is that when I'm a uni student I can file for alimony from parents if I don't live with them. She's still in England, and she's set to inherit a third of my grandparent's house, whom I live with now. She won't pay me any alimony when I file for it, but her and aunts are sure to sell this house fast after grandparents die. If I filed for the money I would get a share from this.

Dad has been talking recently about selling his old apartment and giving me around 25k from the sale, he never talks about it, but I'm pretty sure he knows I could fuck him over for this money, even though he's not in touch with mail. Oh and we talk now because he has a wife and a kid and he has to show her what a great father he was to me.

So to sum it up, if I stick with my guns, I'm bound to get some sort of 'settlement' money from my parents for being bags of shit. Am I some kind of a psycho, because I feel like this isn't nearly enough?",10Sep2018,1

410,"Let me elaborate. 

I am American. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California. In fact, I am the only American in my family. My entire family, even my brother who is extremely Americanized, is from the Dominican Republic. 

My Spanish is absolute crap. Today in AP Spanish we had to read what we wrote about a certain topic and literally not a single soul understood me (everybody in that class are native Spanish speakers). My parents speak to my in Spanish all the time, but since I obviously live in an English speaking country, my Spanish never excelled as great as my mom wanted to it to. 

When I visit the Dominican Republic, I feel like the outsider I am. 

When somebody asks me if I'm hispanic or latino in the United States, I answer yes and just hope the conversation ends there. I try to not hide my Dominican roots because here in the United States, you are the same ethnicity as your parents. And to be frank, I hate that it's that way because if I'm going to be honest, as much as I wish I could hold the Dominican flag with pride, I am not from there. I wasn't even at least born over there to call it my birthplace. 

I feel that no matter how much Spanish I learn or how much I learn about the Dominican republic, I'm not Dominican (by ethnicity). It doesn't help that my mom always pressures me to translate in my crappy ass Spanish when she acknowledges I'm American. 

I'm so embarrassed by this. I don't want people to ask me where my parents are from and question why is my Spanish so crappy. I just wish my life wasn't like this. I know I can just learn Spanish, but like I said, I'll never be the same as somebody who was born and raised in the Dominican Republic. That is what I realised today when nobody in class understood wtf I was saying. 

I honestly don't know what I'm asking at this point. I really wanted a place to release all this frustration. Should I just erase all this Dominican bullshit and continue being a White American? Lie where my parents and family are from? ",10Sep2018,1

Professionally, I have a resume that lists all my skills/job experience.  I objectively have these skills and jobs, and anyone who knows me would vouch for that.  But if someone who didn't know me asked if I could do anything I have listed on my skill set, I would be hesitant to say yes; I lack the confidence to say I could.  This is really messing with me in terms of the job search, as I stop myself from applying anywhere cause I'm afraid of the embarrassment of walking into an interview and feeling like an idiot over what should be entry level positions, mind you.

I went to school for Computer Science, but one of the things I thought about after I graduated was teaching Comp Sci instead of working in the field.  I've taught as a Teacher's Assistant, Technology camps, and school programs so I was excited to see if this was something I could actually do.  Phone calls to my state's education department find information were responded with laughter and I should already know these things (even though I didn't go for education in the first place and am just confused by their website's format).  Was a real punch in the gut to something I actually got inspired to do.

Personally, I'm having trouble keeping productive hobbies because I get stuck in a loop between ""You're not doing enough"" and ""Your expectations for yourself are too high, slow down.""  I'm reminded of that famous reddit post of ""No more zero days"".  But when I try I get mad at myself for not doing more and then I get mad at myself for not pushing myself more.  I minored in Game Design/Programming as it was always a fun hobby of mine.  I used to make all kinds of stuff when I was younger and after I graduated I wanted to make a portfolio.  But now I can't even write or design anything without getting frustrated and giving up, even though I understand that I objectively cannot fully design and create something by myself overnight.

I do have some skeletons that I want with all  my heart to not tell her or anyone. I think telling her would make me suicidal if she knew how awful it was.
However some people know a little, and I don’t want them to tell her.

I had a relationship with an older guy when I was 14 and not long after that I suffered a sexual assault by a gay man after a night out. This wasn’t my fault and it was pretty brutal. I went to hospital but didn’t say the full extent. No one asked if it was sexual.

In my 20s, I was confused and had a friend and we lived together and sometimes we slept in the same bed. There was some kissing. It was bordering on a relationship. 

Then my parents found out. I was mortified and denied it. I had Christian conversion therapy. Then I moved away and met my fiancée.

We were together and I didn’t cheat or think of me at all. Then I did. 

I met a guy off an app for watching tv and a handjob. Then I let him suck me off and we watched gay porn together. Then I did it again with another guy and then another.

Now I’m so scared she will leave me if she finds out anything. She means the world to me but I messed up. I want to get married but I don’t want the burden of this.

I can’t leave her and be with men ever, I’m so grossed out by the idea and gay men. I can’t barely speak to them. I have therapy so I’m telling someone all of this, but the therapist doesn’t tell me what to do, she tells me to make my own mind up. So I don’tk ow what to do.",10Sep2018,4

424,"For a month or two, I’ve decided to move back to my home country. I’ve told my family and they’re not that supportive about it because they think I will do much worse over there since it’s classed as a 3rd world country. It’s starting to bum me out. 

To clarify, I’ve decided to move because I currently do not have responsibilities or children and I though that since I have nothing to lose, why shouldn’t I travel back to the country I was born in and live out some experiences while I can. I’m still 22, I want adventure and more experiences. I’m not going to do this blindly. I know I will struggle a lot over there, that’s not something I don’t acknowledge.  

But now that I’ve told my uncle (he’s come to visit) about my decision, he has also agreed that it would not be a good idea since I’m so reliant on technology etc and my mum thinks that if I go forward with this then there isn’t a chance for me to get a bigger loan in the future or get a mortgage..

427,"My dad seems to have trouble with trying stop talking whenever he gets into a conversation or argument with someone. For example, whenever my dad and I start an argument, he will immediately get very loud and start yelling. He doesn't let me speak whenever he does this, so I would have to try to yell over him to get my point across. Then after a while, he goes from talking about the argument to talking about something unrelated. This didn't just happen in one specific argument, this happens all the time in every argument we have. Another example of him not being able to shut his mouth is when we meet someone new or a family member. Whenever this happens, he excitedly starts saying embarrassing things about me, things most parents would be hesitant to say about their own children. Other minor examples of him being talkative are when he unnecessarily adds his own commentary when listening to someone or when needing help, such as asking for directions when he can just use google maps. I need help getting him to stop unnecessarily saying things when he doesn't have to. Just to let you people know, having a civil conversation about this matter with him will probably just end up with him talking over me. ",10Sep2018,0

I’m in my late teens.. that’s a little bit later than when most people get confirmed (I’ve moved house/town a lot in the last few years, that’s why I haven’t had it yet)

From the age of about 12 (when I started going to a Catholic school) I knew that Catholicism was NOT what I believed in.. it just doesn’t resonate with me. No matter how hard I’ve tried, I haven’t been able to convince myself to be a “true catholic”.

I’m pantheist. I don’t believe in a supernatural God, as “he”’s described as in the Bible. I believe that God is pretty much nature, the universe an everything. God doesn’t really “exist” in the typical way. It’s just science an nature, but beautiful. 


My parents as forcing me to get confirmed. I feel like that’s wrong.. for me to say things, to agree with things that I don’t believe in, in front of a church, in front of believers. 

I know it’s what my dad wants. But I don’t feel like I can do it. I don’t want to do it..  I am not catholic.

I don't think it's shyness either, I can be quite a confident bold person...but around people I don't know well I just turn into a slab of marble, I can't talk to people or connect at all and struggle to loosen up to have any fun. Some of my struggles may be due to insecurities perhaps, I'm not in paid work right now, have no fiends, and struggle to find hobbies so I worry people won't want to talk to me.  


I am autistic but I'm sure I didn't used to be this bad, and even other autistic people seem to do better than me when it comes to making friends. I love people and I desperately want friends as I'm so much happier around other people but...I just...can't. I don't even know how to fully explain it, it's like the words don't come out or just I don't know how to connect to people to involve myself in a conversation with them. I find it worse chatting online - I think online anxiety does come into it because it's so focused one-to-one - I've never been able to form online friendships, but I'm not great IRL either.   


It's so rare I meet someone I can comfortably talk to, it's a one in a million thing but unfortunately just because I'm comfortable talking to someone doesn't guarantee they'll hang around - eg. the last person I connected with was my ex, I connected with him more than anyone I'd done before, easy to chat all day via messenger and hang out in person.   


Perhaps the more important question is how do I fix it?

449,"I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD a few years ago; I am 24 years old now. Since I was 16, i have been on and off anti depressants. The anti depressants always made my symptoms worse. I have been on a couple non-stimulant medications. They don't seem to help much. I am tired of seeking help. It's so mentally draining. 

When I was younger, I was diagnosed with clinical depression. I started taking pristiq around the age of 16 after I dropped out of high school(at 15). Not much change with my mental state so my dosage was upped. After the doctor raised my dosage, my emotions kinda flat lined; I didn't really feel anything. I hated it, so I just stopped taking my medication.

Fast forward about five years. I am in my second year of college. I have finished all my basic work and have started degree related work. I am stressed out all the time. My procrastination was chronic. When I got frustrated, I would just shut down. It was happening a lot. I was drinking exessively trying to cope with the stress. My grades were in decline. One night I rashly make the decision to sleep with my friend's girlfriend of two years(much regret). I get arrested for public intoxication a couple weeks later walking home. My drinking gets worse and I plummet into the depression spiral. Start taking Fetzima. Doesn't really help.I did a lot of crying during this time.

Classes get harder and require more studying and attention. I would day dream through an entire class then realize I forgot to take notes; all I was left with were a few doodles. The school got involved with my public intoxication charge. I had to start seeing a therapist through the school. Stress out more. Drink more to try to cope. Frustrated to no end with the school and the legal system. I shut down. Continue to drink my way out of school around the middle of my junior year. I slowly stopped doing homework and eventually wasn't making it to my classes. I dropped out. I wasn't in school and I didn't have a job. I felt pretty worthless. I felt I was letting my family down. I ended up getting a job at big retail store for around 5 months. I hated it so I quit. Well kinda, I just stopped going. 

About two months go by, I decided to seek medical help again. I was having trouble organizing everything from my priorities and my apartment to my relationships. I was referred to a psychiatrist(I forgot to mention I have trouble with anxiety as well). I was scrapping by with the little money I had left from the previous job and what I had to borrow from my parents (I don't know where I would be with out them). I knew psychiatrist were expensive and I was hesitant to meet with him; insurance wouldn't cover it. I anxiously went to meet him(at this point I had seen multiple therapists from  the repercussions of my PI). I told him I felt directionless, that every task seemed like an insurmountable wall, and I didn't know what to do anymore. He suggested that my depression and anxiety stem from untreated inattentive ADHD. I express that I am reluctant to take any stimulant medication(addiction runs in my mom's side of the family). He puts me on Strattera.

Next few months are pretty good. The Strattera starts to take effect. I started working two jobs and I was feeling good about myself. The fog in my head had cleared up some. Enough for me to get my priorities some what organized and find two jobs. A few weeks pass and my libido is almost non existent and I am having trouble peeing (also made my mouth dry). I looked up the side effects of Strattera. Sure enough, I was soon reading about what I was experiencing. I stopped taking my medication soon after. I didn't go back to the doctor. I just stopped. 

3 months of being unmedicated. I was doing alright. All my signs of ADHD had returned, but I was past the difficult part of actually finding a job.   I didn't know what I was going to do beyond those jobs, but I was making it alright. I was working as a delivery driver during the day and as a bouncer at a bar during the night. Neither job required a lot of focus so I was content.( I have never held a job more than six months). 

November rolls around. BOOM! Ruptured disk in my back. Puts me out for a good three months after surgery. Don't go back to my bouncing job because I was scared to lift heavy stuff. Continue to work as a delivery driver till the end of May. Decided to move states because I felt stuck and had no direction. 

Back to square one. I've been here for 3 months. I have no direction. I feel like a let down. I went to see a doctor and she put me on Bupropion. She told me she didn't want to put me on a stimulant because of the risk of addiction.  I am a little over four weeks in. The medication has reduced some of my anxiety, but as far as my ADHD symptoms go I can't really tell a difference. I need something to work. I am scrapping by again and don't know what to do. I went in for a follow up today and told her my ADHD symptoms have been unaffected. She recommend I see a therapist and I told her I couldn't afford one.  I asked about a stimulant and got the same response. I was so frustrated. I just shut down again. Feels like I am spending what little money I have on pointlesa treatment. I didn't say another word afterwards. Just gave her nods. She upped my dosage for the Bupropion. I cried in my car right after because I just feel like I have been grasping at air for so long. I just want my brain to be normal. I just want help and help seems so unattainable. I am exhausted mentally. I have been crying a lot. I am just so frustrated with everything. I don't know what to do.

2. I am from Argentina, but I lived here in the States for about 20 years. (hint) How I write is how I speak, so ESL is very scary for me and I feel incompetent. (BTW I’m a US Citizen)

3. I feel that I will be an old man surrounded by kids, and I will feel very uncomfortable and quit.

4. I feel that I will not understand any of it or it will be extremely difficult, and I will feel suffocated and quit.

5. I’ve been told that I am smart, even my manager said to me a few times that I know how to connect things, troubleshoot and make thinks work when others at work will take longer. (Compliment or True?) I don’t feel smart and I am insecure… sometimes.

6. I have a considerable stable job and pays well, so far. Someone hire up in my organization said that if I get a higher education, then I can get a promotion and get more money, even to pay up the school loan. That offer was 3 years ago…

7. I’m planning to stay at my job for another 10 years to complete my 20 years to retire with F.B. Then I will have to find something else to do.

8. I was considering on being immigration or tax attorney and working another 15 years. In this economy to retire at 63/65 it won’t be easy.

456,"So some background info: We met as freshmen in high school and started as friends then I developed a huge crush on her. Like I might've loved her kinda crush. So I told her, she had a bf, she turned me down, and we somehow stayed close friends for the rest of the year. Then sophomore year she moved and since then we haven't talked a lot. 

We're seniors now and idk I feel like I have to tell her what she's meant to me because I never really told her everything and I guess I need closure. There were always rumors every year that she might come back so I always kinda just waited for her in case she did come back? And now it's at the point where I think we're too drifted apart and we're on our seperate ways. Like I said we don't talk a lot, maybe 3 real conversations in the last 2 years since she moved. I'm not saying that this conversation is going to be our last one but I feel like it's going to be and if it is I want her to know everything that I have to tell her.

I'm already planning on saying that I'm glad we were friends and that I'm grateful for everything, especially how she treated me after I confessed cause it could've been so awkward or weird and she always just treated me like a friend and we had great times together. I also want to tell her that I'm happy I fell for her and that she was a special crush.

The advice I need is: Is this even a good idea? What should I say to start the conversation? What are some things I shouldn't say? What are some warning signs that she feels uncomfortable or doesn't want to talk about this/to me? Should I tell her about why I liked her and special memories I have of her crushwise or is that doing too much?

Back ground info: i met this girl in 9th grade(currently third year at uni) We became friends almost instantly and really hit off( Friends asked me if we were going out alot because of how we acted around eachother) Never took it far because she had a boyfriend who she broke up with 5 months after transfering to my school. For a couple months i was afraid to mention it or make a move becuase i enjoyed her firendship and she really made me be a lot happier.

Then a year passes my friend group grew exponentially through being friends with her as i realized i had absolutely nothing in common with the people i was hanging out with before. By the this point i had completely fallen for her and was and still am good friends with everyone eventhough the group split due to an incident i wont get in to between two of the people in it.

Still in highschool The girl well call her N invited us one weekend to her house for a sleep over. We ended up being only 5 people and 3 of us slept on the floor and N slept on the bed with a friend well call R.

That monday i texted another friend call yo do you know if N and R are going out? He tells me no. I got really happy and texted another friend to help me ask her out cuz i was really into her he agrees and says we can talk about it in person the next day and i accept. This is where it starts going downhill. N texts me that same night and tells me shes been meaning to tell me something but kept forgetting everytime we saw eachother(wasnt BS she forgets a lot of shit) and tells me she and R have been going out for almost a year at that point but not to tell anyone because even within our friendgroup including me only 4 people knew(which was true). That day i went downhill and ended up falling into depression again for which i had been medicated before but this time i said nothing and got no treatment because i hated the experience i had before. Well in short the crush and depression still remain and i can have happy days but it all comes back eventually. I was talking with one of my close friends the other night who knows about my situation and told him i was thinking of just burning the bridge with her for my peace of mind. Problem is shes still with R and hes part of the group that stayed after the incident and i dont want to cause another fallout but i think i need to do this to finally get this huge weight off of my chest and feel free and happy again.

My question basically is should i do it? and how do you think R will respond when N tells him whats going on. i want to know what to expect.

TL;DR Ive been obsessed for 5 years with a woman ill never be able to have who is going out with a friend of mine and want to end all contact with her for my peace of mind. I do plan on doing this and talking to her in person with just her, But i want to know what fallout to expect before i actually do it.",10Sep2018,0

I currently work with two other members, each from a different school, and they both have gaming programs up and running, but this linkup is planned to hit way more schools and clubs.

Essentially, we had a meeting recently and we discussed our priorities, one of which was to recruit other schools with gaming programs. No biggie, I googled all the local high schools, checked from a gaming club, and messaged the moderators. 

I got a response from one of the people I emailed and they basically asked how our group functioned, and basically assumed it was fully running(my email was pretty official sounding after a bunch of revisions). And asked about dates and times we compete. 

Issue is, we haven’t actually competed except for a couple unofficial online scrims and a smash tournament planned for later this year.

What do I tell the guy? I really want him and his school to join because more schools makes our plug to my school carry more weight, but I’m not sure if he’ll join if I say we aren’t functioning.

462,"  LONG POST

CONTEXT: My maternal grandfather (70-something, struggles to walk but still can, I’d say about 15% mentally senile) usually lives with his son, but he’s been staying at our house for a week. I’m the youngest child in our household, and I’m respectful to him, unlike my two older brothers who rip into him any time they are annoyed with him. I want your advice on how I should feel about my grandfather, or how I should treat him. 
This is a very long post, and I’m sorry. My emotions are running at their highest point right now. 

•••••

What I saw:
1.) My mom has a specific bag in her closet that has about $1000 in cash as backup. I didn’t know anyone knew about this besides my brothers, my dad and I - until I came home from school quietly, and walked into my closet to find my grandpa pocketing money from the bag when he thought nobody was home. 
2.) I was in my parents’ room today. He didn’t see me, and I found him going through a box my dad keeps money in as well. 

•••••


What I did: 
Situation 1: I didn’t want to be rude. I asked him “What’s in your pocket?” When he realized I was behind him. He remained adamant that there was just a tissue in his pocket. I let it go, and privately told my parents. My mom always defends him, so she says nothing is missing, and my dad believes her. This was a week ago, and today he confessed to me that he took $50, when I told him “I’m going to ask you something, and I won’t say anything to you or tell on you, but what did you take from my mom’s purse?” He apologized to me, and said he won’t do it again. This really tugged on my foolish heart strings. 

Situation 2: I asked him “Are you looking for money?” politely. He says yes. I say “That’s my dad’s money. You’re taking it out when you know my parents aren’t home, and I think what you’re doing is wrong. Why are you doing this?” and he responds “I needed it.” He quietly walks away empty-handed, and I feel like an asshole. 

•••••

Why this hurts me: 
1.) He used to be an alcoholic. I tried not to blame him, because he’s not westernized and my Indian family is very traditional so they never thought to pursue therapy or anything for him, thinking that if he devoted himself to God or being a good person he’ll be okay. Well, my dad paid $10,000 on behalf of my grandpa’s credit card activities that my grandpa’s son had opened for him. 
2.) My grandpa was abusive in his past with my grandmother and my mom, but when I ask her about this, she tells me he was a good person unless he drank. She forgives him for this, and I’m conflicted.

My mom constantly protects him, but I don’t feel like he was a good father to her at all. Of course I can’t say that, because I wasn’t raised by him. When he was drunk and lived in India (this was over three/four decades ago), he slapped my grandmother so hard that her ear began bleeding (although her six brothers tracked him down and beat him up lol). Another time, my mom was trying to protect her younger brother from him, and got in the way - and by accident, my grandpa broke her arm. She was a little kid at the time. 

How the hell are they going to pile these stories on me, and then tell me to be respectful and loving to him?  I can’t do it anymore. ",10Sep2018,1

467,"I've had an extraordinarily difficult life overcoming hellish situations overseas. I was also seriously injured in the military which required nearly 10 years of treatment, surgeries, rehabilitation, and physical therapy. I couldn't walk or get around easily so I spent most of my time in hospitals, doctors offices, or my home. Lost pretty much all of my friends and contact with the world. My prison cell was the hospital room and my body for that decade of my life. 

It's been a very long and difficult journey but my hard work has paid off in getting my life/health back on track. I've since gone back to college and I'm doing great academically and have done pretty well networking and making professional contacts. Yet I'm still really struggling with making any personal and meaningful friendships. 

I've worked on following general advice like listening skills, exploring hobbies, meetup.com, volunteering, etc. However, it's not really addressing my issue of feeling like I have very little to offer in social situations. I'm a pretty good listener and can incorporate it into my conversation but the biggest roadblock is knowing what and when it's appropriate to share about myself or my difficult past. I just feel like I bring little to conversations and have very little to talk about because of my odd situation. 

Having dealt with so much it's made me a bit numb and judgmental about other people. Possibly as a defense mechanism to shield me from being hurt again. I know it's something I have to do to break my isolation and I know that eventually I will be hurt again no matter what I do. I feel so frustrated, not being able to help myself and repeating the same mistakes despite everything I've done. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my rant, any advice or even your own story to let me know I'm not alone would be much appreciated.

469,"This might make me sound like an asshole, but I’ve been friends with her (I’ll call her A) since freshman year (we’re both 16f and juniors in high school) and I love her, but I’m just not feeling our friendship as much anymore. I feel like I’ve grown into a different person than who I was two years ago and a lot of the things she says/does just really bother me. I try to just be quiet about it because I don’t have a right to be rude to her just because some of the things she does pisses me off. I want to stay friends with her but I also want to distance myself more. I just don’t think it’s working very well. I asked one of my other best friends to hang out today, and she immediately invited A too. I just wanted to hang out with her alone. I feel like we bicker too much and just clash on a lot of perspectives about things (I’m pretty chill and she gets super annoyed and upset about little things and she can be a jerk depending on the mood she’s in, she makes fun of me for things I like, etc) and I just feel like we don’t have much in common anymore. I want to meet new people and have friends I can relate to more, but I don’t know how to distance myself without hurting her feelings. I still want her to be happy and stay pretty good friends with her, just some distance. I mentioned today that I’m doing a month-long summer program that I’m super excited about, and she said “I kind of want to do that too.” My heart sunk. One of the reasons I really want to do it is because i want to meet new people, and her being there might be an issue because she would stick with me the whole time, and I want to make friends as just myself, not with her, I hold back around her. She also comes off as very abrasive so I feel like if she was with me it would be harder to get close to people. I know I can’t stop her from going because if she wants to do it, she should be able to, I don’t have a right to say I don’t want her there, but it really makes me feel horrible that something I was so excited about finally doing alone might be messed up.

472,"Hi all, I'm new to Reddit and could really use some help- this community seems like a good place to start.

Basically I am a sophomore in college who is struggling to get by. I went through some serious depression and anxiety last fall/winter and was able to get through it with the help and support of doctors/family. It seemed like I had broken through in my spring semester when I returned to school. I was hitting on all cylinders- I had friends, enjoyed my classes, was going out on weekends and even met a few girls (although I think that was my ultimate undoing). This amazing high lasted for all of a month because one girl in particular I became a bit attached to although I told myself (and even her) that I did not want a relationship, and for good reason (she was still hung up on her ex and seemed emotionally immature). After that we still hung out but I was being super selfish and was really only interested in hooking up. I also made it seem like I didn't care what she did because I was trying to act like some hotshot who could get with girls no problem. I fed into this belief and got carried away- I started following hundreds of people from my school, who I didn't even know, on instagram and was posting nonstop on my snap story (I think it was to try and impress others or make it seem like I was this super cool, popular guy). I was pretending to be someone I wasn't but I didn't realize this at the time... I made it to the summer and still kept in contact with this girl although I made things kind of worse between us and now let's just say things aren't good...

&amp;#x200B;

I got back to school and joined a fraternity in the hopes of meeting other people. This has not gone so well since my mind has been on this girl and I have slowly, but surely, slipped back into my depressive episodes. I can't talk with others, I feel like I have ZERO personality and nothing funny to say/ contribute to conversations. I'm actually dropping because I can't cope with all the social obligations (mixers/parties, even though I really wish I could) and feeling like I simply can't talk with my fellow pledges and fraternity 'brothers'- they view me as this distant/boring guy. It got so bad last Friday that I had to leave after 45 minutes because I was having such an intense panic attack with everything that was going on (I was also very high which probably didn't help me much). Oh, and on top of all that, this girl ended up joining a sorority and is having a fantastic time with all her new 'sisters' and is now seeing a new guy who also happens to be in one of my classes! I just don't know how I'm suppose to cope and function with all of this. I've built up this persona of being this super fun and smart guy that's popular and has a bunch of friends/ gets with girls but now it's clear just how little of that I actually am. I don't know how I'm suppose to manage through this semester with limited friends and practically no social life..

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be extreme to just transfer out to another school? I really feel as though I have burnt so many bridges here with multiple friend groups (guys and girls). There's a lot I have left out but the bottom line is that I feel like a major fraud who's now being exposed as a narcissistic loser and I can't carry on this way... I would do anything to go back and change my actions to remain more lowkey and not let myself get carried away. I have had so many thoughts about quitting college altogether, running off to another country, and just other horrible thoughts that have crossed my mind that I never thought I'd experience again

&amp;#x200B;

I know that nobody is going to have an obvious solution to my situation, but what I'm going through truly seems insurmountable and it feels like there is no way out

474,"So, one of my girlfriends childhood friends (since grade 5 ) must have gotten her password somewhere along the way, however it's been changed a multitude of times. Anyway, she's had to of guessed the password as she has told other parties that she has been accessing the account and reading extremely personal information about not only my girlfriend but other people as well. We are talking EXTREMELY SENSITIVE life ruining shit people have confided in her. (not me thankfully haha) Anyway, facebook login history isn't giving any obscure ip addresses, anybody know if the login/logout ip address history is editable in that sense? Could she have been accessing the account and covering her tracks? Instagram provides no ip address for accounts.
So basically at this point the only evidence she has to prove it is her are the accounts of other people AND that those people and the accused have access to information provided to my girlfriend that they otherwise would have ABSOLUTELY no idea of getting.

My girlfriend is absolutely shaken by this, this was someone she has trusted since they were children. Does anybody have suggestions on the best course of action here? She wants to make it known in a facebook post that she has been accessing her conversations with multiple (who knows how many ) people, that she knows for sure. 

She has no idea why she would be accessing her account, ultimately it doesn't matter.

Firstly, when I uploaded a new profile picture to Facebook last week, he messaged me saying the picture was ""shit quality, if only you had my camera skills"". This was completely unsolicited. 

Earlier today I sent him a picture of my beard progress. Again, pure negativity straight away - ""that's a God awful picture"". For some reason I decided to ask him why he thought it was God awful, and he said my haircut and expression was bad, etc.

Typing this out, it sounds super petty. However, I can't help but think all of my other friends would respond to these situations with positivity/support, as I would for them.

I'm not sure whether to put these acts of negativity down to ""constructive criticism"" that I should be grateful for, or simply unacceptable behaviour that I need to confront.

478,"So im a high school student and i was hoping to get into an enrichment class, however last year (where I attended a different school in the same school district) i didnt meet the mark requirements for that subject.

I then talked to a “student administrator” about switching to the enrichment class, he asked what my marks were the year before and i said I didn’t exactly remember but i believed the overall average was high enough. 
He told me to check my report cards and send an email to him with my marks, so i sent an email saying my overall average in the class was 89 (i knew it was much lower). 

I should put in here that i didnt blatantly lie without thinking about it, some friends whove been at my school longer than me said that in this situation teachers couldn’t or didnt care enough to, check prior marks. Plus I thought that if he intended to check he wouldnt ask, i was wrong.

He replied writing that he checked the system and saw that my overall overage for that class that year was not 89, but 64, saying it was strange and asked if that was a mistake.

Im worried that if i stick by my lie, hell ask to see my report cards or contact my former teacher, however i dont think coming clean would end too well for me either.

482,"Advice Needed: Has anyone ever experienced parent alienation, reconnected with the parent, and the parent was dying of cancer? How did you deal with it? I could really use someone to talk to who has been through this before.

Story/Situation:
I am the youngest of 3 and grew up in a dysfunctional, abusive, single-parent household. My parents divorced when I was 1 and my mom was granted full custody. 

Growing up, I was constantly told horror stories about my dad: how he used to beat the shit out of my mom and siblings, how he never paid child support, he did not love us, how he wanted to kill us, he wanted nothing to do with us, etc. I spent the better part of my childhood in fear of this man. 

In November 2017, a cousin on my dad's side found me on Facebook and told me he was dying of lung cancer. I ended up going to meet my dad to get some answers, and long story short, my mom lied. I later found out there is a name for the whole thing: parent alienation.

My dad was diagnosed with lung cancer in November 2016 and had a stroke in January 2017. He never really recovered from the stroke, so he has a hard time with speech functions and movement (he is in a wheelchair most of the time). Because of this, I never really got to meet the real version of my dad. 

I started visiting my dad every week. His cancer spread, but then at a certain point, it started to respond to treatment, then just kind of remain stable. Fastforward to now- My dad just finished another round of chemo, and my grandma said the doctor might not continue on with more treatment. We will know officially at the end of the month.

[I should also add in the mix, a lot of stuff happened over the past 10 years which led me to stop talking to my mom and 2 siblings until they can respect my boundaries (i.e. they are abusive, toxic people.)] 

I feel like I am going through this alone. My husband is by my side and tells me he is going through this with me.

The apartment comes with kitchen, living room, bathroom, etc. However, I’m having a hard time accept hair being left in the showers, crumbs and dirt on the floors, dishes piling up, their crap being left everywhere, even a bottle of acetone on the kitchen counter, empty bottles or foods or crumbs and bits of foods left on the counters and tables, art supplies and papers and personal stuff disarray in the living room, dirty stove, garbage piling up, etc. I had cleaned the entire apartment two weeks ago and less than a day later it went right back to being disgusting. Idk how to handle living like this; I’m not saying I’m too good or all that but I come from a clean home and I like maintaining a clean space. The RA have already met with us all and there was a signed agreement to maintain a clean space and everyone is supposed to pick up after themselves. Am I being too picky??

489,"Hello everyone. I’m 21 years old, and it’s been a week since I left my parents home to live alone.

When I still lived at my parents house, I loved to be left alone in my room, minding my own business. It was my little bubble of comfort.
But during this last year, my little sister had friends over at the house almost everyday. My little comfort was shaken up, and I grew to be very very tired of this situation.

I then had the idea to live alone. I could have a place for myself, where nobody would bother me. It would even be closer to the school. Perfect right ?

Wells the reality is not that pretty.
I, who wanted to be alone, now cries every night, feeling lonely, missing my parents, my room, my dog, pretty much everything. 
I manage to entertain myself well enough, but when the sun set, this overwhelming feeling comes in. « What have I done ? » « I want to go back » « I miss it so much ».

This is a really painful feeling. I want to feel at ease in this appartment. It is beautiful, and my parents and I were so invested in it during the summer, decorating it, buying furnitures, I received gifts from a lot of family members...

And after only living a week in it, I feel so bad at night. Crying even though I had not cried for years before that.

I feel so guilty. After all the time, money, and effort my parents invested in this appartment, I can’t manage to live in it ? And the stress of my studies is now mixed with all of this...

I’m a bit lost and I don’t know what to do.",10Sep2018,4
490,"My best friend \[39M\] and I \[21F\] have been fighting a lot lately, as the title says, and I'm really not sure what I should do anymore. We have known each other since February, 2014 and though there's a relatively large age gap between us, it's never been an issue for us (without personally knowing us, it does seem weird, but we work really well, in general as friends). He's been a very important person in my life, as when we first met at my local public access TV station, I was a very closeted lesbian and he was the first person I came out to. He walked me through all of my confusion and we texted back and forth a lot during this time. Because my dad didn't know I was gay or that any of these texting conversations were going on, I kept the friendship mostly under wraps (he knew my friend but didn't know how close we were). I came out to my BFF in December 2015, and we chatted for a LONG time - a loooooong time - about my feelings and such. We don't get together very often and we mostly just communicate via text messages or Google Hangouts. As introverts, it works pretty well for us. However, there are days where he just seems to wake up on the wrong side of the bed or something. Part of it stems from his strong gut feelings he has, which he calls ""the 'dar"" (short for radar). The first feeling he had was that I had been hurt by a man in my youth, or that I had somehow been abused. 

I have stated numerous times that that has never happened, and yet he refuses to hear it. Of course, this annoys me because a) he isn't listening and b) it's an annoying lesbian stereotype. We've argued over this one multiple times, and every time, he says that the 'dar is never wrong...but it is. The reason he thinks it is because of how socially awkward I am. His other close friend was sexually abused by her uncle in her youth, so I'm guessing he might just see similarities between she and I? I'm really not sure. He promised me he would drop the subject on our last bout of it a month and a half or so ago, but we'll see if he brings it back up. There have been other times where he makes assumptions without knowing the whole story. It's like he is solving puzzles that he doesn't have the pieces to to solve. It's just wrong, and he won't listen because he trusts his gut feelings so hard. Today, he got on me for how recently, I've not been as active on texting or that I only give him quick responses, claiming that he's noticed I've been mopey/depressed. I've stated repeatedly that I have had a very busy summer and I was not down, like he thought I was. I've just not had time. He got totally frustrated with me today over that, again acting like he knew more about me than I do (one of my pet peeves about people). I don't know how to handle the situation. I do not want to end my friendship with him, so I am looking for ways to respond to this properly.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has had a friend with a similar personality type, please help me out here. I just want to know how to respond to him properly when he is like this so that I don't make the situation worse. Thank you for your advice.",10Sep2018,1
491,"Sorry its so long. TL;DR at the bottom :P


To start this off, I [20] rushed into a relationship with a woman [22] who just had her husband [21] cheat on her.
I moved 300 miles to be with her and once I got there she panicked. It was EXTREMELY back and forth the whole time. When it was good, it was the best time of my life, and the happiest I've ever been. And see myself being in the future. 
And when it was bad, it was fucking horrible. She would constantly talk to her husband who was trying to get her back, tell him she loved him. Then lie to me about even talk to me about it. He treated her like shit for months and is an all around pretty garbage person. She always says hes not that bad, and constantly says she's sorry for him. (Because he gets a lot of heat for cheating on her) she writes everything he does off as him being stupid.
I have anxiety and I got to the point of having night terrors on a consistent basis. Waking up drenched in sweat. Its horrible.

After 8 months she says she needs time alone to figure herself out. So I move BACK 300 miles to a place I hate, to give it to her. 

The issue is, I want to be with her more than anything. She says she misses me, and I can barely handle life without her. We both agree there is a special connection and I just dont want to start a life where I am now, with her not in it. So what do I do? 
I don't know if she will want a life with me in it and If she doesn't, I already gave her my everything for 8 months waiting for it to get better, and it didn't. That time was not a waste because in that time we created thousands of memories I could never replace.. But now because of the distance that's not a factor, and im just getting more and more depressed. 

Like I said I already gave 8 months, I can't see myself giving her more than like 3 more months to make up her mind or whether or not she wants to be with me. Should I just let go and move on? Even though the thought of it tears me to peices.
We did agree to meet on the 25th of this month to talk about things. But that only gives her 2 weeks alone. Ive tried honestly way to hard so far should I not talk to her for a while so she knows im serious and gets to see what life would be without me? How do I cope if I do that and she realizes it would be easy to let go of me?

TL;DR: She needs time apart but I've already given 8 months of my best to her. Should I hold on? Or should I move on? We agreed to meet on the 25th of September, should I wait until then for a desicion?",10Sep2018,1

Maybe I repulse women around me, maybe I'm just too immature for a relationship right now.

I've tried to make peace with myself. I've tried to love myself, but for some reason it's been really hard and I always end up hating myself again. I've read books, watched YouTube videos, nothing.

494,"Hi 

im 22 yrs old female from the Middle East. I come from a conservative country and since my home town had really bad colleges and the education system in the entire country is ranked among the lowest world wide I decided to save and study abroad and just try make something out of my self.

now its get bit complicated 

I have 2 options to save money stay in the same small city (less job opportunities) but have a decent room 

or go to a the bigger city with tons of things to do and work but literally (crash on a relative couch for almost 7-8 months) ill make good money and I can save up but I won't even have a room. ill have to spend my entire day out and just come back to sleep , bath and eat some meals with them. 

I was always swinging between being an introvert and an extravert , I don't know if I can manage picking up 2 jobs and being out all day for 7-8 months before moving in to another place. at the same time I know this option will guarantee me money and experience and living in a big city is filled with opportunities.

I usually park in the same spot at work every day. Today someone else parked in my ""usual"" spot so I parked somewhere else. The spots are smaller and it's harder to get in/out so I usually avoid this area. As I was backing out, I misjudged the distance between my rear bumper and the tailgate of the truck directly behind me. I bumped into the truck and immediately started panicking.

&amp;#x200B;

I got out of my car and looked at the truck to see if there was any damage. There was a very small dent (maybe dime sized? Maybe smaller) in the very middle of the truck's rear bumper. As far as I could tell my car was fine. Someone hit the side of my car in this same garage about a month ago and didn't leave any kind of note, which really pissed me off. I knew the right thing to do was to leave a note, which I did - I took my business card (which has ALL my work info as well as personal cell phone number) and was prepared to confess what I had done. I don't know what came over me, but instead of saying ""I hit your car, contact me"" I lied and said ""I saw someone hit your car, please contact me for info.""

I get about 5+ spam phone calls a day so it's possible it was another one of those, I don't know. This person has my work address and suite number and I just know he/she is going to come visit me at work tomorrow. What do I say? ""Hi, the truth is I am the person who hit your truck and I was panicking when I left that note. Here's my insurance info, please forgiving me for being a pathetic idiotic liar"" ?

So I just started my Junior year of high school, and as the title says I just moved to a new school. A school that is *six times bigger* than my last one (300:1800). Before I moved I thought making friends wouldn't be too hard of a task, but it's been almost two weeks and it seems like more of a chore to put myself out there. I've made plenty of female friends and those are fine, but I'm having trouble making more guy friends. I don't know if I'm ""intimidated"" or what but it's just kinda awkward trying to meet new people when most of the time it seems like the people I'm meeting are into accepting new people, if that makes sense? I mean, if worse comes to worse I'll just wait till the spring starts, because all the sports I play are in the spring, and I know that's the best way to get closer to people.

503,"hey fellow redditors, 

10 months ago i had to let go of my dog due to an issue with him ""attacking"" (more like chasing after) a couple of our neighbors' cats. we wanted to give him to the humane society but couldn't due to the lack of space, so we had to surrender him to our local animal control. 

that day still plays in my memory clearly- we took him to walk on the beach (his favorite thing ever) but soon after we brought him to the animal control place to give him to the attendant, and she walked him over to a caged area with us. it was so emotionally hard to take off his collar to let him in the cage just knowing that i'd never get to see him again and i was unsure of his future, as it was a kill shelter. he wasn't a pitbull, which made his chances of getting put down quite slim, but the thought of it killed me. the sounds of his barks and desperate yelping still play over in my mind. to make it worse, as we were exiting the building, my dad just broke down. that was one of the only times i've seen him cry in my life because he loved the dog almost as much as i did.

thankfully, he did get picked up by the humane society (we saw him on the website under a new name) but one day his picture didn't show up anymore. we assume he got adopted.

me and my dog had a very special connection- we adopted him as a stray in central america back when we lived there, and brought him back to the USA with us. in total, we had him for nearly 6 years, which was more than 1/3 of my life. he was there every day for me- switching schools quite a few times, and when i didn't have many friends either or was having a rough time in school and depression. i believe also that he was the reason why i didn't go further in suicidal actions.

in short, he was the sweetest, most loving dog ever. but like everyone, he had his flaws. to this day, i still think about him frequently. after nearly a year, i still cry over him just because he was such a special part of my life.

since then, my family did get a new dog. he's alright, but is pretty much a demon. he'll bite and is just super hyper. in a fit of rage, i have mentioned to my parents that no dog could ever replace my old dog and they seemed saddened by this.

tl;dr- had to give my dog to a shelter, he was very special to me. i still carry a lot of emotional pain over this.

does anyone have any advice to help get over a dog or in trying to love a new dog?",10Sep2018,2
