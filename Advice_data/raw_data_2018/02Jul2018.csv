0,"I [20,F] have known this guy [20,M]for a couple months and we are good friends. When we’re in a group we’re always laughing, picking on each other, and just going back and forth. 

I’ve noticed him alone with other girls and he will talk to them like it’s nothing but when we’re alone he goes quiet. It’s not like he’s busy either, it’s when we’re walking or taking a taxi or just hanging out. I have to start the conversation and many times keep it going which is weird when it comes to him. TL;DR Why does he get quiet around and no one else?",02Jul2018,0
1,"I recently got a promotion at my job, effective tomorrow. I didn’t seek out the promotion, but I was really excited to receive it as this job is a stepping stone in my career. It’s a pretty small company, and I’ve always been friendly with most of my coworkers. But when my COO offered me the job, another coworker (Marie for the affect of the story) was present and congratulated me, then told me my team leader told her she was recommending me for the job to the COO a while ago, and Marie had offhandedly mentioned it to another coworker, “Jill”, and Jill scoffed and said that was a stupid idea. Marie and Jill are long time friends, Jill and I don’t talk outside work but are pretty friendly every time we work together. Jill’s been at the job about 6 months later. A few days ago, my COO publicly announced the promotion on our company scheduling site, and ever since, Jill has been pointing out every small detail I miss on our written shift reports, and during our verbal shift reports she often goes off on rants along the lines of “I told him he wasn’t gonna fool me. This is MY house, I’VE been here the longest”. I’ve ignored it lately, but with the promotion going into effect tomorrow, I will have to work with her and supervise the shift. I don’t want to come off too strong in a brand new position, but I’m getting tired of the jabs. What should I do? ",02Jul2018,7
2,"Background: I'm a 25 year old male. I could diet and exercise a bit better but I'm pretty healthy overall. No medical conditions or anything like that. I masturbate aprox 3-5 times a week, usually to porn but can do just fine without. I've read about death grip on here, and although I don't think I'm gripping super hard, it's obviously more friction than a mouth/vagina. I don't use lube or anything like that when masturbating.

A few years ago, during one of my first sexual experiences, I was making out with a girl at a party. I was very drunk, she was sober. She started making it clear that she wanted to do more than makeout. Long story short, we attempted to have sex but I was so drunk that I obviously got whiskey dick and couldn't get hard at the time. She mocked me and made fun of me for it. Haven't spoken to her since.

My issue:

Since that night, I've had pretty crippling sexual performance anxiety with every woman I've been with. I have no issue getting hard during foreplay (making out, oral sex, etc) but as soon as I go to attempt PIV sex, I go soft. Every time. It's created this cycle where rather than getting hard because I'm excited for PIV, I somehow (subconsciously) see vaginas as like an anxiety-inducing impenetrable wall, and the memory of that party and the times I've gone soft since, go right to my head.

It's crippling my sex/romantic life.

I haven't really been looking for a serious relationship over the last few years. Every woman I've been with since the time of the party has either been a hookup or a friends with benefits type situation.

About a month and a half ago, I went out with a woman and we've absolutely hit it off in every way. Physically, she's so beautiful and she turns me on so much. She's kind, smart and fun and I love spending time with her. I want this to be a long term thing and I think she does too. We spend a lot of time together and we always have an amazing time.

However, as with my last partners, her and I have lots of oral sex (which I love giving) and foreplay. All that's great and I stay rock hard the whole time. I always make sure she's satisfied and we both cum a ton every time we're with each other and have a lot of fun. We both really want to have PIV sex, but every time I attempt to go inside her, I go soft. We've attempted PIV maybe 4ish times including different positions and each time it's the same. I go soft, revert back to oral/foreplay and get hard again, then again when we try PIV...soft.

It's beyond frustrating. With my recent more casual partners, I've honestly just brushed it off and not cared as much. But with her it's different. We both want to have PIV sex so badly and I want nothing more than to pleasure her more and get closer to her than I already have. She's been kind and understanding about it every time and I make it clear to her that I find her extremely attractive and that it's just me psyching myself out. But, understandably, we are both getting frustrated with the situation.

How do I escape this cycle? How do I go back to mentally associating PIV sex with relaxation and pleasure?

Do I stop masturbating for a week, month, etc? Do I never watch porn again? Do I take some kind of supplement? Would trying something like Viagara/Cialis (which I've never tried before) once get me over this?

This has been such a struggle for me and I need to find a solution. I haven't really discussed this with anyone. Just typing this post alone has been a big step for me. I'm overdue for my annual physical. As uncomfortable and embarrassed as I am about this, I think it's time I mention it to my doctor.

Has anyone else experienced this? How do I recover?

Please, please help.

TLDR; No problem getting a woody during 1st-3rd bases but I associate PIV sex with anxiety and disappointment. I need to get out of this cycle.

I think relationships aren’t for me, and obviously I don’t want to hurt her, but.. I don’t know. We’ve been dating for almost 6 months, and she lives around 20 minutes away.

4,"This will be a little long, so here it goes...

I’ve had this crush on this girl senior year in high school but unfortunately she was taken. We became friends and we eventually got each other’s numbers. We would text occasionally here and there but most of the time we just talked about class work and homework. Most of the time, our interactions were a bit awkward. At that time, I was sad she was taken but I still respected her relationship. 

We graduated and we’ve sort of parted ways. The day I left for college, my friend told me that she said she misses me which I thought isn’t anything special. I attended university out of my home state and she stayed in-state. After a few months, she broke up with her boyfriend. Once, I texted her when I was drunk but it wasn’t anything other than the casual “how’s it been?” and “how’s college?”. Even back in high school, our text convos were short. She would reply with only a few words making it hard to continue the conversation so I often end up not replying back. During finals week, I decided to text her out of the blue saying “good luck” and since we haven’t seen each other in a while I said “we should meet up sometime”. She didn’t reply. Despite her breakup with her boyfriend, I sort of moved on because of the lack of interest. I understood she saw me as a friend. 

However, just today, she sent me a picture of us that was taken senior year in high school. I haven’t texted her or been in contact since finals week in college. I said something in the lines of “Oh god” and she just replied with “memories” and laughing emojis. The convo just dropped from there. I shouldn’t but I felt a bit disappointed. 

I just sort of have confused feelings about her I guess. I thought I moved on but I think I still have some little remaining feelings for her and I don’t know why. It’s too bad I don’t know what she’s thinking right now. ",02Jul2018,2
5,"I'm a pretty young guy, been working at walmart for about three years. I enjoyed what i did for a long time and recently hit a bump in the road. My new manager has made the job miserable and quite frankly made me feel like shit. I think of quitting every day. In my eyes it was actually a good awakening that made me realize, ""what are you doing?"" Ive come to think, do i really want this as a career? Now looking for a new job that same question keeps coming into my head. The potential salary at walmart is great but I don't know if i should endure and be well off in life or find a ""dream"" and not know where my next paycheck is coming from. The only real career ive genuinely felt excited about is animal caretaking/training or a stuntman. Everytime i consider one i just think of how bad this could turn out if i go that route. Animal trainers generally make less than i do now and being a stuntman requires a strong hustle game until you're established. So how could i possibly stay afloat while i chase such a dream? I've also made some poor financial decisions and am slowly getting myself back on track to have money put away in case the worst happens. I just feel like im in such a rut and dont know where to go. It's so odd to be asking random people something so personal, but i just don't know what to do anymore. Every day feels a little worse.",02Jul2018,1

Sort it’s do long...

To be clear our relationship was always odd, and people said she liked me but I could never get her to talk with me about how she felt or how I felt (what I really needed from her was friendship)when I tried she tried to brush over it. We met in grad school and became friends very slowly.  She always seemed suspicious of my niceness.  To be clear that’s just me, I just feel the need to help everyone and be nice to everyone, and it has got me burned...no I’m not a nice guy and I’m not pissed, I just am upset to lose someone I cared about.  Until she actually saw me doing similar things for other people and said oh you really are that nice.  I just was interested in her we had a lot in common, similar career goals and the same sense of humor (which I fond usually find in women I like).  I very quickly told myself we should just be friends, and went with that for a while.  There were a lot cliche signs, like our class video had a lot of footage of me because we were always together, I was one of the only guys she openly posted about etc.  But she dated so much i also wrote off any interest as just being nice.

She started pushing to spend time with me, and I didn’t read anything into it because anytime I tried to reciprocate she didn’t seem interested.  I had about a 30% yes rate with her. Fast forward a year and we started spending more time together, and she seemed more at ease with me. We went out more and then all of a sudden she decided to invite me to dinner at her place, I was quite chuffed, but then I walked in and her three partners were there, so she’s poly.  Never addressed the elephant in the room we just started drinking and chatting.  All perfectly great people with similar mindsets.  

But I just felt slighted that she didn’t feel comfortable enough to talk to me about things rather than doing it in a way that I couldn’t address the fact that I developed feeling for her and wasn’t quite comfortable with the situation.  I’m not an ass and am a good actor so nothing was revealed.  Another time a week later when we were out for drinks she invited me to dinner with herself and her partners.  This didn’t seem kosher to me.  Sometimes she just gets a bit silly when she’s drunk, and I didn’t feel welcome in that type of situation.

After that we went out as friends (we always drank too much together) and we had a few awkward moments, but she never wanted to talk.  If it were a one night stand, fuck it, but I genuinely liked her and still do, but I wasn’t jumping into anything without a serious conversation.

After we graduated we suddenly drifted a part, she ghosted me, and then when she texted me it was suddenly all business.  When I tried to talk more I just got one word answers.  So I just feel that I should be done.  I don’t know what prompted this sudden withdraw, from me, there were a couple tense moment ]s but she still wanted to spend time with me.

TL;DR:  My friend and I have suddenly cut off all contact aside from really business like chatting which I’m not even really responding to.  Did all of the weird moments mean anything?  I just thought that when things got heated and she didn’t want to talk it was a red flag?  She was and probably is a great person who made life fun and interesting for me, but she never wanted to talk and I’ve sorta given up on even a friendship.  Thoughts? This all just seems so weird.",02Jul2018,1

10,"I'm going to college next month and I'm anxious.  I'm anxious because I did a 180 when it came to major and college choice before my graduating high school. I did my financial aid late and I have to make a payment really soon. Right now It says I'm not eligible for aid but I believe that it's because I verified my student aid late. I'm not worried about the cost about tuition because it's a state school and I get a state scholarship that covers the majority of tuition. The main costs of my college will be my dorm and my flight training. 

I'm anxious if I made the right choice doing a 180. previously I was going to go to my large state college near my home and major in IT or computer science, when I was in high school I had an aviation class and at the time I was not intending to be a pilot. As time flew I learned more and more about how to be a pilot and basic aviation then I realized that the pilot path is something I can take and I know what I'm getting into (the licenses and tests), but at the same time I don't know if this path is the right path for me. At the other hand, I didn't have a solid plan before pilot other than go to college and get a job. I considered my original option as a ""safer"" option because the college is closer to home and I figured since i'm somewhat tech savy it or computer science would be a natural choice

I was back in court on Friday to receive my sentence. The judge decided to sentence me to spend the rest of summer break (till August) in juvie. Said he thought he'd do me a favor and keep me away from any more parties for awhile.

She walks to the wooden shop on the outside it looks pretty beautiful like it wouldn't be some weird shop that sells really abnormally weird things all the time but on the inside it looks antique, not ugly just a bit old and like it was used for something else prior. She greets a decently old man named Red with grey eyes a long grey beard and some sort of weird torn up brown sweater, also he was bald. He lets her carry on as she's walking and looking around she finds this weird book shelf with potions and books as she's opening and smelling bottles a book falls out of know where a brown book called ""Portals"" which has a circle that's grey and orange on the front cover no picture it's just there she mumbles the title to herself as she's running her fingers across the thick title Lis decides to buy the book as soon as she gets home she plops onto her bed and opens the book and there's that glowy circle symbol on the book her first reaction is to run her fingers across it and boom that same exact symbol in her room wide and big in front of her bed. She's outstanded by the beauty and can't believe her eyes when she eventually goes in she's on some very tall and big grey rock that has a huge hole in the middle she's now wearing the portals necklace she's frantic at first but wonders if she jumps will she make a perfect landing and so she does and succeeds she thinks she's there all alone but as she yells ""Hello is anyone there?"" she's met by a cute young brown haired guy named Ivory 19 blue eyes and pinky skin. He lets her know what this is all about and how he's been trapped there for weeks they aren't the only people in these ""portals"" humans of course they are the only ones as of right now but they have to fight these weird creatures everyday and night hopefully if they do not decide to come out at night they'll be fine but that wouldn't be much interesting or fun would it. They have certain powers based on their personalities, they have to take out all these weird creatures from all sorts of backgrounds and power and it's not going to be easy. Maybe along the way they meet new people and develop feelings for one another but their real goal in these so called portals is to keep each other alive and maybe later meet again when they're finally home

To sum it all up it would be pretty much just be a show where these characters at first are by themselves in this other world called Portals....I personally can't explain lol and so they pretty much just have to go from portals to portals collecting stuff, fighting creatures, bad people...etc...And just survive til they can find their way out back to where they belong",02Jul2018,1

•Walked into her at a party. 
•We were at an event organized by the two of our schools. We don’t go to the same school. We passed by each other a few times, then at she bus stop going home she said bye to me (me specifically even though I was in a group). 
•At at party she sat next to me and put her legs across my lap, but we didn’t talk because we were both absolutely fucked on MDMA. 
•At another party where she said to her friends she wanted to get with me (as in have some kind of sexual interaction with me, I don’t know how to put it in terms that isn’t slang other than that). I spoke to her a bit, we talked about how I was hallucinating from MDMA, I would have talked to her more but at the time I wasn’t interested in her as I was talking to another girl and was trying to get with her. 
•Saw her a few days ago and she tried to talk to me but I had done a lot of ketamine and couldn’t recognize her, the when I sobered up and could recognize her she take took my hand to dance with me but as soon as I stood up to dance with her, her ex boyfriend showed up and dragged her away to talk to her. 

There’s definitely some kind of sexual tension between us, but I always seem to miss my chance to talk to her. I should be able to talk to her at a party tomorrow if she goes but the problem is I literally cannot stop thinking about her. I can’t sleep at night because I’m thinking about her. I’ve probably said 15 words to her, but I constantly imagine that I’m talking to her. I could start talking to her, but if I did I’m 100% certain that I’d fall in love with her, and she really isn’t a one man woman. It would be unrequited. I think I’d be happy just talking to her even if it was unrequited, but I don’t think she’d like me enough to talk to me every day, which is what I’d need if i was in love with her. I was talking to another girl for 4 months and that took my mind off her completely, but that girl’s gone now and I have no one to talk to, I just imagine I’m talking to the other girl. 

I know it’s pathetic but at least I could get with her, but if I did I might think about her even more, so I really don’t know what to do. I think if I never try to start talking to her properly I’ll regret it for a long long time, because I can tell that if I talked to her I’d fall in love with her, there’s just something about her. So what should I do? Try to start talking to her properly, or start to talk to someone else to take my mind off her? Do you think I should avoid getting with her in case it makes me think about her even more?

35,"On a call for EMS, we were driving down the road to an accident when we were struck by a vehicle whose driver was heavily intoxicated. I posted a picture of our wrecked truck on my story with the caption “PSA: If you drive drunk, you’re an asshole”

36,"The title pretty much says it all. I am a late bloomer (not physically, but mentally and socially). I am 20 F and I feel so lacking. I was raised by strict parents, and me being their first child, they were very protective of me. 

They did not let me hang out with my friends without adult supervision, which is understandable as a child but became a little ridiculous when I turned 16. (My parents always wanted me home by 3pm.) I never got the chance to do adventurous things like my friends did.

My parents raised me with the intention of me becoming  a “proper woman.” My mom and dad are very traditional and wanted to me to focus more on how to cook, how to clean, do laundry etc. In addition, focus on school. Which I get. But now, despite knowing how to cook and clean up after myself lol, I’m starting to see how not being free with my life is negatively affecting me. Don’t get me wrong, I love my parents to death, but now I’m starting to see how I’m lacking socially. 

Whenever I talk to people, I’ve noticed how socially awkward I can be. I’m very extroverted and I love talking to people, but I tend lose the interest of my friends/peers since I have a hard time relating to their conversations. (They talk about going out, drinking, going clubbing) Or sometimes it’s the most simplest things like staying late in my school’s library to study (my parents were livid when I came home one time at 8:30pm) I attend a cc, so I still live at home with my parents. 

My friends have also described me as too innocent and are very mindful on how they interact with me. (Which I kinda hate because I feel like being treated like a child, despite being older than most of them). So I never get invited to outings with them.

One of my friends even described my innocence as a giant turn off to guys. So I’m basically boy repellent even though I never intended to be.

I’ve tried talking to parents to let me have a little more freedom, but they are still a little wary of bad things happening to me. My dad even forbade from driving on the freeway because he’s worried about my safety. So even then, I’m limited in the amount of places I can visit. 

There are so many things I’ve never got to do which I feel I was supposed to experience by this age. I’ve never been to a party, I’ve never had a boyfriend, I’ve never had my first kiss, I’ve never traveled with friends, I’ve never been to a concert, never went hiking, spend the night with friends etc. 

A now being pre-med, I won’t really have much time to do any of those things in the future, and just thinking about it bums me out :/

Idk I’m just rambling now, has anyone else been a late bloomer? ",02Jul2018,6
37,"Today I turned in my resignation for my strength coaching job with the local high school football team. I finish got fed up with having to work seven days a week and my input and concerns being ignored despite the fact that I worked more than anyone on that team. I had brought up my concerns multiple times to the athletic director and the owner of the gym I work at (who is friends with the athletic director and somehow has input) and every single time they decided to give the head coach what he wanted (this man is a complete control freak) when it was known such decisions would only hurt and affect me.

So today I turn in my resignation and the response was ugly. The head coach decided to tell me that I hadn't turned in my two weeks and instead was going back on an agreement despite there being no signed contracts for summer (confirmed by the athletic director) and letting down 90 families, effectively telling me I'm apparently not allowed to quit. The owner of the gym I work at also responded in a negative way despite knowing what my issues were and choosing to ignore them. I would also add that when I brought up the fact no summer contracts were available, he wanted me to accept the fact that I would ""probably"" be paid at the end of the summer but upon realizing he'd have to bring in a other coach to cover for the times I'm not there, he suddenly cared about the football team laying as the head coach appears to have been hoping for free work.

So my question is how would any of you handle this? I'm trying to work on a graduate degree and have repeatedly told the athletic director and owner of the gym I cannot work seven days and be a student. Or am I just being unreasonable?",02Jul2018,1
38,"I haven’t asked out anyone in a few years. I’ve been trying online dating and it, obviously, hasn’t been going very well. But there’s this woman that I’ve been interested in for a while.

Here are the problems I was facing:

-	I didn’t feel comfortable asking her out because I was technically her boss when we began talking. Never mind sexual harassment, I just didn’t want her to feel uncomfortable coming into work knowing her boss likes her and she doesn’t feel the same way. I’m not her boss anymore, I still work for the same company but we do not work in the same location. Basically, she doesn’t have to see me and I would be able to avoid her so she doesn’t have to feel uncomfortable if she got weirded out. But I only ever see her when she’s at work and I’m a little iffy asking someone out while they’re at work unless they make it clear they feel the same way.
-	I saw her Facebook and saw that she was in a relationship but I looked it up again today and saw that she’s no longer in a relationship and she’s deleted the picture of her with the guy so I’m guessing she’s single. Though I do know some people want space after ending a relationship and I’m not sure how long that one was so, idk.
-	I’m just a shy kind of person in general. She strikes up conversations with me when we see each other and I do too but I’m really shy and have to force myself.

In your opinion, based on what I’ve written, do you think I should try and ask her out or leave it alone?

If you think I should, what’s your advice on how I should go about asking? I have her phone number but I’ve never texted/called her about anything not work-related. I just always felt I’d be overstepping boundaries by doing that since she gave it to me for something work related a while ago.",02Jul2018,1
39,"So, my girlfriend's sister have a boyfriend that nobody likes in the family. The guy is often rude, extremely lazy and seems to give little care about her. He can also be very negative to her in a way to makes everyone around uncomfortable and she just takes it all, never arguing or replying, and if we challenge him he is immediately aggressive (verbally). The girl in question is also very shy and prude around us. Every time we talk a bit about sex or anything, especially towards her she becomes uncomfortable and defensive, when everyone is joking and don't really care what she does..

At one point I was alone in the house and she left her phone there. I opened it and checked her messages with her boyfriend, trying to dig some dirt on the dude. Except from regular rude replies or meme exchanges, I eventually found nudes of both.

My problem comes from the fact that knowing how shy and all she is, it doesn't strike me as normal behavior from her part. Her relationship already feels abusive, and she seems submissive to her boyfriend so I am afraid that he could be pressuring her in doing such things. Again, maybe she is fine with all that, and comfortable with sexuality with her bf but no-one else.

I would like to talk about this with my gf or the family but I have no idea how to approach them without looking like a total fucking creep, because lets face it, I found myself creepy when scrolling through that.

Any advice?",02Jul2018,1

He won't sell it to me before that. He would rather me take on his monthly $109\~ monthly payments and pay off the remaining balance of the loan on the title for however many months, though. He said it would be better for both of us, but I can't tell if he's being deceitful or not about that. 

Brother 2 has a new car that he's missed 2 payments on because he's irresponsible with money. He just got a new job. He suggested that we go to a used car dealer that takes bad credit or no credit tomorrow and use his car as a trade-in. They said for $500 down, they could get us approval guaranteed.

44,"I graduated with an accounting degree in December and had a rough time finding a full-time job offer. A couple of months ago I started working with a white-collar temp agency which quickly placed me with a notable finance company which I had long had my eye on. My contract was for 3 months, and my requested pay was on the low end of what their temps get.

I'm currently two months into the contract. Everything has been going great, and I would love to continue working there. From what I've gathered, the company tends to either extend the term of temp contracts or make a permanent offer once the term is up. I've heard they're in a period of growth and are looking to increase their permanent staff.

So I have a few questions. When and how should I reach out to my manager regarding my prospects? Should I have an attitude of being dead set on working for the company, or should I make it known that I'm pursuing alternatives (as contingencies)? Finally, if they want to extend my temp contract, should I attempt to negotiate a higher pay-rate? I hadn't intended to stay at $17/hr for more than a few months, and it's common for temps to be paid in the low 20s. From my own perception, I seem to be learning and preforming at a level which would make them want to hire me. Any advice, thoughts, or insight would be much appreciated!",02Jul2018,1

So im pretty freaked, and i need somebody to do me a real solid here. i took a bunch of the messages, they are all from today.

I truthfully have no responsibilities at all, I still live with my parents at age 22 because I'm Asian and it's fairly normal and my parents lived with their parents into their thirties. I have $111,000 saved no debt and I gross $45,000 from my collections job. I have a bachelor's in business and have no roots and could move anywhere in the USA if need be for another job. 

It's just I have no other job lined up and no connections or anything. I felt so lucky eventually getting this collections job. Tough it out and stay, or just quit?",02Jul2018,2

74,"It was a small accident — I backed into a parked car. There is more damage to my own car bumper than there is to the other car. But it was still my fault, and it was my first accident. Oh, also, it was my manager’s car, so that’s great. 

Anyway, I just got home and I just overall feel so awful. I have this feeling in my stomach like I just want to disappear forever, and my blood feels poisoned with guilt and embarrassment that I have to go to work again next week. I completely broke down in front of my parents about it, even though I know it’s silly and unreasonable to feel so distraught over a very minor accident. I also have anxiety which is probably exacerbating the situation. I haven’t had food all afternoon and evening, but now my appetite is completely dissipated. My impulse is to just wrap myself in blankets and wallow in irrational self-pity, but I know it wouldn’t be the most self-helpful thing to do. 

I just need to calm down and forgive myself, or else I’m in for a really shitty rest of my night/week. What are your suggestions to help me relax and get my mind off of everything?

75,"Ex GF and I have been separated for 5 months. I have had absolutely no interaction with another girl since the breakup, and the loneliness is starting to take its toll. I live in a small town with absolutely nothing to do (this place is usually dead after 9pm). We have 1 bar, and there are usually more cops waiting outside than there are people inside. And the closest place to really go out and have fun is 45 minutes away. I work 50-60 hours a week, and sometimes get called in on the weekends, as I'm currently the only production manager and programmer there. That being said, there aren't many opportunities to meet people. I'm thinking about giving some kind of app or website a shot. Friends have mostly suggested Tinder (never used it), and Bumble (never heard of it).

How do you guys deal with stuff like this? How do adults manage their off-time effectively. I like to listen to audio books on my way to work, and maybe work on game mods when I get home (I'm in the gaming industry atm). But I feel like... I'm not going to progress in any of my side pursuits.

What should I do? I tried starting a streak this girl. She always replies, but if I don't talk first, she just sends streaks. She was always happy replying, and I started talking less because I'm tired of having to do all the jokes for her to talk to me. I get nothing, no jokes, nothing if I don't text. Aren't relationships supposed to be 50/50? Did I do something wrong? Am I pushing her too much? Before I added her on Snap, she always smiled at me, and tried flirting with me once. Should I have just left her alone? I'm tired of playing games with this girl, and I'm not going to get horribly rejected like some people want me to. How about you ask your crush out and explain to your dad why his 14 year old son is crying. I'd rather not. Unless I'm sure she's showing she's into me, fuck that. I ended my streak with her because that bullshit was pissing me off, I tried snapping her about something that happened, I get a one word reply. Left her on read, obviously. What, you want me to spend over 5 minutes thinking about a logical way to reply to your bullshit that took less than a second to type out? Seriously, what the fuck? Are you insane? Why can't you just be straightforward like a normal fucking human, but at the same time maybe she is being straightforward that she's not interested. FUCK. This is total bullshit, honestly I'm going to try to forget she ever existed. Can someone with experience tell me what the hell is going on? Am I over thinking this? Is this a one-sided crush?

83,"My mom who is in her 50s is really struggling to find a job to make ends meet at the moment. In 2010 her wife (my other mom) passed away after fighting cancer for a number of years. Since then my mother has had to raise my sister and I alone off of a single parent salary.

For awhile it was fine as she has a really good paying job, but soon found herself laid off along with hundreds of other employees at the company she worked at for 20 something years.

My mother found a full job working at the local community school district for a few years now that she loves to death (something she didn’t experience with her old job) but it can’t make ends meet financially. 

She is a high school graduate and pursued 4 years of college but due to a mix up she couldn’t graduate that year due to missing a few credits. She opted to not spend her money on an extra trivial year so she doesn’t officially hold a bachelors degree.

As an adult in college I recognize times are tough on my family and with my mom being a slight pessimist I worry more for my mother. Would love to get some advice on what jobs/career paths/actions she can pursue that could make reasonable cash so she wouldn’t have to stress so much. ",02Jul2018,1
84,"hey guys, this is really been weighing on me recently and i can’t think of anywhere else to go. so here’s the backstory. 
i have two best friends, who ill be referring to as M and D (not sure if it matters, but M is female and D is male). i have known D since i was around 8, and M is my ex girlfriend who has become close to me after our breakup. 
so the issue is that both of them like me, a lot. like i mentioned earlier, i dated M for a while and then we broke up but continued to be friends. after that, i started a purely sexual relationship with D. now M is jealous of D. 
i know this sounds like a really fixable problem, but it’s destroying all three of us with jealousy and sadness. i have no idea what to do. i’m afraid it’s either going to tear us or our friendship apart. what do i do to not lose either of them? ",02Jul2018,2
86,"Hello,

First, if you're reading, thanks. So I'm an engineering student finishing two degrees, one in electrical and one in computer. I work as an intern for an engineering company, and I have a girlfriend of 4 years and 8 months. I plan on getting engaged within the next month. That's why I think I'm life reflecting. 

Basically, I'm looking for advice on money, motivation, health, and anything else you think may help. 

Right now my life sucks, and I think I'm partially to blame. I go to work every day (albeit about 30-45 min late) and I'm supposed to work 8-5. I'm a couple thousand dollars in debt from the school year, but my will to work and make money is in the toilet. My job isn't particularly bad, actually the money at $18 an hour isn't bad, but when I leave by 3:30 or 4 every day I basically don't have enough money at the end of the month to make any financial progress. So there's one issue. 

Another is that I have goals that I constantly don't complete. I'd like to make YouTube videos, and I'd also like to make some video games, but when I come home from work my drive is so low that I normally sleep for 3-4 hours and/or watch Netflix. I also play with my cat, but that's not a bad thing. 

My diet also sucks, but I've always had such a high metabolism that I've always stayed at 150, but I eat fast food on the daily for lunch and dinner, because I stare at my debt and worry about buying groceries because I'm broke and I don't have the will power to even do laundry consistently, so how could I make food? I also live with 6 other interns for the summer, so I engauge with them sometimes but it's also hard to use the kitchen with our work hours all being different. 

None of my friends or work colleges think I'm unhappy, on the contrary my work performance is pretty high because I guess I value having a good resume. My girlfriend knows I'm down a lot but she is also dealing with her own junk, so she trys to help but when she's not around I'm still a mess. She's great by the way. 

So any advice would be great, positive or negative, I can take it. Feel free to ask me more questions for clarification. Thanks. 

TL;DR I'm super lethargic and want to have a better work ethic, diet, budget control of diet, and accomplish my goals because I'm super stuck in a rut. ",02Jul2018,1

93,"Last week, my job held an out of office event (mandatory) for all employees to attend. At the end of the day, there's an optional happy hour that I decided to go to. I was hanging out with a coworker of mine during one of the breaks we had throughout the day, when she started striking up a convo with a guy that I've never met who was standing by us. He apparently works in the office, but we have so many employees that I couldn't recognize everyone if I tried. Well, I guess during that initial convo between the 3 of us, he took a liking to me or something.

Later that day at the happy hour, he found us near the bar. I was friendly as I would be with anyone, but nothing more than that. Then he basically started following me everywhere and that's when I started getting weirded out. My friend mentioned the fact that I had a boyfriend in casual conversation, just so he knew, but he didn't seem to care.

My friend had asked me to go to another bar with her after the happy hour at work in front of him, to which he subsequently invited himself and that left me in an awkward position. I said no thanks, and thought that would be the end of it. He kept following me around saying, ""you're going to the bar"" getting more and more intense as he repeated it, and I would say ""nooo I'm not. I'm going home."" and that kept going on for a while, to the point that I was pretty uncomfortable. I could tell he was starting to get intoxicated and he kept getting closer and closer to me. I would move away from him, and then he would tell me to ""stop trying to get closer to the exit."" I thought I was relatively upfront with my disinterest, and he knew I had a boyfriend since it was mentioned once or twice so I'm not sure where the disconnect was. I wanted to leave the work event right then, but I didn't want to walk by myself to my car so I waited for my friend to wrap up. 

As we were leaving, he follows. I couldn't say much because the happy hour at work was over with and everyone had to leave. He stops by the restroom and basically tries to coerce me into going with him. I said ""No."" and as he leaves to go use it, my friend and I start walking to our cars- pretty briskly. I told her I felt bad, but she said I didn't owe him anything and to keep walking. 

So we are almost at our cars when we see him following quickly behind us. He tells to me to ""stop running"" and as I kept going, he says ""you're on my shit list now"". 

My friend and I's cars were separated in the lot, so she says she will watch me go to my car, and I agreed. Well I'm almost to my car and he catches up to me. My friend noticed that he is there and calls me to pretend to be my boyfriend. Well, he knew it was her. He said, ""tell her you're coming to the bar"" and I just told him ""No. I have to leave sorry"". He then says ""are you guys talkin shit?"" I say no and I closed the door and drove off.

Needless to say, I'm pretty worried about going to work tomorrow. I'm scared that he said I was on his shit list. I don't know if that meant anything. It was a very weird experience and I'm pretty uncomfortable. We work slightly different hours and we are on different floors in the building, but I'm afraid he will find me. Before things got weird, all three of us were talking about where our desks were in the office. He also knows what my car looks like now. 

I haven't had too many encounters like this and I'm not sure if it's worth talking to anyone at work over or if that'll just make the situation worse. Maybe he will never talk to me again, but I just have a bad feeling for some reason.

Am I paranoid? What should I do/should I leave this alone? I've been dreading going to work tomorrow...

Anyways, I've known his password for a long time and I check up on him, even though he always acts really secret. I realize this makes me look like the badguy, like I should just trust him. But He's always tried to keep secrets and not let any family members know what hes doing. I only knew about the gifts because I knew his passwords to his email, and bank account. 

He pays a lot of money to cam sites. I don't think this is right. But I found a video saved to google drive of him secretly recording this other women. He must have asked to borrow her phone then got a lot of information from her phonem, like phone numbers, her someones ip address, and some other technical numbers

99,"So Yesterday, my friend came over and we were gonna play a popular free game (I think you know the name). He has an Xbox but his parents were divorced and he was with the one that didn't have it. He asked if he could use my brothers. my brother is in another state for a tournament and wouldn't be back till the next day. So i asked my dad if he could use it, he said he doesn't see a problem with that. So when my friend came over, he signed into his own profile and brought his own batteries. 

When my brother came back, he said 'you played on my Xbox without asking??' he didn't seem mad, he said it like he was pretending to be mad, but as a joke. My dad came up to me and said 'now that i think about it, we should've waited to ask him' Later my brother comes up will i'm playing, (i didn't play all day because i was fishing, so this was my first time that day) he said that he ran out of Xbox live, and he wants to play on my Xbox, because i played on his Xbox.

 I see two problems with this

1. i'm using the Xbox at the time. And he wasn't using his Xbox when my friend played on it, he was in another state
2. if he uses my Xbox, hes gonna ask to sign into my account that I paid for, since his account is expired

I tried explaining this to him, but he said 'you never let me play on yours when i didn't have one, why did you play on mine?' this has a story behind it. During the summer I got a job, at the end I was able to get a good Xbox, some games, and a sweet elite controller, which ended up being 500 dollars total. But my brother has no work ethic, and he has never had a job. But he constantly wanted to play on my Xbox, I let him play when I was at work, and sometimes even when i'm home. But he abused his privileges and he would spend hours playing with his friends when I wanted to play. I told him he couldn't play anymore and he got super upset. Every now and then I would still let him play, but only for an hour, and only if he asked. But he still played without asking, and would whine when I told him to get off. 

So I explained to him that

1. I bought this Xbox
2. I bought the games your playing
3. I bought the Xbox Live
4. I even bought the cool controller you're using

I ended up telling him it was off limits. He later got a job of his own and worked enough hours to pay for an Xbox with a year of Xbox live. 

My dad is saying that my brother never kept things from me like I am keeping things from him right now, but he actually did. One example is when we were both around 7 years old (we are 5 months apart), he got the new Call of Duty game, and he would never let me use it even when he was gone. He never has been nice to me at all throughout my life, hes constantly saying mean things and even told me to go KYS this year.

But now my dad is saying i'm being unfair, he keeps mentioning the golden rule. But how am I supposed to treat him how I want to be treated when he treats me like garbage. 

The thing is, i have worked hard for the privilege to enjoy myself when i want to, i have had to share with him and my older brother (who has moved out) my whole life, so it means a lot when i work for something I can call mine. 

Am I wrong to not let him play? I need advice",02Jul2018,1
100,"I'm a 23M and lately I've been feeling so inadequate and insecure about everything. I've been feeling like this for a while when I have no reason to because ofal the things I've accomplished but I still feel not important. I've graduated with a bachelor's degree and have landed a job with the city I'm living in with a great salary and benefits, I've moved into my own place, I have a great relationship with my 24F girlfriend, and have great close friends. All my life I've felt useless and not worth much. Even after I went through major physical improvements the confidence after that wore off after awhile and now I'm trying to find that confidence again. I don't want my insecurities and feelings of inadequacy to get into my life but I find it hard to take pride in accomplishments I've made.  

A bit of background: I didn't grow up very emotionally supported with certain things and have been told to suppress a lot of feelings in and deal with them, even when I had suffered from depression in high school. I was bullied a lot by students and teachers in middle and high school and even by my best friend and crush at the time. Some of the things she and said to me I still remember to this day. Even my first few years of college I felt like an outcast and loser because I didn't have a lot of status or confidence. Fast forward to 2017 I lost 40 pounds and now I've gained some decent build to myself with muscle. I met an outstanding woman who I'm in a very happy relationship with and have finished a bachelor's in Accounting and landed a great career. But up until then, I never felt my accomplishments were anything worth bragging about or being proud of. I've just grown up, not taking a lot of pride in myself because of how I've felt due to everyone's constant negative talk..how can I overcome these feelings and learn to have more pride in myself? I just don't wanna be coming off arrogant and haughty when I talk about anything. I just wanna feel proud of what I've accomplished just like I feel proud of the victories and accomplishments of everyone who I love.

103,"I’m at a pretty pivotal crossroads in my life. I’m 25, no real momentum, enrolled at a CC and I hate my job. Finally, after years of no motivation, I have the insatiable urge to kick start my life and better myself. My main motivation is to establish a foundation towards a career path. 

I live in city A. I truly love it, and know this is the perfect city for me. Big city feel, with tons of small town charm. It has a great “community” feel which I think goes a long way as far as feeling apart of society/acceptance things of the like. 

I truly feel stuck though? Stagnation is setting in. I’ve lived here off and on since 2014. Spent no more than 8 months here at a time. I recognize that never allowing myself to establish a foothold is going a long way towards me not feeling like I have a foundation set. But my psychological outlook on the city is that I feel stuck, I’ve experienced it, and want to try different things while I still can. It’s a great place to be if you have a social life, a career, and money. I have none of those lol. 

City B is tempting. I’m trying to ride the wave I’m on of finally buckling down on my goals, learn new skills, and start to actually develop myself. City B has a great urbanism/environmentalism/creativity movement going on right now I want to envelop myself in that as that’s a path I want to set myself on. I’m not going to a university until next year, and this will help me feel like I have taken step 1 towards it. CC for a year, commit to it for once, take a job where I can learn skills and will look great on a resume, and start from the ground up. My psychological outlook will be that I came here for a reason, so don’t lose focus. I have a real problem with getting side tracked and forged down a different path. No more. My daily mantra will basically be “Its go time”

One last thing: most recent ex girlfriend now lives in city B. Really uncomfortable with the idea that deep down in a place undiscovered, I’m moving there to reconnect with her. I wouldn’t attempt to reconnect. But feeling like I’m following her and trying to invade on her new experience? Ehhhh that one leaves me feeling weird. My life, who cares-right? 

So basically: Do I stay, allow myself to actually establish a foothold in a place, not feeling like I’m stagnant, or use the move to a fresh place to fracture my thinking into a whole new direction? 

(Yes I know it’s all in my head and I need to go see a psychiatrist)

I have a few friends I met online, but I want more METAL friends..  and when I go out to shows and events and metal bars, I get compliments on my battle jacket or on my band tee, and sometimes these conversations hit off really well and last for several minutes, and I see these as potential opportunities to make friends, but I don't know how..

In fact just yesterday at an event I went to, this guy with super long dreads came up to me and complimented my battle jacket, and he seemed like he wanted to talk and I gave him a fist bump and smiled and let him go on, but I've always thought if I try to stop that person and have a conversation with them, they might perceive it as needy or think I'm a creep, and so out of fear of inconveniencing anyone I've just lead a friendless life for 33 years..

113,"I'll try to make this as ""put together"" as possible. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend is going through a low point in his life that makes him defensive when we try to work out important arguments. I have been nothing but supportive, and want to help him, but this is weighing on me. He leaves for the Air Force in two months and I don't know what to do. 

Background: I've been dating my boyfriend for 5 months, but we've been best friends for a year prior. We're both 21. When we became friends, he was reaching the end of a rocky relationship (4 years) with a girl who cheated on him 3 times before they officially called it quits. 

This girl was really horrible to him. She knew he loved and cared for her, and abused his dedication to loving her because she knew he wouldn't leave. I helped him through this time when we were best friends, although he has always struggled to fully open up about how hurt he really was. 

After they separated, we became closer and closer. I was becoming a part of their family and we'd do ""couple like"" things- as best friends. One night, out of the blue, he admitted he was in love with me. In the back of my head I played with the idea of how beautiful our relationship could be, and long story short we started dating. 

One thing I am realizing now, that I haven't before, was the extent to how his downfall in his previous relationship is still causing him emotional pain. He fell into a severe depression, that he masked and tried to work out, but because of this he struggles to trust, open up, and truly love and care. There are times I see the true him, before his hurt, but his bad days outweigh the good. 

I just gradated nursing school, and I'm using this summer to study for my boards before I start working in the ICU at the end of July. AKA, this is an extremely stressful time in my life, too. When he has his off days, however, I always address his feelings and do my absolute best to be supportive of him without imposing. He doesn't have many friends other than ones he currently works with, and I'm very social with many close friends and obligations, so I'm his biggest support right now. 

Whenever we talk about these issues, though, he becomes extremely defensive.  For example: We could be spending time together, eating out or with his family, and he becomes very snappy for no reason. Or he just seems distant. I know why he's acting this way, but many times he seems inconsiderate towards others. I try to bring this up to him, and he focuses situationally how he didn't do anything wrong, rather than the fact that this is a problem, and even more of a problem because he does not accept when he is wrong. (His depressive feelings heighten this- guys with depression tend to display their emotions as short-fused, irritable, and withdrawn)

I'll deal with those feelings because I care. It's hard for him, okay. Here's the thing: He is scheduled to start basic training for the Air Force in two months. This makes matters harder because we have such little time to secure this relationship.

A recent event completely threw me over the edge with this ""caring and working shit out"" mentality. We were visiting family of mine, that are very important to me, and the whole time he was very distant. He did not go out of his way to create conversation or spend quality time with anyone, and really just came across as just rude (someone would ask him about himself, he was very short to them). He was the one who insisted he come visit my family, too, so it's not as if I dragged him out to do this. I was frustrated because I realized that even my family could tell how withdrawn he was, and I had to compensate for this. They know I'm a caring and upbeat individual even on my worst days (at least for my family), and them seeing me with someone who was acting like this was confusing for them. 

On our way back to my house, we passed where my mother had her funeral (I lost her at age 10). Losing my mother has made me stronger and more successful, and while I am normally not emotional about this, I started to cry in the car. I was giving him directions as well, and while I told him where to go he made a wrong turn, and when we got back on the right road he stated (""Use your words when you're giving directions next time"")

I was infuriated. He did not do ANYTHING to comfort me about my mother- and yes, some people do not know how to handle when others cry and I was just fine with the silence when I told him why I was (he asked what was going on and seemed somewhat supportive), but saying something like that, at that time, the way he did, was uncalled for.

Long story short- I broke up with him when we got back to my house after hours of fighting. Not just because of what he did. He couldn't genuinely say sorry for it. He'd throw in a straight faced ""sorry"" here and there but did not reassure me, and kept arguing. He always finds ways to turn it on me. And that's unacceptable.

He left my house, and the next day left a 4 page letter apologizing about how he acted, and that he should just be sorry to be ""sorry"". I thought, WOW, finally! He gets it. This is what it took. We talked that day, and he told me he could not lose me. I was a little on edge to jump right back in to the relationship, but everyone deserves a chance to grow, and I care about him. So we moved on. 

Until last night, when I brought up my genuine concerns about him leaving in 2 months for the Air Force. Little communication, and the issues we are facing, on top of his stubborn, selfish attitude (I'm not gonna word it like that to him, but he is, and it's not fair) makes for a bad mix when it comes to a LDR. Again, the conversation started fine but took bad turns when he started arguing about these issues that we need to face (e.g. I told him it was important, for me, that he be considerate even when he ""doesn't feel like it"" or ""is tired"", especially with my family etc. He argued me every way he could, and never faced the fact that this is unfair). 

Frustrated again, I left. I told him we were really done. (I'm not one for bullshit, honestly. A lot of people stay in shit relationships when they aren't being treated as they are deserving of). He wouldn't let me go at first. He told me he needs me. He wants to work things out. But after trying to get out for an hour, he became mad and said ""just leave then"". 

I left, and he texted me paragraphs about how he needs me and needs my help. (In my head- I'm like, then why don't you just take the help I give you instead of defending yourself and making things worse?) I got home and texted him ""I'm sorry Jonah, I really do hope the best for you. Good luck with everything."" I felt sad, so sad, but need to stand up for myself. 

He showed up at my house 20 minutes after I got home. He called and asked me to come downstairs, and when I did he was standing outside shaking from anxiety. We didn't start fighting, I just calmly told him I could not be treated this way.

He told me he needed me, he loved me, we have beautiful relationship he cant lose, he has nobody else, etc. He said sorry. But I stood my ground. We went inside because he was shaking so bad from the anxiety that he felt uncomfortable, so we went to my room. There, he told me over and over he needed to work this out. So I told him, the only way were working this out is if he can realize that he can not act like this to resolve our issues. And again, he started becoming defensive (he sneaks in a comment here and there). 

Frustrated, I started being downright blunt and honestly, bitchy (I deserved to). I told him ""I don't know who you think I am- but I've been through a lot, I don't deal with bullshit. If something isn't working, and I've tried so hard to make it work, I will put myself first and realize what I deserve"" 

Another long story short: he wouldn't leave when we were fighting, calmed me down from being angry (it's 4 am at this point), told me he wasn't going and that we were going to work this out. Him not leaving was frustrating when standing up for how I feel, but damn. He's hurting and he needs someone. He loves me and he cares so much. He is struggling to show this, though. 

This was last night. He stayed over, and we just moved on from it. I told him this morning we're still going to have to talk about it all and our issues, and he told me he knows this and that we will, that he loves me and we need to stay together to work things out. 

This is so confusing. I do love him. He's a great boyfriend going through a really, rough patch (when I say he's great- he is regardless of this shit. I'm not gonna go into all of that, but he is worth it for the good reasons. The bad ones mentioned above are what complicated this all.)

Do I stay? Do I leave? I don't know. Shit. I've tried to leave. But when you care so much about someone, do you just stick it out? 
Sorry for the long post. Advice would be so, so appreciated- I've never been so conflicted.

123,"Hello,

Thank you, first of all, for taking the time to read through this, and hopefully give some input.  So, here it goes:

About three months ago (give or take) I was let go early from a contract job (a non-profit), due mostly to poor performance.  This organization was political in nature, and we were trying to get a bill passed in the state legislature.  The bill, unfortunately, was never voted on, and so that, at least, was out of my control.  As mentioned, though, I simply was not good at this job, and it was mostly due to the fact that my personality did not serve as good of a fit as I would've liked.  This was a position that was supposed to be for a dynamo/self-starter type, and it became clear that my introverted and analytical personality didn't fit in well with this type of work that I was doing.  Even after a few weeks on this job, the stress it put on me started to effect my motivation and performance.  This was a telecommuting position, and I fell into the habit of sleeping in a bit some mornings, and got sidetracked relatively easily.  My employer even had a performance review and tried to find me an office for a more professional setting, but to no avail.  Eventually, as mentioned, I was let go.  The hardest part was feeling like a complete failure, both on a professional and moral level.  Yes, the sudden loss of income was difficult, but I was in a good place financially and wasn't worried about finding work (I recently found a new job).  A few weeks after being let go, I even started seeing a psychologist to help me process the debilitating guilt I was experiencing.  He has helped some, and he has been trying to get me to embrace a philosophy of ""radical acceptance"" in my life.  Nonetheless, I have had the desire lately to email my former boss and formally apologize for not doing a better job, and for accepting the position to begin with, since I should've known myself better.  Perhaps it may seem silly that I'm so hung up on this, but as you may know, the human mind does not always operate in a rational manner.  In any case, do you think I should apologize, or would this make things worse for me by bringing things back into the forefront?  Please let me know, and thanks again for reading.  ",02Jul2018,2

He’s a cook and has been for 7 years and has grown tired of it. He never went to cooking school just basically moved up the ranks over the years. He worked for fine dining for 5 years and decided to leave even though he was very hesitant. He decided to go to a well known 5 star restaurant and his experience there was horrible and he decided to leave after a month. It was basically his dream job and he turned out to really dislike it. I think he was really let down bc he left a comfy job for his dream job and it didn’t turn out onto be what he thought it’d be. He now works at a not so nice catering company and he’s miserable. He never went to school and is hesitant to go bc he doesn’t have any idea as to what he’d major in. He’s depressed bc he has lost his passion for drums and basically just works at this job that he really dislikes. He’s a great cook and has a real talent for cooking but he’s lost about where he wanrs to go in life and it’s really bringing him down. I want to help him but I don’t really know how?

With it being late, combined with the fact that I was upset at S for something small, and that I'm a pretty emotionally unstable person, started to rant. I was talking shit about S behind her back, and I just lived my life normally without ever addressing it to her. 

I know I should'nt have done it but it was too late. 
One of the people in the server was my IRL friend that had invited me there in the first place. Word got around to S about what I said, and things just got worse from there.

S never decided to confront me about it, but she was definetely distancing herself away from me slowly ever since.

 Fast foward a bit, S does something incredibly stupid and hurtful to another friend of ours, and it got me upset. I confronted her about it, and what was just me telling her what she did was wrong, ended up turning on me when she revealed that she knew that I was talking shit behind her back. Instead of apologizing, I cursed her out and walked away. 

Fast Forward a few months, the friend that S hurt started to open up to her again and they became the friends they once were again. I decide that I should also try to open up to S and see if I can rebuild the trust I had broken. When I do try to talk to to her, she would ignore me completely. She would pretend to listen, or she would tell me to fuck off completely. All i do is remain calm and say nothing back. 

My last attempt to befriend S and regain her trust was a little over a month ago. I was tired of her ignoring me and when she did it again I snapped and had told her that she was being petty, childish and outright disrespectful to me and I had told her to grow up. 
I haven't said anything since.

Now the school year has ended, summer break is about 2 months long, and I don't want to return to school with any bad relationships with anyone. I want to be a better person who can control themself, and be on good terms with everyone. And I just don't know what to do with S, I'm completly stumped and confused and unsure about everything. I still have her phone number and I can always try to contact her, but I can't bring myself to do so. I just want to be friends once again, that's all I ask, and I don't know what to do when she is actively rejecting my attempts to break through. Please help me understand what to do.

132,"So I'm in a weird situation. I recently completed my first year at college and met someone in the beginning whom I never thought I would fall in love with with. So with like a month and a half left until school finished, I started having feelings for her, no for her looks, but for her character and personality (She isn't ""hot"" or one of the better looking people, but she is cute). So with the time I had left, I slowly started trying to ""advance"" the relationship. As time went on, I had reason to believe that she liked me back, but I didn't know for sure (I can get into the details later and some of you will probably think it was obvious). But I was racing time and I didn't want to rush things, so eventually I kind of accepted that it won't work (Because of summer and we live about 2.5 hours away from each other and opposite sides of LA) and I was too late and if anything should happen she would be the one to initiate. I still tried a bit after, but not much since there was like 2 weeks left of school., but now l realized that I should have kept going.

133,"Have a number of early diagnosed mental illnesses that were basically untreated for about a decade. I’m 25 now and am incapable of caring for myself. Couldn’t afford college, have to work terrible sales and labor jobs but I’m not competent enough to hold them. I’ve been fired 3 times in 6 months due to my depression and ADHD and quit another job because of it.

Was a good student, can do hard things, but doesn’t really matter without a piece of paper qualifying me to do them. Was homeless, facing homelessness again, and have barely any family or friends to support. Mom has been addicted to opioids for 25+ years, rather was abusive(physically and especially emotionally) and controlling but has mellowed, but basically he told me I can’t be in his house and not work so I can go to school since he never was too interesting in paying me through college despite making enough money I wouldn’t qualify for financial aid.

I stayed with an aunt for 6 months and thought I was turning a corner in my life, I paid 500 in rent a month, including a month between jobs I had to back pay plus 450 for a bed. I literally didn’t get caught up until month 5, then I lost the best job I ever had and one I was fairly happen in for “behavioral reasons”.  My performance was actually top notch, the best in my group. They fired me for being isolated from my coworkers during and off of work hours, for sometimes not paying attention to repetitive things when it didn’t affect my job performance, and because of my mood swings of being active some days and withdrawn other days.  They told me I wasn’t complying with the company culture and openly questioned my desire to be there. 

I then moved across the country because I was so upset, got fired again after a week with no explanation. I called the manager and got no answer, left a message nothing. Left an email ignored.  Same thing happened at the last job, was put on suspension and trainer stopped responding to my texts and declining my calls.
Answer I got through my contractor was “unhappy with performance” but it was a sales job and I had a training quota of zero. Whatever. 

Anyway this is way too long but basically the only way I think to salvage this miserable existence is applying for SSDI and getting that measly 1k a month and somehow putting myself through community college.

I’ve heard getting SSDI through depression is quite viable, but I haven’t taken a medication for mental illness in quite some time. I looked on the website and it says I need to prove the dysfunction but it’s unclear what I need for that? Statements from family members, co-workers, former bosses? How about the job history showing frequently bouncing around and the recent string of dismissals?

Is there anything obvious that I need and anyone have any insight on when I can expects payment?. I’ve worked for about 5 so I should have put plenty into FICA to qualify.

If I have to work and can’t get this I think I’ll just roll onto a street corner and slowly die. No real motivation to do otherwise since that’s where I’ll end up anyway. I’ve already tried enough, I’m over it. No one helps me ever and it wouldn’t surprise me if I get denied somehow.

138,"So I’m not 100% sure this belongs here but I can’t think of a better sub.

For about a year now I’ve been getting these odd sexual feelings, like urges, but not. These feelings come from the thought of being a woman. I know that sounds pretty weird but I don’t know how to explain it any other way than how I just did. Im pretty sure that I’m not gay but something about the thought of having a vagina and breasts just like, excites me (again, I don’t know how to explain it, but I did the best I could and it still sound weird)

I’ve been doing some ammeter self diagnosis and I’m wondering if I don’t have gender dysphoria. I mean, I’m trying to approach this situation very cautiously because it there turns out to be something else going on with me and I decided to chop the wiener off and do hormones and it isn’t what I need, I hear that can lead to severe depression. 

The other thing that I think it might be is a weird fetish. I read a few articles on how fetishes form in the human brain and I see a few connections there. When I was a grade schooler I hung out with the crowd of people who believed that they were werewolves or whatever. My first crush claimed she could transform at will but it hurt her or something so she couldn’t show me. I know now that it was a bad cop out for claiming that your “superpowers” couldn’t be shown, but as a 7 year old I believed it. I have a memory of being in the Forrest with her (we lived both near each other and near a Forrest) and she took her clothes off because some reason to do with being a superhuman.  I think the fact my formative sexual experience along with how I envied her ability to “transform” kind of fused into my odd sexual “kink.” (I guess that’s as good a word as any)

With the ladder theory, I still don’t know why it would place me becoming a girl that “gets me off”, and I have a third theory about how I vaguely remember an anime from my weaboo faze. It was about some dude who becomes a girl or something but I for the life of me can’t remember anything about it so I don’t think that would be the cause of any of my confusion this heavily. I’ve looked into that option a bit too much because I think it also falls under the ladder of the first two theories and I want closure. Unless somebody in the comments talks about my anime theory being a possible source of my odd feelings, I’m tired of there being sporadic blips of “gender bender anime” in my search history.

The other thing is that I don’t find guys sexually attractive, so unless I am a future trans woman lesbian I don’t think it is a likely option but I want to tell you all because I want/need help with this. 

The reason that I named this thread “oh how being a teenager confuses me” is because I wonder if this isn’t normal to a certain extent and it’s just part of being a teenager.

I was finishing high school and had no idea what I wanted to do with life, but everyone told me to go to college, so I applied to universities, got accept and went off to college. I didn't declare a major and spent most of my freshman year pursuing playing music with my band like I had been doing for the past few years. I figured I would keep on working through college and everything would someday align and I'd find my passion. 3 years later I still had no idea what I wanted to do, and it was time to declare a major. I couldn't put it off any more and still be enrolled. I didn't want to waste all that time and money on a degree I'd regret getting, so against everyone's advice, I dropped out to take a year off. My band gained some attention, we started to travel, and one year turned into two, and then finally the steam died down and happy with what I had accomplished, I returned to the ""real world"" with no more of an idea of what I wanted to do than before. I've spent the 3 years since bartending and moving around whenever I got bored, and finally I've made the decision to go back to college for my bachelor's in philosophy and then go to law school. Which brings me to why I'm asking Reddit for advice here...

TL;DR 

I'm 26, I have ~80 credit hours under my belt from my state university, and other than sending in applications I have NO IDEA what to do to get back in or what to expect. I don't know if I should write essays or if standized test scores are even usable? I took the ACT in '09 and scored a 31 composite, but I have know clue if that would still be worth including or even eligible. In 2015 I took the ASVAB when I enlisted in the Navy and scored a 98, but I'm not sure if these are applicable, haven't been able to find much information on it. I wasn't enlisted long enough to get the GI Bill, and I also have no idea how FAFSA works as I graduated early and my mother did all the college paperwork. My credit is terrible from the student loans I still have and haven't been able to pay. 

So yeah, if anyone can chime in with any sort of guidance, I'm open.

I live with my sister and mom my parents got divorced December 2017. My problem is I want to move back to city a by myself to finish highschool but my mom would be incredibly sad because my sister is also moving out in September. Moving back to city A would make finishing school much easier for me in the school system in city A I have 19/30 credits completed and city B I have 9/20.  City A has people I love and have know my whole life and so many friends my age who I still talk to I’m not scared to start a new school there and wouldn’t feel ashamed to retake a grade there is I need to, housing wouldn’t be a problem and with a minimum wage job I could make up to 795 a month which would cover everything I need without help from others. Over all moving back to city A would mean I finish school in a safe space feeling comfortable and happy being able to live a lot happier life then I am now.
In city b my relationship with my mom and sister is tight i love them both but even before this idea came up all I ever thought about was moving out by my self and how happy I would be and how my relationships with family would probably grow. I have to friends in city B who I love and would miss a lot but that problem can easily be overlooked-with everything in city A they have many other friends and I’ve talked to them about this we would miss each other but that would be fine. The only downside to leaving city B would be missing my mom sister and my cat if I can’t bring her. Moving is the best option for me and my future but i  so scared about her reaction and if she might get depressed once I tell her somtimes she wants I move back to city A but there is no way that’s possible with her job and I don’t want her to be home alone depressed without any family living with her, I think even if I told her about my idea and she said no our relationship would get messed up. If I had this conversation with her it would be harder then coming out. Over all I want to move for my education and mental health but don’t want my mom to get depressed is it a good idea too even tell her if so how do I have this conversation or am i way I’m over my head for wanting to move.

They want me to teach 4 different classes and I have to create the lesson plans from scratch. It takes about an hour to make a lesson plan for each class each day (usually more - picking questions, formatting, making alternate versions, creating homework) and while I'll be teaching 6 hours a day, I might end up working for 10+ hours a day.

157,"**Background**

So bascially i have old friend i've known since I was 18, currently the oldest friend i have (who i still speak to) .  We meet in an online roleplay group every so often (frankly when it suits him).

He lives 8 hours away from me. by train so your talking a day travel time. 

We've been growing apart reccently and there are three main factors behind it.

**The bad stuff**

1. His politics worries me, i'm not up for a poltical discussion (like if you start one i won't even acknoledge it) his views on immigration seem similar to far-right talking points e.g it's less ""I think there are some issues with immergration and how it effects the jobs market "" (which i wouldn't agree with but i wouldn't say your a bad person for thinking that) and more ""immergrants don't adpt to our culture and don't belong here"".
2. He's not changed at all.  He's unhygenic like last time i stayed with him there was no soap in the bathoom (and he didn't seem to notice there was for the entire weekend), he dosen't seem to wash cutlery, at one stage when we where having cake he took a knife which he'd just usef to cut chicken, rubbed it on a cloth rather than washing it (admitedly i'm vegiterian but that can't be good even if you are)
3. He can't be wrong, and assumed a much wider breadth of knowledge than he has to the point of making up facts. 

**The good stuff**

1. He appeared at my wedding was pretty good bestman, and is bascially loyal, and fun to talk to... most of the time.

**Decision**

he's off to another country for at least a year, so this is the last chance i'll get to see him. (relatively speaking he's off in august)

1. Just go put up and shut up (he wanted me there for about there for half a week, i've talked it down to a weekend)
2. Make an excuse (likely a family emergency) and delay until it fades, this will probably cost the friendship and i'm not quite ready to do that
3. Something inbeetween like cancel and try to arrange a day later.",02Jul2018,1
158,"So, me and my boyfriend (both 25) have been together for about 2 years now and for the past 6 months we’ve been quarrelling about the same thing and not moving forward. Basically, he is closer to girls and most of his Best Friend are females. He tells me his friends are strictly just friends and he doesn’t divide them based on their gender but I seriously do not like the idea of him hanging out with them. I know they are friends before me and there is absolutely nothing for me to be worried about but I can’t get over it. So in order to make me feel safe, he stop hanging out with them ever since we got together. 
However, recently he has been telling me he is at the lowest point of his life rn because he lost like 70% of his social circle and he feels very affected by it. And now that I made up 90% of his life he is not contented because he feels like our relationship is not moving forward, and he feels that he gives up his social circle for me and yet this relationship is not working out like how he wanted it. 
A little back story: he used to have ALOT of friends (everywhere he goes he gets recognised) but now he rarely goes out and the only ones he hang out with are guys. But he feels that guys can’t give him good advice so he wants to reconnect with his female friends to catch up+ seek advice. He ask me would I rather he lie to me when he goes to meet them or be honest with me. Of cuz I choose honesty but in my heart I really cannot accept it.

Is this a sign that it’s time for me to let go? He explains it very clearly that he feels that nothing in his life is going well rn, and I am a major part of that problem. I know that if I hold on to him then I am just plain selfish, but I can’t help but think: why can’t he be content just being with me?

164,"I met this guy about 8 months ago, he is a friend of a friend. Initially I messaged him to inquire about a friend's party because he was the closest person to the host and I couldn't contact the host. 

Then we talked a bit, he seemed okay/cool but nothing more. I felt a little awkward because he seemed a little too aggressive in trying to become as close as possible in a short span of time. It felt like he was rushing this friendship or whatever, and I felt uncomfortable but ignored it. 

Then he started to act moody because I wasn't as ""affectionate"" to him as I was to my other, closer friends. Uh... obviously? But I called him out on it and he stopped so I was okay with it.

Then a few months later, he confessed he is really into me. I wasn't sure if I liked him that much, honestly. I was kind of skeptical of him from the beginning and I don't know why. But he was a cool guy overall, seemed intelligent. And he was really forward with his approach over and over again, that I was like okay I will go on lunch and that's it. I softened up to him. 

So we casually dated for a couple months until now, I was thinking yeah he's pretty cool and it was going okay.. he was still how he was in the beginning - pretty cool. A little bit clingy but I ignored that part

But holy shit. Nowadays it's just too much. My family was visiting me after around a year and I was spending time with them, and he kept acting shady towards me saying I am ignoring him and neglecting him? Obviously that pissed me off and I replied coldly saying it's my family of course I'll spend time with them... don't say it like that..

So he replied with something like ""well sorry to bother you I'll take my leave since I'm not wanted"" etc. and I said okay, see you later, and went back to spending time with my family and doing some work.

Then it just kept happening. He kept playing the victim card that I am abandoning him or that I don't care about him or that I am being mean to him.. when really I just plainly stated I'm busy with my family so my responses to his texts aren't as fast. WTF. We haven't even exchanged ""I love you""s yet because I don't love him, yet he keeps trying to say it. 

I know he likes me more than I like him, but am I being a bad person? I feel like it's my right to spend time with my family and focus on my work, but that might be my bias. Should I apologise and try to give him more attention or should I break things off? I am honestly starting to get really annoyed because he keeps shading my family saying I should give him more time, and when I say that won't happen he pulls up the victim card. That is completely unlike the way he was in the beginning, he seemed so confident and cool and SELF ASSURED, not clingy and victimising like this.

But I don't know, maybe I am just only seeing this in my perspective. Someone please let me know your thoughts on this and any advice if possible :(

166,"Hello Reddit, I have been a member on this site for a little over a year now I believe. I wanted to ask some advice of all of you regarding a situation that is currently taking precedent in my life. I need to give some backstory and explain everything before i ask my advice. This first started on my birthday where i was with my father on the weekend because my parents are divorced. (Side note they are friendly towards each other so this is not an issue about them). It was my 16th birthday and I was expecting something from my dad so I was very excited.  That day we went out in the morning and my father and grandma who was visiting at the time got some food at a restaurant that I don't like. I didn't eat any and we got some good food from the grocery store and that was it. The entire day we did nothing else, my dad didn't get me any gifts, didn't have a party at all or anything. I was extremely disappointed, my dad during that day acted extremely rude. I wanted to go to dinner at BJs because I really liked the restaurant and wanted a nice birthday dinner. We tried to force me to go to this other shitty restaurant even though I really didn't want to go. He begrudgingly took me out to dinner and did not speak a word to me the entire time and acted all pissy. We got home and I went to bed closed my door and cried, he was so shitty it fucking hurts and we are not doing to bad for ourselves so money wasn't an issue. The next day comes around and my mom picks me up. She gives me a really nice birthday night and everything. So that week I talk to my mom and tell her I don't want to go with my father as usual on the weekend. He doesn't call me for the entire weekend and that point I was pissed with the events and didn't want talk to him yet. The next week comes by and he stills doesn't call me. On the third week I decide to send him something via text, I talk to him about that night and why he still hasn't called me. I talk to him about the night and the problems I had in our relationship, I talk to him about how he has forced me into unhealthy habits and lifestyles, how we don't really seem to connect anymore, how I always attempt to bond with him but he never bonds with me. A week later and he still doesn't respond. And then another week and then another week and then another week. it has been over 2 months and I still haven't talked to my dad. I went through phases of sadness, disappointment, and now anger. So the question and advice that I ask of you Reddit. 

Should I try to through away all of dignity and try to be the bigger person and contact my dad and try to make things right and make a beginning call to restart out relationship? Or should I make the Ending call and tell my dad that he obviously doesn't want to be in my life and that our relationship is over?",02Jul2018,1
167,"I was debating posting this in r/mentalhealth but I guess there's more people here. 

I've recently moved back in with my parents as my mom is battling terminal cancer and my dad needs the extra support. They're both in their mid 60's and understandably not like they used to be. However as much as I love them they both have some deep seeded mental health problems that have grown over 40 years of being together. 

Our situation at home is that just the sight of one another causes all of us to lash out at each other. Every problem or issue we ever had with one another comes out into the open and things we've buried in our past come out in the open. These aren't small disagreements, but hour long shouting matches and every trigger in the book used as ammuniation against one another. 

The problems stem with my dad and how he deals with stress. He was one that could never make a decision and for every wrong move he took he would blame us for eternity. He's the type of person that enjoys picking fights and intellectually trumping people for the simplest things. He's incredibly narcissistic and never admits his faults. He's physcially abusive and when he feels he's not getting through to someone he moves the arguments to his fists. Sometimes when he couldn't hit me he took it out on my mom and sister. 

It was so bad that no one would ever sit infront of the tv because we knew he would start fights for no aparent reason. My mother had sent us to private schools and he would start fights with teachers and would always threaten to pull us out of school. He would blame us for  his money woes when he wasn't paying for our tuition. We grew up with constant stress, blame and torment. There was never a quiet moment in our house. 

My mother on the otherhand is strong personality and can only communicate while yelling. She voices her frustrations in a monologue regarding everything that went wrong in her life. Her anger comes from my dads treatment of her and how she didnt have the financial independance to leave him in the first place. My dad had taken control of all her money and used them for failed investments or support extended family who were making losses. He did the same with me and I don't have any savings in my name. 

Its really hurt my career as the options available to my friends from high school are out of reach for me as I have anxeity, ptsd and chronic depression. 

Now recently my dad is realizing slowly the damage he's done. His forceful nature has cripled us and yet made us resent him further. With my mom now having cancer i'm trying to get the family to calm down for one in their lives but its not happening. My dad would either trigger my mom or she would remeber the pain she went through and now has nothing to show for it as my sister and I grew up damaged as well. 

Has anyone had any success in turning around a stubborn and narcisstic family member? Going no contact isnt an option, because though i'm saving myself the damage is still getting done when i'm not there.  My sister chose the no contact option and she hasnt spoken to either of my parents in 6 years.

178,"I am very anti stealthing, I consider it sexual assault. I believe everyone in a sexual situation has a right to body autonomy especially when it comes to penetration. Nothing should be inside your body without your expressed consent. 

I know the situation I’m describing isn’t stealthing as there was no deceit. But it’s very steal thing adjacent.

I have heard from a friend who heard from the friend in question. That he penetrated his girlfriend without a condom without her consent. In the telling of the situation that I received she quickly realized that he wasn’t wearing a condom and stopped him. They had exclusively had sex with condoms before this. They had a fight and are maybe broken up. She went in a different state for the summer for work so their relationship status is hazy. From my understanding they’re working on their relationship that may mean just staying friends or may mean dating again in the future.

I have no idea why he did this. I know he knows he fucked up and regrets it. As neither of the people in the relationship told me I don’t know the circumstances. Neither of them know I know and it’s not something you bring up.

I can’t think of any situation that makes this behavior acceptable. There are situations that could make his behavior less reprehensible. Were they both very drunk and he forgot to put a condom on?

Had they talked about it and she seamed open to it but never agreed to it?

His intentions would be good to know.

I have a rule of thumb “Distance yourself from people who’s behavior you find morally wrong”

There have been friends in the past that I have cut ties with because their behavior was not ok by me. I’m pretty close to this guy and it would be hard to cut him out.

However, I feel like I'm wasting my high atar (GPA of Australian high school) score by doing something artistic.

Long story made short, my parents have been separated for a few years after my dad had a lengthy affair. My sister and brother took sides with him and he of course doesn’t discourage that.

191,"My boyfriend (H) and I grew up in the same neighbourhood in a big european city. Our neighbourhood is very diverse, so a lot of our friends have immigrant parents, or are even first-generation themselves. H's best friend is of african descent, and he really loves him, he has a tattoo dedicated to him. So you can imagine my surprise when I overhear H having a conversation about Zimbabwe, where he is saying it's a shame it's not Rhodesia and so on. We were at a party, and I was really taken aback, but I didn't want to scare him of, so I tried to talk to him about it in a non-confrontational way. In response to my questions he said he was a ""racial realist"". I figured I would talk to him about this phrase once we were sober and in a different setting, so I kind of left it.

However, the fact that I asked him about his views seemed to make him want to open up to me more about it, so later in the evening when we were sitting together, he started saying there was something he wanted to tell me about, to present to me, but that he didn't want to do it now, he wanted to 'get his facts straight'. I kept saying I was looking forward to it, and that it was probably best to wait. Now, it's worth mentioning that H sometimes expresses inferiority, due to being a high school dropout, while I go to university. It bothers him a bit, but he's also really proud of me. I'm one of the very few people from our group of friends (who grew up together) who went on to further education.

A few hours go on, and by now we're pretty drunk, H and I have just stopped dancing and are kind of standing, his arms around me, in a corner of a club, he has to talk directly into my ear for me to hear it and as my back is towards his stomach, I have to turn every time he says something to react, and say something back.

He says in my ear, I want to tell you what it is I want to talk you about, but I don't want to talk about the details yet. I say okay, I feel like it might be better to wait but I can't imagine how big a deal it can be whatever he's going to say. Well... I was desperately wrong. Cause I kid you not he said ""The holocaust didn't happen"". My jaw drops a little and I just kind of stare blankly out, but he can't really see my face, and when I've had a few seconds to digest the shocking statement, I turn to him and say ""Let's talk about it some other time, not now, not when we're fucked"". Not long after I say I want to dance with one of my friends, and so I go over to her.

I can't talk to any of my friends about this, because I don't want to tell them that H said what he did. I have a bit more sympathy for him because of his background, he comes from a family filled with abuse, addiction and poverty. But I have no idea what my next step is? Do I have to convince him the holocaust did happen? I think he will feel like I'm belittling him if I try, and don't let him present his views first. But I seriously can't stomach listening to someone deny the murder of millions of innocents.

TL;DR My boyfriend confessed to me that he doesn't believe the holocaust happened, and now I don't know what to do.

195,"Background: 

GF of 6.5 years and I are both working in the Middle-east with well paid jobs. 

GF is not happy with the life here because we have few to no friends, and there's nothing to do in this sandpit. (People in this country merely co-exist rather than live together due to cultural differences).

I am happy with my job and there are promotions on the horizon. Although having few friends, I can live with the loneliness as I want to invest and buy property ASAP.


Situation:

GF got a good job offer back home in Europe and she absolutely wants to go back. But it would mean I have to resign and follow her if the relationship is to stay. 

**If I follow her to Europe**, we will advance in the relationship, we will get married in a year and have kids in 3-4 years. But I will career will suffer as I don't speak the language, and I had been changing jobs quite often in the past 6 years. So, it will take me time to look for jobs and my first job would probably not be good because I wouldn't have any bargaining powers as an unemployed. in short: keep relationship but my income will be reduced by half and my career would likely stall for a few years.

**If I stay here,** it would mean an end to the relationship. But I get to keep my job and a stellar (hopefully) career. I would be able to buy property in 3 years, and with the power of compounding, my 40s will be easy. But it's difficult to get in serious relationship in this country because people come and go.

Other concerns:

- If my gf dumps in Europe, it would mean I'd lose everything
- the middle-east is volatile, it is not a permanent solution
- I had change job twice in the past 6 years due to headhunting. I don't think it looks good on my CV if i don't stay in my current job for at least 5 years
- I am indifferent about having kids or not
- Europe has 50% tax, So, I would save only very little money
- I am from a single parent family, struggled a lot financially when I was kid. I am afraid I would repeat what happened to my mom, end up being losing everything because of her trusting dad fully.

Yesterday we (8 people) went to a friend's house, had some predrinks and eventually went to the club. With us, was Emma's best friend, James. James is rather a shy and fragile person. He's good fun but he suffers from depression and anxiety. It's been roughly 1-2 years since he sees a therapist and since he'd been doing that, he was feeling better and slightly more confident. What I (the writer, not Emma) learned yesterday, is that he stopped seeing his therapist 1-2 months ago and also quit his hobbies.
Anyway, we were all out in the club and everybody was having a good time, or at least pretending to enjoy the evening. In the course of the evening, Emma and another guy who was with us (who we met the first time yesterday) were dancing together and eventually started kissing and stuff. From that point on, we noticed James' change in behaviour. He stopped dancing and moving all the way and looked kinda frightened. He wasn't feeling good at all. From there on, things happened quickly and I'm not sure who told me what part. Thing is : James was having a panic attack. The reason? He saw his best friend Emma kissing some other guy who we all knew for like 3-4h. When we were walking home, Emma finally told me everything. James is in love with her since quite some time and he feels like shit everytime he sees her best friend showing affection to somebody but him...
Emma is in a shitty situation since she does not love him back and she made it clear several times, even though they've been best friends for about 5-6 years. She can't tell him straight away since we all are pretty sure that he will be absolutely destroyed when he learns the truth that way. On the other side, she is afraid to go out with all of us any more because she can’t get close to someone without feeling guilty or without his best friend having a panic attack (or even worse perhaps).",02Jul2018,2

201,"First time poster here.
Before I’m going to get into it I have to list a few things. I live with chronic pain and my life is horrible, I am failing school atm, I suck with girls, I don’t know how to control my feelings and I am way to direct.

Here is a list of important stuff to know.
1. Me and this girl are taking the same bus in different directions, so we see each other before and after school, wait for the bus and talk.

2. My friends are all from other parts of the world, but we still treat each other like brothers.
One of them has a identical twin and because I am the wannabe funny guy I always tell the story of how his mom actually had triplets and that she gave me away because I was to cool for their family (sounds rude written down, but I am the exact opposite of him)

3. Everyone thinks/knows that mentioned friend and girl are in love, even though they both don’t want to talk about it.

4. The girls parents want her to marry someone from her country.

Let’s start with Saturday.
At 00:01AM I congratulated her, because it was her Birthday. The message wasn’t received, it was only sent, I figured it would be normal at that time. I actually went to a totally different birthday party with mentioned friend. It was fun, but at night she still hasn’t gotten my message. Because I knew that they text a bit I asked him if it’s the same for his messages and he told me that her parents took her phone.
Sunday I get home in the morning, she text me and thanks me for congratulating and I go to sleep.
Monday morning she was not happy but not sad she was just... It felt like nothing.
I didn’t think much of it (You know, the „time of the month“ joke), but I still wondered what happened.
After school she refused to take her bus and says „In 10 minutes there’s another one“.
And me being the stupid fucking retard I am, I looked at her and asked calmly „You Parents don’t want this with you and him, do they?“ and she breaks down in the middle of the Central Bus Station. I have NEVER seen her cry before. So I didn’t know what to do. I just said that everything is going to be fine and that there’s a solution to everything. I said “ I would offer you a tissue, but I don’t have one.” And I said “I’m so sorry i didn’t want to make you cry”. She didn’t say anything except “Did you have to say that”.
She got into her bus and left, I walked home and told my mom I’m not hungry (I’m feeling so sick).

What the hell did I do?
Why did I do that?
And how can I help her? 

I am really sorry for any unpleasantries due to my grammar and/or person.

Same thing is happening this month, another negative result on the HPT although it's now the 2nd of July. She's going through a lot of stress lately, with school, friends, family and our own relationship problems. I still try to do my best to comfort her since we already saw the negative result. But you still can't be 100&amp;#37; sure, hopefully not but she could be pregnant but too early into the pregnancy thus giving a negative result, or other cases that give false negatives.

207,"My mum is currently using a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 from 2012 (yep).  To put that into perspective, I made this post in 2018, so, it is quite an old phone.  This might sound weird to say online, but my mum is the best mum I have seen in my life.  I really feel she deserves so much better.  She is turning 50 years old in some months, so I want to gift her with something super special.  I want to break out my savings and buy her an iPhone.

**Skip 4 paragraphs to skip rants.**

Why an iPhone?

Firstly, I've actually just failed my GCSE exams in mathematics and computer science, the subjects which were once my favourite and I thought I was good at.  I feel like Androids and free/open-source software are just for geeky macho men, ***in my opinion***.  I'm looking for new interests, and along with it, slowly trying to make our technology stack a lot simpler.  Apple products are easy to use and never force me to figure stuff out; I'm too dumb for that, I failed my exams, remember?

Secondly, I have a bone to pick with Samsung and the open-source geeks.  I totally did not like how Samsung gradually slowed down my mom's phone after she installed only a few updates.  It's like planned obsolescence.  We tried to factory reset it and it's still slow.  There is also a notification light that is permanently on even after factory resetting it!  The first official update we got from Samsung also made apps crash and the interface looked like crap.  The open-source geeky community also get on my nerves.  As part of a computer science project, I have had to work with them many times, and I just don't like them.  So, you can understand my frustration.

Lastly, I am a proud user of an iPhone 6S, and my mum and I are planning to buy me the iPhone coming out after iPhone X this year.  As an iPhone user, I want her to have one too, so we can use iMessage, for it is such an awesome app.  My mum goes to work everyday and having a good chatting app can help us connect.  Not to mention, the build and app quality on iOS is designed for users, not for geeks.

Alright, so...  I was wondering if I should take out money from my savings to buy her such an expensive thing, without her permission or not?  The problem is, I don't know if she will be happy or sad when receiving an iPhone as a gift.  She knows that I want her to deserve the best in everything, that also includes the best phone.  But will she be upset with me breaking my savings to spend on a pricey phone?  This is a dilemma.  I don't know if she'll be happy or sad.  She always tries to encourage me to save money, but she really needs a phone.

Thank you.",02Jul2018,1

210,"Excuse me is this post makes no sense, I wrote this in a rush and I don’t want to read back over it because it will just make me cry. Im not even sure this is the right subreddit so if anyone has any suggestions on that please let me know! 

For a bit of background: 

I have a friend who is in a really dark place. She has attempted suicide twice now, ending up in the hospital both times. 

Yesterday me and a friend had to forcibly take her to the hospital, it was either she came with us or we called the cops. We made this decision after calling several hotlines, she had made plans to attempt, and hadn’t sleep more than an hour a night and hadn’t eaten any food in 6 days. This was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life, I put my best friend in the most stressful situation she had ever been in, I’ll never forget the looks on her face. She went from deep sadness where she couldn’t talk, to anger, to obviously looking for ways she could escape. It was traumatic for us all, and it’s something I wish I never had to do, but it helped, she has been set up with emergency counselling, has seen a doctor who has prescribed her an anti anxiety medication to help with her sleep on top of the anti depressants she is already taken. It worked, she slept like a baby last night, every time she snored I cried, it was a step in the right direction. 

What I’m asking for advice on is where to go from here, she’s set up with help, but how do we come back from something like this? I’ve broken her trust in me, she told me things she didn’t want to tell anyone else and ended up being dragged into hospital against her will. I know that we will be alright eventually, and she has since cried with me and thanked me for taking her, but she can’t shake the feeling of anger and betrayal. 

Do I step back now? I want to keep helping but the more I force myself on her the more she will push me away and I need her to be able to trust me again and be able to tell me things, she finds it extremely hard to open up and I was the only person in her life that she got to the point of being able to. I have promised her nothing like that would ever happen again if i knew she was getting help. 

I feel so lost, I don’t know where to go from here or what to do, all I want to do is camp out at her place and watch over her 24/7 and never leave her side, I don’t want my best friend to die. 

Also, I’m putting together a journal that she can write in, with words of encouragement here and there and lists of what she can do to distract herself, if you have any suggestions on things that helped you or a friend when in a low place please let me know so I can add it in to the journal. 

Any advice on how to look after myself after yesterday is welcomed too, it’s affecting me in a very big way.

212,"Recently my grandmothers mental health has been declining rapidly and it’s coming to a point where she’s a danger to herself. 

To begin with, she has stayed in a mental hospital when she was in her thirty’s (we don’t know why, but know it has happened) and have always known she wasn’t completely healthy mentally. 

However, recently her mental health has gotten extremely worse: 

-She went to her doctor and the nurse told her the side effects of the medicine she takes for her foot that is swollen, one of which was liver failure. This caused her to believe her liver is failing and she stopped taking her medication and refuses to. 
-She lost her insurance card and believes her best friend stole it and sold it to somebody who has now stolen her identity. 
-She believes that anyone who calls her house phone gets their identity stolen.
-She told my sister that her and my grandpa have cleaned out their savings because she is dying (grandpa doesn’t know why she thinks this) 
-She believes her neighbors have set her up and that they are going to steal her house from her, she constantly gets up and looks out the front door and says “they’ll be here anytime” 
-She thinks my cousin is in prison because he called her phone and his identity got stolen and because he works for the government, the gov’s identity got stolen and he is in prison because of it. 
-She tells us she wishes the phone would stop ringing when it hasn’t rang at all. 
-She won’t bathe or eat 
- and lastly she thinks her and my grandpa have a suicide pact together, that she’ll kill her self and he will after her. (We’re very afraid that she will kill herself because of this) 

We don’t know what to do to help her. We tried to have her admitted but she will not consent because in her mind everything she says is true. Our hospital will not evaluate her without her consent. We don’t know how to prove she can’t consent. 

Please give us advice on how to help her. ",02Jul2018,1

214,"Before you say to use curtains hear me out. I live in a small complex of apartments/flats (here's a picture of a similar looking one so you get the idea what I'm dealing with, we have one balcony and 4 windows just like on the right [https://imgur.com/a/9RVUjQj](https://imgur.com/a/9RVUjQj) ). We live on the first floor/ground floor. About a year ago I was laying in bed (around midnight) already half asleep and the door to our balcony was open so looking from outside of the flat you could see inside(our bedroom). Which is what this freak did, he was looking inside as my girlfriend yelled that someone was outside looking inside (note: the guy is tall as hell, must be at least 195cm/6.4' to see in). I thought it was just someone passing through under our balcony as thats what people sometimes do around here to get a shortcut. We didn't bother with it. 

7 months later I noticed underneath our windows that there are footprints in the snow leading directly to our windows from the pavement and a giant square piece of concrete appeared there as well. I could barely move it but I put it a few meters away from the window into a bush nearby. Days later I hear knocking on the window, my gf screaming for her life as she gets scared easily. I go to the living room window where I see a police officer outside knocking. He told me that they caught a guy masturbating underneath our window standing on the concrete square for better visibility. He asked if we were having sex or something, I said no I wasn't even in the room which he was peeking into, only my gf was there eating a damn kiwifruit fully covered underneath a blanket. Also it was -5° degrees outside and the dude was somehow wanking off. He was looking through a gap we leave for our cats to look outside. 3 days later I was checking if anybody's outside and I saw the fucker running around our windows trying to find a gap or something. 3 days after he was arrested?? I dont get it. I was looking from the bedroom through the balcony windows. He noticed me back and started running. I thought he ran off but as I was calling the police I saw him running back and forth around our windows. I couldn't see his face and I don't believe he saw mine either. The police didn't arrive. I keep seeing evidence of him walking over the flowers and the tall grass now. It must be him because no one else goes that close to our windows even when people use the shortcut close to our windows. I told my neighbours about him, they have never seen him. 

I'm planning on getting shutters but that's not a solution. I was looking for some cameras but that's just so damn expensive. I'm just afraid of him taking it to another level breaking into our home or hurting us, you never know.

What do I do. Should I bait him and call the cops when he comes? I just don't know what to do. Honestly just wanna hunt him down and cut his dick off but I'm afraid he would enjoy that- any suggestions are welcome, thank you.",02Jul2018,1
215,"So at my workplace we have a staff appreciation board. My boss was supposed to take care of it but eventually I was given the opportunity.

My self esteem was at rock bottom and I had panic attacks at work and cried every morning before I had to go. I felt like I was going to be bad at everything I ever tried again. Then I moved so had to move to another job in a hotel and it was amazing. I picked it up quickly, I get on well with my coworkers and I in general really love it there. The only problem is that all I want to do is make coffee all day. 
I have a real passion for making good coffee, which would have been perfect at costa but for the fact that it was an unpleasant work environment. Nobody else at my job cares about coffee, which is fine except that I have a dream of one day running a cafe. 
There’s a different costa near where I live now which isn’t as busy as the one I worked at and I’ve always enjoyed talking to the staff as they’re really down to earth and chilled. They’ve expressed interest in offering me a job there which I’m considering taking, as the training they give there would really help me work towards my goal. 
Obviously I’m concerned about leaving a job I know I like for somewhere that might make me feel really bad again, I just don’t know if the promise of really specific coffee training is enough to risk it.

217,"Today I learned the hard way that no matter how old you get, the people around you never seem to grow up.

I type this as I’m sat in the shade on my own eating a really crap sandwich which reflects my mood -  crap, shoddy and flat. 
Looking totally independent sat on my own when the reality is I’m steering over the fact my best friend has fallen out with me and as a 30 year old grown woman I’m struggling to understand why. 

Let me just prewarn you, this may be the most immature story you have ever read but maybe the wonderful people of reddit can open my eyes as to why this happened - you are after all my company on my lunch break as I sit alone. 

I’ll start this story from the beginning where all stories start- my friend... let’s call her Jane. We met as we worked with each other many years ago and formed a strong bond. 
I hadn’t ever had a friend like Jane before she so funny and we both understood each others personalities and both supported each other no matter what, I’ve helped her through a really shitty long term break up from her partner and tried to get her to love herself again bla bla bla you get it - general friend stuff! 

Anyway cutting out half the story we both moved jobs and ended up working together again. In my new job role I was placed with another member of staff let’s call her Charlie. 
I absolutely loved Charlie she was / is the kindest person I had ever met and just genuinely made the work day so much better. 

As I was placed with Charlie management saw it fit that they pair us up for any large events etc. This was when I saw Jane turn... I received a text from Jane one evening that said she felt like a third wheel and didn’t want me to be friends with Charlie. 

Okay, fair enough maybe she was feeling left out I don’t know but I tried to reassure her that she was obviously my best friend but I 1) can’t just be rude to Charlie and ignore her when I’m also her friend 2) when I’m at work I’m at work I’m not here to make friends. And I took her out for dinner to make her feel like she was still my friend. 

I noticed then that every time I spoke to someone no matter who it was...she would either start bitching about them to get a reaction or she would begin to blank me or I would receive a text saying “why the fuck is she talking to you you’re mine” 

Hahaha.... I would just laugh it off every time. Girl you crazy. If she spoke badly of someone I would just let her say her bit and nod. I’m her friend after all I’m supposed to listen to her right? 

Anyway here comes the downfall of our 5 year friendship in one day. 

On Thursday all 3 of us were on lunch everything was fine, Jane had someone stop her to discuss work so I said I’d heard back up to the office as I had a meeting...
That afternoon Jane seemed to be ignoring me in the office and come Friday didn’t speak a word to me then left after half the day was up without saying goodbye... 

We have each other on the find my friends app, you know the app you can track your friends/family/boyfriend and I began to notice that Jane was turning it off every weekend and completely blanking my texts, she would leave work without saying goodbye and barely speak at lunch.... 

After this weekend and completely blanking me again I decided to confront her about it today and ask what is going on and told her out right that I haven’t got time for her pathetic drama she needs to grow up and that if something is going on I can’t chase her around playing guessing games part of being a friend is to be upfront and honest with each other. 

Jane simply replied that we are mates but not as close as we used to be and that because I went in the lift with Charlie back to the office and left her she was fucking pissed off. 


Infact here’s her exact reply... 

“Mate I had nothing to say to you after you and charlie full on blanked me at lunch and walked off on me then your talking about how Your brother blanked you.. feels shit don’t it. If someone came to talk to you quickly and I fucked off back to the office you’d be pretty fucking pissed. And Friday you didn’t exactly say anything to me.. I’m not the one who has to chase you around to talk it should be a 2 way street. I just said I ain’t fucking blanking you and I’m still your mate it’s just we ain’t close anymore evidently but I ain’t gonna be a dick and blank you hence why I still said morning to you.” 


I replied. 
“You were talking to XXXX I said I had to go back up to the office I had a meeting. I would never expect you to wait for me. I don’t get pissed off at stuff like that Jane cause it’s petty. But ok you do you and see how that goes, as you say “evidently we aren’t close” so let’s neither of us put an effort in to resolve that. 🙄 fucking nora. Go eat a frigging McDonald’s and sort it out woman. “

I tried to make light of the situation at the end as we usually get a McDonald’s if we are having a bad day but I got no reply after that and she has completely blanked me all day since then... 
I’m honestly at a loss here, on one hand I have an extremely jealous and possessive friend who has never been happy for any recent success I’ve had (moving house, good relationship, getting a dog, being promoted) and doesn’t like me being friendly to anyone but on the other I have a friend who I have had a good time with and some good memories with who I wouldn’t want to lose but it’s genuinely making everything so awkward at work and it’s just difficult! 

I’m trying to just be as positive as I can but I’m really confused as to whether I’ve done something wrong or whether I’m dodging a bullet here. Any advice will help.

Pants/Jeans: I love Levi's. I like Chino pants. The colors I like are Black, Light Blue, Dark Blue, Gray, Army, and Khaki. I like denim, slim fit, and regular fit jeans. I love wearing pants. They also talk crap about me because I prefer to wear pants as opposed to shorts in the summer. It's just what I'm more comfortable wearing.

Shirts: I like graphic tees, Nike t-shirts, Baseball tees, Henleys, button-downs, and custom fit polos. 

Sweaters: I LOVE cardigans, I like half zip-up sweaters, shawl collar sweaters, v-neck sweaters, and turtlenecks. I also like sweatshirts and hoodies. I don't like flashy or designer sweaters, just casual.

Shoes: I like Nike's, Adidas, and Converse. They talk crap about me because I'm not into the shoes everyone else is into. For example, Kyrie Irving's or the new Jordan's everyone wants. And I like shoes that are solid colors or just two colors. I don't like shoes that are colorful or flashy.

Coats/Jackets: I LOVE Peacoats and North Faces.

Shorts: I like shorts I just don't wear them that much. I just like to wear shorts that are one color. The same colors I listed for pants I like to wear in shorts.

Miscellaneous: I also like to wear digital watches. I don't like to wear chains or jewelry. They tell me that my clothes are too small. Mind you, I'm 5""8 and 120 pounds. I'm a small framed guy, and I like to wear clothes that are fitted. I don't like to wear baggy or loose clothing. Black is my favorite color, so I wear that a lot. My family thinks it's too gothic. They tell me I wear the same clothes all the time when I don't. They tell me I don't dress my age and that I dress older. They say my style is very plain.

I just wish they would stop judging my style of dress! It's what I like! How can I get them to leave me alone?

224,"This is extremely scary for me to write this publicly but I just need some advice from a wider audience, people who don’t know me, not just my coworkers or close family.

Currently my situation is this. I’m 25 and I’m working as a server. I live in the US but I am not from the US. I’m full time and I make good money. Financially I am comfortable but I hate it and I cannot do this for the rest of my life. After I finished high school I took a gap year to travel and then I started university at a great school on a great course. I struggled so much, my head was a mess. I had no direction, no motivation, no friends, no confidence and I was living at home with my grandparents which was miserable too. I had severe anxiety and I ended up experiencing episodes of depersonalisation. I guess I just burnt myself out from constant thinking and worrying. I started taking medication but I couldn’t get my shit together and I failed my first year. I went into my second year and half way through I ended up deferring to take some time off as I was a mess. I started working full time at a bar but I was drinking a lot, sleeping around, doing drugs etc. All I cared about was socialising, partying, travelling and having fun. I didn’t think about the future and I didn’t think anything mattered. I never saw the ‘point’ in applying myself. But now I feel like this is all catching up with me. I’m full of regret about fucking up and missing all the opportunities that were pretty much handed to me at 18/19/20. 

But, now I feel like I have really grown up and I feel motivated to do good things. I’m tired of letting anxiety hold me back and I’m tired of being lazy and making excuses. I know I am capable and talented deep down but I have no confidence. And, I’m feeling really anxious about my future and whether I’ll ever get my shit together. More so, I don’t want to wait tables all my life! 

I’m terrified that I’m going to fail and the voices in my head keep telling me it’s too late for me. I swear, my brain hates me. 

Here are the few first steps I am taking:

1) Going back to university. My application is sent and I am currently just waiting to speak to an academic advisor to discuss my options.

2) Practicing my writing skills. I’ve always been okay at writing and I used to love it when I was a kid/teenager before my head went to shit. I figured this will help me when I go back to school and it will be good for me to have a creative outlet. Words are free!

3) Fixing my attitude and adopting good habits. I think my biggest problem is my thoughts so I decided I would try thinking more positively. I am also trying to develop good habits to hopefully help me break out of negative thought cycles. 

4) Setting an appointment with a therapist to help me learn more strategies to cope with constant worrying, negative thoughts and some traumatic experiences I haven’t yet dealt with. 

But, I’m terrified that this is all in vein and that I’m too old or it’s too late for me to do anything worthwhile with my life. I didn’t do anything at all productive when I was in the  key part of my life when I had everything going for me. I rejected it all and now I have nothing going for me. Now, the people I went to school with are doing great things and I’m just here clocking in and clocking out. 

Honestly, when I think about it it just makes me want to cry and at the worst of it I contemplate suicide sometimes. 

So, sorry that was such a long read. I just have these questions:

Is it too late for me? I keep looking at people around me and I feel so behind.
Is it all a waste of time and effort? 
What do you think of my ‘steps’?
Am I kidding myself?

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this drivel. ",02Jul2018,1

Most times I ignore him or tell him to go and be with his girl because he knows I’m not the type to ruin a relationship. I guess his girl saw it and instead of blaming him she put the blame on me. She told me I looked 12 and that he isn’t thinking about me anymore he has moved on to better. Then she sent me a picture of the two of them coupled up in a car just to boast about it even more. I blocked them both afterwards but, I didn’t think looking young in the face was a bad thing until now. He already left me to be with her and that had made me a little insecure off back, now this.

232,"Some background: my dad has just finished one year of a two year tenure abroad for his job. I'm a junior at a college which is in a different state to the one I live in. In December, both my dad and I had come home for winter break. I had accidentally seen a slightly suggestive message he had sent but then my dad had closed it and I hadn't been able to get his phone away from him to take a look. So i let it slip from my mind and tried to forget about it, since I didn't really think he could be the type of person to cheat. This summer, he has come to visit for about 1.5 months, and again he's been really paranoid about both me or my younger brother (who is a high school senior) getting close to his phone, and I've also noticed that he's started making a lot of mean comments about my mom while she's not there (previously they used to be more like light hearted teasing but now they seem really pointed). I was able to get hold of his phone yesterday when he wasn't there and went to his messaging app and saw that he's been actually messaging two women about meet ups and it's been going on pretty regularly. Now i'm really unsure of what to do. My family's super close knit but also we don't really talk about our emotions/feelings ever...the one time my brother tried talking to my parents about his anxiety he was immediately brushed off with the typical statements like oh you're just thinking too much, it's not that serious etc. 

So I don't know how to bring this up with any of my family, or even if I should bring it up and risk what our family has right now, especially since both me and my brother are still in school. I keep on thinking that this might just be a short term thing because my dad is far away and lonely. I don't know how to act around him either, we've always been close and had a good relationship but now I feel like that was all a lie and sometimes I'm really snappish with him but then other times I forget and I fall into our usual conversation flow. I'm really tempted to just box it all away and try to forget that I even saw those messages (even though I'm thinking about them like 90&amp;#37; of the time) and hope it all gets better when my dad is back here for good, but I'm not sure if thats the best option. I don't even know how I would start this conversation with my mom or my brother if I decided to tell them (I'm really close with my brother and tell him a lot of what goes on with my life).

But calling off 3 days my boss told me I needed a doctors note now, and then I missed another 2 days from that so now he needs a doctors note and Human Resources need a doctors note also. Now I’m supposed to call HR also if I qualify for short term disability but Im not sure if I want to go with that. So I called my boss and told him I came down with a stomach infection and have my doctors note for all this, and he said that’s fine as long as I bring a doctors note/call HR. So I go to immediate care, I’m honest with them and tell my situation. I get a doctors note, but all it has on it was that I visited the clinic at a certain time, that I was Ill and needed to be treated at the clinic with my doctors approval. But on the note nowhere that it says I should be off work for a week, there’s only the date of when I came in. wondering if I went back to work today what should I expect?

237,"Hi there. I am really hoping that some of you would lend your perspective on some stuff going on. I am feeling very upset but don't really want to talk to anyone I know about it. Apologies for the wall of text.

My mother was widowed when I was ten, and at that time had serious health issues. Shortly after that my ""golden child"" older brother left home for university. I was left in a depressed home with a mother who was understandably shellshocked by her life threatening illness and the death of my father. I was physically fairly well cared for but emotionally neglected even as I was left in a caring role for my mother as she sporadically went for more operations etc. Even when I was a young child my mother would expect me to look after her when she was ill, and she would not even mention to my brother that she was having operations.

Fast forward a couple of decades and my brother has moved to the other side of the world and had great professional success and has a wife and several kids. I have had a spotted career in a difficult industry and remain single. It is assumed that I will continue to provide any care for my mother. 

After a difficult couple of years I had decided to go away for the summer and do some long distance walks. Mostly alone, but friends had arranged to join me for the best sections. But my mother needs emergency heart surgery. I have been told to come home and look after her. She didn't even tell my brother about the surgery. She has not thanked me or commiserated with me that I am missing out on my summer. She has repeatedly gone on about how bad she feels about letting other people down - she was going on holiday with her boyfriend who she doesn't live with, and my brother who was coming to this country for a week next month who she was going to take on holiday (I was pointedly not invited).

So I am cross that I am being taken for granted, that my plans are deemed unimportant. I told my brother that I was sad about my trip and messing my friends about. He said I could rearrange. 

I am also terrified that this pattern is going to go on. My mother is kinda relentless when she wants something and completely unable to view anyone else's perspective when it is different to hers. I feel like the only way to limit the demands  in any way would be to stop it completely and cut myself out of my family's life, which you will understand why I do not wish to do.

I am very sympathetic to every thing she has gone through. Her mother was cold and undemonstrative before her. And her continued ill health and my father's death were very difficult. Through all that she held a demanding job and kept a roof over our heads. 

But I have also come to realise how much pain and life opportunity caring for an unloving parent has already cost me. I am over sensitive, and though I try to be less so, so much of my emotional energy is spent on my mother instead of relationships of my choosing. Any advice on how I can protect myself by becoming more emotionally detached would be most appreciated.

239,"female roommate is alcoholic, drinks every day but is high functioning, has not been single for more than a few days at a time since 15, gets drunk, sleeps with someone, and cheats on every bf.

male roommate is long-term single, desperate for sex, sees every girl that talks to him as opportunity, socially graceless, tends to lash out at women when he doesn't get what he wants.  

put them in the same house and.. i've heard them have sex 2x but im certain it's happened more often

male roommate doesn't try when others are around, basically gets her alone, gets her drunk (not hard to do) and pesters her into going along with it, and because she has sexual trauma in her past (my guess is that she was molested when young) she is vulnerable and eventually lets it happen, says she doesnt want it to happen but... i dunno

she's told me that she's never told him no, and when i confronted her about it after hearing it again recently she said that she hadn't blacked out, knew what she was doing. one of the reasons that i decided to involve myself this time is that only 2 days before it happened again, she said: xxxx doesn't respect me, xxxx doesn't care about our friendship, i dont care about xxxx. and then she spends the whole day with him, gets stupid drunk with him and finally has sex with him, of course also cheating on her bf, again. 

when i talked to her about it she didn't want to me talk to xxxx. i talked to her about seeing therapist, said she made appointment but i dunno, said she was going to talk to xxxx and tell him it had to stop, dont think that happened. i talked to her about moving out, initially she seemed into it but the very next saturday she was doing the exact same thing with xxxx. 

at that point i basically decided it was her life and if she wasn't going to change anything i couldnt make her. ive been trying to move out myself but cant afford it yet. ive felt very powerless to do anything about this despite knowing that xxxx has basically been raping her for years, even if it is somehow 'consensual'. 

but this is the question after all that. is there anything to do when a woman won't change her unhealthy situation?

240,"I understand that the title, for lack of a better explanation, may seem idiotic to some. But the story is a bit more complicated so for those who have time to read, I thank you very much for your time.

(Bit of background, up until two years ago I lived a difficult life filled with depression, addictions, self-hatred, bitterness, etc.. But two years ago i had a moment where I realized that needed to change. I took a journey and began that transformation and although I am not even close, I have made progress. But my story hit a bit of a roadblock and I could use some advice (something I would never ask for in the previous me as I was just closed off and bitter) I'm a 26M if that could add any additional perspective)


Five months ago, at what is now my previous job, I met someone who I developed a strong emotional connection for (call it love). Being in the state i'm in, still recovering from the issues above, I fell madly in love with her. It was great, at first, like things always are. And she did alot, without even knowing it, to help me on my journey of self-discovery and improvement. But there was alot of bad too. Irregardless I loved her deeply. Eventually she was having trouble at work with the management so she quit. She found a new office (same type of job) that she really liked. She told me about it and how they needed someone for the position that I held at the job we once worked together. Well, I was crazy about her and so I quit my job and went to her new office. She put in a good word for me, plus I made a good enough impression, to be hired. But things just dissipated with her soon after. She stopped putting in any effort to see or call me. (And the nature of her position is one where she is in the office inconsistently so i didn't see her that much at work). So for over a month there has been barely any contact and that which is there seems shallow from her no matter how hard i try. And I get it, she is entitled to feel however, or not feel, for whomever. 
But now i'm trying to figure out what to do from my perspective. I only took this job to be with her, which quickly backfired. The position does pay better than the previous one I've held but I don't enjoy it. And anytime she is in the office I feel like I take a step back emotionally and I feel so horrid about myself and my situation. And i'm struggling with this heartbreak and being in this office (When I began my journey I started eating right and working out intensely. I was successful for two years, consistent and happy to be improving. For that last month and a half I haven't work out and my eating is terrible due to this issue).
And I know this may seem ""pathetic"" to some and let me be frank, it sure is. But it is miles of an improvement over the person I was before my journey and I'm trying not to fall back to being that person (but this issue is weighing heavily on me. I know I took this job for the wrong and selfish reasons and I shouldve thought how it could end up if the one thing I wanted out of that job, her, was not an option anymore).

Should I resign from this job?

241,"I don’t think I can/should talk about my situation right now, and I hope I can get this across. I’ll try as best as I can.

In short, my anger comes from me feeling a sense of injustice. Not for myself, but for another situation involving other people whom I know. But I feel very much emotionally tethered to this issue.

Another thing is that my anger is made of pure frustration (and protectiveness) and much less... sympathy, if that makes sense? I am just a ball of rage.

This thing is also recurring (has been for a couple months), so I get angered every so often. It gets so bad that I feel like I lose control of my thoughts as I seethe. After a while of this, I rationalize to myself and try to trivialize the issue in my head, but honestly, the issue just comes up again and I get angry again, and it takes up a portion of my day as well as my positive mood.

Do you guys have any tips on how to just... let go? I’m a pretty calm person usually, but this struck me so hard and I’m not used to anger so I don’t know how to go about dealing with it.

I feel like my rationale isn’t strong enough. You know, the part where you talk to yourself in your head to calm yourself down?

243,"TL;DR - long distance best friend refuses to talk about anything besides ex-bf (they broke up in Nov17). She's admitted to being crazy (see full story), asked her about her new job weeks ago and never got a response until yesterday, “ran into \[ex\] and some girl. She works at \[redacted\] club, she’s beautiful \[her first name and last name\]. find her on fb.” No interest in looking her up on fb or discussing this further (drained from only talking about her and her ex for almost a year now). what do I say and when do I let go of an unfulfilling friendship?

\[28F\] I have lived in a different country than the woman who was the maid of honor \[30nextmonthF\]  in my wedding for almost a year now.  She’s smart, beautiful, and she has a great high paying job.  Since I moved, we have only talked about her now ex-boyfriend (they broke up in November).  He was emotionally abusive and he is a drug dealer (which I found out right before I moved, a year into her relationship).  I’ve been sending her paragraphs of good advice, letting her talk it out, and being as supportive as I can.  When I say paragraphs, I mean PARAGRAPHS to her questions, “did I do the right thing,” “was I wrong,” “what if he dates someone else.” I have recommended she go back to her therapist, as she previously struggled with depression but she just says she can't be honest with them.  I have told her I can’t keep talking in circles about it and I no longer know what to say.  She’ll tell me she agrees but just circles back to him, “I just don’t understand this..” She will ask me the obligatory, “how are you doing?” question but once I answer with just a sentence, she’ll move the focus back to her and her ex.  If I bring up an issue I’m having (first fight with my husband), she’ll respond like, “you’re fine,” and “it’s just hard.” I am not exaggerating the shortness of her answers.  Our friendship became strained when she started avoiding me for weeks following loads of thoughtful advice.  It turned out she was still seeing him even though they were still broken up.  They would argue, it would blow up, and then she would resurface, asking me the same exact “what did I do wrong?” questions.  

I also learned from her she is kind of the problem.  I love her and I’m not commending her ex but she’s kind of crazy.  She’s confirmed all this: she’s broken into his social media accounts to spy on him and confronts him what that info, shows up to places she knows he’s at, and shown up at his apartment without his permission to scream at him for not texting her back.  

The final straws – around a month ago, she told me she wasn’t going to talk about him anymore.  I said it was a great idea, mind over matter.  Our conversations were been few and far between.  I’ve asked her about her new friends, a new guy she was seeing, her new job. She barely responds.  I recently left my remote job and took a foreign job. She hasn’t asked me anything about it or my life.  

Finally, 12 days ago, I asked her how training was and mentioned how excited I was, no response until yesterday, “ran into \[ex\] and some girl. She works at \[redacted\] club, she’s beautiful \[her first name and last name\]. find her on fb.” 

1) I have zero idea how to respond this. Her ex, no matter how horrible he is, is fully entitled to be with another girl since they’ve been broken up for seven months. 2) I have zero interest in looking up this girl on facebook.  My friend has shown me social media profiles for other girls who also dated someone she did and all she wants to talk about is their looks, face, boob jobs, etc.  I am 28, my friend is 30 next month, these are not productive conversations. 3) I am emotionally drained.  I am negative and frustrated due to always trying to help and having her ignore me. I am tired of hearing “I won’t talk about it anymore but I just really can’t get over \[x\].”  I am sick of being in a one sided friendship where she clearly doesn’t care about me but has taken advantage of the fact I’ll always respond.  

I have anxiety related to my inherent need to please everyone and she \*was\* the maid of honour in my wedding so I’m not sure what to do. How do I respond to the most recent text?  And how do you know when you have to let go of a friendship for the sake of your own happiness?

So last month (June) I had some financial hardships that resulted in me paying my rent just over two weeks late (I was fired for personal reasons and took a pay cut on my new job - now I also have an additional part time job so I’m ok this month). I did communicate with my landlord the entire time, updated her regularly, made payments when I had the money and sent her receipts and such, etc., but I’m sure she’s annoyed regardless. I just moved in in April and she took a chance on me despite being uncomfortable with my tip based job, just because the property manager really liked me.

I’d like to be an easy and outstanding tenant from now on, because paying rent super late like that isn’t something I typically have to do and I don’t want her to have terrible expectations of me, or risk not having a reference when I move out. 

Aside from paying on time every month moving forward, what can I do to be a great tenant from now on? I’m 20, and this is only the second apartment I’ve ever had. The first apartment was a much larger complex with much cheaper rent and was owned by a corporation. This complex only has 9 or 10 units, everybody knows each other, the property manager lives on site, and it’s owned by a woman and her husband, so I care about lasting impressions a lot more here and don’t have experience with this setup yet.

Any advice greatly appreciated, and if you think there’s a better sub for this please redirect me!

Thanks!",02Jul2018,1

255,"So to start things off, we only dated for around 3 months. I struggled being honest about who I was because of my last relationship. He eventually told me he was thinking about breaking up but wasn't sure and that he'd ""keep me updated"". I asked for advice from different people and they urged me to end it, as he was always very manipulative and denied his wrong behaviors. Before we started dating we both promised we'd be friends no matter what, he said he'd only date me if I agreed to that condition. We're broken up now for about two weeks, and I've been trying my best not to fight with him, but he constantly picks fights with me. Anytime I go out with any guy friends alone or in a group, he asks me if I'm sleeping with them or if I'm going to. I have never cheated on anyone in my life so I don't know why he asks me that. He assumes I'm lying when I say that I'm trying to stay busy, and he's paranoid that/ accuses me of blocking him from viewing my story on Snapchat, or pictures on my Instagram. He tells me that he doesn't care about me and that if I try and be his friend maybe he'll care about me again. I want to be his friend but everyone suggests that I cut off contact with him. I've told him that maybe we shouldn't be friends because of the constant fighting, but then he calls me a compulsive liar, and tells me I'm just like my father. He knows that becoming my father is one of my biggest fears. I'm stuck in a constant loop because if I don't stay friends I'm a liar, but if I do stay friends, he hurts me. I made a Reddit account just to make this post, and I need advice asap. If you have any further questions on specific things I'm 100% willing to give details on anything at all.

256,"So I don't have a lot of friends, just one that I'm close to. This means that I don't ever really have someone to talk to. My one friend says that they will always be there if I wanna talk, and I know that they truly care for me and enjoy me. But since I don't have anyone else to talk to I end up texting them a lot. I think it annoys them because they just ignore my messages. I know they see them because they will be active on Instagram or something, but don't open my messages.

 It really hurts and when I confront them, they just make up excuses like, oh I didn't get them, but then they open them right after I talk to them about it. I just want to know how I can not annoy them with too many messages. 

(I know the obvious answer is to just text them less, but I really enjoy talking with them and like I said there isn't anyone else I can go to)

I’m not saying I’m in the right, but keep in mind she led me on super hard almost a year ago and didn’t tell me she had a boyfriend and would refer to her boyfriend as “a friend”. I stopped taking to her for a while in December after she told me she was having issues, and when I asked her to talk to me about it she said: “we’re not close enough for that”.

261,"I have this friend I've been having trouble with for a few years. Well, it's not really him, but more so me. This was all online by the way, I don't know him in real life.

I've had issues with anxiety for a long time, but for reason meeting this person took it to a whole nother level. Admittedly I think I'm kind of asshole, because it all started when I realized I probably had a crush on him (He's gay and I'm a girl, so that would never go anywhere anyway). I started getting jealous that he would hang out with his other friends more than me and that he didn't talk to me a lot, but I'm being a hypocrite because I don't have much to say anymore either. I also felt absolutely terrible that I had a crush on him even though he's gay. I ALSO felt terrible being jealous of his other friends being his best friends and that I wasn't. It's like I have a problem I'm aware of but I still feel angry at him even though it's not his fault.

This anger at him combined with the guilt and regret I feel caused me to get panic attacks whenever I saw his username. I decided I would unfriend him, at first for being angry with him, then every other time was because of how guilty I felt and that being friends him cause me physical pain just from seeing him. I unfriended him and refriended him like a million times, over and over and over again because I was so indecisive of what to do. I wanted to stay being friends with him, but at the same time I didn't. I keep getting in a conflict with myself over whether it's his fault, or my fault, or both of us. Even though personally I think it's my fault.

Every time I see him, my personality starts centering around him, and I feel like I need to be perfect or something and not show who I really am because I'm afraid he won't like me. I don't know why this happens to me.

He often makes me feel upset, but that's my fault, not his. Whenever I apologized or explain the situation and be honest, he just says,""It's fine."" I don't know why this response bothers me so much. Everything he says is just kind of emotionless and vague and I never really feel like he wants to be friends with me, but at this point, it's understandable since I'm an annoying, clingy piece of shit. I asked him today and he said,""I don't mind if we're still friends.""

Today, I finally decided to talk to him again, saying,""Sorry for all the drama a while ago."" and he said,""oh, wow, hi"" which I was offended by it...I thought,""Wow, havn't seen me for so long and you say,'wow,hi'""? Why? Wtf is wrong with me? Why am I such a mean, awful friend to this person?

This is the only person I'm like this with. With anyone else, I'm like whatever, I'm not as insecure with my other friends, but around this specific person, I get all angry,irritated and possessive. I don't know why.

I felt a lot better when I stopped being friends with him, but then as soon as I started trying to be friends with him again, I felt depressed, my heart started pounding, I felt weak, and started getting a terrible headache. That headache is still going on right now as I type this.

I talked to another friend with anxiety and they said he was kind of mean to them when they got anxious. So there's that I guess.

I don't know what to do and I don't know what's wrong with me. Why am I like with only one person and no one else? Do I try to be friends with him again, or do I stop trying and just accept that it's too painful for me because of all the guilt?

Sometimes I have dreams about either being friends with him again, arguing with him, or me being honest about stuff and him just saying,""oh"".

262,"   This situation started over two years ago [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3z3r16/help\_me\_decide\_if\_im\_absolutely\_insane\_for\_having/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3z3r16/help_me_decide_if_im_absolutely_insane_for_having/)

Quick recap on the last two years: we've been living in the house we had built and we've regretted the decision to have my dad move in with us since day one.  

Sure, many of the things I set out to accomplish have come to pass - my deadbeat brother is out of the picture.  

we managed to sell my dad's disgusting house.  My dad's health has drastically improved - he's lost about 100 pounds and he's actually sort of taking care of himself... I say sort of, because in all reality my wife and I are basically his caretakers.  He doesn't help with the groceries, if he ever cooks anything it's just for himself and he leaves my kitchen a disaster, and he never picks up after himself.  

We keep our house nice and tidy.  My wife and I and the kids keep up on the bulk of the chores, and we periodically have a cleaning service come and do the deep cleaning, so at least superficially he's not living in utter squalor, but thats not because he's ""turned a new leaf"", its just because I won't allow my house to be a disaster.

After an initial battle of will, he finally stopped sleeping in the family room and watching reruns on ESPN 24/7 and started living in his own room, but about two months ago he ""moved back in"" to the living room.  Sports blaring at all hours of the day, and now I can't even go downstairs to cook a meal without having to bump into him and make awkward small talk.  I mean, I get it.  He's probably lonely, and miserable.  But you know what?  it's not my responsibility to try and make sure he's happy.  It wasn't even my responsibility to try and make sure he's healthy, or a functioning member of society.  He's almost old enough to retire, and if he hasn't figure that shit out on his own by now, he likely never will.  At this point, I'm done.  I'm out.  Not my circus, not my monkeys.

I am not sure how someone can be thoroughly oblivious to the fact that their mere presence annoys the people around them, but when you've lived your entire life being a selfish SOB I can't really expect him to change, now can I?

I'm fed up with him being around.  I know now that if I don't do something it's going to ruin the relationship I've foolishly spent all this time and energy trying to save.  So I've gotten to a point where I really couldn't give a care less.  Its not like having him in my life is in any way benefitting me or my kids.  He's less like family and more like a shitty college roommate and I was naive to think that this would have turned out any other way.  I stuck my neck out and gave a fuck when it wasn't my turn to give a fuck.  And what happened?  I got fucked.

So a few weeks ago I asked him point blank - ""hey, when are you planning on moving into your own house?""

His response - ""oh, after things fell apart between me and \[his girlfriend\] I don't think I'll ever move in there.""

At this point all kinds of alarms are going off in my head: this situation just hit critical mass.

So here's the situation with the house, etc.  Both my wife and I have gotten promotions since moving in and on paper we can afford this house just fine, but we'd be doing MUCH better if we bought a cheaper house and just had to worry about ourselves without him being in the picture.  We've been discussing it, and due to the fact that my dad put some money towards the house up front when we bought it (I'll admit, he paid for most of the landscaping and put a chunk of the deposit towards the swimming pool), there is no scenario where my family stays in the house and he packs his shit and goes.  Not only that, but I really don't want to be stretched so thin.  We could get a house with a mortgage that would cost half as much and be doing fine, we could start putting some money away for our kids to go to college, or maybe take a vacation every once in a while.

Between stress at work (I have been trying to get into a new job, but just can't seem to find a new position that wouldn't be at least a 10&amp;#37; cut in pay), the financial stress of living slightly above our means in this expensive house, and the strain all this is putting on our marriage, after weeks of deliberation, my wife and I finally came to the inevitable conclusion that we just had to sell the house and cut our losses.  My dad is one work injury away from becoming an invalid and needing a 24 hour live in caretaker, and that is NOT a responsibility I am willing to take on.  No fucking way in hell.  

So we took a little staycation over the weekend to just get away from him for a while and we could go over the details and come up with a plan in private (have I mentioned he eavesdrops constantly?).  We came home yesterday and let him know that we were going to put the house on the market, and at first he seemed fine with it, but I think maybe he wasn't picking up on the fact that we -- as in MY family -- were going to buy a new house and he wasn't going to be in the picture.  So at around 10 last night while my wife and I were watching TV upstairs (upstairs is OUR area of the house, I have always considered it an invasion of space/privacy when he saunters on upstairs), I hear his ass shuffle on up the stairs and he is visibly angry.  He asks some questions about whether we've told the kids yet, etc. so then stops beating around the bush and he gets down to it and finally asks point blank

""so where do I fit in in all of this?""

with a clearly puzzled look,  I responded matter-of-factly

""I don't know what part of 'We DEFINITELY need our own space' wasn't clear.""

so he starts hyperventilating (I shit you not, he starts huffing like he's a three year old preparing to throw an epic tantrum) and then says ""I'M NOT HAPPY!""  and storms off, and slams his door.  A few minutes later he goes out into the living room and starts watching tv on HIGH volume (the speakers are mounted in the ceiling directly underneath the master bedroom floor which I KNOW he did deliberately to piss me off).  So I guess I get to look forward to a few months of petty bullshit until the house sells.  I'm hoping he's just so pissed he decides to go move into his house and leave me and my family the fuck alone.

So long story short - my dad is a selfish asshole.  I fucked up by thinking I could fix his problems and now nobody is happy.

I guess I'm not so much asking for advice as just recapping a thread from a couple years back.  I'm sure anyone who reads the original thread could have predicted this outcome but eh... live and learn.  

So key points to take away from all of this:

I learned that you should NEVER let your parents/inlaws EVER live with you.  

I learned that you can remove someone from a problematic environment and they'll faithfully recreate those same problems wherever they go.  

I learned that by trying to ""fix"" someone, you're not going to do them any favors because 

1) it absolves them of the responsibility of digging themselves out of their own shit so they'll never learn or change

2) any problem that was ""their problem"" is now and forever ""your problem""

3) in some cases, it ruins the natural boundaries that relationships, eg; between a father and son are supposed to have.  I'm not his keeper.  I'm also a grown ass man with a family of my own to think about, I don't need his problems.

I have no doubt that in a few months time this will all blow over, my family and I will have our own life, our own space, and our own privacy back.  A little older, a little wiser and carrying a little more debt than before, but we will survive this and press on, and in a year or two everything will be back to how it should be.

I also have no doubt that my dad is going to move into the house he bought and within half a year it's going to be a disgusting pig sty just like his old house.  He's going to go back to binge eating junk and he's going to gain back all the weight he's lost.  I'm also willing to bet that he's going to be lonely and depressed so he's going to let my lazy, POS brother come and free load off of him just so he has someone to talk to.  He's probably going to go back to the bottle and the pills.

And you know what I've realized?  I'm fine with that.  When I started this whole thing, my motivation was selfish and I can see now that I was wrong.  I had just lost one parent to their terrible choices and I just wasn't willing to go through it again.  I am sure that left to his own devices, my dad would have been dead by now.  He was dangerously overweight, drinking way too much and taking pain killers, living in a filthy disgusting hoarder house that would get dangerously hot during the summer because the AC was broken.  I am certain that going down that path unchecked he would have been dead by now.

He will never see that.  he'll never admit that I saved his life.  First off, he'd have to admit that his life needed saving. To do so would mean he'd have to take a long hard look at the terrible fucked up life he's lived and awful things he's put his family through by being a selfish, co-dependent wreck his whole life.

  
I know now that when you make a selfishly motivated decision that it will inevitably come back to bite you.  On paper, it may have seemed like I was doing the right thing by intervening, saving a parent from destroying themselves.  But I forgot my role in all of this - he's my dad; not the other way around.  It was never my responsibility to try and fix his problems and by sticking my neck out and getting involved in a hot mess that was never my problem to fix, I've gotten nothing but debts, regrets and pain.  So when you're considering making a decision, especially an important one like letting a family member (or anyone for that matter) be a part of your household, you really need to consider whether the choices you're making are driven by selfish motivations.  I know it could seem like taking care of family is the opposite of selfish, but I didn't do what I did out of love or respect for my dad.  I did it sheerly out of a need to protect myself from experiencing the pain of loss.    And in the end you know what that bought me?  He's managed to alienate himself, and I wish he was out of my life anyway.  so I'm right back where this all started, but now I have a bunch of debt wrapped up in this stupid ass house I bought, and I get to live with an overgrown man-child throwing petty tantrums because he's a co-dependent mess that is scared to be alone for the next couple months until the house sells.  not exactly ideal.  Watching him slowly self destruct from far away I think would have been preferable to being his babysitter and being forced to keep him from self destructing in front of my impressionable kids, and creating a toxic, hostile living environment (not unlike the dysfunctional mess I grew up in... hmmm).

264,"I’ll try to make this as short as possible and I’m not sure this is the correct sub to post under, so I apologize in advance for that. Anyway, I’ve been my moms best friend since, well since I was born...we have been inseparable. I’ve been homeless with her, I’ve lived in a truck/hotel with her, I’ve been through all of her bad relationships. There was one year we finally managed to split and I was living on my own with my best friend and I was doing pretty well financially, I was even thinking about going back to school (high school drop out here) but the past three years my mom hasn’t been the most reliable when it comes to money. She’s been a bartender/server all her life but recently it’s been hard. I work as an assistant manager for a shoe store and I make pretty decent money, but the problem is a lot of it goes towards covering her half of the bills (normally we would split everything down the middle.) The problem is, my mom just seems so toxic sometimes. She quits jobs when people disrespect her in the slightest, she never wants to work more than 3 or 4 days a week, she never wants to work anything besides bartending and when she does find low paying jobs that aren’t bartending, her pride takes over and she doesn’t accept them, she has really bad anger/impatience problems and is constantly walking around like she deserves the utmost respect at all times. I’ve paid her half in rent numerous times, up until recently I was even paying my brothers cell phone bill because she couldn’t, I’ve been paying for her cell phone bill now too, I’ve been paying the internet/TV bill for almost a year now by myself even tho I’m 200$ behind with them because of late fees and a missed payment, I’ve paid for her car insurance once or twice, too. Now, I don’t like confrontation so I always keep my mouth shut and my feelings to myself but sometimes I feel under appreciated and a little taken advantage of. I know it’s my mom and I should be here to help, but I also want to live my own life and be able to have my own money that I work sometimes 45-55 hours a week for. There’s things I wanna do but I’m afraid to do (like getting a new job or getting my license and a car) because I’m afraid of taking a pay cut when I’m never sure if my mom will be able to pay her half in bills. When I do speak up sometimes I get yelled at and told all I care about is money and she’s family and we should take care of each other and I get that and I’m always more than willing to help, it’s just stressful sometimes because I feel like I never have any money to do anything for myself. I work a job that I hate but I’m afraid to get a new job because the one I have now pays good and if I go anywhere else, I would take a pay cut. I’m just not sure if I’m really being selfish or if my mom is taking advantage of me. 


TL;DR: my moms source of income isn’t the most consistent/reliable and a lot of the bills fall on me. I feel taken advantage of, am I wrong? ",02Jul2018,1

267,"For a few months I've been working part-time at a family business. As time goes on, I've noticed that the company is on its last legs. Talking to my uncle and my grandfather, it sounds like this company used to be massive, owning multiple factories, and being a market leader in their industry. However, the company took a massive blow when Chinese manufacturers began making products with the same quality as ours, for much cheaper then we could compete with.

Since then, we've been on a slow and steady decline; forty years ago we were among the best in Europe, now we only have one warehouse, an office with three desks, and my family gets excited whenever we make more than £1000 of marginal profit in a single day. As it stands, we're barely making enough profit to keep the lights on, but I think I can turn that around.

Our company has barely been modernized post-internet. We have a website, but it looks about fifteen years old, and the company has no social media, and has never done online advertising. I think we still advertise in magazines, and it's possible our products have been promoted by the companies we supply to, but we have never done our own online marketing, and we have no social media accounts. However, I can easily fix that, I just need to find a way to explain the internet to my grandfather so he'll let me do it...

Our products have a niche market these days, but for many of them it's a market that has several communities across multiple social media platforms. But how do you explain things like Twitter to someone who has never even sent a text message in his life? I think advertising would be a bit easier (could use TV advertising as an analogy), but any advice on how to explain that would also be appreciated.

268,"I wake up, exercise, go to an unpaid job, dick around on the internet, and go to sleep. Every day.

The unpaid position seemed like a good idea when I took it, mostly since any paid positions seem to need at least a few years of experience, but there are at least 10 other people doing my same duties and I feel lost in the shuffle. The job itself isn’t fulfilling anymore— I learned all I could from the first few weeks. Now it just feels like I’m doing free labor, but I still don’t have enough official “experience” to get a real job.

I’m trying to apply places, hoping they’ll still consider me, but I think I’m either going to end up working some place for free and living in my car or working at Mcdonalds and living with my parents for the foreseeable future.

My only saving grace is that I have a few friends living in Europe and they’ve each offered to let me stay with them for a while. A few even offered to pay for my food and stuff while I look for a job there, though that would require a visa and all kinds of stuff I don’t know about.

Should I ditch my life and wander Europe for a while? I won’t get any experience, but honestly it’d be cheaper to live with them than try to keep paying for my apartment out of pocket. If I do go, is there any way I can benefit from it so I’m not lost when I get back again? I’ve been thinking a lot about becoming an author— maybe I could hang out in a foreign country and try to write? Or work at McDonalds, live with my parents, and try to write then? At least I’d be making money...

I know I need a change. I’m falling into my worst depressive episode in years. I’d greatly appreciate any advice.",02Jul2018,0
269,"Hi, 

I’m a successful 26 year old female. I had a lot of friends in high school but somehow got into drama then got diagnosed with something I was ashamed to share. The girls I was friends with in high school were kind of the materialistic, want to be model types... I, on the other hand was always into school and gaming. I ended up isolating myself and now I find that I literally have no friends. 

I’ve been told I’m pretty and used to model, (I don’t think this way) and generally speaking, people always say I’m really funny.. I made a few really good friends on video games and twitch but they can only interact through the computer. Any advice on how to make a good group of friends? ",02Jul2018,1
270,"Around February, I met a guy who was really funny and cool. We made jokes and became good friends once we started talking about deep things. My friendship with him sparked jealously within my other guy friends, but I let some of them go, because it was becoming toxic. 

At this time, I was 15 and a bit more naive. Now that I'm 16 (My birthday was the 30th of June &lt;3) and a bit less naive. I've had a little more time to observe my friend's behavior. Now, it wasn't until recently I learned that said friend was only 14 years old. His voice was a bit deep, and he talked like he was older than me. At first I couldn't believe it but after spending more time with him, it became more clear. He can not solve issues like a normal person would. The only way I can describe his immature behavior is just by saying ""He's ACTUALLY a 14 year old."" when he gets upset he blames me for being sensitive, blocks me/removes me off of social media, refuses to talk to me, that kind of thing. At first, I would get through to him, but now its ridiculous. 

I was wondering why he was the only one who hadn't said Happy Birthday to me, but today when I tried to text him and make up, it said he unadded on Snapchat. 

You're probably wondering why I'm still friends with this person, and here's why:

I LOVE to play video games. Its a therapy for me, and helps with my anxiety. My therapist promotes it, but my parents refuse to fund it (I'm looking for a job don't worry) so I was left out of many activities with my internet friends. But my friend, took it apon himself to buy me many things so that wouldn't happen anymore and I'm grateful for that. I feel like I'm betraying him and ""taking his money and running"" if I stop being friends with him over something small. 

This time, he made me upset and I left to calm down so that my anxiety doesn't flare up, and I was told by another friend that he said ""She always does this."" before leaving too and proceeding to block me on everything. Like, cant you really blame me? I get that I'm really sensitive sometimes, but this is so absurd.",02Jul2018,1
271,"I was in the Canadian Military for 10 years before I became sick and was medically released. With a medical release a member will receive free schooling for up to two years in any college of his/her choice. While also getting paid 75% of their wages while attending school throughout  these 2 years. 
So to use up my free time during these summer months I have volunteered at several youth agencies and soup kitchens to help my community and to help me get the career I have been pursuing.
My dilemma is, I have been givin an opportunity to start at the job I was seeking in the first place. This job doesn't require schooling but since the schooling was free I decided to go for it anyway. Now with 1 year of college left and the job I wanted right in front of me, I'm not sure which one too choose.
A) do I stay in school and finish it since it's free and I'm getting paid anyway to get a diploma. Then seek the job after? Or

274,"Let me start off by saying I didn’t have any experience in my job nor a degree in it. I was told I got this job based on my personality and bc they needed a back up for helpdesk. The “help desk” at the time only reset passwords and didn’t try to progress with the times. She also managed a techstore which sold computer equipment to multiple departments the last year she was there. In my 6 years I learned and caught on pretty quickly as a computer technician. At about my 4th year the helpdesk person was let go. I was called in and told that since she is no longer working with us I will have to pick up her duties but also complete my technician work orders. So now for the past 2 years I am multitasking in the mornings I am juggling help desk (actually interactive with Remote Desktop and software/image deployment), techstore management (creating purchase orders, filling orders, and inventory) and in afternoons doing technical work orders on site while the 6 other techs only have to do work orders. All of them have less experience than me but since it is a government job, we all get paid the same. We all have the same title. My immediate supervisor downplays what I do bc I don’t get “as many” work orders as the techs. He also jabs and makes a lot of comments when I ask for help. If I need help moving boxes he will say “you’re strong enough” and doesn’t help me at all, just watches. If I forget about an order he says “are you getting old.” If I reply unknowingly, he says “are you a real blond.” It all feels demeaning but since I started he’s always played this way with everyone, with me it feels a little more though. If anyone asks why I don’t speak up to our director, it’s because they have lunch together everyday. They’re practically best friends. And it’s all politics here.

278,"This is going to be a huge thought dump, so be prepared.
TLDR: I just want some advice on what to do about my family situation.
Let me rewind, It's some 60 years ago, and a man named John K Tullos (my grandfather on my father's side) is driving through some southern state that I can't remember.  At this time he is about 30.  So he drives through a poor-ish town and meets my grandmother, Carolyn, who is about 14.  He has money, so when he tells her to come with him, she doesn't hesitate.  My dad claims that he ""saved her"", but John is really just a fucking freak.  The two have a child named Chris, who dies in an MCC because they couldn't watch their kid while he was crawling onto a main road.  They then have another kid, a daughter, named Tracy, and then a son, my father, Shawn.  They grow up and live a pretty normal life, meanwhile their parents are heavy smokers, like a carton a day keeps the doctor away smokers, and the house is disgusting.  Tracy takes up smoking too, and I'm pretty sure my father did too because I have found cigarettes in his car, nicotine gum, and he uses a vape pen.  John was very abusive to Caroline, however it was not emotional.  My mother always said that John talked down to her and disrespected her.  I am pretty sure that he also convinced her to get breast implants or some kind of injections, because she later got breast cancer, which she recovered from.  Tracy was always very unstable, she most likely has a form of social anxiety, I am like 99% sure she writes a porn-blog(I saw it, not 100% sure it's her though but I have my reasons to believe it is).  She had a divorce with her husband and she really just stopped talking to everybody after that.  Moving on, my father, as I have heard, was pretty normal.  Recently though(few years), he has been acting out.  I think this may have been because when was 15-16 he was working in a Dairy Queen when a blizzard machine fell on his head and I don't think he went to the hospital to get his head checked out.  He went on to get a degree in sociology or something that he will never use because he works in retail.  He met my Mother, Kara, at Framingham State University some time in the late 90's.  From there, they get married and have two kids, my sister Anika, and me, Logan.  Shortly after, it was discovered that my father had spinal misalignment , which meant that he needed a spinal fusion and disc replacement.  He had very severe back pain so he had it done.  Over the years he had been packing on weight, which has made his pain even worse because it puts weight on his spine.  He eats very unhealthily and this has caused him to develop a very serious case of diverticulitis which needed major surgery to correct.  Post-op he is still eating shit and I bet it's going to come back and this time it will be worse.  My dad is also a big asshole, when he gets angry he becomes a child and throws a temper tantrum.  If something stops working he will smash it or throw it.  He has thrown mugs across the kitchen, smashed plates, destroyed a printer, an air conditioner, a microwave and a lot of other things too.  He talks to my mother like she is an idiot, while she is way smarter than that him.  They constantly fight every day over the dumbest shit too, but I can't think of examples right now so I'll add them later.  My dad is also a super attention whore and needs to be the center of attention for... reasons.  Every time he got surgery he got pissed that we weren't at his recovery bed for every hour of his stay, meanwhile my sister and I have school and my mom has work.  He finds a way to worm his way into peoples conversations, and he tries to be very controlling over my mom.  I don't worry that he will hurt us because my Mom, sister and I all have black belts, and my father is well, an idiot.  Speaking of my mother, I don't have much to say about her other than she has a very big ego, most definitely has OCD, and is a really bad hoarder.  Despite the OCD she hoards everything and her room is actually filled completely with clothes and the couch is also filled to the brim with clothes.  She can't throw anything away, and if I tell her she is a hoarder she gets really angry and tells me that I am ungrateful and that if she paid for something then she shouldn't have to throw it away.  Moving on, I have recommended divorce to my mother but she always just laughs and brushes it off, and I don't thinks she knows that I am serious.  it's not like she likes him either, she actually hates him and complains to me every day.  I have a feeling that since she doesn't have a very good job, that if she divorces him she will be ruined financially.  Oh yeah, I forgot about financial problems too.  We're like really poor and my parents credit cards are at like 4000$ and we are living paycheck to paycheck essentially.

286,"Background:
My son has been struggling with binge eating since he was 10. He was prescribed Abilify for an out of control cyclical mood disorder but the drug made him constantly hungry. I got it under control pretty quickly but he has stayed slightly overweight ever since then. Because he has been growing at a rapid rate, I consulted our doctor about his eating habits and he helped my son to understand what is a healthy amount of eating during a growth spurt and what is binge eating.

My son is 14 and 6’4”. He currently weighs about 250 after losing 25 lbs by exercising and curbing his binging habit. Because he’s doing cardio and weights, he’s aware that he might slow down losing weight and has begun instead to notice the changes in his body.

He is very open with me about this weight loss journey except for one thing. He will not talk about his “man boobs.” He was teased relentlessly in elementary school about them and began to wear sweatshirts year round. He still will not wear a t-shirt despite his weight loss and two days ago I realized why. He had fallen asleep in the basement and had stripped down to his underwear, so when I went to wake him up to head to a counseling appointment, I saw that he has gynecomastia and his pecs are quite large.

The advice I need:

He will not talk about this issue. He just broke down and sobbed when I made the mistake of bringing it up on the way to the counselor. He doesn’t want to hear about any of his options. He doesn’t want to talk about it at all and I get that.

Do I let it be? I’m having a hard time with that because he might have a hormone imbalance that needs to be treated. My mom brain is thinking that maybe a lot of my son’s problems could be linked to a hormone imbalance- he has depression, insomnia, gains weight easily, and the obvious breast tissue. Do I make a doctor’s appointment for him against his wishes? Help!

296,"Hi,

Let me preface this by saying that I find this hard to talk about as the reaction to what I describe is often negative and it results in people misunderstanding what enters my head unbidden and what I really want to do. I also do not think this makes me edgy. It is something the deeply distresses me and has done for large periods of my life.

To put it broadly, I have an issue with thoughts which enter my head in mundane situations. The thoughts are normally incredibly violent and the imagery is pretty vivid. 

The content of the thoughts varies but is always violent. The violence is not specific to a certain target, it can be aimed towards men, women, children, animals, or myself. 

I can give an example; I might be walking down the street and as someone walks past me I will get this really strong desire to physically attack them and it will be accompanied by images of the attack that are sometimes powerful enough to make me feel sick.

They have also sometimes involved sexual violence. 

They come on with little or no prompting and when they do it results in me becoming incredibly anxious, my chest tightens and i find it hard to breathe and I become terrified that I these are desires and that one day I might act one of them out. 

When it happens I tend to alter my behaviour. I.e, walk away from the object of the thoughts or turn around and detour home so that I am no longer walking behind a person. 

It does worsen when I am stressed or in a low mood and I can remember having these sorts of thoughts as early as six-seven years old. Earlier on it was solely revolving around animals. Same as before, strong imagery and a kind of pull to harm them. 

It just scares me that I might do something but I am unsure of how to approach this problem and sharing it semi-anonymously on the Internet seemed like a step towards talking to someone about it. But the problem is I don’t know where to start and I thought someone on here might’ve had similar experiences and can offer some advice.

Thanks in advance!

297,"Hello all,

I appreciate you read this long post, I have detailed some of the things he has told me and I am helping a good friend in his 30's trying to get over his ex of 1yr relationship.

He is finding it quite hard to move on, and is falling into bad habits.

He has lost his gym routine, starting to put on weight, largely stays indoors, his work is being affected because he has unresolved things in his mind.

A little more about his relationship situation and why he is finding it hard:

The break-up came as a bit of a shock to him, they had been together for a year. Although he was not initially that attracted to her, she won him over time and they had a good relationship and was growing to like her.

They had a lot of things in common and seemed to have similar long term goals.

They also had a lot of things not so in common, he was a vegetarian largely, whereas she also eats vegetarian things but also largely eats meat. This didn't seem like a peroblem since both went with it fine.

He is more of a long-term viewer of things, he preffered to save his money and live life in balance. Instead of going out with her all the time he used to bring things so they could cook together or he bought home made things he made to her. He cooks things at home, has to look after his home, cars, business all by himself.

She was also quite intelligent but would spend money left right and centre on breakfast, lunch, dinners, and bars, very outgoing. He liked this about her and wasn't fussed how she spent her money.

They met online, and the girl began to like him quite a lot, she introduced him to her parents after a few months and things were going well.

He is a little of the hesitant kind and so was taking it slow, one complaint she had was he never said he ""liked"" her when she asked him a couple of times.

He preferred to show he ""likes"" her by bringing her home made food, cuddling her for a long time, paying attention to her and rarely looking at his phone etc and instead preferring to listen to her voice whether she complained about work, or was excited etc.

He did little things like bring hayfever medications etc to holiday in case she had allergies, massaged her if she was in strain etc.

She was also really lovely.

But on holiday they both discovered each other a little more, she had anger / tantrum issues, and he went inside his shell when she told him off for not recognising her injury pain. He felt as though her anger was partially because of him and maybe she doesn't like him anymore and started thinking like that during the vacation and mentioned it to her.

He feels he never got the chance to convey to her how much he liked her and regrets not saying he ""liked"" her when she asked during the relationship.

He made his mistakes of maybe sharing the valentines dinner cost, but paying for other activities.

He made the mistake of forgetting she had an injury on holiday but she was showing a willing attitude to carry-on so he thought maybe it was OK for the day / time at the time.

He said these things to her, that he is sorry for not recognising those things, he also said during the break-up he liked her but because of past traumatic relationship he hesitates in opening up to a woman. Even after 1 year.

He feels quite emotional at the moment. Certain songs on the radio remind him of her. Certain moments when he is lonely he misses her.

He is only seeing her lovely side but used to complain how fussy, somewhat temperamental, illness prone she was but he saw potential in her to find out more.

In the end I think they would have broken-up anyway but they may have a push-pull relationship.

It's been a month now since they broke up, she has not contacted him and I think deep down he thinks maybe she will.

While you can see they had issues, and differences, and similarities it seems to me like it was a communication issue. Something they both could have resolved instead of breaking up. However in the modern dating culture it seems like if it's not perfect it's easier to break-up than work things through.

He has a lot of these thoughts in his head, things he wanted to tell her but now can't and it's eating him up. Sometimes she appears in his dreams where it is like they are back together.

And then he wakes up and realises the reality is different and it sets the tone for the day where he cannot get over it because it is in his mind.

He isn't motivated to date and is losing confidence and self-esteem because he has lost all his shape and fitness from the gym. He is an attractive guy with good career but seems to struggle meeting women.

He is becoming skeptical about online dating also because he thinks it's perhaps not the right place to find someone especially on free apps.

19M virgin, thinking of losing my virginity before I turn 20. Never really thought it was a big deal until a couple weeks ago...

I live in a college community of male and female 18-22 year olds. I am OK looking and have decent physique, but never scored due to lone wolf personality and very bad social skills, never attended any parties or events due to social anxiety and simply not enjoying them...

I have good money in my account so this will not dent my finances. Prostitution is legal and regulated here.

For me this is more of a symbolic move - to get the 'weight off my shoulders' in my last days as my teen... I don't care at all about the sex at all and am actually quite nervous about doing it...

307,"There is so some back story but I'll try my best to explain it. I'm currently going into my 4th year of university with a major in psychology and a minor in economics. 

I applied for an internship in my hometown over the summer back in February. Went through 2 interviews and they said they would get back to me mid May. First week of June, I had heard nothing back so I sent them a follow up email to see if they had made a decision. No response so I had assumed that they went with someone else and didn’t bother to contact me after. I was a bit disappointed but I had a potential job at a coffee shop in town for the summer so I wasn't devastated. 

Flash forward to today, July 2nd. Get a response (a month later from my follow up email) saying that the ‘higher ups’ were out of town/on vacation and they’re making a decision this week if I’m still interested in the internship.

It’s at a prestigious company but frankly I’m pissed off at how they’ve handled everything so far. I’d already moved on from the opportunity and made other arrangements and now I’m finding out that my dream internship might still be available but I have other responsibilities now. I have a job I’ve already committed to that my friend/now coworker put their recommendation to get to for me so any poor behavior on my part could potentially hurt them. I don’t even know if this internship is paid and since I'm completely independent I need a source of income. I wouldn’t be able to start til the first week of August at the very least because my work schedule has been posted through then, but I’d have to leave in September for school. I'd have to deal with moving and finding a place for a month and also potentially paying rent at 2 different apartments (one in the town with my university and one in the town where my internship is).

Any thoughts or advice on the situation would be helpful, I just don't know what to do at this point.",02Jul2018,0
308,"Hi all! My two year review for work is coming up and they generally give a raise at each yearly review. My question is, if I'm not satisfied with the offer, how can I politely but firmly counter? 

Some background: I'm a medical assistant for a large company and I've been here for two years. At this point, I can do pretty much anything that needs done within the clinic and then some. 

I started here at 18 with no experience and was making 13/hour, then at three months it was raised to 14$, at my one year it was change to 16$, and then two months ago I got a small pay bumpy for becoming the head trainer for clinic staff. 

I'm able to handle the general patient load just as any of the other staff, but I'm generally quicker getting patients in and out so I can see more of them. I took over doing inventory for supplies, became the head trainer, and am helping to develop our new charting system. 

I'm also the go to person for little help, in wound care, with computers, etc. I'm not completely fluent in Spanish, but I can do 90% of my job without help from a translator because I've learned so much since starting. 

Overall, I feel like a very strong asset to the staff and of course want to be compensated as such. I'm not looking for them to raise from 16 to 18 or something, but a solid 17 dollars feels reasonable. 

If I'm not happy with what's offered, what is the best way to counter? I'm making about the same as the other medical assistants, but generally do more work than them because of the new responsibilities. ",02Jul2018,1
309,"So I'm in a weird situation. I recently completed my first year at college and met someone in the beginning whom I never thought I would fall in love with with. So with like a month and a half left until school finished, I started having feelings for her, not for her looks, but for her character and personality (She isn't ""hot"" or one of the better looking people, but she is cute). So with the time I had left, I slowly started trying to ""advance"" the relationship. As time went on, I had reason to believe that she liked me back, but I didn't know for sure (With details, some of you will probably think it was obvious, but I'm both oblivious and not extremely confident). But I was racing time and I didn't want to rush things, so eventually I kind of accepted that it won't work (Because of summer and we live about 2.5 hours away from each other and opposite sides of LA) and I was too late and if anything should happen she would be the one to initiate. I still tried a bit after, but not much since there was like 2 weeks left of school, but now l realized that I should have kept going. I recently invited her to something in LA with me and a friend, and it took me a long time to send that text, but now I want to ask her out to someplace with just me and her. How do I do that?

313,"Hello,

So about 6 years ago my brother was introduced to this woman and they began seeing each other, about 2 months in he revealed that she was pregnant, not his but it was the father of her other 2 children who she only has a relationship now through the children. They moved into the house with my parents and I and made it an absolutely miserable place to be for 2 years, at the end of those 2 years a family member found a burner phone that belonged to her husband and it turns out my brothers fiancé was sending him nudes and making plans to go visit and play it off as her taking the kids to see their father. She was doing all this through social media, and from what I understand some of the conversations and photos took place during a big party my parents threw for her, I remember her leaving a lot that night and coming back looking nervous. 

He leaves her after she made some real nasty false claims and some disgusting comments about him and our family, and I stuck by him because before he met her he was honestly my best friend, we did everything together, even when I began dating my girlfriend  we would still hang out all the time and go everywhere together whenever I wasn’t with her. About a year and some months later he began being very secretive and hiding his phone whenever he got a message, I had my suspicions but didn’t pay too much mind until my parents revealed that he was talking to her again. She wasn’t allowed in the house when my parents were around but I’d catch her in his room all the time even when they were home, then came the big reveal, she’s pregnant and it’s his (which I honestly don’t believe) and they’ve sworn off of social media to be with each other. 

And after this talk of she’s not welcome and this and that it’s like nothing ever happened and everyone welcomed her back with open arms, but I can’t even bare to look at her, she’s a disgusting human being to me, she tried to greet me but all I could do was turn my back to her because seeing her just upsets me. I finally got sat down and told that I need to support this because it makes him happy but I told my family that I want nothing to do with their life and I’m not going to be at the hospital when he the birth happens. They’re at the house all the time with all the children and i end up in my room the whole time because i can’t bare to be around her or my hypocritical family. 

Am I overreacting? Am I wrong for alienating myself?

317,"Hey there! I'm a mentally disabled/ill 31 year old lady who finally got her first semi serious job!

I think I'm starting tomorrow but not sure. My boss said she's waiting for my paperwork to finish and to plan to be there at 2pm.

I'll be working at a Pizza place a couple houses down from my apartment, and I am SO nervous! I've had a couple of jobs before, but with my illness, I've never lasted more than a couple weeks to a month. It's very difficult when people don't understand you, or how you're such a slow learner.

I do have a good drive and willingness to learn though!

I think I worked at McDonald's for a week when I was 17 and my symptoms were just starting to get bad.

Then I worked at my college cafeteria for a week before I bombed out of school. I could not do the remedial work and it was too many people in my job to interact with. I freaked myself out so bad I had a panic attack and passed out in the cooler.

Then when I was 28, I got a job working in a grocery bakery department. Depression from my new divorce (husband cheated), and moving back home to my narc mother...it was bad. I lost my job because of a suicide attempt, an overdose. 
I was getting really good at this one, but I still screwed up Breakout with the damn muffin trays. I never got the muffins right.

I've been waiting for a while for my Depression to start lifting before I try again and I have one. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be a fast paced environment, especially with it being the week of July 4th.

I guess my question is, how does someone like me make a job stick? I love cooking, and I love making pizza at home, so hopefully I'll like this too and my illness won't get in the way.

I'm nervous that I'll just keep getting things wrong. I've never run a real register before, I've never really answered phones before, I have to pass the Pennsylvania RAMP test in order to sell alcohol (we have a beer cave), and a Subway test (because Pudgies is in the same building as a Subway), and I am just a nervous wreck!

On top of that, I just double paid rent for a fiasco from last month, so I literally can't even afford a pair of shoes or pants for the uniform! Sigh.



So besides the obvious, ""relax"", how can I make this better or easier? Has anyone worked in a Pizza place before? I could really use your advice. Thank you for your time and sorry for rambling.",02Jul2018,1

I currently work in a small office with a fellow female who I am very fond of as coworker. She is a saint and is always on my side. 

However there is one small problem. She seems to spray this body perfume on her 1-2 times a day, 3 sprays each day. We work in a very small office, windows and AC, but its only us two- it's small trust me.

320,"This is going to be a long post, but it's been coming for a while. I am 20 years old still living with my parents. I have a sister with special needs that I care about very much, she is the biggest reason I've stayed here with them so long. They work and I babysit so they can pay the bills and afford to spoil her, which she deserves considering all she's had to go through. 

I dropped out of high school after freshman year after I had moved and had to switch schools once again plus my dad had gone to prison due to drug charges. I was in a bad place both mentally and physically, I hated myself and the people around me, except for my sister of course. So once I dropped out I spent quite literally all of my time indoors babysitting and gaming. I was going nowhere and I didn't care. 

Time passed, we moved yet again and my dad was released from prison. Now I didn't have to babysit all of the time. He dropped drugs, my mom's anger was calmed, things seemed really good for a while. I decided it was time to become the man my father couldn't be and picked up my life before it was too late. I went back to school, started getting straight A's, started working out and lost all of the weight that had made me hate myself, I was doing really well until my mom's anger came back.

I can't decide if my mom is good or bad. I go back and forth in my mind constantly about it. I remember one time we were in the car and me my dad and her all started arguing. She, in her rage, decided to go pedal to the metal, speeding down the road as fast as the car would allow her until everyone shut up. 

I'm a musician, it's always been my passion and she knows that. We were once again arguing and she, in her rage, went into my room, grabbed my favorite guitar, pressed it against a hard surface and threatened to break the neck. I said fuck that and pulled her off of my guitar. I didn't throw her, I didn't hit her, smack her, anything. I simply pulled her off of my property and because of that she smacked me and my dad got puffed up like he was going to try something. I also have anger issues, so in a black out rage I punched through my door multiple times, cutting up my arm to hell. I sat down and shook in my room silently trying to calm down, she took that opportunity to come into my room and belittle me, asking me if I felt like a big man for breaking the door until her friend convinced her to leave me alone. 

The most recent example of her rage came when she attempted to stab holes though all of my drum heads, she started stabbing one, I pulled her off and she started saying I put my hands on her, threatened to call the cops, started drama on Facebook, called my grandmother and said I put my hands on her then locked me out of the house with nothing. I then convinced her to let me in so I could gather my things, and in the realization that I wasn't going to see my sister again for a while I started crying, this was at a time when she was facing the possibility of going blind so this was hard on me (she didn't go blind, she had surgery and had a great recovery a few months later). I didn't know if she'd ever be able to see my face again, or if she'd recognize me if she did go blind before I got to see her again. Once I broke down she decided I didn't have to leave. I really wanted to anyways, but I didn't. 

These are worst case scenarios. In normal everyday life she is still miserable. She smokes weed heavily, those are the only times where I can be around her. When she's sober I can't talk to her. She treats everyone like shit, yells at people or gives them constant attitude, any attempt to ask her why she's being rude is met with more yelling and anger. I've tried everything. I've tried yelling, I've tried talking, I've tried explaining, I've tried listening, but no matter what  if anybody is around her she just gets worse. We can't just leave her alone because she holds grudges, so letting her cool down doesn't work. Weed is the only thing that helps. 

I've not said much about my dad because as of recently he hasn't been bad but he has been the main cause of all of my problems. Any time he'd get high I was the one that had to  push and pull him out of the house because he was getting high off of my sisters medicine that makes her leg contractions stop so she wasn't in constant pain. We've butted heads many times. He's threatened to kill all of us, he's abused my mom, my mom's abused him, I've seen him snort pills right in front of me with other family members, he's taken me to stores when I was only about 3 or 4 and stole pills causing him to get arrested right in front of me, I mean the list could go on for hours. 

I don't know what to do honestly. I will be joining the Navy either at the end of this year or the beginning of next year but until then I feel like I'm here just living to stay alive. I'm not suicidal, I'm just exhausted and feel miserable. I know a better life is just around the corner but that doesn't fix how I feel now and how I'm going to feel when I finally get out. I don't know how to fix any of it. I don't know how I'm supposed to fix my misery right now, I don't know how I am supposed to adjust to normal life after years of being a shut in because of them, I don't know if I should cut them out of my life forever once I'm gone, I don't know how I'm supposed to fix this anger they've given me, there's so many questions and no answers. I don't know if this post will be of any help but it's worth a shot. Thanks for taking the time to read this. ",02Jul2018,1

324,"My boyfriend's 24 year old cousin ended up homeless because of some selfishness on the part of the people he was staying with. Well we ended up taking him in. I had never met him before this, either. He moved in and we started getting him set up with getting government aid so he can get his own place. We are making sure he can save his money and are paying for everything just like we would be if he wasn't there. Food is always in the house, he has access to our computer and game systems and essentially has his own room(we just have to walk through that room to get in or out of the house). We put money down to make sure he had fresh clothes and toiletries.   


He has been in our house for less than a month and we have already had two BIG blow up fights. One was because we kept telling him he needed to save his money and he blew through about $600 on nothing and we told him we didn't think he should pay for his girlfriend to come to our state for the second time in two weeks. The second fight, he literally told me that I have no business telling him to save his money when I don't have a big savings account of my own. Mind you, we aren't having him pay for any bills, any food, any supplies.  


We only had two rules when he moved in:  
1. Lock the door at night/if you leave. We even got him a key.  
2. Can't smoke cigarettes inside.  


Well he's been in the house for less than a month and has left the house unlocked 12 times overnight. Every time, we have talked to him like an adult.  


Well last night, he left the front door WIDE open. We don't live in a good neighborhood and people walk through our yard all the time, since we don't have a fence. I also have a cat, who luckily didn't get out(thank goodness she likes to sleep under the bed while we're sleeping).   


After all this going on, I don't feel safe in my house. I also don't want him to be homeless but he literally sees nothing wrong with his actions for any of the above things.

327,"I have been working for two years at a company in an industry I really enjoy.

During this time, the company has changed massively. It used to be a 10 person company, but it’s size increased 10 fold to 100 people. As a result, everything changed; the culture, the way we work, the structure... it isn’t even recognizable. 

At the end of the day, for me, I feel like I am now just a cog in a machine. I feel like I never get to do anything creative or for the sole purpose of trying it. This kind of behavior tends to meet a pretty vitriolic response. I also feel negative pride in my work recently, it disappoints me to know this is what will come to represent me. I feel this is just a product to be sold, not something crafted. 

On top of that, I feel my company has relatively negative practices. Pretty basic things like not allowing flexible schedules, not offering competitive salaries, and not allocating resources efficiently. 

They seem cognizant of these problems, and people’s complaints, but i don’t have any confidence that they’ll change, even when they say they will. When it comes down to brass tacks they always revert. 

The problem is that, in my city, there’s no other jobs in this industry.

I was so lucky to even get into the internship program because I wasn't in the running originally because of the county I lived in. The internship didn't describe what I'd be doing only that it was ""technical in nature"". At first, I got this internship thinking ""Wow!

I'm no stranger to coding but they are leagues above where I am. I really don't like them, they're hard to talk to and so different in personality to me that I don't get along with them.

335,"So I'm currently studying abroad, and speak English around my peers. Back home, I speak Cantonese. I've found that I've been interacting with people differently, and haven't been doing as well socially as I would have liked because of this.

I'm not sure if it has something to do with fluency and confidence - I feel like I know the words, but when I speak in English, a part of my brain which tells me how to reply to certain situations has just been switched off or changed. If I ask myself what I'd say in Cantonese in such situations, I would be able to then make up a direct translation. Otherwise, it doesn't come naturally to me at all.

For example, my English flirting / friend-making skills are pretty much limited to bad puns and awkward compliments, whereas in Cantonese I can hold a halfway decent conversation that goes further than asking and answering questions.

I'm also more able to suggest and articulate ideas in Cantonese (eg. in group projects or just random chit-chat), whereas I tend to just agree and go with the flow in English. Obviously saying 'yeah same' on impulse to every other sentence hasn't been doing me favors. Taking a few seconds to translate and translate back again isn't going to work either though, so if anyone has any way to overcome this, definitely let me know.

336,"My father has always been incredibly smart. He works in a medical field and is very successful. I've always looked up to him and consider him pretty much the smartest person I know. But over the last few years he has gotten really into conspiracy theories.

 I don't know if he has always thought this way and just kept it to himself, or if it is a more recent change. He will send me videos and try to get me into them as well. I normally just say ""that's interesting"" but I don't really want to get into an argument with him over his views.

From what I could tell, it started with the pretty basic idea that parents shouldn't vaccinate their kids. My mom and him now both believe this even though I was vaccinated when I was a child along with most(all?) of my siblings and we have no medical issues that could be misconstrued as being caused by vaccination.

He also watches a lot of Alex Jones, but the most recent one he has told me about and sent me a video for is this Q anon/great awakening thing. It started on 4chan and has communities on reddit now. It is all about how the ""deep state"" is controlling the world and how Trump is here to stop them along with a few other ""good"" guys.

339,"Long story short, I moved out of my shared apartment early and no longer speak to my room mate. I moved out 4 months before the lease is up and it's been 2 months since I've moved out. Today I received a call from the new apartment manager asking if I will stay or leave because my old room mate has given her two months notice already. 

I didn't know i had to provide a notice as the old manager did not mention it to me when I informed them I was moving out early. I know it's my responsibility and not my room mates, but when the new manager spoke with my old room mate, my room mate essentially just told the manager nothing about the fact that I've already packed and left, and just stated I have ""stuff left"" in my room (mattress that I was originally going to pick up before the lease ends) which she already knew about and knew that I was coming back to get.

So my question is, when I come to empty my room and do a last sweep, should I get the manager to come by and see that my room is empty, clean and in good condition as I will not be coming back again after that day. I'm assuming my old room mate will be there until the lease ends in August, therefore I obviously will not be there when she moves all her stuff out. 

We aren't on speaking terms, and seeing as she left me in the dust about the new manager, I am worried about being blamed for things I didn't do (ie. dirty apartment, damage) because I haven't been there for two months now and will be officially moved out a month before the lease is over. 

I've typed up my notice and indicated that I'll be moved out on the date I come to empty my room.

Yeah, so I had been looking for this camera forever, found a good deal on eBay, bought it, buyer shipped it on the 20th of June.

I contacted the seller to ask if that was normal, he said he's not sure and couldn't help because it is in the US. I contacted the shipping company and haven't heard back. There also doesn't seem to be an option to contact the airport's Customs, so I'm kind of wondering how to proceed.

I’ve had a “silent” crush on this guy from my school for about half a year. Since I’m quite insecure, I’ve never felt confident enough to make a move. It’s even hard for me to look at him because I don’t want him to think “ew, why is she staring at me?!” 
For some time, I actually felt like there was a certain spark between us. We sat next to each other in English class and he always smiled at me and we often “accidentally” touched and he never pulled away. 
I guess he wasn’t that interested after all because this behavior stopped a few months ago. I still sometimes catch him looking at me but I don’t have hope any more.

345,"Hey everyone.

About one month ago, I finished all my exams and decided i wanted to do something productive this summer. Many people told me to start going to the gym. I am 17 and skinny. Got some muscle but they’re small. I wanted them to get bigger. My plan for this summer was to go to the gym, read a book, study for the SAT.

I’ve already done one of these and I’m studying just fine, but today was my first day and it did not go as planned.

About halfway through my workout we started doing squats and Jesus I felt like I was going to vomit. I told my personal trainer I feel like I have nausea. He then made me do something and I felt better. I KNOW I was going to vomit. My PT is actually a nice guy. Sounds like he’s experienced I tried my best but it was pathetic. It took some pull ups and some push ups and I was dead. The rest of the workout felt like hell and I realized how weak I am at lifting lol. PT told me it’s okay and everything’s fine. Didn’t give up, just continued. When I finished came back home and 5 hours after the workout, my back hurts and my muscles feel so weird.

Before this I used to play Football (Soccer) and Basketball. I was very good at Football and then I stopped. 1 year ago I started Basketball. I freaking loved it. Didn’t start out as a pro of course, but I was a quick learner and eventually was at the top of my class. Why? Because it was fun. There was actually an objective. Score a goal. Make a 3 pointer. Dunk. Idk. WIN FOR YOUR TEAM?

The benefits seem nice at first, people respect you more, you’re more attractive, you’ll be more confident. After today I feel like none of these are worth it. Except for confidence but I was already confident before all of this so I don’t care. Mom is a manager at the gym and she said she hoped I enjoyed it. I didn’t. Nothing against anyone who works out I just felt VERY out of place. Respect.

My question for you all is: is there any reason to continue? I thought it hurts like hell, and it’s boring as hell. Should I stick at what I’m good at naturally (other sports) ? I told my father I wouldn’t go to my home country for the summer so I can stay here and work out. I can study there just fine so should I tell him I changed my mind?

And finally if you have stories you’d like to share, feel free. I actually kind of need it right now. I’m very confused.",02Jul2018,1

348,"Hi, r/Advice. This is my first post here; after seeing the awesome advice you guys give to other people, I thought maybe I could spill my guts and hope for someone to give me even an idea of what I should do next in my life.

My parents are both narcissists on different levels. I have been emotionally and mentally abused by my parents, and have been sexually abused by my now-deceased grandfather and a former student at my university.

I've gone through a lot of emotional trauma in school from severe bullying that I'd prefer to not get into; I've been abandoned and betrayed a lot. I'll leave it at that.

I've attempted suicide four or five times during my life, but am now thankful I never succeeded. I have a loving boyfriend who I'll be getting married to next year and he has helped me work through a few personal problems I've had.

I came to my university as an animation major, which disappointed my mom because she wanted me to be a doctor or go into the military. Despite that, she supports me. My dream is to open my own animation studio and create a unique business model while focusing on new graduates and women from Asian countries. I'm currently working on a short animated film to raise awareness about sex trafficking.

My dad left my family behind in March and visits every weekend. My parents fight constantly when he's here. I don't have a paying job because my ""job"" is watching and keeping tabs on my 4yo sister at all times.

I studied abroad in Japan for a month recently and learned a lot about morals, but I still feel very confused and messed up in my head.

Now that you know a little about me, here's a few of my many dilemmas:

1. I know nothing about running a business. I feel insecure in my art and stories, and I feel like I'm doomed to fail.

2. My memory is fading. I feel like I can't remember 95% of my life. I don't know if this is from the trauma I've experienced or what, but it has gotten me into serious trouble with my family and friends before.

3. I feel lost in life. I don't know what direction to take next. I'm still in school, but I feel like my life is wasting away. I don't know what to work towards. I'm sad a lot and keep to myself, and I don't find myself thinking about much either.

4. I feel like I'm going to bring misery to my boyfriend. I feel like I'm cursed in a way that makes people hate and abandon me.

I'm very scared of the life ahead of me. So, what are some ways I can feel more secure in my life? How should I combat my memory loss? How can I feel like I'm living a more meaningful life?",02Jul2018,1

362,"Hey, I’m 19 and a half and I’ve been out of high school since 2016. I haven’t started college yet, mostly because I can’t decide what to do. But now I’ve kind of narrowed down my options and the people I know aren’t really willing to let me know, since they want me to figure it out myself. 

So I used to do this thing called Mock Trial in middle school and high school. To say I was good at it was an understatement and I have several state championships under my belt. I really enjoyed it too. Which leads me to my options.

1. I’ve got a job at a big box grocery store (one of the classier ones, ahaha) and I totally feel like if I went for it, I’d be able to make a career out of it, without having to go to school. This is tempting because I really hate school but obviously the money isn’t great 

2. I could become a paralegal. This ties in to the fact that I like law, and don’t like school. It only requires an associates degree. 

3. An attorney. Obviously  this requires wayyy more school than the others. I don’t doubt I’m bright enough to do it, but I don’t want to get 3 years into my bachelors and decide I want to do something else and then spend more money on school. But it wouldn’t be worth it if I didn’t get top of my class.  (as many people know there are more lawyers than there are job openings for them)

367,"I live with my girlfriend in an apartment pretty large complex in California. On Friday night, we found a small dog on the property and brought her into our own apartment. She had no collar or dog tags. Her hair was extremely dirty, matted, and she was very skinny. We assumed she had been on the streets for more than a couple weeks based on her appearance. We fed her, gave her multiple baths, and even trimmed her hair. The level of knots and matted hair left me in disbelief. I also have reason to believe she has fleas. I was surprised this small and fragile dog was able to survive that long in the summer heat. 

She was so happy after we cleaned her up! She was running around and playing with us! We quickly grew attached to this awesome dog. We even bought her a collar, leash, and some treats. The following day, we knew that she had to belong to someone. We firmly believe in karma, and wanted to do the right thing. We decided that we would try websites and put posters up, and that if that failed we would keep her.

We went through the weekend. We never saw any lost dog signs up or any posts online on various websites.  Sunday night, my girlfriend took her out on a walk through the complex. The dog walked through the large and vast apartment complex until she eventually reached a door at a different building. My girlfriend could tell that the dog has been there before. My girlfriend and I knew then, that was where the dog probably lived. Later that night we visited that apartment with the dog.

Turns out, the dog belong to that family, and they were on vacation for the weekend. They left the small dog on the patio for the weekend.. on friday night!! I couldn't believe that the dog looked like that after less then a few hours. That means the dog looked like that while she was still with the family... There was boy  who was happy to see his dog. We were sad, but know that was that, and the story was over.

A week or two later, we see the same dog again. We bring the dog in.. and same thing. The dog smelled TERRIBLE, and her hair was already started to matt up once again. She was starving and thirsty. Not only that, but this dog still had the collar on that my girlfriend and I bought her! They couldn't even supply this poor dog with her own collar. We gave her a bath once again. The dog is very happy to see us, and vice versa. We start to think, what if this happens again, and we are not here to take care of her? (We're moving soon).

Now, here is the part where I need advice. It's apparent to us that these owners are not fit to own a dog, and we would even go as far to say this is boarder line animal abuse. We would like to keep the dog for good, because she really is a great and happy dog. We also believe that she deserves to be cared for.

368,"Okay so last month my dad and I had to travel on the PA turnpike and we were following our GPS directions. It told us to get off on an exit that was meant for EZ pass holders only (we don't have ez pass) and basically just made a split second decision to get off there, as we had somewhere to be soon. We got off without needing to give our ticket to anyone. 

Then, on the way home, it told us to take the same exit. We even deliberately missed it to see if it would reroute us somewhere else, but it told us to make a u turn and take the ez pass only exit again. We ended up taking it again and once we got to our exit, I had to pay the maximum toll fee of about 50 bucks because we didn't have our ticket. The toll guy gave us some forms to fill out to mail to Harrisburg explaining our situation and that our GPS told us to take the exit. We did a few days later. 

Today, we get a letter in the mail asking for more money from them (turnpike). Nearly 75 more dollars. This is ridiculous right? I didn't mind paying the initial 50 bdcause even though we were just following our directions, we still messed up. But an additional 75 dollars is absolutely ridiculous. Is this some sort of a scam?

375,"So I live in a condominium complex with a pretty good amount of parking spaces and everyone gets a 1-car garage. Theres an open parking area near both of our houses that can only hold 4 cars and competition for these spots is pretty high because its near the entrance, always shaded, etc. but has always been a pretty fair first-come first-serve ordeal. This asshole moved in a couple months back and has FOUR cars, taking up all spaces all the time (never even utilizing his garage which is literally 30 feet away from these spots). He also gets off work around 2pm so rarely does anyone else get parking there anymore. If someone does take it, he will literally wait until the moment they leave again to take the spot again. He plays this stupid game of musical chairs moving his own cars around making sure nobody else gets a chance. 

This past week I got off work at 12pm, including last night, so I’ve actually beat him to the spot a few times. But today as I was backing out he was there, blinker on, waiting for me to leave like a vulture despite the other 3 spots belonging to him. I hate this guy but don’t want to go straight to reporting him because once they investigate they would see that lots of other people, including us, have 3 (or more) cars. However the rest of us have the decency to use our garages and dont hog up parking like this tool but the rules here are stupid about having more than 2 cars.

380,"I went to the grocery store last night because I was running dangerously low on chocolate, and I had to pee really badly by the time I got there, so I immediately went in and asked the deli clerk where the restroom was who pointed me to the back of the store. When I got there, it was locked with a sign saying that the restroom is only open 8am-8pm (it's a 24 hour store), so I left the store and used the bathroom at the McDonald's across the plaza parking lot.

So, I returned to the grocery to do my shopping, being indecisive because my butter biscuit chocolates were no longer on sale, and this security guard blocks me in the aisle with his cell phone in my face recording me, snatches my grocery basket from my hand, tells me they have me on security camera shoplifting, and insists that I leave the store and I am banned from the property forever, and if I take one step back in the parking lot, I'll be arrested for trespass.

First off, they do not have me on security camera shoplifting, because I obviously did no such thing. The security guard made a mistake. He is a kid, and he got really hyped up, like a rookie cop making his first arrest. He was clearly nervous, but also clearly getting off from the adrenaline, and he actually went so far as to say ""you're a joke"" when I told him I never shoplift. He would also not allow me to see a store manager, and told me I must leave the property immediately or I'd be arrested.

I was treated horribly, and for what reason, I have no idea. I don't think I fit the profile of a shoplifter. I mean, it was Sunday and I had been working in the garden, so I was wearing casual clothes, but a quite expensive jacket and I'm fairly clean cut. Yet the security guard treated me like garbage and made a scene while recording it (which I assume he gets to keep a copy of, since it was on his cell phone).

This whole ordeal really pissed me off. He didn't even let me explain what really happened or why he made a mistake. In hindsight, I guess I should have waited for the cops to come and explain this all to them, but I didn't want to risk being arrested, and I don't know if it would have even helped things any.

I want to do something about this, but I'm not sure what. Of course I'd like an apology from the store, a $1000 store gift card, and the security child to be fired, or at the very least, be reprimanded and be sent back to basic training, but I know that's not gonna happen.

What can I do? What should I do? Should I even bother?

Thanks.",02Jul2018,1
381,"Dear redditors,

I am writing on behalf of my little sister who was in an unhealthy relationship with her ex. 

She had just broken up with him after finding out that he had been seeing his coworker behind her back (19) , had gotten her pregnant (she had an abortion) and is now together with her.

They shared a dog, a gift she had given him when he cleared of cancer. The dog is registered under her name, vet under her name. 

He is now asking for the dog back as it was “rightfully his”, and in doing so, threatening my sister through text about “dying a painful death” and other rude and out of line comments. Most recently he stopped paying his cellphone bill which was registered under her name, to see if it can go to collections and the only way he would pay it is if she gave the dog back. Basically blackmailing and uttering threats.

Now, without meddling too much into their lives - I want to offer her the right advice.  He’s been harassing her through text, and has completely affected her day to day and her well being. She fears for her and her dogs safety because she feels like he’ll break in and just steal their dog. 

What do we do? He can’t cheat on her and have it all - or can he? can she report this to the police? ",02Jul2018,2
382,"I am 2 years into a PsyD program (out of 4/5 depending on progress).

I have failed the competency exam, the written exam, and have not completed my prelim oral defense. This is not due necessarily to me not understanding the material. This is me not being committed to the program. I really was ambivalent since the beginning. I wanted to be a psychologist to help people but the amount of time and money is a downer. 

It is an incredibly expensive program and I feel trapped because I am two years in. The program director and I met and he seemed to indicate that he is aware I am ambivalent and its not really a concern of my competency (so that was mildly reassuring). I don't even remember why I wanted to be in this program and be a psychologist. I want to be a therapist. I also want to reach my highest potential - in myself and also in helping others. Being a helper is incredibly important to me. I got the most fulfillment working hands-on with clients - watching them grow, being there for them, offering stability, unconditional positive regard, genuine care and empathy. I also love learning and love reading studies in psychology to help me understand myself and clients better. I enjoy this immensely. I hate the tedious drudgery. I hate the amount of loans I have to take out. I feel bitter watching my age-group have babies, buy homes, advance in their careers while I feel held back by my program and the eventual huge amount of debt I have to pay back. 

Is it worth it? Am I just burned out? Do I keep going? I am running out of time. If I do not start working now the program will kick me out next semester so a non-decision is a decision. I cannot stall any longer but I do not have the motivation to continue. ",02Jul2018,3
385,"Another home post. 

But I really need some solid advice. We have talked to a lender and a realtor. There’s literally one house that’s kinda in our price range [250k] and this doesn’t happen in the area often. So I really wanna see if it would work. 

Right now we live in a 3 bedroom/1 bath apartment [Washington state]. Our rent is 1k and water/sewer/garbage/heat are paid. We only pay for power and that runs us 40~ a month. So, as you can see, living here is pretty darn cheap. He’s a penny pincher and I respect that, he’s really worried about going house poor if we purchase. 

He makes 77k a year. I can break down our budget a little bit. 
Both of us have great credit. 
He puts $450 a check away for retirement. 
He gives me $375 a check for whatever I need [I’m a SAHM so I do all the appointments, most the shopping, et cetera]. I’d be willing to shave that down however much I need to. If we got this house we’d be significantly closer to family. I visit my Grama frequently because we have an eBay business. So that would save a lot on gas. 
Rent as I said is 1k. 
Internet is $77. 
Power is $40~. 
My car payment is $222. It’s about 2k from being paid off.  He has money in savings so we could pay that off and free up $222. 
Car insurance/phone bill run about $300. 
We probably spend $400 on groceries. 

I just got off the phone with our lender and he said that 50k down would put us at 1331 for mortgage. But that’s not in my partner’s comfort zone. I realize the more you put down, the less the mortgage payment, so my Grama wants to step in and help. It’ll be my inheritance so we are super lucky to have her to make something like this possible. 

I like to think of the bigger picture. Equity, ownership, having a yard for our kiddo to play in and a place to call our own. I haven’t been pushy or anything because I understand where he’s coming from. This is a big deal and can be very scary. 

Thanks for reading, if you have any good tips I’d love to hear them!

392,"Hey Reddit, so I'm a teen and that probably reflects in the circumstances surrounding the breakup and my lack of maturity in decision making. I don't have many people, namely adults, that I can go to advice for in real life, so anything is appreciated. I mainly needed to vent, so if you don't want to hear the backstory, scroll down for a tl;dr.

Roughly one year ago, I \[F17\] developed feelings for my best friend \[F17\]. This may be a minor detail, but my friend was Korean, which is why we had a pretty touchy-feely relationship as friends. Of course, the subject of sexuality had come up before, and my friend had voiced that she was not particularly interested in men and had also frequently joked about dating female idols, which coupled with the nature of our friendship, led me to believe that we had a chance together. 

After we started dating, I noticed that she was reluctant to acknowledge that we were in a relationship (?) She didn't treat me differently, but that's what initially bothered me. Whenever I showed affection she reciprocated well, but aside from that.. she didn't treat me any differently from our other friends. At first, this made sense to me considering that this was her first relationship, and she might have been coming to terms with her sexuality as well as a new relationship dynamic. However, it's that mindset that made it so hard to recognize that although my friend cared about me a lot, she wasn't ready for a relationship and she did not like me romantically.

I eventually realized that she was just *very* emotionally oblivious to her feelings and mine. A few weeks into dating, she stopped showing as much affection, but she continued to be pretty physically affectionate with our other friends which admittedly made me feel insecure. Which I asked her about this (""Hey, \_\_\_\_\_\_, we don't seem to be that affectionate anymore; do you think you.. like me romantically?"") she assured me that she did care about me a lot, but she felt like she didn't have to be so affectionate because we were already close. This is where I made my first mistake, and eventually, where a lot of personal growth occurred. I should have realized that we weren't compatible in terms of what we wanted and that breaking up was an option. Instead, I fell into a habit of blaming myself, which only grew worse when I felt like I was ""losing interest"" in my gf whenever I felt like she wasn't giving me enough. In this time..

1. I fell into a depression after realizing how insecure I was in the relationship. 
2. I became unresponsive to my gf.
3. I developed anxiety, which impaired my ability to think logically. I became extremely self-loathing because I felt like I couldn't make our relationship work out.

During my depression, I knew it wasn't working out. I was a hard person to be around, and I definitely needed to work on myself before dating someone else. I brought up the idea of breaking up multiple times, but my gf reacted by brushing it off, saying that although my lack of response was boring sometimes, it was okay because I had my good days too. At the tim, her reaction had just made me feel confused yet relieved because I had not wanted to stay in a relationship she did not want to be in. Now repeat this conversation several times in the span of several months. Fast forward to earlier this year, I finally decided to get therapy to work on my insecurities, anxiety, and depression. And I'm happy to say it worked!  I'm definitely more self-forgiving and accepting now. It was at this point that, after a lengthy conversation, I told her we needed to take a break. I had asked her if she really thought she was attracted to me, and she said that she didn't know, and she was sorry that she couldn't give me a better answer. I don't think she actually liked me romantically though. I think she enjoyed my company as a friend, so when I brought up the idea of a relationship, she agreed to it because she didn't want to lose my friendship.

After that, I was confused about how to feel. We were still friends, but it felt unhealthy because I felt like I couldn't keep it platonic. When I tried bringing this up with her in a text (quote: ""Hey, I'm not sure if this is a good idea because I feel like I can't keep a platonic relationship with you :/), she responded with ""Awwwww"" and proceeded to change the subject. She didn't mean to brush me off like that, she's just THAT oblivious. 

I was honestly mad at her. I was pissed when I realized she didn't take the relationship as seriously as I thought she did. Was that my fault though? Yes. I clearly gave her the benefit of the doubt when I shouldn't have. My annoyance definitely showed, so my friend texted me asking why we were so awkward nowadays. I explained that although it wasn't fair to her, I had too many hard feelings from our relationship, but she genuinely didn't understand. She thought I was being petty and dramatic... She also revealed that she had felt extremely stressed during our relationship (more specifically my depression), but felt pressured to stay with me because of all the things I did for her. And I'm not going to make excuses for the way I acted while I was depressed. It would make anyone feel kind of down, at the very least. But I wish she would have told me this earlier. I mean, I knew it had bothered her and kept trying to talk it out, but those conversations felt one-sided on my part. Since then, we've mostly talked it out, so I think she understands what happened (but not to the full extent). 

I still think she thinks of me as a friend and doesn't see much reason to think otherwise. But now I just see her as an ex. Although we're on good terms since the last time we spoke, I don't trust myself to give her the kindness she deserves. I know her reactions stemmed from a lack of emotional maturity and she's a good person with a lot of potential, but I'm still pretty salty. I still see her from time to time, and honestly I'm just kind of passive aggressive. I'm trying to distance myself, but it's proving to be difficult because we also share a tightly-knit friend group that (with the exception of one person) wasn't aware of our relationship. What's the best way to proceed in this situation? Has anyone experienced something similar, and if so, how did that end up working out? If you've stuck around for this far, I just want to offer my thanks haha. I really appreciate that you took the time to read through that. c:

**tl;dr :: Broke up with my gf of one year when I realized she didn't like me romantically. We started off as best friends and I believe she wanted to go back to that. However, I have too many hard feelings leftover from our relationship so I don't think it's possible. I also don't think she deserves the resentment I feel, so I'm wondering how to best work through that.**",02Jul2018,1

And while I love my job, the company I work for, and my boss and coworkers, I don't think I will be able to make ends meet after the savings are gone. (about 1-2 months worth) After I calculated all my expenses, I'll have roughly $80 to put toward extra things like an emergency. And that's at only $25 a week for groceries for two people. 
Also, my job is seasonal, so at most I would be there until October. That's good and bad because I might be able to hold on and live on very low wages for three more months. But if I wait until October to apply, it might be a month or two before I am offered another job.
So I'm stuck. Should I leave a seasonal, low paying job that I love to pursue a job that is more financially stable but that I might hate? Or wait until October?

403,"Hi, a couple days ago I made a post on r/personalfinance about a new position and an increased hourly pay rate, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8va2jb/how_do_i_go_about_asking_for_a_raise_i_never/). If you don't want to read through it I'll try to recap what happened. Basically, a few months ago, I got into a complication with my direct supervisor and put in my letter of resignation. The Sate Manager and Senior VP of my company had a talk with me and convinced me to take a different position with the company and they had me sign a paper that showed I would be making more than what I was making. 

After three months of eagerly looking through my pay stubs to see if the raise had come in I sent an email to my payroll department at work and the lady at HR responded today with, "" I sincerely apologize as this was an error on your new position paperwork. Standard practice when someone is transferring position is to pay the same rate of pay they were already earning. Which is xx.xx/hr in your situation. I'm sorry for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused."" 

Upon reading this I was extremely disappointed and pretty much lost all motivation for this job. I didn't reply. I sat there for an hour just letting it sink in. The only reason I didn't quit was because I thought I would be getting that raise. It was because of that raise that I decided to move out of my parent's house, otherwise I've been living paycheck to paycheck with the hope of one day soon receiving that raise that never came in. I don't know what to do, It's not like I can quit and find another job, because I have nothing saved up. 

Both the State Manager and I signed that paper saying that I'd be making more money and apparently It's worthless? I don't even know how to feel. I've had a knot in my throat all day",02Jul2018,1

411,"I don't know, I wanted to ask because this happens to me a lot, and it's frustrating at times. It's also just really bizarre.

I have vivid, realistic dreams. Always have. But often, I have distinct memories of something happening that other people have no recollection of. Sometimes I clearly remember when it was just a vivid dream, other times I swore it happened. Also with my dreams, when they're bad, I can tell myself to wake up. I had a bad dream last night and decided that I wanted to wake up so I did.

Anyway, some examples: I ""remember"" having a conversation with my stepdad about the Slayer concert that I had planned to go to recently. He was saying ""I don't like Slayer because they're heavily involved with hard drugs, almost all of their fans are methheads."" I asked him where he got that information and he said ""you can find it anywhere, just look it up and you'll see."" I remember looking it up in real life but I couldn't find any information about Slayer ""being involved with hard drugs."" I asked my stepdad about it a few days ago and he was so confused; he said he had no idea what I was talking about and that he doesn't think that about Slayer or their fans, that he has no recollection of that.

Another thing, I remember seeing a post online that a girl I went to high school with made about how people shouldn't go to my neighborhood because there's a ""cult"" back here. Other people commented agreeing with her, that it's spooky and strange. Again, I was just confused; I've lived here for 10 years and I've been almost everywhere here, in the woods, in the trails, down every street, and I know a lot of people and there's never been anyone scary. I searched online again to see if I could find that post but I didn't find it. It's odd because I barely even knew this girl. 

But yeah, it's a lot of stuff like that. I remember conversations and events that apparently didn't happen, yet they feel so real to me.

I always like my ex-bf's sister. She and I just clicked. I loved her brother a great deal and maybe i still do in my heart but he is immature and hurt me a great deal. She used to work for my brother's ex fiance (weird world)

She's a bit anti-social media but we'd chat on occasion laughing very very hard at somethings in our lives. My ex didn't get it. Before her brother and I broke up, i though he was depressed and told her b/c i give a damn. he hated work, he hated me, he hated everything except video games. he'd dump on me for hating my job and then i got laid off and he called me depressed after 2 weeks....ummm that's a normal reaction.

So, anyway - it came to ahead with her more or less implying that i was being the more mature one here recognizing this wasn't right and wasn't going to wait ideally by for her brother. He wasn't talking to me and i genuinely was scared for him. I told her b/c someone else needed to see what i was seeing.

So i ended the relationship and just let it go but now almost 2-3 months later she friends me? Odd. It's def not her brother stalking me as i've seen her profile before. Not sure what to do or say here...

So this just happened and it's freaking me out. Me and my father never really had a great bond. It's not like we hate each other but we avoid each other a little bit as he has a very short temper and I have been through abuse and can't handle it. He doesn't usually hit, but sometimes he does. Anyway, he's not the cause of the abuse but whatever, we don't talk much. He's just gross, always with his hand in his pants, pants unbuttoned, shirt up a little. Eats like a pig. I just really don't like him. But, on to the story. 

Me and my mother are very close. I discuss everything with her and she's always there for me. I asked her if she could buy a pack of simple boxershorts for me. I just needed something comfortable to wear. So she bought be a pack and after I just showered I put one on. Because I always struggle with sizes it's always hard to find the right size so it really was a guess. My father just came home from work and was in the kitchen. I went into the living room to my mum in my nightgown and since he was away anyway I lifted my nightgown a little bit and said ""see, the boxers are perfect!"" To which my mum nodded and in the meanwhile he literally ran from the kitchen and literally looked down to see my underwear. I quickly pulled my nightgown down and went into my room. Now it feels so awkward. I'm always scared when he's around. I get really nervous because of him and I always cover up as much as I can but I thought it would be okay. Well, not.

I've been in school for a while now. First got a marketing diploma - didn't click with me much took a year of finding jobs and twiddling my thumbs before deciding to go back to school for an accounting diploma. I liked the business side of things and the idea of managing time/people and resources. Graduated and worked for 2 years doing bookkeeping. Most jobs I found were nothing more than attaching invoices to purchase orders and data entry. It was awful and I was worried that I had made the wrong career choice. I then heard that most of the aspects of accounting that I enjoyed from school required a degree in the real world. So I went back to upgrade my diploma to a degree so I could qualify for a CPA and be given actual work that I could take pride in.


I'm now finished upgrading my degree. I've been in school so long that it's kind of crazy to think that I'm done. The idea of finding a full time job is exciting and scary. Coupled with the pressure to move out and find someone to start a life with it's a lot to take on... I've been depressed/stressed lately trying to come to terms with it and I could really use some advice to help adjust and adapt to the new lifestyle I'll be starting.

419,"I've been estranged from my mother for almost 14 years now. She's manipulative, very difficult to get along with, probably has a personality disorder, and impossible to communicate with. She was emotionally abusive and made me utterly miserable when I lived with her. To put it into perspective, CPS offered me emancipation as a teenager based on a recommendation from a school counselor, but she manipulated me into turning it down. I ended up leaving home a year later, and for the past 14 years, she's refused to believe anything is wrong with the way she behaves towards other people. There have been times when we nearly reconciled, only for her to do something crazy/manipulative again and me tossing the towel back in. She doesn't understand what the problem is even when I point it out to her. She refuses to listen to anyone else's side of things and has no concept of healthy boundaries while always playing the victim card. It's probably no surprise she's never had friends.

Well, she recently got herself a passport and is now leaving me messages saying she'll be in my area for 3 weeks and wants to stay with me. She's retired and there's no other reason for her to even be in the same country. I live in a tiny one bedroom apartment; not only do I not have the room to host her, I definitely don't think I could tolerate her for 3 weeks straight. I have my own life and find this incredibly invasive. I've repeatedly asked her to not to do this, but I don't think she'll listen.

I understand she's my mother, but I haven't had a relationship with her in 14 years and forcing me to host her for 3 weeks isn't my idea of ""easing into it"".

I work for a well known retail store.  A coworker (70 year old female) fell off a ladder.  I paged the code for accident.  Management didn't run they took their time while this poor woman is lying on the ground with a broken wrist.  The first one to show didn't ask what happened, didn't ask if she was ok, and didn't offer to call an ambulance.  This manager looked down and asked ""do you want help getting up?"" .  They got her up, took her to the office, called the company nurse hotline.  The nurse on the phone said to go to the clinic the company uses for small accidents.  Now the poor lady that fell mean while isn't speaking up about where she wants to go.  They took her to the clinic who just did an xray said ""it's a little bit broken"", and gave her a crappy temporary small brace.  They told her to wait for the orthapedic surgeon to call for her cast.  The fall happened between 9am and 9:30am.  She was brought back to work between 11am and 12pm.  Made her work, being a door greeter.  Meanwhile the swelling is getting horribly worse, she wasn't prescribed pain meds.  Close to 2pm she calls the surgeon asking why they didn't call, they say come immediately.  I see her  finally with a full shoulder to hand cast, she says if it doesn't heal in 10 days she needs surgery.  I am mainly furious with how the managers handled the whole thing and feel like I need to report to someone, but it isn't my personal situation.

Now, initially, I thought it would be okay, but very quickly, I am thinking this will be a disaster. I barely know this person and it feels like she made the decision all by herself without consulting any of us.

433,"Hey, so my relationship with my parents is stressful. I know they don't feel that way or see the strain, but it's definitely here on my end. Whenever I visit home, I go through anxiety meds 3 to 4 times faster. I never feel a desire to call or see them, but I'm the good child, so I do whatever will make them happy I guess. For reference, about a year ago (when I was ~20) my father told me ""You know we love you no matter what right?"" and it hit me like a sack of bricks that no, no I did not know that. So I do think they think they love me and they've done a lot for me that I recognize, but I've never felt like they've cared about me in and of myself as my own person. I don't know if that makes sense. Maybe I should ask for family counseling? They aren't abusive...or at least I don't think so, but it's too much for me. Maybe I'm weak? Who knows. Anyway, what I need advice with is do I inform them of my plans to get a tattoo?

They've always been anti-tattoo, more so my mother than my dad, but my brother and I have both always wanted ink. He actually has a tattoo (giant thing on his shoulder blade with foreign language writing, so who knows what it says) and they're aware of it. It's funny because all our lives we've been told if we get a tattoo, we get disowned, and the original plan was to make my brother start paying for all his own shit (insurance, cell phone, etc), but that kind of fizzled out and he's living there rent free without a job while he spends more time playing videogames than working on his grad school stuff. Anyway...

Originally, the idea was to hide the tattoo from my folks for the purpose of avoiding my problems, but I never felt right with that. I'm getting this tattoo to represent being my own person and remembering what sort of mark I hope to leave on the world and sneaking around about it feels like a childish thing to do.  Plan B was tell my parents I'm going to get a tattoo and I'm informing them as a matter of courtesy and I hope they can respect my decision as my own even if it's not the choice they have made. Present it as an 'agree to disagree' situation. It's not like they'll ever have to see it anyway.

But then... I shared my thoughts with some friends and mentors of mine. And the consensus was Plan B is the mature thing to do and that was probably the best option, but then they'd ask what sort of reaction I expected. It's so easy to predict it's laughable. My father would fuss and talk about how he's so disappointed and how I'm too young to make any sort of decision and how it's just trendy or whatever. My mother would cry. For days. She'd ask why I'm doing this to her. She'd accuse me of doing drugs (she does this whenever I make some small step towards growing up; I don't get it either). Once I give that answer, the resounding conclusion has been ""why bother telling them then""

Well...I so very desperately would love them to see it's my choice, my body, and my life. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that they won't come around, but man, wouldn't it be great if I gave them a chance and they transformed into different people? It's hard to keep hoping for something while still knowing it won't work. So now, we've arrived at Plan C. Get the tattoo because I want to and I've done all the right things and been smart about it. Don't tell them but don't hide it either. They'll likely never see it, but so what. I'm not getting a tattoo for any reason to do with them; I'm getting it because I want it and I feel confident in my decision. It's worth noting that people who know my family are also for Plan C as well as adults who I consider mentors in my life. I just...I don't want to completely give up on my parents, but it feels like holding on will just keep killing me. Advice on my tattoo dilemma is why I posted, but if anyone wants to shed some light on the overall family dynamic, I'm all ears.",02Jul2018,4
434,she has not turned 16 and not allowed to have a boyfriend yet so we are just more than friends. The thing is that her parents are making her go on dates with other guys when she turns 16.
