0,"The current course I am taking is being taught by the same professor year after year. He is the only one ever to have taught the course and no other professor is willing to teach it and he is tenured.

My professor makes this course, a mandatory course for my major, very hard for the sake of it being hard which he has openly admitted. Over half the class is failing and about 20% plans to drop it.

I do not have the finances to drop this course and take it else where at another school but I also don't want to risk failing and tank my GPA to where I would not be able to graduate.

If I drop it and risk not getting my degree, what do I put on my resume? Will I be able to get a job and save money to finish my degree?

I don't know what to do. This course by itself has given me incredible amounts of stress and anxiety.",13Nov2018,1

My interest in this person is not romantic, it's more like I think they're totally fascinating and I want to be their friend. This person is a public figure (an author) with many fans so that's not going to happen. I've had minor obsessions with famous people in the past but they only last a few days and then I realize how silly it was and laugh it off. This is different.

5,"I am a very calm person normally, but have anger issues. For example I get angry over stupid stuff, but don’t act on it. Here’s a little background on this story, I have a very expensive pair of ear buds I keep in my back pack, and during P.E. I usually listen to music with them. After warming up I went to go look for them and they weren’t there, I asked my group of friends (I am at a new school and I am not entirely sure they consider me a friend) if they had them, and they said no. Here is where my meltdown started, I said a couple of swear words and then I asked again, friend 1 says friend 2 has them. I charge friend 2 into the wall then I start choking him. I then proceed to calm down and try to talk it out. Friend 1 then says the person that took them put them in the bleachers. As I am doing this friend 3 throws them on the basketball hoop and gets them stuck (didn’t find out who did it until after all of this). I yell as loud I can “WHAT THE FUCK.” Trying to calm down I walk out of the gym to the conjoining empty classroom and repeatedly yell “DAMN IT IM GOING TO KILL WHOEVER DID THIS.” I punched a wall nearby and left a hole in the wall. In my fit of rage I went to the bathroom and broke one of the stall doors because I didn’t know where to go. I walk back to the gym prepared to choke the person that did it, instead I (still raging) walk back to that empty classroom, where apparently a teacher was when I punched the wall. I saw the gym teacher in there and she tried to calm me down, but instead I started yelling about how people always take advantage of me and whatever she does won’t do shit. The rest of it is how a teacher I am close with calmed me down. I am extremely embarrassed by this, and to make it worse I am at a new school that I don’t fit in well with. What can I do that won’t 1) make me have another meltdown 2) not make me look like that one kid that is going to shoot up the school.

During this time I’d been telling them and her I care about her so I feel like I’ve been mugged off and don’t know how to handle the situation. Should I be annoyed and if so who should I be angry with.

7,"Just a couple of examples. Just now, my dad (who was clearly drinking) walked in on me doing schoolwork because I was having a problem with the wifi. While fixing it, he noticed that I was using a vpn, and proceeded to yell at me, because he didn't like that he couldn't monitor what I am looking at online at all times. When it came down to it, he said that I shouldn't use one ""because I said so."" He spent the entire time being overly rude and offensive, and it was pretty awful to sit through. My mom will use multiple tactics to make my life miserable. Here are a few. Sometimes, when she is mad at me while in the car, she will drive like a maniac for 5-10 minutes in order to scare me, before I ask why she is driving like she is. She will then tell me, ""I don't know anon, why am I?"", further scaring me, then she will proceed to yell at me until I am reduced to tears. Other times, she will be yelling at me, and if I yell back, she will intentionally burst into tears, and call ME abusive, which really hurts. I can't go to any adults that I know, because they will take my parents side, because they like them more than me. ",13Nov2018,1
8,"I think I have baby fever, but I'm not sure now is the best time for my SO and I to act on it. 

Here is a bit about us: our family consists of myself (26F) and my SO (38M) and our son (3). I love them so much and we have pretty much decided that our family will be complete when we have a second child. We don't want a large age gap! Conceiving TONIGHT  (sort of joking) would make it a 4 year age difference between our kids which would be just about ideal in our eyes. My husband is also 13 years older than me, and therefore feeling a bit more pressed for time to have our second. 

We are more secure financially than we have ever been, though that doesn't mean we are exactly well off. But we are 'well off' enough to conceive (no pun intended) building a house, which is what we are doing right now. We have a carpenter helping us out and it is a small house; but nonetheless, **we have no deadline for the job.** There are two reasons why I pine on this :


1) with my first child, we were a bit nomadic in his first couple years, even attempting a move to a different continent which, in the end, failed for various reasons. It was mostly fantastic and felt like a six-month vacation! ..and I wouldn't trade all those hikes in southern France for the world! But... it made me want stability for the next one. A nursery all set up and the whole shabang! Made me desire a more typical maternity leave where I could count on certain supports. So, seeing how we are currently so close to being stable (with this house) and rooted in a lovely community, I'm impatient but still eager to wait for the house to be complete before having baby #2. 

2) We are currently housesitting as our house gets built. The housesit will only last until April, at which point, if our house isn't finished, we will have to find another place to live. However, it is extremely difficult in these parts to find a rental, particularly in the summer, because everyone seems to put up their homes for airbnb (they can get more $ this way). So if we can't find a rental, we are left with the last resort option of crashing with my in-laws for the 4th time since my son was born 3 years ago. About 1/3 of his life was spent living at his grandparents'. I really do NOT want to go down this road again. Particularly if pregnant or with TWO kids.   

My biggest hope is for the house to be ready in early spring (but there is no guarantee here - there's bound to be hiccups).

I think that's the bulk of it. 

I want to have another kid but am really hesitant to go ahead and conceive right now. Considering our first was a surprise, I would like to be a bit more prepared this next time. 

I think as I write this, I know what we need to do. 

Any advice welcome!

11,"Hi guys, freshman here, and I’ve having a bit of a dilemma. As a bit of background knowledge, I’m known to have an anxiety problem surrounding sports along with severe chronic depression. I played highly competitive basketball for years, but quit in June due to burnout caused by my father.

In my school, tryouts for winter sports are just now ending and I’m having a major problem. I tried out for winter track instead of basketball. I made it because the coaches decided last minute not to make cuts and had my first practice tonight. It was AWFUL. Now, I’m not known to have great endurance, but I had assumed I could keep up with at least some of the other freshman (most of which who hadn’t done track before) but I was horribly wrong. We did 5 800s back to back in the cold pouring rain and were expected to get very low times. I physically, even at 100% effort, couldn’t do it.

On the other hand, there’s a make-up tryout for freshman basketball tomorrow. I’m decent at basketball, though I haven’t touched one since June. I’d imagine I’m super rusty. I wouldn’t have a problem making the team, I just don’t particularly want to. Over half of the girls on the team don’t like me, one of my first impressions to the coach was of me having a panic attack during the game, and I know for a fact my dad would go straight back into extreme helicopter parenting AKA the main reason I quit and the main reason I have so much anxiety surrounding sports.

So, in my situation, would it be better do to a sport I can barely physically stand to do and am not very fond of or to do a sport I’m decent at but will have a lot of social and mental problems if I am to take it back up. Not doing a sport isn’t really an option.

12,"Sometime Friday night going into Saturday morning my keyring (with my house keys) and about $70 worth of cash came up missing. The cash I chalked up to me maybe drinking too much but I know I didn’t just randomly lose my keys. I wouldn’t have been able to get into the house that night without them.

For the past three nights I have had to either have the door unlocked for me or someone come open it for me. I finally accepted that I somehow lost my keys. Something I’ve never done before... Until today.

While exiting the upstair area and rounding a bookcase at the top of the first flight of stairs I noticed my keyring on the shelf, minus my house key. I finally put two and two together. One of my roommates had gone into my room while I was asleep or away, went through my belongings, stole my key chain and removed my house-key from my keychain. I’m also certain whoever did this also stole cash from me.  My bedroom has no locks on it.

21," I'm thinking about quitting my job at the end of this month or the middle of December. The aim is to join the Air Force by early 2019.  

I currently work construction at a fabrication shop. But at times, we're sent to the field. Prior, I was working at Walmart(first job) for the past 2 years as an assembler, overnight stocker, opener for toys, etc.

5 months ago, I asked my best friend of 11 years if he can get me a job where he works. At the time, I was feeling a bit down because I didn't know what to do in life.

I felt like I was going to stay at Walmart for a long time and I also felt taking advantage of from managers because they knew how good I was at my job, that I ended up handling 5 departments by myself, I did that for 2 months.

I asked the co-manager if he could do me a favor and switch my position (I did him a bunch of favors, like helping out the overnight crew for months, since he knew how fast of a stocker I was - even though my work hours were 7 am - 4 pm)

Walmart was also letting go 3.5k co-managers (we lost all of ours). He switched it for me but the assistant managers didn't care, they would change my schedule. It was like I never switched my position in the first place. I would only work my new job like 2x every 2-3 weeks. Even then, when I worked at the new position - I would get pulled to my old job. Thus making me look for another job.

I don't really like my construction job, it's not really my thing. It's obviously more dangerous and more complex than retail but I at least felt happier at Walmart since I had pride in being one of the fastest stockers in the store. I was also thinking about being a welder since at our shop they start at $20. I was being taught at the shop, it was fun, but it didn't feel right for me. It's not my passion and I wouldn't want to live that way, driving here and there, being in awkward positions, etc.

The pay is only a $1 more but it could be $2, once I'm hired on (currently agency) to the company - but I'm not going to stay long so I don't really care if I get hired on or not.

I like computers so I figured why not join the Air Force with an IT related job.

23,"Throwaway Account. 

Three years ago, I was deeply betrayed by a friend, who happened to be a barista at a coffee shop that hosted a poetry open mic I used to attend. My parents were a part of the poetry slam community, so I was well in that society, until this happened. I was banned from this coffee shop, have been blocked by several people, and my social life and reputation has gone to hell. 

At first, I tried to keep my head down to avoid more drama, but now I think I’m at a point where I need to clear my name if I’m ever going to have a social life again... it keeps following me. 

**The Situation - this is long, I apologize.**

I am actually banned from from a coffee shop because of a disgruntled barista. I mean physically banned, as in, if I show  up they can call the cops for trespassing.  It started with some drama involving one of their baristas, who I will call “Amy”, and her boyfriend “James.” 

I became pretty good friends with Amy and James for a while - to the point where they had given me an invitation for a threesome, which  I accepted. However, before it was supposed to happen, I learned from my cheating ex that he had Chlamydia which surprise surprise, he had given to me. This is will be relevant later. 

Anyway, 

Towards the end of our friendship, I got the cold shoulder not just by her - but by literally everyone in that social circle. I had no idea what  the fuck I did, but I know animosity towards me when I see it. There was only one mutual friend who was still friendly with me - Jared.

My last performance at this open mic, I took Jared with me at his request. I had to drive him there, and in the car I mentioned my paranoia about people being angry at me. He gave me the infamous “look.” 

The look of “*I know something you don’t know, and I don’t want to tell you because it will hurt you.*”

I told him to tell me, because I was going insane. 

**From there I learned:**

- I was accused of being obsessed with them, and trying to start a polyamorous triad with them. 

- I was also accused of trying to watch them have sex (did they plan to blindfold me during this threesome?)

- I was harassing them.

- I was trying to talk to her through her friends, who happened to be my friends too. 

So much more that has been faded from my memory, as it was petty bullshit compared to being accused of being a creep that was trying to watch people have sex.

Naturally, I was pissed. Furious. You don’t invite someone into a threesome and then complain of them trying to watch you have sex. 

That night, I made the fatal mistake of read a poem I had written about a similar situation I was in, but the poem had made it explicitly clear in no uncertain terms that this was NOT about Amy in anyway whatsoever.  I even consulted Jared before reading it. It should also be noted that Amy wasn’t even working that night - her best friend Robert was. So she wasn’t even there that night, and that will be important later. 

Knowing what I knew now, Jared and I were speculating how long it would take for everyone to assume he and I were dating, and for him to catch shit about it. Things had been quiet until I drove Joey back home and we were walking around his apartment complex and talking. 

Then he got a text from James, and it was the meanest thing I’d ever experienced as an adult. 

The text said:

&gt; Red Flags! Red Flags! Don’t do it, bro! You’ll have to get penicillin shots.” 

I saw the text and cried. Jared even had tears in his eyes because it was an unbelievably cruel thing to say about someone who had been in an embarrassing situation through no fault of their own (again, ex cheated on me). 

He texted James back saying “That was a really shitty thing to say, and she saw it and now she’s crying.” 

His response? 

&gt; Well damn, I managed to ruin two people’s nights. Sorry, I was just looking out for you.

I texted Amy in a frenzy asking her what I did, and I was sorry for whatever I did, and to please just tell me what was going on that made James feel disgruntled enough to send such a text message.

So I went home in tears. At the time, I had a very private Facebook page. I used it to vent because I lived in a severely emotionally abusive household. Private FB, as in 10 friend.s. Amy was one of them. I posted a status I had meant to hide from her, because I didn’t want to shame her. 

My status: “*I thought you were my friends.*”

My online friends of course, commented on it, asking whose ass they needed to kick and stuff. I said in the thread that I had hid this from the person in question because I was trying to vent, not shame anyone. I didn’t unfriend her yet, because I was hoping maybe it could be worked through after I got my frustration out.

Apparently I had not actually hidden it from her, and Amy sent me a text saying I didn’t hide it from her. She blocked me everywhere she could. I actually felt pretty guilty, because that thread was pretty nasty towards her. I sent her a final text apologizing for that.

She replied with this long rambling message I did not bother to read all the way through, but the gist was:

- I was immature for posting my problems on social media (she posted all the time about the things going on in her life, so that made me snort). 

- I am way too creepy and fucking clingy.

- **Accused me of reading a poem about her.**

- Told me I was banned from this coffee shop and to never speak to her or any of her friends. 

Out of respect for her, I dropped most of that circle (which hated me already), and I made sure to drop everyone who was close to her, as I didn’t want her to feel I would try to stalk her through them.  However, I did leave one or two very mild acquaintances on there because I don’t care who you are, don’t fucking tell me who I can and can’t talk to. I never really spoke to them, either, it was mostly just to spite Amy (*I unfriended them a year later after I realized I was being too petty*)

The next day I posted a status on my public page saying that someone was concerned I wrote a poem about them and performed it at their workplace - and I wanted to quell their valid concern by saying I wouldn’t do that, and if you think I am, to talk to me about it. 

That was it for contact. 

What happened was deeply traumatizing for me. I stopped going to poetry events because I didn’t know who knew what, and I didn’t want to deal with anyone else hating me for it. For an entire year and some change, I was shell-shocked. I would literally panic if I had to drive anywhere near her neighborhood or if I thought I saw her in public.

I begged the people I knew who were still attending the open mics and events at this coffee shop to NOT mention me, and pretend like they don’t know me. I did not want Amy to assume I was sending people down there to stalk her.

Eventually it got so out of hand, it was a large contributing factor to a hospitalization. I was going to kill myself. I was diagnosed with PTSD from the event, on top of all my other issues.

Two years ago, I went to dinner with my boyfriend and thought I saw Amy and James. I had an internal panic attack, and was trying to rush dinner so we could leave ASAP.

That was when I realized this had to stop. That night I went home and resolved to put an end to this shit. So I wrote a letter that I delivered the next day by showing up at the coffee shop and quietly slipping the envelope addressed to her on the table.

I went in person, because I was working under the assumption that Amy was going to be as unreasonable and outrageous as possible.

- If I sent something online, she’d think I was about to start making fake profiles to stalk her, and there would be no end to it (I’ve seen this happen before).

- If I sent someone in my place, she’d say I was sending people to stalk her.

- If I mailed it off, then it would be a case of “I know where you live,” and that would end badly. 

So I went in person, at a public place with lots of cameras, where people could see me, so she knew I wasn’t up to anything other than dropping off a letter that she may or may not read. 

When I got there, everyone was in the back, so just placed it on the counter and left. And when I did, I felt like it was FINALLY over for me. I didn’t panic in public anymore, and I didn’t feel so apprehensive about who knows what.

**That is, until this year, when I realized that this situation possibly spread from that one open mic group to the ENTIRE poetry community in my city just when I was getting back into it.**

Cold shoulders, getting blocked, suddenly disinvited from things after going to an event from that coffee shop - I know what’s happening. 

I don’t know how to stop it. I’m wondering if maybe there’s truth to her statements... maybe I *am* a creep. It probably wasn’t in good form to go down there and drop off a letter. I just wanted to not panic in public anymore. 

Is it worth trying to clear my name? HOW do I even clear it? I considered a lawyer, considering I am actually banned from a venue, but then I stepped on the property again, so maybe I killed my chances with that. 

I just hate this feeling of watching my life unravel again, and knowing that saying anything might make it worse. It feels so helpless.

25,"It’s me, my wife, and our friend renting a place together.  He is normally calm and mopey, but he recently got a girlfriend and it has made him angrier and angrier.  We’ve tried to talk to him several times about it and he always listens and says he will do something about it, but then he keeps yelling.

Recently he has been pressuring us into getting his gf on the lease, but my wife thinks she has been inciting him and is not okay with it.  I’m also pretty uncomfortable with doing something just because someone is getting angry with you.  

The last time we brought up his anger issues to him (about once a month) and said we weren’t okay moving anyone else in until things improved, he started threatening us and telling us we should move out.  He always insisted on paying the property rental company and having us pay him, but now he is using it against us and saying that as far as the rental company knows he is the only one who pays rent.  

When his gf asked me why she can’t move in, I told her it’s because our household is already pretty bad and we don’t think a fourth would help.  She said that we were nasty people with a nasty home and that we just don’t want our housemate to be happy.  

I’m not sure what I should do.  My wife never knew him to be like this when he was single.  Normally I would just move out with her, but she is very disabled and even if I took care of everything for her every time she has moved previously it’s been extremely hard for her.  She is terrified of my housemate.  It has gotten to the point where I just want to do whatever it takes to get him out, but don’t know what my options are.  He really fixated on how the company thinks he’s the only one paying rent even though all of our names are in the lease.  What can I do?",13Nov2018,1

I know I sound dumb for rushing adulthood (ex. Having kids, getting my own car, etc), but above everything I hate being looked at as a kid and having to be dependent on others. I want to be able to have my own place, my own car, etc. I want to have kids now but I know I’m not ready because I have nothing to my name. What can I do?

28,"23/F here.

My dad growing up wasn’t especially good. He is diagnosed bipolar but won’t take meds (and that isn’t a dig at bipolars—I’ve been diagnosed bipolar also, runs in the family it seems). He’d fly off the handle at the stupidest shit, screaming/swearing/hitting us when we did as little as spill milk or cry (when we were little, like 5 or 6). He’s no doubt been emotionally abusive too, incredibly controlling to me and my mother especially. He would go on Benders when I was 5-15 years old where he’d get wasted, do tons of cocaine and have sex with hookers, come home in a rage at 3 am, and he’s never apologized for it. He’s sober now but is still a raging dick.

I have this thing for men with addictive personalities. I’ve dated several alcoholics/ex alcoholics/drug users. I tend to fall for them quickly while I feel nothing for “good guys”. 

I’m terrified because now I’ve fallen for another. He treats me incredibly well (this far), but he’s been to rehab twice and has definite issues with drugs and alcohol. 

I love this guy. I really do, and he loves me too. But I’m thinking long term, I’m so scared that he’s going to end up like the others—either batshit insane and horrible to me, or relapsing and getting back into drugs. He currently goes to AA and has been mostly sober for a year or so (with a few slip ups). Other than that, I swear the few months we’ve been together he’s incredibly good to me.

I’m so scared my “daddy issues” cloud my judgment. Then again, this guy doesn’t have to be like all the others right? Shouldn’t I give him a chance?

Tl;dr: I have major father issues, and I tend to date alcoholics/addicts/men with problems. Is this time going to be any different?

11:00am-6:00pm (with a couple of half hour breaks) - take notes on the chapter due for the week, make sure I understand all concepts, etc.

32,"Hey all, I recently lost my job as a therapist and am currently looking for a new job. The job I lost was a community based program. My friends and family blame my lack of success on the lack of training. For instance, I received 3 days of shadowing on the job when my friend in another position had 3 days of training a week for 90 days.

There is not much in my area hiring for a provisionally licensed therapist. I had an interview 45 minutes out of town today that was a total joke, a phone call regarding a job I'm not interested in in a town I love (5 hrs away), and a call a few minutes ago that's local (but travels an hour out) offers good pay and benefits, but is similar to the job I lost. I'm not terribly interested in the work, but theres great benefits and its hard to find what I really want to do anyways.

Was it the lack of training that caused me to lose the job, or am I just incompetent and unable to take this job?  What do I do? ",13Nov2018,1

Actually, I am now being replaced with someone apparently much cheaper, even though my friend painted this picture repeatedly of him and I growing and building this company together.

34,"So my parents are from Somalia, which is a country in Africa, and I was born in the states. My dad isn’t racist at all however my mother seems to have a bias towards black people which never made sense to me because we’re black. 

Anyways I’m a student in college now and I was on the phone with her talking about how classes were and etc. Then when she asked if I made any friends I just talked about people I met and I mentioned one of my closest friends is black and then we started getting into a heated argument. 

She kept telling me not to “involve myself with black Americans” because they’re “no good” and just kept spewing racist rhetoric. I kept trying to explain to her that what she was saying is racist and how it makes no sense for someone like her to say or believe these things. She kept ignoring my responses and of course this ticked me off so I just told her she can’t decide who I’m friends with and I hung up. 

I honestly feel like crap because I talked back to my mother and felt rude but at the same time what she was saying was blatantly racist and I felt like I had an obligation to condemn what she was saying. I’m not sure how to confront my mother again and calmly explain to her how what she was saying is racist and also apologize for raising my voice to her because she’s still my mom.

42,"Some backstory: I was born in Brazil. My mother is what most people would call white, with light green eyes, her father had a somewhat brown skin with unknown origins. My dad has a brown skin from his mother side and his dad was white Italian all the way. I was born with light brown eyes, straight hair and light skinned, although as I grew up my skin got somewhat darker from sun exposure; I tend to get not so much sunburn and to tan very easily.

Fast forward a bunch of years, I moved to the US to a diverse but still mostly white city in the West coast. All my friends so far have been white Americans and culturally I feel like I fit and am very comfortable among them; that includes taste for music, movies, food; in general most of the conversations are just what you'd expect with people who can relate to each other. 

But here's the thing, I have a strong feeling that people look at me and always assume that I'm the ""Latino dude"" due to both a darker skin color/hair/eyes and whenever they notice I have a different accent or tell them I come from South America. But I do not have anything in common with the said Latino culture. It's not a matter of disliking anyone or having any discrimination against other cultures or races, it is just a feeling of displacement. I cannot relate to their specificities and I never thought of myself as a non-white person before coming to the US.

People I get to know better always treat me without any discrimination and the racial subject never comes up but whenever it is time to meet new people I always feel like I'm treated as an outsider at first. For example, I was at this party and some kid comes to me and starts speaking Spanish and I had to tell him my first language was Portuguese and he insisted on it like I was supposed to understand him. People on restaurants tend to assume I want my food spicier than my wife's and get shocked when I say I don't like spicy food. People expect me to interact more with other minorities and initial conversations tend to gravitate foreign subjects and the what whatever situation happened to immigrants somewhere. In general, even coming from people that are very opposed to any kind of racism I still feel like I'm assumed to be different.

What can I do to feel better with myself since I cannot change everyone else's way of seeing me?

I just wanted to walk in some party without ever having to talk about my country of origin or the fact that I just enjoy pancakes and maple syrup and thanksgiving food like all of them; not burritos or some exotic shit they saw on TV. One of the reasons I decided to stay here was because I felt like I belonged to the culture more than where I came from, and I can't help but feel sad when at first sight people just assume I do not, before they spend time with me and just end up accepting me as part of the pack.",13Nov2018,1

My family is pretty spread out. They do Christmas. Some years I make a second trip to them but I'm in graduate school and time and money are both rare. My family has never visited me in my city ive been living in for the last 5 years.

45,"I have had a membership in a town I have lived in for about 4 years now, and I'm having some issues now. The owner of this gym used to be a personal trainer for me, and we were generally what I thought on an okay level of speaking. Well given that I started school 2 months ago I have been trying to cancel it since I don't use it anymore. All I get told when I go in there is ""oh I don't have the billing book that has your contract in it."" 

I haven't signed a contract in a few years though, and they only last 2 as far as I remember? The very last time I went in there to speak with them about it I told them that I want to cancel it because I moved away for school. (which I did, I live over an hour and a half away) 

To which I was informed that I would have to text them my new living address to see if I lived far enough to cancel my membership. To me that doesn't make any kind of sense, but at the same time I dont run a gym so. Here I am still waiting a month and a half later for the owner to still text me.

 I have been wanting to cancel just because I don't use it, along with holidays coming up I need to save money. 

Every few months they take extra money out of my account along with the membership as a maintenance fee. When I started attending I was told that it would only be 1 time a year.

I'm not sure what exactly to do, I keep reaching out only to get brushed off once again. It seems so sketchy to me...

47,"Hello everybody, please excuse me if this isn't the right subreddit as this is my first time posting here on this subreddit. Anyways with that covered and out of the way I'll start explaining my situation now.

We started having conversations when she followed me and asked me who I was and why I was watching her Instagram stories. We had a total of nine conversations after that one through out the following days. I started all of them but the first one. She unfollowed me by the second conversation we had. I started it because I saw a post she made stating that she was moving soon. I asked her if this was true. She told me it was and proceeded to ask me why I wanted to know. I didn't know what to say, so I left her on read for majority of that night. About 20 minutes after her asking me why I wanted to know, she started making weird story posts. The first one stated: I'm desperate for new clothes I need to look good for my nonexistent boyfriend. She kept making similar posts like that one throughout that night and ever since then. I told my friends about this the same night I left her on read. They thought I was stupid for not realizing what this ment. They both saw this as a great opportunity for me to finally introduce myself to her in person. I never got to do it though. I posted this up on Reddit just to see what you people thought and if you people saw the same potential as my friends did. You people also thought I was stupid and were saying that I should start making moves on her. Well fast forward to now. I found out through our previous conversations that we didn't have anything in common at all. I also found out that she is on birth control for whatever reason. All the conversations we had were pretty good. She never asked me anything but she still was pretty involved in them. In one of the conversations we had after that, I asked her why she kept making all those posts, and she literally told me straight up that she wants a boyfriend. We kept having conversations after that, but the last two were not that great. It started seeming like I was annoying her or something. I asked her if I annoyed her at any point in time and she told me no. I replied saying okay then and also stated that it seemed like I was annoying her and that I guess I took it the wrong way. She responded saying that she just didn't want to talk. I responded saying okay I'll leave you be from now on. She replied saying thanks. So then I wanted to leave her on a cliffhanger, so I replied saying by the way about all those posts you keep making about wanting a boyfriend... I left her on read again for a good few hours. I finally responded saying I'd rather say it in person. So she said I don't even know what you look like dude. So then I tried explaining who I am and what I look like and she said it still didn't help. She said the same thing the first time she asked who I was. I then asked her well what will? She replied saying idk man. Anyways I'm thinking about messaging her over Instagram again this upcoming weekend, telling her that I like her, how I came across her profile, the reasons why I was messaging her and that I would have told her in person about how I feel but barely saw her in school and never had the time to. Now I know this isn't the best way to go about it, but from what happened over direct message on Instagram, it's seems like I skewed my chances, but I'm not entirely sure. Keep in mind I'm not holding my breath that something good will come out of this, I purely want to do this just to get it off my chest, and let her know before she moves away. My friends and people on reddit think I should, as I really don't have anything to lose since she is moving soon anyways. What do people think?

Also what I don't understand is, that if she is so desperate for a boyfriend and complains about being lonely all the time, why did our conversations start to dwindle? Especially when I'm a guy, who goes to the same high school as her, is in the same grade as her, is in the same homeroom as her and is talking to her. Maybe she knows what I'm trying to get at here and isn't having it? I just don't know how it went from her being nice and giving solid responses to things, to her then giving me short answers and acting like I'm a nucince. If there are any more details you need so you can help me figure this out just let me know. 

Some extra information:
- I've never got to introduce myself to her. 
- We go to the same high school.
- Are in the same grade. 
- Are in the same homeroom. 
- Have no classes together. 
- All conversations were made on Instagram via direct message.
- She could be acting this way towards me due to her having anxiety.
- Made alot of story posts on Instagram during the time we spoke about wanting a boyfriend. The latest one she made was her responding to something her friend sent her: Friend: ""Having a boyfriend has its pros and cons."" Crush: ""How? I cannot think of any cons about having a boyfriend.""
- She is moving away three weeks from now. 
- Last year a lot of instances of eye contact between me and her happened throughout the hallways of the of my high school.

Things got bad when he fell into the wrong crowd in high school. It started out innocently enough when his friends got him to try vaping. Then it turned into smoking weed (in a state where it can ruin your life btw). He was an over-achiever, had a 3.8 GPA, had a high rank in JROTC and he got a free ride to college.

My mom let him chill w/o a job this summer as a reward and that's when things got bad. He would be out way past curfew, and my mom eventually forced him to get a job after he'd been so irresponsible. 

Everything was supposed to change when he got into college. Well, things only got worse, because he moved out. Him and 4 of his friends put together their money and got a tiny 2-bedroom apartment. The semester is almost over and he is failing most of his classes, smoking &amp; selling weed, and is on course to ruin his life.

He constantly needs money or something from my mom. He used all the data playing Pokemon Go, so my mom had to buy unlimited data. He broke his phone and she had to buy him a new one. Now, he crashed his car (supposedly off-roading with a POS 2-wheel car) and with literally 0 dollars in his bank account, my mom has to pay for that to, which is going to be over $500.

My mom thinks he is going to end up in prison or worse. She has considered cutting him off completely, but doesn't want to. He says he needs to move back in soon (some time after the semester ends). And my mom wants to lay down the law and set things straight.

60,"Basically a group of friends and I got together in class and came up with an idea to make a board game but give it a light communist twist. So we did. The game itself has little to do with real communism except for its name, branding, and imagery.

But my parents (I am a teen) are taking to the game very poorly. Every time we talk about it (i.e. me showing them stuff I designed) they get very upset. They think that if I associate my name to the game and try to sell it then I am essentially ruining my life. Are they in the right to think that? Are they being ignorant? Am I being ignorant?  I need advice. ",13Nov2018,1
61,I don't know why it bothers me but it does. Can someone help me figure out how or why it does? It makes me feel insecure but besides that I'm not sure. ,13Nov2018,1
62,"I asked someone out today, someone I've been in love with for a very long time. And to summarize they said we should just stay friends. I don't know how I fell, just empty I guess.

63,"So I’ve been working somewhere for a little less than a month now, and obviously I’m not an expert at the job yet since I work less than 20 hours a week. I just found out that one of my bosses told my friend who got me the job that “i suck”. Her exact words were “Nadia, your friend sucks” and other stuff but idk exactly what. How should I confront her about this without totally getting fired? I thought we were cool, but it turns out she talks a lot of shit. Should I go to HR or what?",13Nov2018,1
64,I work for an addict who has sketchy people and known druggies/dealers hanging out in the store when we are not open . I closed and came in next morning and found a baggie of drugs  and a bottle of pills out in the open . A volunteer advised me to throw it away so I did... Now I feel like I should have maybe called the cops? I was just so upset and very angry I was put in this position. I did not want our customers to see it and was not thinking straight. I love my job except this aspect. I would not be surprised if there were more drugs there. So what do I do and did I mess up? Do not want to be in this mess:(  Any advice appreciated!  ,13Nov2018,1
65,My dad called me a disappointment and yeah he was drunk when he said it but god damn has it stuck with me I’m a senior in HS and my dad basically calls me a failure all the time but it’s like dude ur a failure for basically drinking yourself to death I don’t say that but I want to man he is verbally abusive and really puts me down not sure what to do he thinks video games lead to failure,13Nov2018,1
66,"So, I've met this girl on Tinder about 2 months ago. We went on a first date and everything went pretty well. She's a shy person, so I didn't want to make any moves on her so early on. About a week later, I hit her up to set up a new date. She basically ignores me and when I ask her what's going on, she tells me about how she isn't over her ex just yet (They broke up like 6 months ago). So I just tell her that's fine and I move on with my life. Now a week ago she hit me back up asking me if I was still down to hang out with her. I really like her, so I agreed. Now tonight was the date. We watched a movie together, but because the movie sucked, I tried to get her 'in the mood', shall I say. Immediately I got this vibe that she wasn't down for that. After the movie we talked about how she sees this relationship going further, and again, her ex came in the story. She basically explained that if her ex would hit her up to get together again, she would immediately agree. (So basically, she isn't over him, yet again.)
Now, what should I do? Tell her to not text me again? Or wait til she is actually ready for a new relationship? Or just try to find someone else? 
Would really appreciate any help from you guys :)
Thanks

67,"Okay so I work at walmart&amp;  I was in the back doing  computer work. I was passing out and I guess this little highschool girl recorded me and put me on her snapchat saying “This bitch is falling asleep, me too😂😂” And I found out cause One of my other co workers sent it to me since she has that girl on snapchat. I am not gonna cuss or be that rude cause first of all that’s a kid and I won’t stoop to that level of ratchet😂I’m 20 lmao. She’s probaly 16/17.

I mean she could get in trouble right? Because she posted me without consent. ",13Nov2018,1
68,"So I've (17M) been in a relationship with this girl (17F) for about three months now and things have been going really nicely. We get along great, have never fought about anything once, and talk to each other every day. 

It's only recently that I've started worrying that maybe I'm putting in more than I'm getting out with the relationship. I feel like a do a lot of little things to express how much I care about her, like asking how her day was, giving her random hugs and kisses, saying goodnight, and I love you, stuff like that. Sometimes I realize that she either won't do the same back to me, or does, but only after I've already done something, almost as if she feels obligated to do so.

It's entirely possible I'm just overthinking things like I do sometimes, but some outside help/advice would be very much appreciated.

69,"I've been dating my SO for almost 4 years. When we met, which was at work, we were both in seeing other people. We started hanging out, and even though we were attracted to each other, we never acted upon it. Months later, we both broke up with our then partners and started to officially date.

A couple of years ago he confessed to me that another co-worker who I considered our friend, roughly around the same time my SO and I started to hang out, overtly expressed that he was sexually attracted to me. By the time he brought this to my attention, that person had left the company, so it wasn't that big of a deal.

After having learnt this information, this person and I ocassionally chatted online to catch up but always in a friendly manner. We always made each other laugh, and he never expressed any intention other than friendship to me, so I disregarded his previous comments as an office crush.

One night I casually mentioned that I was on online-speaking terms with this ex coworker of ours and my SO expressed discomfort about it, so I stopped talking to him.

About 3 months ago, my sister in law offered us 3 tickets to go see a stand up show with her. To my surprise, my SO thought it would be a great idea to invite this particular co worker to the show, given he was a stand up fan. He contacted him and he happily accepted the invitation.

The night went on fine, he was very chatty and the 4 of us had pizza while catching up after the show.

I should mention I live two hours from a big city, and I rarely go there. Coincidentally, I was there by myself last weekend and while I was killing some time on phone waiting for a friend, this ex coworker of ours got in touch with me. We started talking and decided to meet up to catch up. I thought to myself, how paranoid of my SO to think this guy would have any sexual intentions towards me.

Later in the afternoon, we got together in a coffee shop somewhere in the city. He wanted to talk about his love life, which should've been a red flag, but given that I had mentioned my SO and how well our relationship was going it wasn't that farfetched. Anyhow, he kept bringing up girls he had slept with and I tried to casually change the subject. At one point he even said: ""Well, I am interested in this one girl, but she has a boyfriend"" followed by a nervous chuckle. I somehow knew he was talking about me, so I veered the conversation as fast as I could away from that comment. It made me uncorfortable, but given that I unfortunately live in a very chauvinistic country, I know how to handle these kind of situations with a bit of ease. I immediately knew I'd fucked up and that my SO was right all along.

We finished our chat and he gave a lift to my charter. During the drive, I noticed nothing awkward. We said goodbye and that was that.

I looked at my phone when I got in the charter and realized two things: 1) that it was dying and 2) that I had many missed calls from my mother. Nevertheless, as standard, I called my SO first. I told him what I've been upto, and the moment I mentioned this ex coworkers name, he turned cold and monosyllabic. Given that I had already confirmed during our coffee that all of my SO statements were indeed correct, I felt this sudden gilt and remorse about the whole thing. My SO was so upset he proceeded to tell me that we needed to talk when I got home and blocked me in order to prevent any further communication.

Two hours later, when I got home, we got into an argument. I felt so guilty about the whole thing and he was so visibly upset about it that I made the hugest mistake: I lied. I told him nothing happened and that we just talked about his ex. He didn't fully believed it, but after giving me the silent treatment for 2 whole days, decided to move on from it and start anew.

A couple of hours ago, we were on the couch, chatting and laughing like we were 2 days before, when the subject was brought up once more. This time, feeling less tense about the events that took place, I told him the truth. Needless to say, he is utterly heartbroken at the fact that I lied, and I know he is right.

He said that he cannot see me in the same light now, not after knowing that I am capable of hiding things from him and the our bond of trust is ruined.

I don't know what to do... To be honest, I'm not sure why I'm even writing these lines here. I guess I fear I've destroyed the future I had with my SO and I just needed to hear someone tell me if there is a way back from this.

Sorry for the long post and any words of advice will be welcomed.

72,"A couple years back, my ex described be as a boring individual. At the time I didn’t give it much thought, but it slowly creeps up and bums me out every now and then. I work, and have made friendly acquaintances with, a few 22-19 year olds. Whenever I look at their table during lunch, I catch myself becoming envious of their silly and jovial nature. 

When I think back on their antics though, it’s not that I wouldn’t or don’t want to act like that, it just never crosses my mind to be silly or childish.

Idk if this last part is relevant, but to give you some context about my mindset: 27M, I have what I would call a matter-of-fact type of view on things, I tend to be less optimistic and more of a realist. Mainly cause I view constant optimism as phony and disingenuous.",13Nov2018,1
73,"Hi guys, first time posting. I’m a high school student, and had done very well academically my entire life. The sport I do requires me to wake up at 5:20, but I woke up that time last year. My grades were excellent last year. This year, I am stressed constantly. Even when I go to bed at a decent time, I wake up exhausted. My grades are starting to drop. First quarter this year I failed every test I took for the first week or two. I can’t find the motivation to study and am just feeling broken. Nothing I do seems to work. I was sick for 2 days giving me a 4 day weekend where I got good sleep, and it didn’t help at all. I’m trying my best, but I’m just defeated at this point.

74,"So this year I'll be turning 25, on Thursday. I get it, I'm an adult now and shouldn't need to celebrate.
The way I was brought up though, I always celebrated at home with the family. Anything other than that was unacceptable and hurtful, so I was content not to challenge it. Last year I drove down from college just to see them. I walked it and my Mom didnt acknowledge my presence, until my grandmother realized that there was only 5 hours of my birthday left and alerted my mom. I saw her pulling something from the oven and suspected it was a cake (I didn't need one, but that's the common sense train of thought). She pulled out dinner for my grandmother and told me without looking at me, or actually she spoke of me in the third person. ""Birthday celebrations stop at 24, we don't do those things since she is an adult."" She didn't say anything else and I just gave everyone a hug, made an excuse that I had to finish studying and left. It was mentioned until she sat a huge decorated sheet cake in front of my 25 year old sister a month later. She said, ""I would have gotten you one, but it's just that your birthday has passed"". I shook it off, i was trying not to be selfish on my sisters birthday, but she made it a point to tell everyone that I didn't get one and laughing. I just wanted to be with my family and celebrate my sister being 25. 

My little sisters birthday (20)  was the next month. She got taken out to dinner, but decided the restaurant birthday dessert didn't count as an official birthday dinner, so she got a second one in February, both times my mom cracking the joke that I didn't get one. I just wanted it to be about them since that's what it needed to be. 

Around April, mom took all of us to lunch and to see the 50 shades movie. A girls day. As I was hugging her bye, she said ""so this can count as a birthday thing, right?"". I'm about to sound really bratty, but she never intended to take me out for my birthday, the pieces just clicked into place and she went for it. My sisters got birthday dinners and cakes and gatherings. I got a burrito and a smut movie. I love her, with all my heart, it just hurts.

This year she keeps skipping over mine purposefully, since my niece is turning 1 the following Saturday (I am excited for her, and love that we are close on the birthday scale, she has my heart). Whenever someone brings up mine, she says that my little sister is meeting with the wedding coordinator that day and if she isn't too busy she may swing by a drop off a sandwich to me to celebrate. 

I've come to hate my birthday. My boyfriend is trying to salvage it, and wants to take me to dinner. My mom hates him (he is a single dad and different race). When she heard that he was thinking of taking me to dinner (I was not expecting any plans from else where because of past experiences), she has been making it a point to not acknowledge me kindly. My boyfriend and I made plans for dinner, but I have the sinking feeling that she is gonna pop up here on Thursday with dinner knowing I'll be gone. It feels like a trap, but if no one else was celebrating she wouldn't bother. I don't understand. I've considered spending it alone.

75,"So my supervisor is kickass he has been super supportive and prob the best supervisor I have ever had hands down. Super helpful , inspiring and just an overall joy to work with makes everything fun and inspires me to work hard and makes me enjoy the job. He is is very helpful and constructive in criticism and has helped me learn my tasks better to perform better. He has recently in 2 meetings recognized my hard work in front of the staff and I have been working so hard and having great morale and overall good vibes at work ....until today. My supervisor left early because he was there early and one of the directors was in. I was coming in to pick up more work to do and in a emotionless and cold voice he said to me “your doing a bad job” embarrassing me in front of the co workers and bringing my morale and will to work and self esteem from 100 to 0. All I wanted to do was put on a pair of brass knuckles and bust is fucking smug face open. I calmly said “In really sorry I’m working as hard as I can and I will try to do a better job I guess “ and he snidely says “you guess?” I’m off tomorrow and not really sure how I will handle this weds but I plan to tell my supervisor and possibly go to hr and explain this is not leadership it’s straight hostile bullying and abuse in the work force.

I just want to thank everyone who responded to me. I wish I had gotten the chance to talk to him again. I was not aware how fast his condition had deteriorated, and the very next morning after I posted when I saw him, he was on a ventilator, heart monitor shut off, and heavily sedated. DNR. Less than 24 hours after that, he passed away early Sunday morning.


I wish I had talked to him more, even before he was hospitalized. I wish I didn't take his wit, his intelligence, his memories and experiences for granted. Most importantly, I wish I had tried to call him even a day sooner to talk to him. These are regrets I will have all my life. I know he's no longer suffering, and I hope he knew I loved him. 

*My* advice for *you*? Text someone right now, anyone you love or care about, old/young/family/friends, and tell them you were thinking of them and that you care about them, or that you love them. The future is never guaranteed. Thank you guys again.

79,"You guys, I need advice. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 10 years (11/11 is our anniversary). We have obviously talked about getting engaged hundreds of times over the years. He's even asked my dad for permission- about 5 years ago while we were still in college. 

We decided early on that we didn't want to get engaged in school because we could barely afford to eat, we didn't want the ring he chooses to reflect that. 

We are now a few years removed and boy this engagement thing is just not happening. 3 years ago he was ready to buy a ring, then he broke his leg on a bachelor party and was out of work for 3 months, therefore on a heavily reduced wage. So there goes that year. 

2017 New Years Eve he promises me in front of everyone at the party that by this time next year we would be engaged. Unfortunately, he had to go to physical therapy for his broken leg, so all his extra money went to that. 

Same story for 2018. He told me we would be engaged before Dec 1, when were going on vacation with our friends to Mexico. We have done so many wonderful things with our friends that, of course, cost money. Between trips and student loans and medical bills- this engagement is not going to happen. 

I understand that he doesn't have the money to buy a ring, but man does it make me feel down. Trying to not judge my relationship against others, but it gets really hard when all your friends that have been together for WAY LESS TIME than we have get engaged. Not to mention how much it hurts my boyfriend when people ask why he hasn't proposed yet. It's not like he doesn't want to! 

I'm trying not to bring it up, and I told him that I understand that he doesn't have the money, and I appreciate his transparency about the whole thing. On our anniversary Sunday he hugged me and started crying because he feels so shitty that he isn't proposing. I don't know what to do. 

I feel guilty because I know he's struggling, but it makes me feel so bad that somehow every other guy that also has bills is able to buy a ring for their girlfriends. I always impress to him that I'm not going anywhere, but man does this suck. 

I don't know what to do.

82,"I’m (23 F) worried about my emotional attachment to my friends after my reaction to something that would be considered minor to most people. I recently asked a friend of mine who is also my coworker (also 20s F) to hang out via text a week ago. We’ve previously hung out a 3-4 times in the last month or so with both of us initiating meet ups but this time she didn’t respond to my request. I saw her a few days later and  she immediately acknowledged she was sorry she hadn’t got back to me, she had just been busy but made an indication she would sometime soon. I understood, however since then she has texted me about work, and I’ve worked with her two other times but she still hasn’t got back to me about hanging out. 

I know logically she probably doesn’t hate me and isn’t upset with me, but my emotions and brain keep telling me otherwise. My emotions tell me that I’m not important to her or she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore. Yesterday I cried for about a solid hour over the possibility that this somehow the end of our friendship even though it’s highly unlikely. I also didn’t sleep well since I kept thinking about it. I feel this isn’t normal. I’m also concerned because this isn’t the first time I’ve cried over a friends non response. I have plenty of other friends but only seem to exhibit this kind of behavior when it comes to certain friends. I’m assuming I have some kind of attachment issue because I let these situations affect me so heavily but I don’t know how to not let these thoughts get to me. Any advice?

How do you accept or tolerate people who have vastly differing opinions than you without ""labeling"" or ""dehumanizing"" them through associating them with the political handle they associate themselves with? It seems such a hard task because if you disagree with them, they get very angry or dehumanize or label you as this and that.

86,"I am 20 years old currently living at home going to school at community college trying to get back out to a full university after some health issues. Thanksgiving break is coming up and my family likes to have a sorta open thanksgiving due to us not having much extended family. Plus its a good way for us kids to see friends who are usually busy with school and in my case out of state.

My issue that I need advice on is that my dad mentioned how when you go to a house you bring something to give the host. As much as I understand that most of my friends are 18-19 as I am one of the older people in our friend group. There college students with a limited ampunt of money to thier name that they need more than my parents need another bottle of wine. On top of that the easy gift option of alchohol isnt exactly something at 18-19 can just go buy.

My parents are implying that they expect a gift from my friends. And being the judgemental pricks they are if my friends dont bring something I will never hear the end about how they ""arnt good kids"" and ""dont have any respect"". And its not like my friends have any clue they are ""required"" to do this. I would need to just say ""hey guys come hangout oh and bring a gift because if you dont my parents will think less of you"".

So how do I handle this? Suck it up tell my friends and let them decide if they give a crap about what my family thinks? Argue with my family, and how the fuck do I bring this forward in a way that will actually be listened to? Or what are some cheap simple gift things I could tell my friends that would work well enough as gifts?

89,"Hey there. I'm just a random person on the Internet, but I'm just feeling some pressure so I'm asking for some advice and/or comfort.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a bit of background to assess my situation:

* I am currently a high school senior who performs at the top of his class, and is currently in the process of filling out college applications.
   * I do not do any sport-related extracurriculars on a day-to-day basis; however, I am involved in multiple academic/community service clubs.
* I do not indulge in any other inappropriate behaviors (e.g. underage drinking, drugs, theft, crime, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I will just lay down my problems:

* I drown my sadness, frustration, or worry in YouTube videos or videogames (namely, League of Legends) and seclude myself from my parents on a regular basis. They treat the game like how the Chinese government treated *Monster Hunter: World:* a complete ban.
   * As a result, I play in secret, enduring angry lectures (often at high volume) of my parents yelling at me that I am never on top of my things.
   * I have long evaded my parents' attempts to control my play activity, but given that one of my parents is quite experienced at computer software, the battle lingers on and they don't feel like giving up anytime soon.
* This has gone on for quite some time, so likely, my parents don't exactly trust me anymore--rather, no one in my immediate family trusts me at all (my siblings got dragged into this.) I gave up trying to regain my trust; I did not know how and I still don't know what to do to this day.
* Obviously, the fact that I'm posting this is an acknowledgement that LoL is a problem at the moment. However, I feel a compulsion to remain ""free"" from my parents' restrictions, and currently believe that a life with LoL is still possible and balance-able.
   * How do I know this? I lived by myself very recently in a pre-college environment for six weeks without any restrictions with my parents whatsoever, and was able to excel at the pre-college courses, regulate sleep at decent levels, and maintain a great relationship with the college professors. During that time, I was able to play LoL with friends at the college on a regular basis.
* My life is still laced with stress, with me constantly worrying about every activity that I perform (besides video games, ironically.) 
   * A few examples:
      * If I am say, practicing violin, I will begin worrying about what tasks I should also be doing, then become restless and stop after a mere thirty minutes.
      * If I am reading a book, I cannot concentrate because I will worry that I am wasting time on something that will not benefit me in the future.
      * If I am working on *homework*, I will worry about college applications or future projects that I can be doing.
   * Suffice to say, there will always be something for me to worry about, so I cannot feel peace.

So why am I asking Reddit?

* I mentioned earlier that my parents and my siblings have seen this happen before, and they just tell me to just stop. Sure, it's a simple answer, but then I deconstruct it with my overthinking abilities until it becomes meaningless, ending with me either denying what they say or forgetting about it in a matter of days.
* My family is relatively nonreceptive to my breakdowns (they don't trust me either,) so I don't believe they will listen to what I have to say anymore.
   * My parents do not care about my feelings. Whenever I try to say anything, they cut me off in a slew of yelling, downplay or predict what I said, or ignore me completely.

&amp;#x200B;

With all that into account, what should I do? Thank you so much. Say whatever you like--I hope to find advice from someone with a new perspective, that's all.",13Nov2018,1

Yet, the other day we were talking about ex’s and she showed me one ex, and he was this tall super fit guy, with big muscles. We then talked about past sex experiences and she started talking about the ones she had with him and it turned me on so much. 

Personally i don’t know if its just me being horny, but thinking of her getting dominated by that guy drove me crazy and i don’t know why, it bothers me but i also love it. She has no idea i feel this way and i am thinking about telling her and seeing how we can deal with this, im just afraid she’ll think im crazy or weird for it.

Should i tell her? And how should i bring it up if so? ",13Nov2018,1
91,"Hey everyone, so a little backstory on the situation (will be pretty general with details to retain confidentiality). We are a group of 13 college students that are planning on renting from an apartment building company in Chicago. They have a $400 application fee, and the rooms start at \~$1050 (which is the lowest cost, but it is pretty expensive for the area in Chicago). It is a new apartment building, and I have been in contact with one of the managers there trying to negotiate a deal, because we have 13 people, and I'm sure they have space that needs to be filled as they will probably have a lot of empty rooms in the coming months, so they could make a lot of money off of this as well. We are only planning on living there for four months. They are also having a promotion, where if I refer someone that person gets $500, and I get $500, and this happens for every person I refer (if I refer 3 people, they each get $500, I get $1500). 

&amp;#x200B;

So we planned on using this promotion, because either way they'd still be gaining money, or else they wouldn't have made this promotion in the first place.  Over the course of the weekend I have been negotiating with them, and before my call this was the offer we concluded on basically by Sunday night:

\-$400 application fee is waived for everyone in my group

\-$1050 rooms were brought down to $1000 per month, $1150 rooms were brought down to $1050 per month (there are only a limited number of $1000 and $1050 rooms we can get, though, and some people in my group will need to get rooms that were brought down from $1250 to $1150 per month). As well, the promotion (which I double checked on multiple times to make sure that it still works that way, and every time they have said yes, if 13 people sign up, I get $6500 and everyone gets $500, and we would all obviously split the money so that it's even for everyone).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Come Monday I had a phone call with the manager of the company, because he was supposed to send me the written format of our deal, which he took a long time to do, but basically I called him about it because some things seemed off, and this is what I got from the phone call:

1) Over the weekend a couple $1000 rooms and $1050 rooms were booked, so we'll have less of those and more people in my group will need to go to the $1150 option

2) He didn't include the promotion offer in the original written email, and when I asked about it, he said he'll put it in the letter. I get the new letter, and it again seemed off, so I called him and he seemed confused as to why I thought I would receive $6500 and everyone in my group would receive $500, and acted like I didn't understand them properly over the weekend, and apparently the promotion terms changed because my group is so big (which doesn't really seem to make sense to me)...

&amp;#x200B;

3) He also texted me late tonight letting me know that since they are making deals for a month and a half from now move in, which they don't normally do, that we must all pay first month's rent within 24 hours of signing. 

&amp;#x200B;

92,"hello I am 13F and in 8th grade.

At this point it's like a game to me. Sometimes I'll go weeks without eating. Just to wait until someone notices or see how long I can keep it up. It gives me a rush or something. It's getting addicting. I've lost all appetite and eating is like something I have to do rather than want to do.

It's hard to eat and it makes me anxious. I don't want to end up in the hospital with anorexia though. But I'm headed down that path right now I can tell.

This is important.

The owner of the business ended up getting a new herbal manager while he does his own thing. I’m not the biggest fan of the guy but I do what I am told. As I was clocking out today he asked me to stay back for a few minutes and asked if we could change my name into a more white person name so our customers wouldn’t have a hard time pronouncing my name. I honestly don’t care how people pronounce my name because I have dealt with mispronunciation since elementary school. Anytime someone says my name wrong I judge go with it because it’s easier for me. (I don’t really care it doesn’t affect me but it’s still MY name) I told him I didn’t care that they don’t say my name right and he said we should change it so customers would feel more comfortable talking to me. I told him no I was happy with my birth name and I am not changing it. I walked out. 
I called my husband furious because they knew my name when they hired me and it didn’t become a problem until this GC. 
My husband said to quit because this job has been stressing me out (I’m the only office staff) and it’s not worth my time getting disrespected or stress over them and I’m highly considering it. 
I am going to the owner of the company tomorrow to let hem know of the conversation and how I am bothered by it. I am still unsure of what i should say. 
I feel offended that he even felt like he could say that to me. I am going in at 8 to talk to the owner. I have really bad anxiety and sometimes feel like can’t do confrontation so any advice would be appreciated. I’m honestly just really offended about it. ",13Nov2018,1
94,"I was bullied throughout school and that includes being bullied for big forehead, big lips, skinny, tall, big feet - this wasn't the main reason for the bullying so maybe the bullies just threw in these taunts for good measure, but then I do know that I have a big forehead which is a huge insecurity for me. Unsurprisingly I developed body dysmophia, at it's worst twenty years ago I tried to cut off my own face and asked people to beat me up (logic was at least I'd know I was ugly).

&amp;#x200B;

My body dysmorphia is much better these days, the problem is I still don't know how I look. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some days I look in the mirror and think I'm beautiful. Some days I see all my flaws. 

I have sleeping problems and how I look when rested verses lacking sleep is vastly different. 

I'm getting older (35) so I feel my looks are fading, and I'm currently a bit bigger than I'd like to be.

I'm often told I look like [Krysten Ritter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter), and I do fit to conventional beauty standards such as white and thin.

I have a weird face that's not symmetrical, I have no idea what it's doing and feels like little control over my expressions. 

I've carried a mirror with me 24/7 since 7 years old, constantly checking my hair and makeup - I don't understand how people can just walk round without this, I look like such a mess if not freshly brushed etc. so have to assume I'm ugly.

I've had people tell me I'm attractive, I've even been told I'm the most attractive in my group of friends, but if I was that attractive maybe I wouldn't be single - sometimes people do show interest but they put no effort into getting to know me or even just trying to bed me, so I can't be that attractive. The men I date are very far from conventionally attractive, but one guy I very briefly dated earlier this year was the most attractive man I'd ever seen and it didn't take much effort to get him (granted I didn't keep him, I think because he's shallow so preferred Instagram model looking younger women). 

Whenever there's a photo of me I look HORRENDOUS, even if I can manage to get a good photo on a good day when I'm feeling attractive and take a million selfies it still doesn't look like what I see in the mirror. I can't trust other people to take photo of me as they always turn out so horrible, which is sad as I've no photos with friends. Sometimes people agree I'm not photogenic, but sometimes people have taken photos and claim they can't see why I think they're so bad - I do mean that they're bad, this isn't just a typical womans reaction to photos, it's really upsetting to see how warped I look.

&amp;#x200B;

People say you're pretty to be polite, so I can't trust others opinions. 

It's hard to feel confident when you've no idea if you're ugly or not.

So back in october I got into a minor fight with one of my close friends. I needed her to finish her part of the project and I was getting really upset over her work ethic. Out of irritation, I send her a sarcastic text message stating: “Thanks for the help”.
She got really angry at me about it and threatened to quit the project. I was able to calm her down but nothing had been the same since. 
Everytime I talk to her, she uses this fake ass smile that would put barbie to shame. She actively avoids me and pretends that everything is okay. I’ve tried multiple times to resolve the tension but she always replies with: “No, I’m not mad at all”.
This brings me to today. Earlier this night I asked her to share a document with me. As I opened it she left a passive “warning” telling me to not “mess up” her work. I got fed up and told her I’d just do it independantly, the moment after I said that she removed my access from the doc. 
I don’t know what to do. Passive people are the absolute worse because everything is so ambiguous. I’m angry but confused, sad and stressed, I don’t know what to do! 

Please share some advice, I use to really enjoy her friendship. 

Thank you

I’m curious if anyone has any advice they could give on efficient low interest rate credit cards or something of the sort I can apply for and possibly get approved to finance this watch through? I wish I could find no interest but with no credit I don’t think it would be possible. 

If anyone has any advice or help that’d be appreciated! 

Also I’d appreciate it if no one berated me with how I shouldn’t be spending money this way or using credit cards this way or something like “you shouldn’t spend money you don’t have”. I have the money I just don’t want to buy it in full. I just don’t want to get talked down to is all!

99,"Some backstory: I’ve had a bad feeling ever since I met my best friend’s boyfriend. He seems creepy to me. He’s rude, possessive, drinks too much, is crass. The list goes on and on. I haven’t had the heart to tell my friend I don’t like the guy. But I know she knows because I’m not good at hiding things. It’s actually causing some distance between us and I’m sad I’m going to lose her as my friend. This is a 25 year friendship! She’s been with this a-hike for 10 months. 

Anyway, I really hate the guy. So of course I googled him to see what I could learn and lo and behold he’s on the sex offender registry in his city for soliciting a minor for sex. As disgusted as I am, I am not surprised. I feel horrible for who ever his victim is and I can’t stop thinking of what an even bigger scumbag he is than I previously thought. 

So my question, what do I do? My friend has been telling our mutual friend that she wishes I would give her new bf a try. So I’ve heard it through the grapevine that my dislike of this guy is known. Maybe before my internet sleuthing I could have given him a twelfth try, but with this info, absolutely not.
But how do I tell my friend “I googled your bf and he’s a sex offender”? I can’t say that! But she must know? How can she not know? I’m lost here. I don’t want my friend to date this dirt bag and I don’t ever want to be near him again. 

(And before people say that people can change and be rehabilitated, yes, I agree with you. But there are so many other things wrong with this guy’s personality. This is just icing on the cake. Also, his offense involved a minor when he was well into his 30s, so that’s pretty sick.) ",13Nov2018,1
100,"This is going to be long because why not, right? I'll do my best to break it into paragraphs though.


So when I was in high school, the butt of my friend group was this one kid named uh, let's say Samuel. Samuel was always getting shit on by us (borderline bullying in hindsight) and I tried to defend him some times, but other times I joined in. Anyway at some point I met his younger sister and, although she wasn't the best looking, I was fixated on the idea of fucking her. That was 3-5 years ago.


Fast forward to last year, I have a girlfriend and Samuel and I don't really talk. His sister Susan is friends with me on snapchat and somehow we start talking. I don't mean talking in a relationship sense, just yknow, casually chatting about stupid shit. She mentioned she wanted to get a job and I offered (cautiously) to put in a good word for her at the place I work, because at that point we were friends enough for me to feel like doing her a favor. She gets an interview but her mom finds out and, doesn't want her working a job and waylays that (Susan is 18, I am 19 at the time)


Later that month (fall last year) I offer to take her for a ride on my motorcycle. As far as I can tell, I'm not into her at all, I just like her as a friend and I also like taking girls on my motorcycle. She says yes and we go out for a ride with some of my other friends (this was in the fall so I relish any body-heat I can get). The bike is my shitty ninja 300 (that was the last time I ever took a passenger on it because it's just not a fun bike for two up riding). At some point, she mentions she doesn't care how hard I ride because she regularly rides in the car with people drunk driving ( :o )


This plus the fact that I was leading the groupride for some reason plus the fact that, I kind of just didn't give a shit about her, lead to me riding as hard as I could on backroads at night (without being able to get off the seat because, yknow, passenger)


I end up scraping peg with her on the back and then we hit a set of twisties called ""burnt mills"" at like 80. I expected a deer around every corner. Anyway, it was a stupid, incredibly risky thing I did with her on the back, but I was fine because of sheer luck + pirelli rosso 2s are god-tier tires on a 300. Seriously, they won't lose grip.


Anyway I drop her home and she says she had a really good time. I don't know if she was lying but it didn't seem like she was. We continue talking on snapchat. I have a girlfriend so I don't flirt or anything like that, just basic selfies and shit like that. I did grow to actually like her as a friend, which I told her.


Summer rolls around and I take her out for a ride (yes, again) on a vfr800 deluxe. This time I'm a lot more careful because I actually give a shit about this bike, and I like her a lot better having gotten to know her more. It goes good, we talk about some shit, she (unpromptedly) ended up telling me her sex count while talking about how lifes been going for her and is like ""3 isn't a lot, right?"" and I'm like ""nah dude you do you"". We talked a bit about her boyfriend (she had several over the course of time I talked to her)

After that, the next time I take her out is weird. We agreed to go on a night ride because idk, we both thought that nighttime would be fun to cruise around in. I'm tired as FUCK but I go to pick her up after a party and she's clearly drunk/high. She said she wasn't that drunk but all the way down 202 my vfr was giving me a tendency to weave. I'm not so much of a spastic that I deathgrip the bars, and I know the road is steady, so that doesn't lend me a lot of faith that the cause of the weaving wasn't her.


Anyway, we get to Wawa and get some coffee, and we're talking on the curb, just the two of us, when abruptly she kind of says she ought to be getting home. I was a little disappointed we didn't really ride or talk, but at the same time, I was pretty tired so I didn't care. Part of me felt it was something abrupt, something CAUSED her to want to go home, but I just didn't care that much to dwell on it for some reason. I figured it was unlikely something I did, but if it was, I mean, what could I do, right?

I dropped her home and after that, we talked a bit less and less. She started taking longer to respond to my messages and snaps, and after it got to the point where she was taking 3 days to respond to a snap, I stopped snapchatting her. I figured yknow, I'm not gonna be upset for someone for taking a while to respond, because that's not mature and maybe she has something going on, but at the same time, she doesn't owe me a timely response and neither do I, so I just stopped talking to her. 



I later totalled the vfr800 on some backroads and broke my collarbone. I would be lying if I said I wasn't slightly upset that she never messaged me to ask me how I was doing. Instead she would just snapchat me once every few days a selfie (probably the same thing sent to her streaks), and take 3 days to even open my response. 


Eventually she started snapchatting me once a day. I don't like to leave people unopened, so I would open hers as soon as I got it. But i'm not going to bother responding when it wouldn't lead to a conversation, yknow?


The one time I did was when she snapped me, I opened, and 30 seconds later she snapchatted me again. I figured she was trying to maybe have a conversation, so I messaged her, but we made stupid small talk for a few messages and then when it drifted into tomorrow, I stopped responding because I don't want to have a multi-week conversation over snapchat.



Anyone see something I don't? And also, am I a bit of a dick for not responding to her snaps but opening them? I feel like a small part of me is doing that out of spite, but I don't want to be spiteful",13Nov2018,1

We made an appointment and took x-rays and the dentist recommended an orthodontist to extract the infected teeth because he said she needed that. My gfs insurance ended up running out before we could get an orthodontist appointment setup and on top of that lost her job.

Over the past half year, I have gotten to know one patient/client very well (I see the same people everyday). Last week, though, he graduated the program to resume a relatively normal sober life. But before he left and while I was congratulating him on his upcoming graduation, etc... He gave me a note with a flower drawn on it and his phone number. I told him right away that I was really sorry, but there are strict laws about not dating recent clients or even hanging out with clients, but that it was very nice. But here's the thing-- I'm quite upset about it. I can't stop thinking about how I'll never see him again, and how he'll likely get a new phone soon (because most people in the program have government-given phones while in treatment) and then there's literally no chance of ever coming across this person again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, given that background info, what I'm asking is this: 

Would it be totally wrong and messed up for me to just text him just ONE TIME so that he can at least have my number? So that, eventually, when he gets a new phone number and enough time has passed since he's been a client, he can contact me if he still wants to? 

I think it would bring me a lot of solace. Because as it stands right now, I'm the only one with any way to contact the other person. Also he isn't the type to be on social media.

110,"Growing up throughout high school I always had a friend group consisting of at least 8 friends but it ended up growing and growing as time went on. New members were added but the core pretty much remained the same. Now it is time for college and most have gone off to their respective schools. Most went to community college, others went to in state schools, and a rare few went out of state. At any rate, one of my friends I have known since sophomore year of high school went to a school in my state, only an hour and a half away southwest. Another good friend is also an hour and a half away but north. North friend comes down to the hometown often, mostly because it has been hard for him adjusting to his huge city of a school and just hasn't made that many friends, still a loyal companion. Whereas my southwestern friend has been here a decent amount of times but ever since he has been away, I could message him and he will straight up just leave me on read. This happens every single time without fail. He's not much a texter which is understandable but even when he has been down I text him to hangout I am left on read, once when he was with some of our friends at his father's house.  The worst was probably when a close friend flew from Florida to the hometown and having not seen him for a while I wanted to hangout but I unfortunately had work late. We still hungout but it was very short lived as his parents wanted him home early. That night I hear of plans on going to Southwestern friend's college. Floridian friend tells me he is planning on going. North friend hears and is dying to go to the college. At this particular college there are other's who are our friends as well so it would have been nice to see them. So i decide to text my southwestern friend as he had conceived the plans for my Floridian friend to come over. Shoot him a text and what do you know, left on read. This especially hurt me because I had to find out from the great vine, not even this man's fingers that he didn't want me or my north friend or anyone from the hometown to come. I had to hear it from my Floridian friend who I had barely seen. The reason behind this was because where he goes to college there are ratios of girls to guys that you must have to get into parties. He didn't want us cramping his style. Fine I thought, I personally would have been fine just hanging out exploring the college and a nearby city but ok. Turns out they didn't even go to any parties for some reason unbeknownst to me. Flashfoward a few weeks time and I receive some goodies, 14 grams of molly. I had been hyping this up because over the summer a few friends took it and I had taken it at senior prom. Everyone saw I had an amazing time at prom and were jealous, however most didn't say much to me at all about. So southwestern friend finds out and immediately hits me up asking for some. In the back of my mind I was saying to myself, wait wasn't it just two weeks ago he denied me and a couple of my friends, for a mere selfish endeavour, a party, which is available to him a lot because he goes to a university. So o just replied with a short yeah. I talked to a bunch of our mutual friends and they have all mutually, unanimously agreed that him flat out ignoring me and other is really not cool. So my question is, should I take an eye for an eye and just leave him on read from henceforth, or should I upcharge him for the mdma or just explain to him why I am upset. I hate being petty but at the same time this really pissed me off especially when I just wanted to visit him and my other friends.",13Nov2018,1

Last weekend after talking to my academic and financial advisors I called my grandparents and asked for advice they said they both could and would pay for my tuition this semester. Tonight my mother asked me what progress I made on getting a loan for this semester and I explained everything that had happened and she blew up and started cursing at me and asking how dare I do this and then she got my dad and he came in and got in my face yelling at me and then he grabbed me by the shirt and put me against a wall I pushed him away and then he came back and tried putting me against the stove and the stove top was on. My mom kept trying to get between us. I pushed away and moved towards the door. I tried one last time to talk it out and they still wouldn’t listen so I told them I would come home when I felt safe. I didn’t think they would take this well so I had packed a go bag but I didn’t think it would come to that. Unfortunately I don’t have my birth certificate or social security number just some state ID. I ran to my gf’s house and talked to her parents who had known what was going on. My mother called them and I didn’t hear the full thing but I think she implied that if they didn’t send me home she would call the police and say I assaulted her. I walked home and tried to talk to her and the whole exchange was really strange. She kept trying to get me inside and to come all the way upstairs to the bathroom where the rest of the family was I kept repeating no I don’t feel comfortable with that so she finally agreed to talk to me in the entrance hall even though she was cold. I explained for probably reason billionth time all the factors that made me do this and she agreed but I could tell it wasn’t actual agreement more just a yes shut up don’t make a scene come inside. I called my grandparents and let them know what has happened and their worried my dad will use this to cut them off from me and my siblings. Don’t pay it and they might get to see us. I love the major and despite feeling like shit all the time I’m passing all my classes with high B’s at least. I had to drop chem but I’ll probably try and take it over the summer or next semester. I feel like my life is a mess and I don’t know what to do. I just want to go to school.,13Nov2018,1
113,"Okay so I finally moved out of my parents place about 4 months ago (I just turned 20). The first month or so was smooth sailing with me and my roommate but once my roomates girlfriend got back from her summer vacation she started coming over a lot. I’m talking like 5 days a week. I gave it some time considering my roommate hadn’t seen his girlfriend all summer because she was across seas. After 3 or so weeks of her being over for 4-5 days of the week I talked to my roommate about it. I explained that it’s uncomfortble because I want time alone and some time to myself, quiet time basically. Considing I work from home it’s kinda annoying when there are two people sitting out in the living room watching tv all day. Sometime he would leave her there while he went to class which really made me and my girlfriend uncomfortable. He understood and cut it back a bit but recently more problems have started. So when we moved into this place my parents and I spent a lot of money on furniture. We bought the dinning table, couch, coffee table, and a nice media cabinet for our living room. I also gave my roommate some of my old furniture cause all he had was a mattress and a tv. The TV he put in the living room so we both could use it. The only problem is him and his girlfriend are on my couch watching his tv all day long. I don’t mean like they are on it for 5-7 hours I’m talking about they wake up at 9am sit down and watch tv until 12 every single time she is over. They are couch potatoes, my roommate barely leaves the house. When my girlfriend or any of my friends comes over we are forced to just hang in my room because they are on my couch watching tv and cooking up a mess in my kitchen. I understand it’s his tv and he doesn’t have one in his room but I think he could be a little more considerate considering she is over 3-4 days a week on my couch. It has come to the point th
at I see she car parked in the parking lot and I don’t wanna go home. Like just tonight after I worked a super long weekend (out of the house I might add) I hear my roommate is in his room playing video games and when I walk out to get some water she is in the living room doing her homework on my dining table alone. I felt very uncomfortable. I feel like my personal space is constantly being invaded and I don’t know how to approach my roommate about it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",13Nov2018,1
114,"    Short intro, I guess. I’m a 16 year old dude, my mom is 40, not sure how relevant age is to all of this. Several months ago, I asked my mom if I could go visit family alone a few states away, as I know she doesn’t want to pay for her ticket and she likely couldn’t get the time off work, over Christmas break, (not during Christmas Day). I’d specifically go for one of my cousins who I always have a great time with, I only see her twice a year for about a week or two at a time. My cousin and her mom just came here for the weekend to go to a football game, and I had a lot of fun with her. 

    I asked my mom about going to visit them during Christmas several months ago, and she said she’d think about it. She’s now saying that because I saw my cousin this last weekend,  I don’t need to see her again for a while, she hasn’t completely said no yet, but she likely won’t let me go. I just don’t understand the logic behind it. My mom won’t be the one paying for the ticket if I do end up going, and we have no plans for anything over Christmas break, so I just don’t understand why my mom wouldn’t let me go. Even if I saw my cousin recently, that doesn’t mean that I can’t see her again, it’s not some radical inconvenience. I asked her if she had any other reason and she didn’t.
 
     I just would like to know if there’s any way I could try to convince her to let me go within the next few days, because after that ticket prices go up substantially. Any and all advice is appreciated, thanks for wasting your time to read this.",13Nov2018,1
115,"Hello.

I went to an extremely demanding High School and graduated with a honorary mention. I went on to an extremely demanding college where I study right now, while I also try to keep up with doing some sport, having healthy relationship and **a** relationship, developing skills I'm interested in on the side and getting freelance gigs that pay little-to-no-money but land me in the right places.

This means I have been accustomed, as most of you surely are, to a lifestyle that is mostly about work, with little sleep and very little time to relax. I enjoy my work, I think curiosity is one of my greatest qualities and even when I have free time I seem to come up with projects and things to study and learn. I love this lifestyle.

BUT.

Over the years, I developed a sort of internal bully that has kept me up to scratch when working: I feel guilty when I relax and do things just to have fun for too long. The problem is this bully does not go away once the semester is over, it's not gone when I have no gigs, it's not gone when I *decide* I need a vacation.

I can be sitting in a hammock at the beach, drinking beer with my friends and girlfriend in the middle of a beautiful summer and something in my mind will tell me: stop wasting your time.

I've talked to other people with similar lifestyles and they all deal with this but It's not been that big of a problem until now. I know people like this are, well, the majority of truly adult population who maintain families and work real jobs.

So here I ask to you, fellow redditors:

How do you learn to chill the fuck out?",13Nov2018,1
116,"
My boyfriend and I have been best friends for years, together as a couple for 2 years. Before we ever got together I once googled his dad's name out of curiosity (he's a Dr.) and found that he is a stage three sex offender on the registry. Some extra snooping found a news article that showed he fondled a patient's breast during an examination, not sure if there are other offences. 

I've kept this to myself until now but it's all I can think about when I see his dad or his family. I don't know how I'm supposed to pretend I don't know anything for the foreseeable future when it's such an ugly, horrible offence. 

The dilemma is I don't know if my boyfriend knows. Do I keep this to myself until we break up or die old together, or should I put this out in the open now rather than later? But then I worry that it's possible he has no idea what his dad has done (he was 15 at the time), in which case I run the risk of ruining his relationship with his dad by saying something!! 

My head is running in circles and I can't stop thinking about his horrible, abusive dad and the fact my sweet boyfriend is either too ashamed to tell me or just doesn't know the truth. Do I then have a duty to tell him?

Thank you so much if you've read this. Any insight you have would be so appreciated. This isn't something I can talk to friends or my mum about, because I don't want to ruin their opinion of his family.  Please tell me if this whole thing is none of my concern or business and I should just let things rest",13Nov2018,1
118,"For the last few years I have been a really social guy, friend of everyone, but the other day I had something weird happening to me, I made a couple of friends feel really uncomfortable at home, I never meant to and barely realized, so we meet up at my house with the idea of cooking together and having a good time, I was with my girlfriend too, so we were 4, two couples.
The afternoon went on we were cooking pasta and brownies. There was one thing which bothered me and it was that my friends started drinking, I didn't expect our afternoon/evening to be like that but ended up accepting it and joining, after we finished cooking one of my friends wanted to light up a joint, another unexpected but acceptable thing, as I smoke as well (but I'm leaving it as I don't feel like it anymore), either way, we all smoked a little bit and the food was naturally awesome, tho I noticed something weird about my friend's ways during the dinner I just ignored it. We went to sleep after that.
Next morning we cleaned up, had lunch, and my friends left.
The night after that (Tonight) my girlfriend told me our friends felt like I did not want them to be in my place and that they felt uncomfortable, they didn't want to tell me personally but they told her, she didn't notice anything weird as we have been together for a couple of years now and she knows my ways.

121,"This is my first post ever so the format and sub may be wrong so I'll try to keep this brief. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother recently broke up with her abusive boyfriend of 12 years despite being warned that he was a past felon and was exploiting her loneliness. He was a a scumbag but he financially 'supported' her for all those years and now that he's a fugitive (he got out of prison, violated probation and is now on the run after making death threats to my family), she has no income and relies on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't the place for my life story so I'll basically say she treated me like shit and ignored me growing up, yet I always loved her unconditionally and maybe out of guilt because of my inner hatred for her. Now that she needs me I don't know what to do. I don't make much money since I live off medical retirement from the Army after sustaining combat injuries overseas. I can't drive because of my PTSD and I'm sure she's aware that I rely on her for that aspect. I still have hopes of getting married in the future and at the very least begin dating again before I reach my late 20s.. but she's asking for half of my monthly pay to meet her 'needs'. If I don't give her exactly half of what I receive she says I'm ungrateful or starts 'crying' that nobody else is willing to help her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still coping with my own issues, mainly PTSD, physical injuries from the Army and I'm still grieving for my girlfriend/fiancee who killed herself 4 years ago. I always thought I was cold and carried myself with a stoic demeanor but this is breaking me down. I'll definitely have no family of my own in the future if this continues and I'm not sure what to do. I thought my life was coming together slowly over these past years and now this arises. This is fucking embarrassing because I've been to war and survived years of childhood abuse... but this is the thing that breaks me.

123,"Hey r/advice i’m a 15 year old guy, sophomore in high school and i’ve a dilemma on my school situation. I have a very good close group of friends at my current school and it is supposedly the best public high school in my state. However my family has gone through a lot of shit in the past few years. Around when I was 12 my middle sister (i am youngest of three) began doing drugs and drinking quite frequently. When it got bad enough we sent her to rehab on an intervention and she’s been a bit better since. But, the entire school found out about this and there is now an extreme prejudice towards our family. Being that I live in a snobby suburb where people think if you drink or smoke you are the reincarnation of satan. 
My parents also just filed for divorce 3ish weeks ago and I’m at home with just my mom now. My dad and mom have both been fighting a bit over me and my dad wants to move me away because of the environment my mom allows at our house (let’s sister smoke weed and drink underage). He doesn’t want to take it to court but he’s said time and time again that he could get custody in 5 seconds. So with this i’ve been presented a opportunity to go with him somewhere and transfer schools. This would be good because i would have a clean slate with none of the prejudice of my old school, but it would also suck having no friends especially since i’m not the most social kid. I also don’t want to leave my mom, given i’d be able to see her but i love her very much, but i also love my dad. I’m very torn between going with him but i feel like it would be just to transfer and staying at my school with my friends and mom. Any sort of advice/help would be extremely appreciated

A couple of weekends ago, he asked me to pick up some things for him from a mutual friends of theirs as part of the final proceedings of the divorce. Ties with him and the friends were severed when they divorced, I imagine as part of him trying to move on. He told me he needs his anonymity, he wants to really be free of that side of things, so please don’t divulge any information to them. And I thought yeh! Fair enough.

I show up and they’re glaring at me from the door. He’d given them a fake name for me, and they knew it was fake. They wouldn’t give me his stuff without seeing my ID so I figured, it’s about me and not him, handed it over. He then asks to take a picture, considering the value of what I’m transporting I thought fair enough, sure. But I had a bad feeling about it.

As soon as I pull away I start to panic. I call him and tell him what’s happened and he’s the most upset I’ve ever heard him. We’ve now been fighting about it for weeks. We haven’t been able to be intimate since either. He’s completely changed and if it’s brought up he’s still very very mad. 

He feels he was really clear to not share anything about me or him, and now he doesn’t feel he can trust me. Today I tried to say that I just understood the part of don’t tell them about HIM and didn’t get the full picture of how important it was to him to not share about me either. He seems to think I understood and told them anyway, to fulfill some other “agenda” of mine. I really don’t see it that way, I misunderstood the gravity of the situation and what was important to not share. 

He seems to worry about me, he said I have no idea what I’ve opened up now that they have my name, age, and address. And he wants so desperately to move on with his life and anonymity was a part of being able to do that. He mentioned today about it being a “fatal error”.

I fucked up. I know I did. I’m so sorry and I wish I could take it back but I can’t.

Did I ruin the relationship? What can I say to help him understand it wasn’t malice, it was incompetence.

Quick summary:
I’m 17, next year is the last year I could possibly do grade 12. 
I’ve always wanted to graduate from highschool just like everyone else, and I’m totally capable !! 
My parents are very set on ‘no’ because I’ve moved schools like 10 times (mostly when I was grade 8-10 because my anxiety was terrible &amp; I was involved in a LOT of drama, but now it’s honestly barely noticeable, I’m just shy). 
My last school move was earlier this year. 
I begged my mum to let me stay, but she dropped me out. I literally had no say, I was so happy there &amp; had no problems, so I know I am completely capable of going to school! It’s honestly just my dream to go to school &amp; graduate

I have finished grade 11 through distance ed:) 

So is there any way I can convince them to send me to school next year? We just moved house &amp; there’s a public school right by me!

141,"Here’s the deal. My husband and I have horrible choices regarding healthcare at this moment in time. We make too much to get a government credit/subsidy for healthcare. I am an independent contractor so no healthcare is offered to me. His job offers healthcare that’s $350 a month only for him (won’t cover me) and it’s pretty much a catastrophic plan. We can’t obviously get Medicaid. What should we do? I have a few options I’ve compiled from different areas and I’m not sure what the best option is at this point. 

Note: we have no current conditions/diagnosis, we are 23 and healthy, go to the doctor maybe once a year if ill but that’s it, however we are looking forward towards if we were to have a child (probably not even this year, but eventually). 

1. Short Term Health Care Plans—- $200 or so a month for us both and they pay up to 1 million with 0% coinsurance and a 2500$ deductible. Lasts up to (you can pick) a year and covers prescription drugs, accident, hospital, doctors visits, etc. Only excludes some random things (kidney failure?, sports team injury, etc) and it does exclude pregnancy so doesn’t help me there although not an issue for now. It renews every 3 months and excludes only conditions previous to starting the first time with them as preexisting (if I discover I have heart disease in January—they won’t consider it preexisiting in November even though it’s a different set of 3 months as long as I was with them in January). However deductible and such resets every 3 months. If we discover we have a more serious health issue, we could jump to an aca/major medical plan later although potentially inconvenient or difficult depending on the time of year. 

2. Catastrophic plan. We could pay for this and it covers everything we could need with no limit for 500$ a month for us two after the 7500$ deductible is met. We pay $500 monthly regardless of whether we use it though and MOST of what we would encounter will likely never be $7500. When we have a child, we will have to pay $7500 that year, for certain, but it’s at least somewhat capped at that price? Just difficult to imagine paying that. 

3. More expensive bronze/gold/silver plans: $650-900 a month. We simply can’t afford this comfortably and the deductible for these are still around 5k and they have a coinsurance where you must pay 20% on top of that. Seems like a worse deal than the catastrophic even. 

What sucks the least? 

TL;DR: all health plans appear to suck. Which one is the least sucky from the list above?

The manager claimed he called me and noted I was supposed to bring money but never did “back in September”. I kindly reminded him that back in September, I did but he said that management said it wasn’t ready. He claims he doesn’t recall that and that “everything is noted and he called me and left me a message early September” so he gave the garage to someone else. He automatically gets defensive when I ask him if he can tell me the date and time he left me the message so I can pull it up and he starts saying I’m “playing games” with him and “he’s not going to go backwards but move forward to see what he can do to accommodate me”. I’m actually more upset over his attitude. If he messed up and forgot to make a note or forgot to call me, he should just say so. I hate the fact that I literally had waited almost 10 months for a garage for my apartment and didn’t end up getting one. At this rate I don’t even care for the garage anymore, it’s more of I hate the feeling of being stepped on by my property manager. 

Is there anything I should/can say or do to explain my frustration to them, or should I just ride it out for the remaining 4 months and find a new place? I guess I’m just looking for an apology for the whole ordeal but I doubt I’d get one.",13Nov2018,1

I'm unemployed and have literally no money; still living at home and trying to get myself together. But I want to be able to give gifts this year. At the very least I need three (for both my brothers and brother's boyfriend) but I'd like to figure something out for my parents too if I can. 

The thing is I have noooo idea what to do! Brother #1 is very picky and difficult to shop for - he usually just asks my parents for gift cards. Knickknacks and whatnot are out for both him and his boyfriend because they live together. So I was thinking homemade snacks in reusable, decorative jars, but then that rules out my other brother because he doesn't really eat snacks and I wanted to have similar gifts for simplicity. 

Any tips or ideas from people who have been in such a scenario???

147,"I've never had a real fight with a friend before, probably because I'm a very passive, easygoing person who will usually instantly just apologize to avoid conflict, even if I'm not really in the wrong. I reached my breaking point with the person I consider my best friend last night, though. I love her, but it seems like even though I'm there 99% of the time for her, the moment I'm not perfect or make a mistake she's just instantly upset with me. Her responses are short, my attempt at conversation is blocked, and she treats me like a pet that is being punished for misbehaving. 

This time it was because I left her hanging in a conversation on Saturday night when I was out. She was going through some tough stuff, but to be honest she usually is, and most of the time I try to give her my full attention, but I work a full time job and got distracted with the weekend and just wanting to have a bit of me time so I stopped looking at my messages when I felt the subject was starting to go in circles. The next day I try to check in on her and she's giving me one word answers. When I'm finally blunt enough to ask her why she's acting like this, she tells me that she is ""halting communication"" for now because I upset her by not answering the night before. So, I finally just snapped. I told her that I'm not going to be treated like I'm a shit friend for petty stuff like this anymore, and if she really wants to halt communication that's what she'll get. I haven't spoken to her for 24 hours. I feel like a shitty, awful person but at the same time I'm still so mad. I care about her, but I want to stand up for myself. 

I just need some wisdom from someone who has maybe been through some similar stuff. Am I overreacting? Am I a bad person for getting upset, is she right to be mad? This is all so confusing for me. Even if you just read through this, thanks. I really needed to get this out of my system, but don't want to gossip about her to mutual friends, I do respect her even though I'm upset with her.

150,"A bit of context: I'm 16 and this is the first time I've ever dealt with a loss of someone who I'm very close with. Visited my grandmother in the hospital on sunday night from about 12 to 1 am in order to say goodbye. Her mind has been gone for a while now and she was being given morphine, so she was asleep. 

My parents, aunts, uncles, and older cousins had been taking turns watching her, as they dont want her to be alone when she passed. Me being in the awkward zone between a child and an adult, I was the youngest to go in and see my grandma. I said 'I love you', 'Thank you for everything', and 'Goodbye'. Now, I had done my fair share of crying (learning about how long she has left, driving to visit, during the visit, driving back, and when I was going to bed), which brings me to my first problem.

She passed Monday morning, about 9 hours after I visited her, and 10 minutes before I got home from my 2nd period class. I went back to school and hung out and joked around with my friends, took notes, everything was normal. 

It makes me feel guilty.

Am I allowed to act this normal so soon? What should I do or not do in order to respect and avoid disrespecting her passing?

153,"Still trying to wrap my head around this one, but..

Grad student, been living here about a year and a half now. My roommate and I have pointedly not gotten to know each other at all. I try to keep out of his way, but I'm naturally pretty messy and he seems obsessively neat, so I'm sure I must have been annoying him. From what little I've seen he seems smart, professional, and very fit, though he's also a dwarf.

I keep kind of an insane liquor collection. I don't hit it particularly hard, but I'm sort of a whiskey snob and have a collection of assorted things. Several months ago I was in his room for some reason (retrieving dog, watering plants, dropping a package... can't remember), and noticed a book called ""Living Sober"" by AA on his desk. I didn't make much of it besides feeling guilty for looking, and have tried to keep the whiskey cabinet doors closed (generally he never uses the upper cabinets since he can't reach them without using a stepladder.)

Anyway: A few months ago I was out drinking with friends, and got way too drunk and sad, and decided to lay off the booze myself for a bit. I did find a new gin that I really liked that night, though, and decided to buy a bottle but leave it for my inevitable return to drinking. I had a lot of alcoholic family members so anytime I notice myself drinking more than I like, I back off for a while. This time I decided to wait for the new year, and have been sticking to that.

Fast forward... roommate left for a bit to have surgery and recover, came back, then left again after a week or so with no explanation (he sent me a text after he'd been gone for a bit, saying he'd be away). He didn't take his car. Today I happened to look in my liquor cabinet, and the bottle of gin I wasn't gonna touch is like, 80% empty.

So... I kind of get the impression he relapsed hard, stole a bunch of booze and then left to go to rehab/let his parents take care of him for a while. I'm not sure what to do about this, if anything.

tl;dr: Roommate has AA book in his  room, a bunch of my gin is gone and I didn't drink it.",13Nov2018,1

J have been attending CBT and I have recently had my anti-deppressants dosage increased. I was working, and I had a good job with good pay, but really shitty managers. They were getting increasingly annoyed with me being ill and having to have time off, they'd changed my position at work and piled a load of work on me that should have been someone else's responsability, and the pressure, and the slog of getting out of the house in the morning with a 10month old and high on Oxy just became too much. So, I went to the doctors told them how I was feeling and they said I shouldn't be working.
The anxiety about what my managers are saying about me now is tearing me up but I do feel like a weight has been lifted, to a degree.

161,"Hi, so I'm a bisexual girl, aged 20.

I've always liked women, but I've only ever been with men. 

I have found it difficult in the past to actively like and pursue women due to trauma and being literally terrified of my own vagina, lmao, not knowing how to please myself, thus thinking there would be no way in hell I could ever feel confident enough to please another woman. 

I also struggle with extremely low self esteem and confidence. My attraction to women has always been quickly overcome by intense jealousy. It wasn't like this until I hit puberty, before then I would find it easy to crush on women. 

I hate my personality and, please don't judge me for this, find more problems in that in relation to being with a woman than with a man, because it feels much more closely, personally competitive. 

But recently I have begun discovering myself a lot more and my original attraction to women has been unearthed. Recently I've found that it's not even a challenge to put my own personal issues aside to simply like a woman for her looks, style, and personality. I have started to appreciate women for who they are and not what I'd rather look like or be like. 

I'm not yet ready to date anybody, as I know I have a lot more to do with myself and discover about myself before I can commit to loving another person, but I feel that when I begin to date again, I want it to be with women. 

I just don't know how. I don't know what I'd say. I have no idea what to put on a dating profile to warn other ladies that I have absolutely no experience sexually or romantically with them, and I feel that it's kind of my duty to put it out there. Other lesbians and bisexual women who are comfortable with themselves would probably want to know so there aren't any surprises that could jeopardise a possible relationship. I don't want to seem like I'm just 'sick of men and trying it out with the girls' cause that's not what this is at all. 

I don't know how to have sex with women. I don't know how to flirt with them. I don't know how to make them comfortable and I don't know how to alert them to the fact that I'm terrified and frigid and don't know what the fuck I'm doing. 

I really would appreciate some advice on this. Anything at all, but please don't be rude about this as its a genuine fear and something I really need help with. I don't want to come across as 'less than' to other girls. I don't want to come across wrong. I don't know how! I wouldnt know where to begin. I don't know how to flirt. Sexual attraction is something that comes later for me in a relationship unless it's seriously INSTANT and I've only ever had that with my most recent ex boyfriend and like, celebrities. I'm terrified! I still have a bit to go before I commit to this but any advice would be so appreciated.

I had a fan on loud so they wouldn't hear (or so I thought) and I was being careful. Nobody said anything so I thought okay, and have done it for a while since then.

164,"So, I'm at a loss of what to do, and I feel like either choice will have some major impact, but that could also be my anxiety causing me to overthink things. A bit of backstory is necessary; A year ago, I went through a rough break up and had to move out from my living situation. Since then, I moved into a 1 bedroom apartment I thought I could afford reasonably for $975 a month. I didn't realize that they would charge me monthly maintenance fees, which puts me over 1k a month for rent. Then I got fired from my job in May, which put me in a really rough spot financially, and fucked over my credit. I got another job a couple months later, but since then, I've been so behind on credit payments, bills, etc. and I owe so much money everywhere that it's become so overwhelming, and due to my rent that basically takes my entire paycheck, I haven't been able to really get ahead at all. I only have one more month left of living in this apartment, but I'm stuck on what to do now. I don't want to stay at this apartment anymore because it's WAY too expensive for what I currently make. I'm basically left with two options:

* Move back in with my mother, rent free.   
\- However, I'm a trans man, and my mother isn't very accepting of it. She helps me out, but still refers to me as her ""daughter"" and uses my dead name while I have a beard and masculine voice. I'm not fully passing imo, but most folks perceive me as masculine.   
\- I also would likely have to quit my current job because I would be moving to NW Indiana (currently residing in suburban IL)  I'm on the fence about this. I'm not necessarily in love with my job, but I know it's a good opportunity for career development, and I have only been working there since July, so I'm always concerned about how that looks on a resume. I also hate job hunting, and am worried about being unemployed while having to still make payments on shit without any income. Plus, I don't want to stay in Indiana at all, and would prefer to stay in Illinois, more specifically the Chicagoland area. My job doesn't pay amazingly well, but I'm a social worker, so I'll never really be paid amazingly well ever.
* Try to pursue moving to Chicago  
\- I have reached out and gotten in contact with some LGBTQ identifying folks that are also trans, so I don't have to worry about having any conflict regarding my identity. The rent for the apartment I'm looking at is $500, which is far more reasonable, and the person I was in contact with was aware of my poor credit and said that they would be willing to be a co-signer, which I was really surprised about. It is in Chicago, so I would still have to commute for work out in the burbs, but if anything, I could still have my job while possibly pursuing a new job in Chicago. Living back in Chicago is a major goal of mine, along with going back to school for my Masters.  
\- The issue with this is I'm not guaranteed this apartment. I am supposed to go meet up with the potential roommates this week, but I was informed that there is someone else that is wanting to apply for the apartment. I feel gross about having to ""compete"" for housing, and I'm super anxious about not being accepted.   


Basically, I'm just not sure which path to go towards. I've been struggling for the past year, and I need to recover, but I'm not sure which option is best for me. It's just overwhelming and I feel like I have no clear answer. Any advice would be so appreciated.  And if there is any more information that's needed, please lmk. ",13Nov2018,1

166,"So here’s the backstory... one of my friends is getting married and he’s very successful and most of his friends are of the same socioeconomic class.

I’m a regular guy who works hard to get by. 

For his bachelor party we’re going to Miami for what will likely be one of the craziest weekends of my life. I worked really hard to save up enough to go because literally no expense will be spared and I’m really excited to have achieved my goal to save enough to go and I’m looking forward to blowing it guilt free on all the vices you can expect to find at bachelor party.

However the amount of money I’m bringing (which by my standards is a lot) is basically pocket change to everyone else going. Admittedly this is a bit intimidating but they’re all down to earth guys who I know I don’t need to compete with when it comes to spending and I’m readily prepared to live within my means. 

The advice I seek from you all is how to best blend in when out and about at high end restaurants and clubs. The rest of the guys going are so wealthy that they are used to enjoying a life of pleasure on a regular basis. Bottle service on weekends, beautiful women everywhere, etc.

As far as looks go I fall somewhere in the average-to-decent category and will blend in with everyone else in the group as far as that goes. But as an average man I’m not used to above average women throwing themselves at me and I’m trying to figure out exactly to handle that. I know it’s a good problem to have but I still want to make sure I don’t stand out like a sore thumb being the only “regular” guy.

We get like 6 months to do it and we need to conduct our own research and get mentors and the whole lot, so the project isn’t very forgiving of mistakes or being misinformed. 

So one girl in my class is doing her project on Asperger’s syndrome and she was made to introduce her topic so that the class could critique it and give her advice to how she should approach it. So I’m obviously not a mental health expert but I vaguely remember reading that Aspergers isn’t its own thing in that it’s considered apart of the autism spectrum. I brought it up during the advice session just bringing up my concern kind of as a question because I wasn’t sure and she responded kind of rudely and said how it was wrong to be considered under the autism spectrum and it just seemed kind of hostile even though I brought it up very gently. I was more trying to encourage her to research it a little more. 

I searched it up tonight and it seems like it’s apart of the autism spectrum, right? 

My question would first be, is aspergers a separate condition independent of autism? 

And if not, should I bring it up to her again? 

I would hate for her to lose marks on that and I’m not sure if she even would because it’s being read by a mental health professional. 

Also her attitude when I last brought it up just seems kind of weird and I’ve known her from a few classes and she’s very odd. She blames the school as to why she gets low marks and complains saying how it would suck that because of her marks she couldn’t be a lawyer because she’d be a great lawyer, like what...

I feel like he puts everyone before me, sometimes I even feel like he's embarrassed of me. I just wish there would be atleast a bit of effort, even just asking me out for dinner or to the movies. I could never tell him this, I have 0 confidence and I feel like he would get offended? Thats probably just the anxiety but it took me 2 weeks just to say do you still like me lol which he said ofc i do but the feeling wont go away. I mean how many people do you know that have been together for 2 years and see each other less than once a week when they live in the same town :/ I love him, it hurts me to think that we might not be together in the future. 

He's the best person in the world in my eyes but I feel so unwanted, even when we're together. I don't know what to do, I know I should talk to him I've tried but as soon as I start I just change the subject because I'm scared of what will happen.

I should also say I'm not hard to be around, I don't put my insecurities on him or anything like that we usually have fun when we're together that's why it's so confusing, if anyone has any advice  or just some words to boost my confidence and finally try talk about it I would really appreciate it",13Nov2018,1

I sometimes have thoughts of having an affair with him, but I feel gross for thinking about it. I thought that my feelings for him would go away when I mentioned that I confessed that I liked him to guarantee a rejection and I thought it work for a while, but someone made a passing comment on how the both of us should date.

We have no idea if we should watch out for any certain behaviors or avoid doing certain things. If any extra information is needed I'll try my best to provide it.

Well my dad wants our grandpa to move in with us due old age (72) and increasingly reckless behavior, but because of his behavior, the rest of us have been become worried. Our grandpa has spent large amounts of money on obvious scams, he's been kicked out apartments multiple times for monetary reasons (5 times this year alone), lied to my dad just to get more money and he's done other similarly reckless things. My dad is ignoring every negative aspect of his father, he thinks he can do no wrong. The fact grandpa's other sons aren't taking care of him at all, is pretty much a giant red flag for us, it shows that he's either not that trustworthy or a complete pain to handle. We do understand that he's family but it's hard to accept a person with such a track record into our home. My dad sends him money monthly to help him with rent, he's been sending him money for almost 10 years. He's even asked my dad for outrageous amounts of money, just last month he asked for 1200$ for a Nigerian prince-esk scam, which is typically the kind of scams he falls victim to. We already have a problem with our dad, he's been wasting money on ""investment"" companies and stocks, which he has only been making losses with, on top of that he's in the mindset of a mlm drone. The addition of our grandpa just spells financial doom, as our dad is already 75k in debt with the investment stuff, it's already hard trying to get our dad out of the hole he's dug himself in.

I have been best friends with this girl for almost 6 years and we’ve been together through a lot. She’s helped me through a lot in my life, and I like to think i’ve helped her a lot in return. We used to hang out together all the time and we were really close, but now that’s all changing. She got into a new relationship about a month ago and she’s completely ditched all of her friends. She’s canceled plans i’ve made with her so she could hang out with him. She’s lied saying she’s busy with homework or hanging out with other friends, when in reality she is with him. He’s almost all she ever talks about. 

I am happy for her, and I want her to be in a happy relationship. I myself have a boyfriend, and when I first started dating him I made a major effort to balance my time. I never neglected her or my other friends for him. I want her to learn how to manage her time because it’s getting to a point that feels unhealthy.

189,"I will try to keep this as short as possible. My husband has a daughter with his ex girlfriend. They have a custody agreement that states 70/30 custody (70 to the mother) so my husband pays child support. 

My husband basically bends over backwards to meet his ex’s demands. In the beginning of our relationship, she would ask him very personal questions about us to “make sure” this isn’t going to end up like his previous relationship that ended in a divorce. She doesn’t want their daughter getting attached to someone who isn’t going to be in her life anymore which I can understand as I have a son of my own who is 6 months younger than her daughter (they love each other, it’s awesome).

She’s pretty intrusive and vengeful so my husband walks on eggshells around her for the sake of their daughter. There have been two occasions where I wasn’t allowed to come to certain events to be with my step-daughter because my husband didn’t want to say ‘no’ to his ex about boundaries and didn’t want to rock the boat with her. His main fear is that she will try to take him to court for full custody. His fear is that since he has 2 DUI’s (he had a really rough time with his previous divorce from a separate woman and made some bad decisions, went to rehab and hasn’t drank since) and has been to jail because of that, that his ex might have some ammo for her threats. 

This is all becoming really difficult for me because I keep telling him to stand up to her and tell her no, stick to their custody agreements and to avoid hanging out together with their daughter because from my understand, it’s just going to make her think her parents are bound to get back together and I’m the only thing standing in the way. If this were happening to me with my son’s father, where he was asking for full custody because of my past I’d say *squinty eyes* “bring it on” and fight to make sure he couldn’t just take advantage of me like that (I however have full custody and no visitation/no contact from him thankfully). 

My husband and I are planning on getting pregnant next month and I’m kind of terrified of what that will do too but that’s a whole different situation. I’m just wondering, does she have some leverage in this situation? Will his past allow her to take full custody of their daughter if she feels like it one day? I’m hoping that understanding the legal side of this could help ease my husband’s mind a bit and keep him from doing her bidding all of the time, especially if we will be having a child of our own together soon.

193,"Hey there. I'm just a random person on the Internet, but I'm just feeling some pressure so I'm asking for some advice and/or comfort.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a bit of background to assess my situation:

* I am currently a high school senior who performs at the top of his class, and is currently in the process of filling out college applications.
   * I do not do any sport-related extracurriculars on a day-to-day basis; however, I am involved in multiple academic/community service clubs.
* I do not indulge in any other inappropriate behaviors (e.g. underage drinking, drugs, theft, crime, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I will just lay down my problems:

* I drown my sadness, frustration, or worry in YouTube videos or videogames (namely, League of Legends) and seclude myself from my parents on a regular basis. They treat the game like how the Chinese government treated *Monster Hunter: World:* a complete ban.
   * As a result, I play in secret, enduring angry lectures (often at high volume) of my parents yelling at me that I am never on top of my things.
   * I have long evaded my parents' attempts to control my play activity, but given that one of my parents is quite experienced at computer software, the battle lingers on and they don't feel like giving up anytime soon.
* This has gone on for quite some time, so likely, my parents don't exactly trust me anymore--rather, no one in my immediate family trusts me at all (my siblings got dragged into this.) I gave up trying to regain my trust; I did not know how and I still don't know what to do to this day.
* Obviously, the fact that I'm posting this is an acknowledgement that LoL is a problem at the moment. However, I feel a compulsion to remain ""free"" from my parents' restrictions, and currently believe that a life with LoL is still possible and balance-able.
   * How do I know this? I lived by myself very recently in a pre-college environment for six weeks without any restrictions with my parents whatsoever, and was able to excel at the pre-college courses, regulate sleep at decent levels, and maintain a great relationship with the college professors. During that time, I was able to play LoL with friends at the college on a regular basis.
* My life is still laced with stress, with me constantly worrying about every activity that I perform (besides video games, ironically.) 
   * A few examples:
      * If I am say, practicing violin, I will begin worrying about what tasks I should also be doing, then become restless and stop after a mere thirty minutes.
      * If I am reading a book, I cannot concentrate because I will worry that I am wasting time on something that will not benefit me in the future.
      * If I am working on *homework*, I will worry about college applications or future projects that I can be doing.
   * Suffice to say, there will always be something for me to worry about, so I cannot feel peace.

So why am I asking Reddit?

* I mentioned earlier that my parents and my siblings have seen this happen before, and they just tell me to just stop. Sure, it's a simple answer, but then I deconstruct it with my overthinking abilities until it becomes meaningless, ending with me either denying what they say or forgetting about it in a matter of days.
* My family is relatively nonreceptive to my breakdowns (they don't trust me either,) so I don't believe they will listen to what I have to say anymore.
   * My parents do not care about my feelings. Whenever I try to say anything, they cut me off in a slew of yelling, downplay or predict what I said, or ignore me completely.

I didn't end up working that night. She later messaged me saying I was also working Sunday and asked if I could also work Saturday. I had been sick all week so apologised and said I couldn't.

The next week I received no roster and was getting concerned. I sent her a message:

Hi, I just wanted to check whether there is a new roster or am I working on the week 1 and week 2 roster? Can you let me know when I'm working next just so I can be sure as I'm a bit confused. Thanks

So I’ve had blonde hair my whole childhood, and it turned a darker dirty blonde in my teen years, after that I started getting highlights to keep it a fairly light blonde. Now I’m almost 20, getting bored of my appearance, and thinking of maybe changing something that’s been the same for a very long time. I like the aesthetic look of dark brown hair on other girls, and I’ve been thinking about going brown, but I’m not sure if it would look as good on ME as I think it looks on some other girls. You feel me? My friends have told me it wouldn’t go well with my light complexion. I’ve also been told that I would look smarter, but also more mousy, and less attractive with darker hair. Can anyone give me their honest opinion? I’d prefer if you would be as honest as you can without being too mean! :)

Also - there’s no need to comment stuff like “if you wanna dye it brown then do it, don’t care about what anyone says.” Because honestly I’m not completely sure that I DO want to do this, otherwise I wouldn’t be asking for advice! There’s a solid chance that I might seriously regret it if I dyed my hair brown, or I might love it, I’m just not sure. I only really want to do it if I would be able to pull it off and look good. I’ve never had dark hair before in my life so I don’t know if it would look good on me. I realize that it’s all a matter of opinion, but I’d like to hear some more opinions beyond just me and a few of my friends!!

202,"I’m sure plenty of people have been through this... on both sides. I started working at my current job a little over a year ago. When I started I became pretty cool with a woman that no one else really gets along with. She is kind of negative and micromanaging, I understand why people don’t get along with her... but she’s also been through a fair amount of shit (no one is born an asshole, they are made). We also established early on that I’m not one to push around, I push back. She prays on those who are sensitive, Ive picked up on that and tell people to stick up for themselves and she’ll back off.

So that’s the shortened back story. Recently a new position opened up and we both applied, she didn’t get it and I did. She’s been in the field for about 20 more years than me, she’s worked at this specific place longer than I. I’m not one to acknowledge gossip but I’ve heard whispers from credible people that she’s bitter and is telling everyone she wasn’t chosen bc “I’ll (myself) be with the company longer since I’m younger” and she isn’t planning to be helpful towards me at all (my job is very team-work necessary kind of job)... as if to try and sabotage me... she is extremely normal to me to my face though...

I just have zero idea how to handle it... I’ve been having difficulty with confronting her (usually not an issue for me) bc she is very good at her job and I have a shitload of respect for her and I don’t want to jeopardize the relationship... she also is one of those people that doesn’t really acknowledge her flaws so I feel like the conversation won’t go anywhere so why risk it?

So I was a fucking idiot.

Over the past year or two I've made it least a couple of accounts on Chaturbate (an adult webcam modeling site); I would create and delete them after the shame set in... sent in the ID verification and everything.

I like the “positive” attention, even if it's from guys and my room would reach it least a 100 viewers most nights. Since I do this as a kink, I would send the tokens I received to a performer that I thought needed them. It's never been about making money, I just like that kind of attention because I never would get it irl. Girls are repulsed by my autistic personality and I don’t see myself getting into a relationship because of this. I also realize that getting a girlfriend most likely won’t solve this problem because the root of this issues runs far deeper. I think it’s considered exhibitionism. I really love seeing people type this because I would *never* get this kind of attention from anyone I meet in person.   

As much as I love doing this, I know this will fuck up my future. For example, I’ve seen videos of me recorded online titled things like “manly man cums like man” or “bear man cums angrily” and I’m absolutely mortified. I’ve submitted DMCA takedown requests for any video I find. How can I contact Chaturbate and ask for them to delete all my information like my scanned ID, name, pictures, videos, etc. If it's on the internet, it really out there forever. Should I just accept it?

I also want to stop this compulsion of going on that site. It’s gotten to the point where I’m considering chemical castration to bring my sex drive down. I feel like total shit afterwards and very guilty.  Society hates sex and I must hide this.",13Nov2018,1

We asked for a Leave of Absence, to play things safe but the meds pooped out and incapacitated me from attending class April 2018. 

&amp;#x200B;

The semester ended at around June 2018. Admin stated that my grades were ""too low"" (clearly I was unwell) and now I was withdrawn from the school. I even appealed for an academic probation prior to withdrawal so that I can amend things once I've healed. That was denied too.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I can't move to other universities because my grades are too low, and to add salt to injury, they would not release my report card because I had ""incomplete"" subjects. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm ruined. My chances of attending my dream universities is now close to nil. My grade average is around 60%, and I'm unable to re-apply as a freshman because schools don't allow freshman applications for students that have already studied in another university.  

&amp;#x200B;

Applying as a transferee is impossible because of my seemingly dismal academic performance.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I presented official documentations that prove the legitimacy of my psychiatric condition.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything that I've worked for academically, powering through the thick, heavy fog of undiagnosed depression and ADHD had been burned into ruins. 8 months in, and no universities want to accept me.

212,"Greetings, I want to ask for advice/suggestions on how can I bring more exposure to our story when we have tried numerous options to receive awareness to the abuse we experienced by former neighbors. Since 2013, me and my relatives have encountered rude, invasive, disrespectful neighbors who are affiliated with a gang. To this day, none of the people involved have been fined or arrested for their crimes against us. We have tried to to be known by:

* Contacting different news stations such as FOX 5 and CNN, but none of the stations called us back. I offered to share our Police Reports and content that those people shared online that is illegal, but no call back. Oddly in 2015 when my relative called FOX 5 after the house was shot, one of their vans drove by our house and did not stop by to speak to us.
* I share our stories through  many sites such as Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, Wordpress and posted videos and Police Incident Reports to show proof of our cases.
* Share videos of the damage on our house and the shell casings the Police did not collect when two Officers arrived during the 2015 shooting.
* Discuss how the local Police here did not help us and listen to our calls and complaints when these people threatened to shoot our house, which did happen.
* When I mentioned that many of our Police reports was missing information, and how a Detective began to blame my sibling for why our cases was not solved, which is not true.
* I tried to ask many people I thought care for me to share my Blog posts and videos, but 

The earliest incident that we remember that happened involving these people was when our ADT sign was stolen from our yard in 2013, and suddenly appeared across the street at the house the neighbors resided. Then, in July 2013 two of the children watched their friend ride a lawn mower across our yard and driveway, resulting that group being scolded and the teens throwing rocks at our house as retaliation. More of their true nature began to surface when we began to see large gatherings at the house, people posing with a gun in their hand and taking pictures, and moments where we asked the teenagers to please be careful when they played Basketball and sitting close to our mailbox and mailbox post.

Telling the children to not trespass angered them more, to where the neighbors tried to provoke a fight. One of my siblings tried to report the neighbors, and that resulted in our house being shot in November 2013. There is so much information to type, that I do not want to proceed and cause the reader to tire of me. 

The teenagers specifically began to ask their friends to harass us, shout death threats, loiter near or park in our driveway, to trespass and to provoke my siblings to fight them, and us calling the Police to report their behavior. These people shot our house again in May 2015, and has yet to be arrested despite giving information of the vehicle description and who was seen in the vehicle the day before the house was shot.  **What we doing wrong to where we have not successfully caught the attention of other people or the media?** I immensely want to know since me and my relatives want these individuals to be punished for their actions.",13Nov2018,1

I took this specific class out of interest, it will likely be cut off for any post-grad application I have

I am in a 100 level nutrition class and the class structure is very poor. Everyone is doing quite poorly. 

Instead of teaching the process of how digestion relates to nutrition, the class material simply makes us memorize terms we learned in class. No one seems to quite understand what is going on.

The class is basically built so you can regurgitate the terms you learned all semester on an exam, without really ever having to understand how digestion works with nutrition (which is what I wanted to know).

Ideally, we would apply the information from the text or the lectures to continuing projects to better understand the process, but we have never done anything like that really.

Is there a way to bring this to the faculty head without being rude?

216,"Ok. So I live in a house full of 6 people including myself. We’re all friends and all that. Well, one of my roommates asked if I would take off from work so I could watch her little sister while she worked. I was told that I had a place to sleep and that I would be fed in return which I was ok with that since I just turned 18 and I wasn’t asking for much. Fast forward a month and the little sister left. But I lost my ID the same day her little sister left. And I don’t have the money to get a new ID. But my roommates won’t help me out in anyway. At all. Ive been starving myself for days at a time because I don’t even have the money to feed myself atm. I don’t know any resources that will help me either. I also don’t have my ID so I don’t know how far I’ll get. I do speak up whenever my roommates do get something to eat. Or even anything at that. They tell me no and come up with a stupid excuse. But here’s the other twist, whenever I get something and they ask, I don’t EVER say no. And when I do get ANYTHING I don’t go without sharing. And I hardly get anything wether it be food, smokes, hair products, ETC. Ig it was the way I was raised. I grew up with a big heart because I never had much. And I know what it’s like to struggle.

220,"I will try to keep it short. Sorry if my English isn't that great.

So our new neighbors (about half a year) have a young husky. We live in a building complex in which we have a flat that also has a small garden and they live in the main house in a really really small flat. 

When they moved in they already had their dog, a really adorable young husky, and we all fell in love with him. Because they have such a small flat we told them that it would be totally fine if they let him in our garden from time to time to run around. As time went by they started putting him in our garden for really long periods of time (sometimes up to two hours). Now this dog does not like to be alone (totally understandable) and after some time he starts crying and barking and trying to dig his way through our fence. The problem is we can't just let him into our flat because he runs around like crazy trying to eat everything that comes in his way and we also have a cat that really isn't all that fond of him. I feel so so bad for him when he's out there on his own crying and not understanding. I sometimes go out to play with him but I also have a life and things I need to get done. 

We have told our neighbors once that they can't leave him with us for that long but after some time they started doing it again. I also don't want to deny them our garden all together because then he can't run around at all (except for their walks).

Im currently in my sophomore year of High school, and I am struggling to keep going. Throughout summer and throughout the first month of school I was stoned. I had to stop for my mom because she knew what I was doing, and couldn’t handle it. My father was a drug addict and he killed himself when I was four. Because of this, she has a very negative view on pot, even though he was addicted to heroin. My mom loses it if I hang out with my friends, who are high all of the time, even if I’m not doing anything. Because of this I stopped hanging out with my best friend. I dont really have other friends and have been really lonely sense I quit. Im very depressed which is one of the main reasons why I started smoking weed. Thats back now. My mom had me take Zoloft, an antidepressant, but it murdered my sex drive which im not okay with. It also gave me insomnia. Now I live in a house with a mom who constantly refers to me as an addict, even though I quit, and a little brother who I love to death. Im far behind in school and am having trouble getting my work done. I kinda dont want to exist anymore which is hard for me to admit.

222,"So I have been working a crazy work schedule for the past 2 weeks and have had no time for anything. (12hr graves every day for reference) On last Wednesday we left to go to a wedding out of town, which was my first time off since starting the crazy schedule, I stayed up during the day after getting off work to help get my sleep schedule back to normal so I wouldn't be a zombie for the wedding, and when my wife got home, she got pretty mad at me for the house being a mess. The mess of the house was probably 20% of my fault, the other 80% was from her. I offered to help her clean, which is what ended up happening, but initially she was really mad that I hadn't spent the day cleaning the house getting ready for this trip. The part that really mad me mad about this was there was a lot of mess from the weekend that she made while I was working and had plenty of time to clean up after herself. 

    I purchased a nicer present for my wife's birthday before this happened, nicer than I would have even normally gotten for her, as also a way of saying sorry about having to work the temporary crazy schedule, but after her getting really mad at me over this, I feel like returning it and getting her a present more in line with what she would be expecting for her birthday. Am I being petty for this?

i found this apartment i liked a lot and asked to sign the paperwork to make it official. the girl who would be leasing it to me asked me to wait a week because more people were coming to look at the apartment and she didn’t want to cancel on them. this confused me for a few reasons and i assumed that for whatever reason she didn’t want me to move in so i went with my second choice.

the girl i would be leasing from at the second apartment seems really sweet but i don’t really know her. she said she would split the relet fee so i sent her my half of the money over paypal a few days ago with the assumption that she would pay the fee the same day. i reached out to the apartment complex after not hearing anything and found out that she never paid it. i texted her about it today and she said that she was still filling out paperwork and was out of town and that the whole thing should be handled by the next week. i think it’s strange that this wasn’t communicated earlier but i realize that i could have asked? i dont want to think she would scam me because she seemed really sincere but you never know :(

meanwhile the first girl is now giving me the okay to sign her lease asap lol

so now i dont know who to sign with. i like the first place A Lot better but it was so off-putting to have the girl ask me to wait until other people could see the apartment. am i being paranoid? should i just wait for the end of the week or contact paypal to get my money back now lol? i dont want to make a wrong move and end up without a place to stay :(

241,"So, there's a guy I like (J), and he's recently started dating another friend of mine (we'll call her M). Well, I was at his house yesterday, and apparently we were really, really close to dating, J and I. He had liked both M and me for a while, and I was ""winning"" for the longest time (for lack of better words). Both of us were just a little too scared to act on it, and he knew M liked him so he asked her out after they spent a lot of time together and he started liking her more.

I don't know what to do, self hatred is through the roof because of this, especially since M had texted me at one point asking if I liked him to try and set us up and I said no, as I 1) naturally deny having any romantic like for anyone due to elementary school, and 2) hadn't known M for long, and at that point I wasn't even ready to admit it to my friend of 12 years, so no I wasn't going to confirm to a friend I've only known for 2 months at the time. She told him apparently, and that was the main reason he held back from making a move. 

I'm happy for M and J, I am, but it hurts. I had delt with the hurt and the ""what if"" when they told me they were together, but knowing how close I was... It hurts so much more. He said ""if the cards had been played any different, we would be dating. This is the only timeline where I'm dating M instead of you."" I had been thinking of possibly being in a poly relationship with both M and J if they would let me (as M and I are both bi, I was hoping it'd be like a triangle/triad), but talking with him about it brought back my feelings of just wanting to be with him and him alone. (Btw, I had mentioned that I was down to be with both of them, which he took as a sex way (which isn't completely wrong), and said that he and M had actually discussed it a bit after a nice Saturday we all spent together, and he said he was more than ok with it and that M probably would be, so there's that.)


J and M haven't been together long, and even J mentioned that possibly if their relationship didn't go well, there's a possibility we could date. I'm happy for them, and part of me wants to be with both M and J, but is it wrong that there's a little bit that wants their relationship to maybe not quite fail, but just not work out and they split on nice terms and I could date him? He said that he still found me sexually attractive, though the romantic attraction has lessened since he got together with M, but he hasn't said it's gone completely. I just don't know what to do. Both of them are my friends first and foremost, and I want to be in a relationship with both of them still, but talking about it with him  just makes me want him again. Knowing how damn close I was, not just having ""what ifs"" of whether or not if I had confessed then if we'd be together but knowing now for an absolute fact that we'd be together now... 

I just want to know what to do. Both on what to do with J and M, and just how to get over how close I was and that if I wasn't so damn scared. He was also scared of admitting his feelings, but still ended up with a cool girlfriend, leaving me to third wheel it, which makes it worse now, seeing what I could've had. I haven't quite let him know that I still have feelings for him, and also wonder if I should. Any and all advice would be much appreciated. ",13Nov2018,1

My parents are getting increasingly angry at me for not being able to drive when I'm 21and all my friends can. They shout and we get into arguments about this.

It got brought up at drinks that I had said to somebody I thought I could trust, that I didnt think the team were really my crew. She brought it up in front of everybody. Then it escalated, and me being paranoid when I drink tried to defend myself. Today I had a catch up with my temporary boss (my original boss is away) who is in the group of those I said that to at drinks. Its escalated alot. During my meeting he picked my work apart, then brought up what happened at drinks. He wasnt there but somebody has obviously told him. I told him everything is fine however since it's been brought to his attention hes now aware and so is my whole team. I've been in tears all day over the meeting. He said I'm distant from my team (introvert I am) however I do still support them as I'm meant to, but he says it isnt enough.. my original boss has always praised me and even put me on permanent so I know this wouldnt have happened if he was here, but I just feel like Friday has created a pack mentality and this was an opportunity panning from Fri to run me down as I've now reeeeeally excluded myself from the team. Not one person in my team acknowledged me today &amp; I really feel ganged up on as I know it's all still being talked about and escalated. I wish my original boss was here as none of this would have happened. I have 3 weeks to survive until my boss gets back &amp; things hopefully get back to normal. But man the regret &amp; anxiety of drinking that night &amp; starting what I have is killing me. I've had a shit day, been in tears most of it cuz I can't believe what has happened. I was on day 3 of no smoking so that's definitely added to my emotions &amp; being so sensitive with everything thats happened. I Just bought a pack &amp; a 6 pack of drink. I know I shouldn't have but i just feel so defeated. Life was going great until Friday. This was my dream job and if you cant get along with your team then what can you do. It's my own fault for opening my mouth but now I dont even know if I can continue with my job. I spoke to a PA of higher with my concerns about moving teams and she told me I couldnt, to suck it up until my boss got back then told me I need to change the way i wear my hair and dress to come across more ""professional"".

247,"Some background info: I am from germany and recently started my Masters Degree classes and we have some pretty cool professors who want us to read some very interesting stuff (like the english demagogues article on wikipedia for example).  
I feel like a lot of people would benefit if they would get the opportunity for this kind of education aswell but most are probably just too lazy. My friends and me included, we usually just browse reddit / Youtube and listen to podcasts and i think thats how most people in our age (20-30) are usually using their free time when they want to satisfy their thirst for knowledge/entertainment.   
I'm currently thinking that i would like to start some kind of medium (podcast/youtubechannel or something like that, but without any intention of making it my career) in which lazy people can get education on various topics, even though im just talking about stuff they could read in books / wikipedia articles / journals \[with sources better than dude trust me\]. 

*(So heres where i need advice:)*  
**1.** But i dont know if that's even something that people want? I wouldn't want to put work and effort just to find out that everybody hates it and consequently hates me. (because i feel like thats content leeching when i only talk about stuff from other people/foreign articles, but on the other hand i think most people would be interested in a lot of the thinks i found interesting when reading but are just too lazy to actually read it themselves). 

**2.** What kind of medium should i use? Twitch / Youtube / other?  How should i present the topics / get started anyways?

**3.** Should i ask my professors for advice? How can i ask without giving off the vibe that i am trying to crawl up their buttholes?

**4.** Is this even worth the effort? I've seen a lot of Teachers and Professors with their online lectures on Youtube or their podcasts and only a chosen few that actually made an impact. On the other hand i also think it benefits me if i prepare topics which are relevant for my education to present them to someone whos unfamiliar with them.",13Nov2018,1

So I work at a convenience store on 3rd shift, and while doing my coffee rounds a young girl with puffy eyes appears and asks to use the bathroom.
Not really unusual, but when she comes back she asks if she can 'Hang out' until 6am when she can catch a city bus to school. It was like 1am. 
Let's call her 'Casey.'

I really didn't know whar to do, it's sleeting out and I don't have a way to lock the store up so I can drop her off somewhere. I couldn't tell this kid to go walk in the cold sleet and dark. 

So I hung out with her for a bit, find out she's like 16 and lives a 15-20min drive across town. I gave her water and one of my box noodle lunches. Let her use my Hotspot. 
I asked my assistant manager what to do and all she said was 'She needs to leave.'

I guess I mother henned a little too hard, but Casey was grateful and super chatty, trying to help me do things around the store. I let her stay a bit but thought I would rather her be home if i were her parent. 

So I bought Casey an Uber. I couldn't really afford it and she was scared about getting in trouble for sneaking out.
'Would you ground me?' 'Yeah, because I was worried about you.'

Did I do the right thing? Idk if I'll have enough after this paycheck but I feel a little better. I'm still worried.

I used to be an affectionate, open kid. I believed in bffs and tried my best to make friends. I moved around as a kid and it took a toll when we finally stopped moving. My parents became very depressed. My dad would bury himself in work, my mom would lie in bed all day if she wasn't at work. I remember I would hug her or kiss her on the cheek and she would recoil and tell me to get off of her. Lots of yelling. School wasn't any better. The friends I cared about dropped me without warning a year into pur friendship. It was a small school and I was an outsider, so from grade 5ish to 8 there was rarely any familial warmth physically or emotionally and no close friendship in my life at that time and it left me emotionally stunted.

I've gotten a bit better in my early 20s, but I still have issues. I hold people at arm's length. I date emotionally unavailable people and disconnect during sex because I know they don't actually care.

254,"So 2 weeks ago, we had a new friend join our friend group. Let's just say that his name is N. I also had 3 other friends that I knew for a long time. Let's call them J, S, and M. I've known S for 4 years and I've even visited him where he lives twice. I've known M for 3 years and we're close-ish and we've never really fought. J is a girl who I really wondered if I liked or not. She is very toxic and hateful towards a lot of things, and is always clowning on me. She's been with our friend group for about a year. I would also like to note that this was all going on over the internet with my internet friends. N was really offensive with his language but he always said he was joking. J and myself would always be online over the night and talk in a Discord call, and we were surprised to know that N also stayed up so we let him join our call.  We looked past the offensiveness and we actually became good friends. We would always hang out at night while of our other friends were sleeping. We would always play games and watch movies until the sun raised up. Until, two days ago. That night, J was telling me how she was having problems with N being there. N was telling us how he usually goes from friend group to friend group and that's a reason why she didn't want him to be apart of our friend group. I explained that we should let him leave when he wants to leave and that him being offensive is because of his life and he really isn't offensive. She actually agreed with me and didn't really raise any concerns with me. Fast forward to last night. I was sleeping really early last night, and I wasn't there when my friend group kicked him from our private server. I woke up from a call from a very irritated J. J called me at 4 AM and I couldn't go back to sleep and I told her that she shouldn't be calling me that late and that I was trying to sleep. I couldn't go back to sleep, so I joined the call that had both S and J in it. I then read a DM from M that said,

""Hey OP""
""So I kicked N because J was talking about how he was gonna leave anyways and he likes to jump from friend group to friend group.""
""I love you so don't be mad please.""

I was very angry but I couldn't be mad at him because it was J's fault. Me being furious I joined the call and had a talk with them. I was told that it was a joint decision and that he was a toxic person and that he would go find another friend group eventually. I was very upset and I told them that I didn't want to kick him from our friend group and that it was rude because both S and M didn't even know him at all. They only talked to him on occasions that he would be on before 9 PM. I then found out that it was J who told them all the info and that she was the one who wanted to ban him. I was disgusted because to me this was very fake and petty for J to lie to me to my face and to ban someone. S and M don't even know N but they still banned him. What should I do from here.

Hello everyone,

I need advice regarding my father. Hes been an alcoholic for about 30 years, the last 2 years he increased his drinking and became very bitter, resentful and hateful. Last month he crashed his car and got in a fight with the neighbour. I suspect he even started driving drunk and drinking on the job. The problem is, nobody knows how to talk to him, because he is the type of alcoholic that would try and hide his drinking habit, when he drinks, he does so in the basement or the bathroom and tries to pretend he is not drunk. When confronted, he would denie that he is drunk or that he has a problem, I suspect not only infront of us, but infront of himself too. I dont see how he can denie that hes drunk, while he cant even walk, but he does....

How do we talk to him and what do we say? How can we make him acknowledge he has a problem in order to even start getting help?",13Nov2018,1

271,"Hey, yeah. The title is pretty self explanatory. The long run is, I’ve been experiencing the symptoms of PTSD. I have experienced PTSD before, but differently. The first time I was experiencing it was a few years ago. I would have very vivid flashbacks to when my moms boyfriend molested me. My bf (now ex) witnessed me toss and turn countless nights. It got so bad, he wasn’t allowed to touch me in certain areas in certain ways. This last year, I was able to put (most of) those demons to rest after I reported the incident, took it to court and won. Flash forward to now, and my PTSD is back, but now in a new fashion. I am tripping over things that happened and mistakes that I made during high school (I am 22 for reference). I find myself obsessing over old relationships from that time period as well as every little aspect that I’m disappointed in &amp; beat myself over it. It doesn’t help that I am very good at remembering things either. This is affects my life with my roommates because I’ve developed this horrible habit of starting to start shouting alone in my room when all the unstoppable reel of memories start playing in my head. I know they can hear me, too, which is super embarrassing. We hardly know each other and haven’t really had the chance to talk. The few times we did, it went well, but I can’t help to feel like she might think I’m a freak of some sort, but sometimes I feel like with all these mental health issues, I am one. I already know I should go to therapy, but it’s hard to do anything for myself. Not having a car also makes it extra hard to inspire myself to do the simple things, like feed myself, or go get a new pair of work shoes since mine are falling apart. Anybody got any wisdom to spit? 

TL;DR: I’m experiencing symptoms of PTSD, I have dealt with this before. I find myself vividly replaying my failures nonstop. My copping mechanism while this is occurring is to shout alone in my room. Roommates idk well have def heard me. I feel awkward and weird about it.",13Nov2018,1

275,"It all started about almost 10 years ago. To clarify a few things. I am Korean and lived by that time in Switzerland. This guy, we will call him Skyler adds me on Facebook. I didnt have many Asian friends so thought hey why not and accepted the request. We talk talked for a while but i realized very soon that he was just a delusional kpop fanatic so I ended our conversations. His delusion reached a point where he started telling other ppl that hes korean. Got a korean tattoo on his chest and put up a korean flag on his wall. I saw it on his social media platforms. For several months he tried to talk to me which i rejected. I dont exactly remember the order of events but the ones i remeber are: 
- he sent me a picture of his phone, pc, and ipod that have a picture of me as a background. Weirddd
- asked me a few times if i was at club opera or Zurich train station. I said no.
-all of a sudden texts me my dads name and our home address.  Creepy
-i find my selfies on his tumblr page. Eyeroll

I told him to stop contacting me. He always found another way to reach me. New fb account, new ig, tumblr, etc. By now he's even bothering my sisters and cousins. One time even my then boyfriend called him and said he should stop. He always respondet the same way ""ok sorry"" but then would start again in a few months or a year. So then when i thought he had understood, a few years pssed and he somehow reaches me on whatsapp and asks whether i can teach him english or smthn. Dont remember what it was. I said ""I told you to not contact me ever again. Next time ill go to the police"". He apologized the same way and in a week he texted again. So I went to the police. The officer said they cant make a lot since he hasnt approached me physically. In my opinion, if someone is so persistent, is delusional about his own identitiy, and feels no shame, it is possible that he might snap and actually do something coocoo. Right now, he cant bcs im no in switzerland rn but who knows. I havent thought about him for a long time but just a few weeks ago he fucking likes my ig pics and watches my insta stories although i had blocked him!!!! This is definitely a psycho game he's playing. Im not necessarily scared for my life. Its just fucking annoying. I srsly get so angry when he does it. Like hes playing mind games with me.
Any advice how i get rid of this annoying creep?",13Nov2018,1

284,"hello,

i'm 25, and been in university for 6 years now. in architecture department. i did the math, and i have 3 more years to go. reason for me not getting even a little bit close to graduating is that i have bipolar disorder, and had been struggling with panic attacks that wouldn't let me get out of my house. i'm fine now and getting better, thanks to my dear psychiatrist. in the process of getting better i survived a suicide and waste my 6 years doing nothing.

my family only knows a little portion of what i told above, and basicly think that i'm just lazy. they are expecting me graduated at the and of the next semester. i don't have the luxury to tell them that i'm quitting, we are in a very tough spot financially (living in turkey). i have a part time job, but it only helps me cover my own expenses. i'm their financial mesiah, arriving in like 6 or 7 months. 

i love painting, always have. my family is the reason i did not go to art school in the first place. they saw no future you see. i managed to apply to closest thing i could, architecture. which they did also not approved in the beginning (they wanted me to go to med school). now that i fucked up in university, i really don't know what to do. i don't want to apply to another school. especially an art school. i don't have the time and financial status. this is turkey you see. 

this is my story. at this point i don't really know what i'm asking to you guys. maybe i just needed to tell.

288,"So I’m currently a sophomore in Highschool and I really have had little to no dating experience. I understand that especially at my age they definitely aren’t that important but to be honest I’m kinda interested in why it’s such a big deal for everyone to have a significant other. So I’m interested in maybe dating someone (nobody in particular so far), not for the social aspect but more of just a deeper connection with someone.

Im not the most social because I generally don’t like getting involved with just meaningless bullshit drama, and since most people my age are quite immature and childish that’s very common. I’m also not the best looking, I’m fit but aesthetically not the best, I’d say maybe 6-7 out of 10. I generally just prefer to keep my distance and observe my surroundings since obviously I really don’t feel comfortable nor safe at my school just because it’s almost an alien environment to me.

But the thing is I really shouldn’t be trying to get in a relationship because I still have my personal passion which takes up almost as much if not more time than school does excluding weekends, and I don’t have a ton of time with it since I basically have 4 years to make it, and preferably I can get to the level before I graduate.

Im not exactly picky with who I date, generally as long as I can clearly see they take care of themselves I usually won’t mind. I don’t really care for things like big chest or big butts because it’s just not important at all. As long as they appear healthy and are semi attractive and have a good personality I’m good. Like I will notice a flaw with a persons being easier than a physical flaw. 

But the big issues are things like I’m not exactly the most inviting because with that it can come with some issues such as needing to deal with things I have no involvement in such as drama. I don’t smile often just cause i don’t feel comfortable with it, i always just have a resting face. My posture is good so that’s already dealt with but it’s just the fact I can easily be intimidating by nature, I probably am that way because of how quickly I can detect things like lies and fake people, so I’m always very slow to open up because I need to basically clear them as an OK they are safe. 

Overthinking things for me is almost natural, since I generally observe my surroundings I’ve learned patterns in human activity and can easily break someone down into what they are very quickly just because I’ve seen so many people like this.

Should I really waste time with a relationship or just let it come naturally? Should I try to work on becoming more inviting to people so others don’t believe I’m a complete nightmare of a human but actually of how kind I can be as a person with those I care for?",13Nov2018,1

293,"I'm a junior in high school and I think I may have a crush on TWO of my senior friends. We're all in the same academic club at school and we talk a lot whenever we're in meetings or when we have an out of school event. The problem is, I don't know who I like more because they both have equally good qualities. They're both really academically inclined and extremely intelligent, which I adore. They're both really funny and have good personality traits (that I know of).

But here's my predicament, I don't know who I like more...

They're both in all the academic clubs, they do sports, and they both have a really high GPA. (Can you spot my type? Lol.) But one is more physically attractive than the other (Guy #1), but I find myself draw more to Guy #2's personality more... I don't know if it's because I mostly talk to Guy #2 and I don't really talk to Guy #1 during our out of school events, and whenever I talk to both guys we talk quite a bit and sometimes we joke around too. (I am aware physical appearances shouldn't let you have a bias towards someone but I really don't see myself being romantically inclined with Guy #2 than Guy #1.)

Guy #1, you would consider him an ""alpha male""; he has exponential leadership skills, very athletic and intelligent.

Guy #2, he's like a ""beta/omega male""; he doesn't live up to Guy #1's potential but he's about there (If that makes sense?).

UGHh they're both amazing people who I enjoy company with but I feel like I'm tearing myself apart trying to decipher who I like more.

I know it goes deeper than me having a silly girl crush on them, like if they see me as more than a friend? I'm not the prettiest of peaches or the smartest, but I can imagine both of them as a potential boyfriend?

300,"I’ve had my dogs for 3 years each. One is a Pitt bull, the other is some kind of hairless mix. I love them. They weren’t mine originally, they belonged to my mom and step dad who got a divorce and then my mom decided she didn’t want them. 
At the time I was 10 months out from graduating and figured I’d just take the dogs with me. But it’s been like 3 months since graduation and I basically had a functional breakdown over the summer due to stress, depression, loss of identity, the works. And I have an unstable entry job and feel super duper scared and insecure about my future. 

So now I’m stuck at home still. I don’t know when I’ll be able to move. If I didn’t have the dogs, I could get out maybe more quickly. Maybe. I have 2 cats too, so moving with 4 animals is really hard and expensive. I don’t have the money. I also financed new floors for my moms house to the tune of $2500 (paid down to $1800). 
My mom let her homeless childhood friend live on our couch for 3 months, my younger sister is a sociopath, my mom was abusive my entire childhood. I don’t want to be with these people at all. My dogs eat trash almost every day because none of the people in my house will clean up their trash. Nobody works with the dogs and it’s impossible to do it on my own. 

I’m so beaten down now. I love these dogs and they’re great. But I want to move so bad and staying here sucks and hurts a lot. I don’t even get to lay with my dogs now that My moms homeless friend is here because she’s at home with the dogs all day every day and spending any time with them means hanging with her. I can’t even cook food in my own house anymore without this homeless bitch there.

301,"hello, i was wondering if there were many people here who were young (around 18 to 30) and were or know someone who's been diagnosed with bowel/colon cancer. i'd love to talk to someone about their experiences and symptoms prior to diagnosis, specifically.

i'm fairly worried because i'm 18, and i've been having trouble digesting food and passing proper stools since i was 15 (couple months before i turned 16). i know bowel cancer is an older person's disease, but i've also read that it isn't that uncommon for younger peeps to get it, although they've found that they usually discover/diagnose it in the later stages.

my symptoms in general are pretty run of the mill, nothing crazy - have had a major loss of appetite, i can barely eat a full meal anymore - despite this, my weight isn't dropping, it's sort of stagnated. i'm always constipated (except for when i get my period, in which case i get a little loose) and the abdominal pain that accompanies it is maddening. i always have to throw up cause obviously the food isn't leaving one way. on one occasion i did throw up feces i believe. there's stretches where i can go to the dunny, but the pain never stops. it hurts when i eat, when i *do* pass stools, sometimes when i breathe. i'm always exhausted, always tired, though i have been diagnosed with iron deficiency so that's that. a couple months ago i went through a bout where i couldn't breathe without either my back, right shoulder, or right hip hurting. deep breaths would always put me on verge of a blackout. there was a small lump to the side of my anus though i think that went after a while, and sometimes there'd be some blood on my toilet paper however none in my stools so far as i could see.

I was a loser, I didn't have anything special about me and I saw no value in myself. So throughout the years I set out to discover and improve myself while my friends were out at parties and having tons of girlfriends.
I was even asked out when I was 22 and so on by at least a dozen women, I rejected them all because I felt I wasn't still ready. I wasn't that person yet.

I've never touched a women let alone speak to one. As successful as my friends perceive I am, I'm really not. I fell like I missed out on many things.
Now I want to get into a relationship. But I want to hook up with plenty of women before I get into a monogamous relationship.
I'm scared. A 26 year old virgin, what the fuck. Why would women even date me after knowing that?
I've read plenty of places that women hate a guy who doesn't know what he's doing. I definitely wouldn't know what I'm doing.
I'm insecure about my junk. It's curved, uncut and looks weird.

For a little backstory I(31M) have been letting my ex and mother of my child live with me and use the spare bedroom for the past year until she could get her feet on the ground and financially stable enough to get her own place, she has recently decided that she is comfortable supporting herself and is moving out. There is this girl we will call her Lisa that works at the local gas station that I am extremely attracted to I let her know I was about 6 months ago and she informed me that she had a boyfriend so I dropped it and we have just been friends since talking about video games and everyday life stuff. Flash forward to this past Friday I am at the gas station getting my nightly dose of energy drink and Doritos crackers having a casual conversation with Lisa and i bring up that my ex is finally going to be moving out and how we are working on a custody agreement about our daughter. before I get home I have a couple messages from Lisa just continuing the conversation which is odd because we usually only really talk at the gas station we do message occasionally but I want to respect her situation so I don't message her first. later in the night she starts flirting with me and I tell her that I don't think its best if she is still in a relationship which she agrees and it goes back to talking about video games and TV shows. I don't hear from her most of Saturday there are a couple messages about how she has been neglecting Skyrim and how hard it is being the only responsible one in her house and I mention that I have my normal Saturday night raid and she just nonchalantly sends the blushing smile emoji and is like I didn't even fix my hair today and now your gonna see me like this(assuming I would come out for Monsters) Sunday she is messaging me all day asking me the normal I'm interested in you tell me more questions but at the same time nothing that I felt crossed the line of being a friend then Sunday evening she messages me telling me that she is staying at a friends house and her and her ex have broken up I try to tell her that i am there for her if she needs to talk about anything and she thanks me then immediately goes into flirting again, i stay strong at first telling her she needs to wait until she isn't so emotional but eventually i give in and start talking to her as if we are going to get together, we even make plans to try to go too dinner later in the week. I wake up Monday and we are continuing our conversation from the night before and I get a message from her EX?(at this point IDK if she actually broke up with him) telling me to back off so I switch to private convo for the end to end encryption and tell her about it and how i think he is on her facebook, she is shocked and then before i can reply another device gets added to the private conversation and then I get blocked. I called her at work(not my best choice) and apologized for any trouble I might have caused and asked her if she wanted me to back off and us go back to how it was or if she wanted to keep in contact with me and she said she didn't know what she wanted and i apologized again and told her of a few mutual friends that could give her my number if she wanted. I know she works tomorrow night and I am contemplating going and talking to her face to face on her break but I dont want to make the situation worse I don't know what I should do

TLDR: Really into this girl, she found out my living situation was going to be more conductive to building a relationship broke up with her BF and started pursuing me, Her SO(at this point IDK if she actually broke up with him) found out that she was talking to me flipped out and blocked me from her account now I dont know what to do to not lose the friendship",13Nov2018,1
309,"A few things you should know first:
I'm underage, but I will be 18 in a few months
I have about 2500 in cash ready
I have no other options left so don't try to persuade me
I have a plan on where to go. I have a specific city in mind but it's pretty far. I'm ready to travel for a long time
I will commit crimes if necessary. Fuck moral codes, maybe next time don't make me be born in such a shitty family and situation
I live in europe so crossing borders shouldn't be impossible, and that's what I plan to do
I have already run away twice but it was for less than 2 days both times
I am absolutely not gonna get involved with drugs or prostitution. Fuck that shit



What should I bring with me? 

What are things you think I should know before doing this?

What mindset should I have?

How should I defend myself and where could I sleep? I'm willing to buy a tent and just sleep in the woods to be honest. I love nature.

Of course I won't bring my phone. I'm planning on buying or stealing one and I would need cellular data, to navigate and get info about myself and also to keep in touch with the world even as I build myself a new one. How will I get a sim card with cellular data with no documents? Are there any ways? There is a lot of wifi around these days so this is not indispensable, just something I would like. 

Should I make it look like I'm dead (for example make a fake video of me being killed or just disappear with no traces) there will definitely be a missing persons report if I don't, and possibly pictures of me published on tv or on the internet which would make me recognizable.

Should I do it when noone is home? I could leave normally to go to school one morning and come back once everyone has gone out, prepare and leave. Or I could prepare and leave silently and sneakily during the night. This also kind of depends if I want to be classified as a runaway or someone who's been kidnapped/killed.

How do I defend myself best? I'm definitely gonna get a knife and pepper spray.

Should I hitchhike? I know it can be dangerous but I would definitely be careful. Or I could just go by bike. I'm already planning to steal one as soon as I run away because I need it to get out of town.

How will I get fake documents? I'm definitely gonna need some, someday. 



Really, don't bother to judge me or try to persuade me. I have no other options at this point and I have seriously weighed my chances, pros and cons before even thinking about making this post. Also don't try to be a creep and ask me to meet up if you have weird intentions. If you live in central europe and are planning to run away, if you demonstrate you have no weird intentions and that you are who you say you are, we could meet up. I definitely would like some company. Keep in mind I have a destination but I can't know 100% for sure that I will find what I seek there. I'm willing to share the money and help each other (for example sleep in turns).
Send me a private message and we can talk about it in more depth (I don't want to give information about me on the post)",13Nov2018,1
310,"Hi all,

Long story short, I’ve been watching my neighbors’ cats since 10/7/18. They traveled to California to harvest weed for money. They have been communicative in letting me know what was happening/when they were coming back for weeks. 

I received a text from them on Sunday night (11/11) at about 10PM letting me know that they were in TN (I live in GA) and they should be home by 1AM. 

1AM came and went and I never heard from them. I’ve tried calling (their phones are turned off/dead), texting, sending them messages on all social media, etc. I know they haven’t been technically missing for long, but knowing them, it’s really strange for them to be this non responsive for this long. 

I’m not sure if they got home, although their house has been dark so I’m assuming they haven’t. Their car is nowhere to be found (they drove). 

Is there any way to search Tennessee/GA mugshots/recent arrest records? I’m worried they were caught with a significant amount of weed and arrested. A small part of me is also worried that something even worse happened.... 

Advice on where to look? Google was ridiculously unhelpful. I need to find these people. This is not like them. I am really worried. 

Also! I know their tag number and both of their full names. Please help!!",13Nov2018,1
311,"So I've (23 m) been single for about 4 months, and it has been a very hard transition for me. We were together for 3 1/2 years and were engaged for a year of that time. We spend a lot of time together, like we were inseparable. She left me out of guilt that she cheated on me and wanted to be single once she did. 

It has been really hard on me the first two months i don't think i went a full hour without crying, I seriously thought about ending my life. I am better now and I know that she wasn't really the one if she was able to do the things that she did and I can now accept that. I don't think about her all the time either anymore. I'm actually really proud of myself because I went a full day this past weekend without thinking about her and I wasn't so busy that i didn't have time. I just didn't. 

I took some friends advice and picked up new hobbies. I'm going to the gym 4 days a week since and I've lost about 15 lbs and put on a fair amount of muscle. I'm also teaching myself the guitar. 

I am contemplating putting myself out there and dating again but i want to be sure i'm ready because I've been a rebound and it sucks and i don't want to do that to someone else. 

My issue is that I've become so accustomed to being part of a couple, I've reinvented myself and while i love doing what i'm doing I feel off. Obviously because i don't have someone at my side, but I don't want to find validation in someone else as i have done my whole life. I want to find it in myself. Don't get me wrong I love myself, I think i'm a pretty good person (even my ex told me as she left me that I am one of the best people she ever met) but I find life to be incredibly monotonous.

So i guess my question is how do i be happy being single until i do find a relationship and how do i find validation within myself an not in the love of another? ",13Nov2018,1

313,"4 years ago: 
I hang out a few times with ‘S’,  who at this point happens to be a coworker. After the third or fourth time, he asked me if I wanted to date. I told him “no, I think we’d be better off as friends.” So we became good friends.

Fast forward a year: I started dating ‘T’. S stops talking to me without explanation. At work, he acted like he hated me. In this time he became a supervisor at our work. Not my direct supervisor, but still. It was hell. He ignored me, was very short if I had to interact with him. 

Fast forward 2 years:
I’m still dating T. I reach out to S with the hopes of becoming friends again and to not make work so shitty. It starts out awkward but after a few weeks, we’re even closer than before and we consider each other best friends. He tells me that he had feelings for me and felt betrayed that I didn’t personally tell him that I started dating someone. He even told me that when I applied for a promotion, he told the hiring manager not to choose me. Luckily I still got promoted. We had a huge discussion where I very clearly tell him I don’t have feelings for him and he said that he is okay with it and that we can still be friends. I got over it and we were still best friends. T and I break up, and the day it happened S tells me that I can hang out at his place if I need a friend, so I do. We became even better friends. I love going to work. And I love this guy. 

Fast forward a year (which is about a month ago): I go on a date with kind of a coworker- not directly working for our company, but close enough. S blows up saying that I betrayed our friendship by lying because I didn’t tell him that I went on a date. S and I spoke every day since we reconciled but the date coincided with a three day weekend where S and I didn’t speak (he was on vacation and I didn’t want to bug him) but he said that it was my fault for not texting him. And that he found out about my date via twitter (which he doesn’t even have an active profile, or follow me, so he literally admitted to creeping my profile) and then he found out from a coworker about who my date was with. He also accused me of lying about what I’ve been up to because my Snapchat would show me at a random location and I wouldn’t mention what I was up to.....I blew up on him saying that It was unhealthy for us to be friends if he’s going to have these expectations from me. 

I have never led him on. We’ve never had a ~moment~ or a lingering look or sexual tension or anything. I love him (which I’ve never said to him) and he knew more about me than anyone else and I cried more about our friendship ending than when my relationship with T ended. 

Now we’re back to him hating me at work. In our long argument he said “I will do what I can to be as friendly as I can be to you.” But he’s not. He’s making work miserable because he acts like I don’t exist. He’s hurt, but he’s acting like I’m the one who hurt him. I had been honest with him from day 1. He unfriended me on fb and Snapchat. Before he did that He posted a song called “who’s going home with you tonight?” And the lyrics are basically our situation. He’s being SUCH an immature child and idk what to do. 

I told him that this end to our friendship wasn’t allowed to affect work but it totally is. What do I do? :( I’m so mad and frustrated that he has authority and talking to our managers would do nothing as they’re closer to him than to me.   ",13Nov2018,1

I only told my close friends that I was getting surgery but not what for and I have no trust issues telling them anything, but in my head I just don’t think they’ll wanna hear that my surgery was about circumcision and I don’t feel quite comfortable telling about it either.

317,"In preparing our gift giving list this year for Christmas, I'm looking for some advice on how to handle gift giving etiquette for my wife's family.  She has a sister with 3 adult boys.  The oldest 2 are married, and the youngest one is 18, out of school, and has a girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

The younger 2 (married and non-married one) are living with their parents still (my sister-in-law).  I know for sure the married one has a kid, but I'm not sure on the youngest one.

Some minor context as well: The nephews rarely or never talk to my wife anymore, nor have they sent us gifts or even thanked us for gifts in the past.

319,"In the Netherlands, people with a low enough income get a monthly allowance from the government to make renting a place less taxing. My roommate is the person on the contract, so he receives this allowance. However, our combined income is counted towards eligibility for this allowance. This combined income is too high. My roommate was aware of this and told me a year and a half ago. I asked him if it wouldn't be smart to cancel this allowance, before he has to pay any of it back to the government. I even offered to lend him money if he needed it. He turned that offer down and told me it'll all be fine.

Fast forward to half a year ago. He received a letter from the government telling him he has to pay back this allowance, because he had no right to receive it in the first place. He was saving up for a vacation we were going on together. I told him again that he should put a stop to this and that he could borrow money from me to cover the costs for the vacation. He turned that offer down again.

Fast forward to now. He has finally canceled the allowance and told me out of the blue he wants me to pay half of his debt. I told him I couldn't do that, because it wasn't my mistake, I even gave him advice and offered to lend him some money over this year and a half multiple times. He ignored all of that and kept on receiving this allowance. I told him that offer still stands, that he can borrow that money from me to pay off his debt and then pay me back when he can, as an arrangement between friends. He got mad, started shouting about how this was my responsibility as well, and he stormed off, smashing the door shut on his way out. He kept going on about how he had factored in this allowance into my rent so I also got the spoils of this allowance. 

I don't agree with him that this makes it my responsibility, because I never had any choice in this matter. He chose to keep this allowance, against better judgement and my advice. 

Is this point of view justified, or am I making a big mistake?",13Nov2018,1
320,"This happened yesterday night. We’ve been together for 4 years.

We went to a nice restaurant, we came back home, we started kissing and we had sex. An hour later I was about to propose to her. 

I put one our song and I started dancing with her. After a couple of minutes I took her hand, I was on my knees and I’ve said “Kate [let’s call her that way], would you...”, and she just run away. She opened the door and I’ve found her on the stairs. 

I told her “what’s going on?” and she said “nothing”. She was almost shaking. At that point it didn’t feel to me like a good moment to propose to her, so I’ve just said I was trying to be romantic and I wasn’t actually going to do anything (which is of course a lie, but I didn’t want to spoil the surprise).

I’ve then tried to calm her down and we went to bed. Now I don’t know what to do. Did I do the right thing yesterday? 

Maybe I shouldn’t propose to her like that. Maybe I should approach this thing differently and just have a normal conversation without any choreographic gesture. 

We didn’t explicitly talk about marriage yesterday, but for me it’s kind of obvious that she knew I was about to propose (what else could’ve been doing by being in my knees like that?).

Texts me constantly and is a little obsessive when I don’t answer (I have a job and a life, it’s not intentional - or it wasn’t initially anyway).

We've stayed in touch over the course of the year, sending funny texts back and forth, that kind of stuff.

Fast forward to about 2 and a half weeks ago.  My girlfriend of 5 years comes home and says she doesn't love me anymore, has been seeing someone else behind my back and wants me to move out in a month.

I was devastated.  I don't have any friends, so I called my cousin.  She was so supportive.  Said she was here to help, if needed and to call her if my girlfriend did anything else unexpected.  She kept on telling me that we are family and she always wants to know what's going on.

I had spent a good deal of my savings on my heart surgery and getting a place at the last minute wiped me out.  Luckily, I was able to get one, though.  I move in on the 20th.

Last week, my ex-gf brought someone home.  It was the last straw.  I left the house and went to my office and slept on the couch.  I proceeded to do it for a few days and then my boss told me I couldn't do it.  I had nowhere to go.  

I let my cousin know and told her I just needed to share what I was going through and that I would be going back home until my move-in date.

It's been hell.  I'm broke until this Friday, feel uncomfortable in my own house and heartbroken.

I couldn't deal with it all and was so hungry I was in pain, so on Sunday, I texted my cousin the following:

""Hey... Things are going to be super tough this week.  I get paid on friday, so I'll be set past that point, but if I need to... Can I ask you to order me a pizza or something to make it by until then? I feel so stupid for asking, but I'm screwed.""

331,"We’ve been friends for 14 years, and throughout that time, we’ve always weighed around the same. 

For our height, we were both a bit chubby at around 160 lbs. (that’s the average, but it did fluctuate) 

My friend was always very sensitive about her weight and often tried to “trip people up” on making comments about it (“are you saying i’m fat?” in moments they clearly weren’t) 

Over the years, we’ve both expressed to each other that we were unhappy with our weight and wanted to lose some. 

Fast forward to now. I started my fitness journey last year and lost 40 lbs. It really showed and I was proud of myself, but I became sickeningly obsessed with the scale and counting calories so I took a little break. One thing lead to another and with some added emotional stress, I gained back almost 20 lbs. While I am kind a little sad about it, I’m mostly proud of myself for stopping before I developed an eating disorder and valuing happiness over a number. 

It had been a little while since my friend and I had seen each other and the next time she came over, she was thin as a rail. It was an absolute shock—in a good way, I couldn’t stop expressing how proud of her I was for her lifestyle change. She lost it all by minor diet adjustments and going to the gym every day. It’s a lot of effort and I am so proud of her and I tell her this almost every day. 

But the problem is that it seems to be the only thing we talk about. Every conversation leads back to how differently people (mainly guys) treat her now and how her biggest goal is to keep shocking people by losing weight for their reactions. I’ve tried to explain to her that this is a very unhealthy goal and that she’s already so thin for her height. 

This is where it gets ugly. She has started insisting now that she is “fat” (sometimes even “disgustingly fat”) 

I totally understand that feeling. I felt that way about my body even after I had lost the weight which is when I started to realize I had a problem. 

But the fact that I am so much noticeably larger than her and she’s calling herself “gross and flabby” is seriously killing me. It depresses me so much. For years of our friendship she always compared herself to me and tried to say I was implying she was fat for far less (which I would never dream of, being a heavier girl myself...) 

But now she is blatantly saying she’s fat and gross and I can’t help but to wonder...if she thinks she’s fat at 120, I must be a landwhale to her at 140. 

I want to politely ask her if we can take a break from conversation about weight while I’m in such a dark place about it, but I feel like she might be offended that I’m being selfish and refusing to celebrate her progress just because I’m sad.

I’m too scared to talk to people face to face because I don’t want them to tko them on the spot. I’m pretty sure it’s caused by the mucus in my throat or my nasal passages but I’m not certain. Obviously, while still being in high school I can’t keep this up, so any suggestion would be very helpful.",13Nov2018,1
334,"A couple months ago, I broke up with my girlfriend due to her cheating on me with several guys and ever since then I feel like my life has just gone to shit. I haven’t been my usual cheerful self, any relationships i try to get into end quickly because the girl thinks I’m still held over by my ex, while it can cheer me up sometimes I’ve lost some interest in band, I’ve even lost interest in gaming which usually cheers me up or at least calms me


I try my best to cheer myself up by just drumming or listening to music or hanging with friends but it doesn’t work or it doesn’t work for long. And then it doesn’t help that my ex texted me a couple days ago basically saying how her life has been great ever since I broke up with her. 

So i ask, why can’t I be happy? Am I depressed? How can I be happy again?",13Nov2018,1

337,"Some back story: I apologize in advance for starting like this. The main reason I need to make the big move is for love. My long time girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years. We grew up 10 minutes for each other and met senior year of high school and have never had any major relationship problems until now. 

We both graduated college and both accepted positions right after we finished. I ended up working in the same state I grew up in. Mainly because everything thing I know and love is here in Georgia. I come from a family with a really tight bond. My grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, and best friends all lived within a 40 min radius of me since I was a child. So you could say I grew up with my morals being family comes first.

Okay back to the story: my girlfriend loves change and isn’t afraid to do things that scare her. She also grew up in the same location as me but maybe not with not as a tight knit family, but still just as important to her! She ends up taking a great job in Los Angeles. 

We have been in a healthy long distance relationship for a year and a few months. It’s been hard, but doable. I just don’t know how much longer we can both do it. I know she wants me to do something that scares me and that’s important to her. For some reason I can’t gather the courage to make the move. Some of the reasons being that I’m worried of how my family will react, worried about feeling alone if I move, and also just about quitting my job to find something else that I may not enjoy as much. 

I’ve been to LA numerous times now and it’s a city I really enjoy. It’s diverse, an overwhelming amount of great restaurants,  a short drive from the beach, and most importantly there remains my best friend and girlfriend. Even with that I cant gather the courage to just do it. 

So, Redditors of the world. What are some steps I should take? Or what would you do in my situation?",13Nov2018,1
338,"I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for the past 4 years. Over that time I have had 0 meaningful interactions with her parents. Although they seem like nice people they do their best to ignore my presence and don't really talk to me. I have never been invited to family events. I have tried my best to talk to them even have given them birthday gifts and have done favors for them before but nothing has worked. Her mom seems more recpetive of me but her dad doesn't look like he likes me at all. I think its because her family is first generation immigrants and they want her to date somebody in their culture. I have also heard from her sister that there parents are always talking about her other friends who have married people who are from their culture and who are doctors and lawyers and how happy they are. I have a degree in history and make about 50,000 a year. This would be good anywhere else but we live in a expensive area and I also have a lot of student loan payments because I went to private school like an idiot. My GF also makes a similar amount but has no student loan payments. We are trying to move in together but we are struggling financially.  Of course this all changed about a month ago.  I don't want to go on a tangent here so you can skip to the next paragraph if you want but the long story short is that my uncle passed away about this time last year and he has apparently left me a lot of money (3.2 million dollars). 

&amp;#x200B;

 Last month I was contacted by a lawyer who said he was responsible my uncles estate. I was suprised because I didn't think he had an estate. My uncle was a very weird guy who never seemed to have his stuff together. I was cool with him but I didn't really like him too much. He would just come to our house at random hours and was rude to us. He seemed to be struggle with addiction (mostly physiological addiction to cocaine and marijiana). His finances were a mess he started several small business that always went under (deli a barbershop and a carwash) . He was like a teenager trapped in an adults body and my mom and I were constantly chasing after him and cleaning up his mess. He wouldn't even talk to me like my uncle more like I was one of his bros from the 80s. Before he passed away he was basically homeless and sleeping at our house. However he spent his last few months constantly flying out to the Middle East (Turkey mostly). I know because I had to take him to the airport and pick him up. On one of his last trips to Turkey he got pneumonia and when he came back we  took him to the local hospital. Apparently he had some sort of undiagnosed heart condition and the pneumonia made it worse. He went from walking around with a slight cough to bed bound and finally dead in like 3 weeks. We have his death certificate and paid for his funeral expenses. After he died a lot of creditors called his old number but we just told them he was dead and refused to pay anything else. All we have from him is his car and a box of his clothes that he kept in the back. This is why I was very surprised when the lawyer called me about my uncles ""estate"". I told him that my uncle didn't have an estate. He said that he had and that he had actually quite a some of money. This same guy also called my cousins (my uncles 2 kids that he never talked to and was a shit father to) and told them pretty much the same thing. I thought it was a scam at first but I asked the lawyer where his offices were and what his name was. I googled it and I found a pretty legit law company in a very nice part of town with tons of reviews dating back years. I visited the law offices and it was like something you would see in movies. The lawyer explained to me that my uncle had left me 3.1 million dollars (it was actually more then that but there is taxes and fees and that is apparently all I can claim). He asked if I had a lawyer and I said no. He gave me a bunch of papers to sign and I read them in the office. It seemed like standard legal stuff and I couldn't find any part that made it seem like I would have to pay them for something. They also had a certified copy of my uncles death certificate( I know its real because I helped my mom get more copies. It even has his ""occupation"" as cook which we just put there because he owned a deli once).  They told me they couldn't give me all the money at once because there is some clause about me spending it like a moron but they did give me  some sort of check for $20,000. I cached the check and put it in a separate account which I have not touched for 20 days and they haven't contacted me since then. They have told the same thing for my cousins but for a much lesser amount about 1.2 million dollars. They are also not sure of what to do and are looking at me for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I told my GF that my uncle had left me a couple of million dollars and she thought I was joking at first.  I took her to the law offices with me on my second visit. She understood then the reality of the situation. She was very happy for the both of us. I told her not to tell anybody about the situation as I am not sure if its a scam or something. However I know somehow she must have told her parents. I got the money about 20 days ago and the last 5 times I have been there her parents attitude towards me has changed considerably.  They don't want to do a complete 180 but they are much nicer than before. Her dad even attempted to make small talk with me. I wear an Islanders jersey and he asked me about hockey despite the fact that I KNOW he doesn't give a shit about hockey or knows really much about it. To be honest with you its been quite disheartening how they have changed their attitudes towards me. I want them to like me but I am not sure how to proceed with any of this. Is the uncles estate thing some sort of scam? Should I go back and ask for another check? I want to say something to my GF's parents for doing a 180 but I am not even sure how to handle that. I haven't told my mom of the money yet and I am not sure what to do. I did not see her name in any of the legal papers that I was given. ",13Nov2018,1

My mom tells me she's been to the doctor to have a look at her hand and has gotten the diagnose Parkinson's. She starts getting minor tears in her eyes and tells me that this is just how it is, then she hands me a brochure and tells me to read it if I want more information.

This is right after and I'm writing this not knowing what to do to support her.

* What can I, as a 15-y/o do to support her?
* What should I not try to do to make her feel better?
* Have you people had any experience with this and what did you do and/or what do you wish you did?
* Any other advice would be greatly appreciated.

344,"Hi, firstly I’ll provide some background on the situation:

I’m currently a high school student enrolled in an AP art class in my school, and the first to be in this program. I have always been on good terms with the teacher and have had no complaints in the past. As a requirement for the course, I have to submit 3 sections for a portfolio complied throughout the year. Although I have always liked the teacher, and loved her style of hands off, exploration style teaching, this simply has not been working for an AP course.

The scenario:
For one of the sections I am to complete projects based on exploration on new ideas, which I although somewhat struggle with, am putting in hours of work after class to keep up and doing what I consider to be my best. For my recent several projects, I have been instructed to complete assignments in new mediums that I have never been taught or worked with before. The teacher has not helped me, showed any demonstrations, provided and resources and claims I must do all of this on my own. Upon spending hours upon hours of time researching and doing my absolute best with what resources I have, all projects have been graded as failing. When inquiring why, the only explanation I receive is that “my creativity isn’t strong enough”. In addition to this, I have not been provided any sort of rubric that outlines specifics of each project, but merely given a general guidelines sheet that applies to any project assigned. Although I have completed each project as best as I can, I am only receiving very general feedback. When stating that I think it’s unfair that I am given arbitrary guidelines and expected to know prior knowledge that I have clearly not been taught (since I’ve been in this teachers class for several semesters), the teacher states that it is completely my responsibility to find out how to do these things on my own and that is the only way for me to learn. Although I agree that my projects are not by any means great because of the fact that I have no experience in this field, I think that her argument that it is 100 percent my responsibility to self teach myself arbitrary concepts and then be graded on a non existent rubric is simply not fair. 

What I’ve done so far:
I have requested an explanation for the grades, and only received that the projects were not good enough due to a missing aspect of creativity (which is hard to portray when working on something completely new) and that I should be able to complete each project using my own research. I have also stated that the hours I put into each project at home is simply not worth the stress of completing my portfolio and having my gpa tanked based on made up expectations and pre requisites knowledge that has not been disclosed as necessary nor been taught or explained in previous courses or this one. I have stated that I am most likely going to drop the course next semester due to the fact that I simply cannot perform better without any help and it’s not worth ruining all my grades because I am expected to perform without help on random guidelines and I am really stressed. The teacher was upset with my decision to drop the course and said that she’s disappointed and has consulted other art teachers who also said my projects were not great as well as contacted my counselor saying she doesn’t care if I drop the course at this point.  Although I agree that this is probably stressful on her too and I absolutely do not want any hard feelings, I think that it is impossible with me to create suitable work without any type of help from the instructor or at least resources to teach myself.

I am at a complete loss for what to do and honestly need some help. I am considering trying to talk to the AP office at my school to try to find a way to reach some middle ground, as well as I feel very bad to have to put my teacher through this as well.

Please if anyone has any suggestions let me know, and if I am completely wrong please let me know too as I wish to improve myself as an artist while also not completely ruining my grades.

Thanks",13Nov2018,1

347,"Hi everybody, I could really use some help or another POV.

My name is Chris (19yrs), and this is about my brother Carl (17yrs).

Ever since my sister was born (she's 3 years younger than Carl), most of our parents' focus was on her. She was born with almost non-working kidneys, and so she got one from my grandmother (you can easily live with only one fully-functioning kidney). However, since the body's immune system will try to attack anything that is not a born part of the body, she recieves all kinds of medication, and often goes to the hospital to check up on the kidney. This means, that it really has been a task for my parents to make us a normal family, if you can say so. In my opinion they really have done a great job through the years. My sister is 12 now, and she's doing okay atm. 

While raising us boys, my parents always tried to treat us equally. Give us both equal amounts of love, and just in general giving us the same things. When we got old enough to bike, we got mathcing bikes for christmas, and later when we both wished for a new PC keyboard, we both got the exact same model. They did their best not to make us feel like they prefered the other. 

I always appreciated it, and I was certain Carl did too. You always hear that it is difficult being the middle child in a family, but we were always equal. 

But it all went a bit wrong, when my brother got onto an ""after-school"", as we call it in Denmark. After ground school (when you're around 15 years old), it is very normal to go to a kind of boarding school for a year, before continuing to HS. Often the schools focus on different sports, such as soccer, handball, swimming and so on... It is seen like a fun year, where you try to be away from your parents for a while (even though you often are home on the weekends) and maybe focus more on sports, and put school a bit in the background. Anyway, both my brother and I went to after-schools (though diferent ones), and we both had great years. The problem is, that on almost all after-schools in Denmark, snus is very wide-spread (you put a bag of tobacco under your lip, and you get a nicotine high, though fairly strong compared to smoking cigarettes), and both my brother and I tried using snus. I only did it to see how it felt (I had never smoked before), but when my brother was away, he got addicted. My parents are really against smoking and other addictive substances (so that includes snus), but they didn't find out while he was attending the school. However, after after-school you have three years in high school, and that's when my parents found out. 

When my brother started in HS he started doing more snus. My parents found it in his room, and they got very upset and worried. My brother also started seeing some new friends, that neither my parents or I really new who were. They kept finding snus in his room, but he always said he'd quit doing it. 

This all happened around 1-1,5 years ago. Until a few months back, I knew he was still doing snus, and that he had smoked some weed once in a while (it's illegal in Denmark, fyi), but as far as I knew, it was only on occasion. A few months back my mother, however, found multiple bags of weed around his room (she told me it wasn't a very thourough search), and she really started worrying. And tbh so have I lately... 

He has begun to seem more ""away"" in his mind. More lazy, more ""dull"", and he is doing worse in school. It is clear that he is smoking quite often, and my mom still finds weed in his room, but I am sure he also is trying worse stuff, and I think my mom thinks it too... Furthemore, he just got his driving license a couple months back, but since there's a null-tolerance regarding THC in your bloodstream when driving, my mom brought a few THC tests from the hospital (where she works), and she won't let him drive, untill the test is negative.

I feel like this is a shit situation. My parents are really worried, that he might be going down a  very bad path, and they don't know what to do, and neither do I. My mom asked me, if I felt like they have treated him any less good than me, but as you already read, we always were treated with the same amount of love and respect. My parents have talked to Carl multiple times regarding his ""abuse"" (don't know what else to call it), but he seems to be pushing them away more and more, especially my mother, and it is killing me to see how sad and desperate she feels. They are very afraid of losing him. 

I don't know what to do. I haven't talked to him directly about it, and I fear that he might also push me further away if I do...

I could really use some advice. 

\- Chris

348,"Alright so I say friend but he’s not like a friend friend. He’s a guy I knew in middle school and with whom I’ve kept in touch (we see each other every one or two years).

So about one hour ago he reached out to me and asked me if I wanted to help him with a project. Turns out he wants to write a book and, since he knows I like to write, he wants me to either edit him and help him write it  himself or write it on my own.

Now, I am currently collaborating with another friend, I write and he gives me the plot and characters, but that other guy is my best friend! And we have equal creative input.

I feel like I should make him pay but I’m not sure if that’s appropriate or not. To put this into perspective, it takes me about 5 hours to write twenty pages, I’m a pretty good writer in my language (not actually English) but I’ve not practiced it often as I usually write in English (the audience is bigger). The guy has a regular salary and is pretty well off.

I do have another job and I study so that would take a lot of time off of my schedule. If I edit him, I feel like this would be a lot of work too, because he hasn’t written anything since we were both 12.

So should I make him pay? How much money would be appropriate if I do so? I do feel like it would be kinda dickish to make him pay.",13Nov2018,1
349,"So, about a week ago I was watching a movie with about 8 other friends at the home of one of these friends. We were all sitting on the couch watching a horror movie in which one of the protagonists happened to be a black girl. 
My friend who I will call Amy had supposedly already seen the movie and was constantly giving little hints about what would happen. This whole time she was saying that the black girl would end up in the fridge, however the movie ended and none of that stuff happened. 
So she exclaimed ; “ wtf, that black monkey was supposed to end up in the fridge “.
Half of the couch didn’t hear what she said but the other half ( me and 3 other white friends ) did. 
I was shocked and I said “ why would you say that “ and my friend chimed in saying “ that’s really inappropriate “ 
However because half the couch hadn’t heard things became a little awkward when they asked what had happened. Nobody said anything. Amy left soon afterwards with really quick goodbyes. 

She came to me 2 days later ( by this time everyone present at the movies had heard about it ) and apologized. But it was a really bad apology. She for one said that it wasn’t meant towards me, that I wasn’t really black ( I’m biracial ) to which I responded with “ my dad is literally black and our white friends thought it was awful too”. Then she said she didn’t mean it like that which I didn’t believe because when the first thing that pops up in your mind in regards to a black person is “monkey “ I think that says something about you and your mindset. However she was apologetic enough that I was willing to forgive and forget even though I felt we hadn’t reached the core of the issue. 

I think another day later I told a good friend of mine about what had transpired and he was shocked but he made a funny joke regarding the whole situation so it had kinda escaped my mind. However he had told the joke to a friend and that friend then told about what happened to well.. uhm.. everyone pretty much. 

And then yesterday Amy came to me mad as hell, she was almost yelling at me. She asked me why I had told everyone about what happened to which I responded that I am allowed to tell my good friends what goes on in my life. 
She then asked me why I told my friend knowing he would tell others. I told her that wasn’t his intention and that even then I hadn’t explicitly mentioned he couldn’t tell anyone. 
She told me that everyone thought she was a big racist now. To which I responded that she should take this up with my friend’s friend and not me. 
She then said “ I made one little remark “ which made me really mad and I retorted saying “ yeah a really racist remark “ to which she responded with I don’t care. 
So I asked her why she apologized to me if she didn’t care and why she was  talking to me if she didn’t care. To which she responded that it was all my fault. 
I told her not to be racist next time and walked away. 
But here is the thing. Now some of my friends ( who have been hanging out more with her than me ) are excluding me because she is mad at me. They have been doing this for a while because she doesn’t like me in the first place and instead pretends she is my friend. But now it’s getting worse. I’ve known these people for years and I feel like this awful person is ruining my life. Luckily a bunch of my friends ( including the one that told the joke and the tattletale
also agree with me ( and their view of her has changed since this whole fiasco ) but still it hurts knowing that these close friends are moving away from me. Did I handle this situation all wrong ? 
So what I’m asking advice for is : 
1. Should I make up with Amy ? Should I even approach her at all ( she’s my project partner for 2 classes btw ) 
2. What do I do with the situation between me and my other friends 
3. Did I take this out of proportion?

I turned 16 a few weeks ago and I had a sort of ""Mid-Life crisis"" happen to me. Some info about me.

1. I have about 0 friends (No joke home schooled)
2. I play a-lot of video games (Probably poured in 500 bucks into steam) (Not even counting the PC i spent for 1400$)
3. I have no real activity other then church to do (I'm interested in boy scouts but i'm already hard pressed to go because I wouldn't even make it to eagle scout in time)
4. This is gonna sound corny but I'm pretty lonely and have just now gotten the ability to date (Christian so I don't wanna go to crazy)
5. I feel like I can't even learn properly (I can't do math in my head and my hand-writing level is on par with a 4 year old's painting)
6. Although the things I do specialize in are kind of toxic for my life (I'm a massive military history nut and firearms nut which annoys my family to no end because that's the only thing on my mind)
7. I have no real male role model to look up to or even to shoot the you know with.
8. I'm confined to my household on my own accord because I simply lack the will to go out and do stuff around town even though I am extroverted when I was in public school.
9. I'm Unhealthy and am seeking an exercise routine and a diet.
10. I just want to live out my few remaining teenage years to max performance (Even if I don't make any memories I just want to have the ability to learn better solely for the fact that I want to and I see my future as being so much more)

I'm also trying to quit my video games. I've already managed to delete 200 GB's of games off my system. I'm planning on keeping all my Rom's and ISO's for now until I can find a reliable backup for them. (Unless I should go completely around and just delete everything)

My mom is the only one to graduate in my family so far. And I really hope I can too.

If any of you can suggest things to improve my life i'll do it. even if its stepping out of my comfort zone to do so. I just want to turn it around for my own sake.

So I'm sick on Friday. Can't get out of bed, throwing up sick. My mom calls me in, it's an excused absence, etc. etc. All good.
I show up on Monday, with my finished notes, and ask if I could take a look at the presentation to get the notes, make sure I have everything I need. ""My policy is if the student isn't there on Friday, they don't get the notes."" I explained I was sick on Friday. It was an excused absence. He shrugs and brushes me off.
This class is really hard for me (I have ADHD), and those note answers are one of the things helping me pass tests. All the other students got them, it's not as if I skipped class, so why don't I? I think I'm being oversensitive, but I wanna ask him again or mention it to my counselor (who, for the record, hates me and my mom because I needed to be taken out of a class last year).
I'm just not sure what to do. I know this is a trivial first world problem, but for someone with chronic anxiety, I am, for lack of a better word, freaking the fuck out.

She definitely likes me as a person and seems like she could be into me but I’m just not sure. But I’ve decided I want to ask her out either way bc I always do this. I always overthink this kind of thing and end up leaving it alone and never act on it. The only problem is I only see her twice a week in the 8 AM class. But I do have her Snapchat. Would it be totally lame to “get my feelings off my chest” over a message? Or seeing as I never really have a chance to do so in person is this ok? Also I’m very shy so doing so over the phone (for me at least) would be ideal.

359,"So, next year is my last year (hopefully), and then I'll graduate and get to move in with my friends. I pretty much have living plans for after graduation, but I don't know what to do about this year in between. I fucked myself pretty bad. I went to a school that none of my friends went to and committed really late. I go to a huge university that doesn't require freshmen to live on campus because they let too many people in anyway. So, when I committed, all of the on-campus housing was full, and I was forced to get an apartment. I got a student apartment with 3 random roommates, and it was fine. We don't have anything in common, but we got along. Due to my nature, I don't really like student organizations and can't really afford to pay for them either, so I didn't really make friends my first year, but I hung out with my roommates, so it was fine. Three of us decided to sign to live with each other for my second year with another one of my roommate's friends. For whatever reason, in my second year, I've been really antisocial and stay in my room pretty much all of the time. I got comfortable with my roommates I guess, so I didn't feel a need to hang out with them just to force friendly, meaningless conversations- like I said, I don't really have anything in common with them. Well, now two of my roommates are living with their sorority friends next year, and the other one is only going to be here for a semester and will probably sublease with one of her friends. I really really don't want to have to start over with random roommates, but I can't really afford to get an apartment alone, and my parents would question me about it because I had so many friends in high school and hated being alone, so I don't really want to deal with that. I smoke a lot and stuff and I got pretty lucky having roommates that don't care if I smoke or do questionable shit in our place. I really don't want to have to deal with having roommates who wouldn't be okay with me smoking in my room or who would expect me to be social- I'm not trying to be rude, I just really really don't want to. It's my last year- I really just want no pressure and a really chill situation before I get to graduate and move on with the rest of my life. It's my last year; I don't really care about making friends at this point, and, besides that, I've only ever really been friends with guys and most college girls and I just don't really click (thats relevant bc random roommates mean living w other girls).

364,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am 28 years old, and I got early this year diagnosed an extremely rare autoimmune chronic disease. There's no cure. First I was told I had left 5 to 10 years, but fortunately, there's a treatment that stops it and I can live a normal life. Anyway, I still need to take care of myself. I can function normally, but I get tired easily, need to go to the doctor every few weeks, and get my treatment in the same hospital every 2 weeks (intravenous). I should avoid stress and physical work. I can only travel if it fits in my 2 week hospital schedule, and to basically online around Europe. (not very long distances at least for now, to developed countries where I could have access to a hospital in case I get ill, and countries without diseases). This is a big handicap for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I currently work as a mechanical engineer in a big company,  and since I was diagnosed I started having trouble at work. I could keep my job, but there's no way I can get out of the junior position. I was told off even for asking for stuff that was written in my contract I had access to (I should be thankful that I still work there they said). So, being discriminated in my company for being ill, I want to change jobs to whatever I can live my life in peace.

I don't mind to keep on studying something new, but I need a flexible job that doesn't kill me long term. Currently I work 7:00-15:00 and waking up at 5:40 is killing me although I sleep at least 7h30. I work full time 8h a day, but I think I couldn't take any job that requires overtime everyday (sadly most people I know work over hours every day) 

I have considered to refresh my programming skills and re-learn how to code and look for a job as a programmer or focusing into stress analysis or even changing to electronics or robotics. I have even thought about becoming a teacher, since I like helping others and teaching but I'm quite lost at the moment .  

Also, my girlfriend and I are thinking about moving back to her country if I can get my treatment there, since the job market is much better over there.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Today  i was supposed to work with him, he told me to meet him at 8 am. at  7:40 i was heating up my car and it was taking a long time to remove the  frost, so i called him up and asked if he would pick me up (we drive  around in his truck when we work anyway)  


He got annoyed and said yes its on the way anyway, then never showed up. Wont answer my calls.  


I guess im wondering if i should just give up trying to be apart of this business with my dad.  


Im going to give a bit more context below  


So my entire family told me someone else was my dad my whole life, (fake dad walked out on us when i was 6 or 7)   


my sister and cousin had the same dad.  


I found at 24 he was my dad too, and that my cousin is actually my half sister.  


I  decided if he wanted me to know i would have and didnt think much about  it, maybe 4-5 months ago i found out he was trying to contact me.  


So  i met him a few months ago, and then found out my full sister said some  bad stuff about him from the past, i asked him about it and he freaked  out.  


He said i had to choose between him and her, same with my cousin (half sister)  


My cousin(or half sister w/e) cussed him out on the phone then he messaged me saying he was out of our lives.  


Started talking to him again a couple weeks ago, and more recently was working on the website and stuff.

368,"Long story short: While I was dating her, my GF was friends with an Ex-FWB, who would hang out and even crash at her place from time to time. He routinely flirted and made inappropriate comments towards her, but that she never responded to. We have been dating for 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I have doubts that they actually had an affair because I never saw her speak romantically or sexually towards him when I looked through her phone. After I told her I snooped through her messages, she still kept her phone open around me and left it alone with me. She never changed her pass code on it, even when I asked her to so I could stop myself from snooping. 

&amp;#x200B;

Still, she invited him over a few times where he would stay the night. She never told me about the nights he stayed over, only that he would stay late. This part makes me extremely suspicious. 

&amp;#x200B;

After our first year together, I had enough, and told her that I was considering leaving the relationship due to her friendship with him. She cut him out of her life immediately, blocking his number and all his social media accounts. She reached out to her once, and she told me about it and showed me the messages. I have asked her several times if she cheated on me, but she said she did not, but she admitted that she let him stay the night several times in her bed after he drank a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has been a full year since we last heard from him. Our relationship has been great, but the questions and doubts I have still cling. My trust in her is severely damaged, and I fear that I will never know the answers to my question: did she physically cheat on me?

369,"I work in a warehouse, I was hired under the guise that my immediate supervisor is the manager and not my brother because of our relation.

My brother had to talk to a coworker of ours because he took an extended break (like he always did before my brother started working there, or say he says) and this coworker obviously doesn't like having a boss who is half his age.

The issue is this coworker also is the weekend shift ""not supervisor"" but he directs things to make sure its going smooth, and I work Saturdays. For the last few weeks he keeps making comments about me being too slow saying ""I have gotten complaints about your work speed"", which is not only not his responsibility to tell me, but is obviously false and just him trying to mess with me.

This guy has been working here for years, ignores safety rules (like not using his horn on the forklift/power jack around corners). And has driven away new hires because of his attitude. The reason he hasn't been reprimanded is because the manager is visibly scared of him (he fidgits and acts super uncomfortable when he has to talk to him only, and not anyone else.)

I spoke to my manager about the being singled out because of my relation to the supervisor and he told me to ""hold out because we are getting a new system to track work performance in a month"", jumping over the issue at hand, so I tell him ""The problem is me being targetted because of him and my brother having a disagreement, not my work"", and he repeats himself. I ask to be taken off weekends and he says no. 

Later on I tell my brother my issue and he says he is going to talk to the manager about it, the manager then repeats himself and my brother says ""Look he is dealing with harassment and something has to be done, I would rather not have to take this up with the General Manager (about the manager) or HR but if you won't help then I have no other choice.""

370,"It’s not that I fear having children, I truly do want them, it is that I fear having the man that comes attached to them.

Today’s generation of men are very immature, I’m 25, never had a boyfriend, every time one would stand me up, disregard me or otherwise use me I would stand up for myself which meant being alone because they abandoned me.

My father was no better, his little game of popping up whenever convenient for him, treating girlfriends like queens while I was ignored did something to my mental state.

I honestly want a sperm donor for my kids. They say you can’t compare one relationship to another, but in this day and age you actually can. Male self absorption is real and I’m not waiting til 38 to have kids when they grow up.

Currently I’m preparing myself for having kids in the next 5 years. I work two jobs, have my bachelors, kids love me (get regular calls from friends kids who wish I could stay forever)

I’m not looking for a boyfriend, but I do have a friend who is just that, we don’t talk everyday, go out, or do things couples do. He helps me by honestly telling me how men think and behave and the fact that men do things just to see what they can get away with conflicts with my personality.

I’m nice, people say so regularly, nice ones are ignored. I want to stay nice and sweet and kind, getting fucked over is what will make me colder then I already am. I have no hope that I’ll ever be in love or someone will actually want a family with me, they want what looks good, what doesn’t cook, clean, pay bills or actually try to build something with you.

I am a university student and last year i failed my year because of deep depressive episode resulting in me almost not exiting my room for 2 months.

This year i am repeating and decided i will do everything correctly. I started cooking for myself and trying to eat less junk, joined a sports society and give all i have to perform well for the team, have not missed a single lecture and fixed my sleep schedule so I get 7-8hours of sleep. I am proud of the progress I've made even though i haven't reached that point where all of this comes naturally.

However, i have been also absolutely failing at being responsible. It all started with taking up a part time job at uni before the start of term. It went well but when iit got time to get my pay, i took too late to send the email with the correct hours. Basically a task for 5 min but i always had the excuse ""i have too much uni work to do, i am too tired, i cant do it now"". At last i sent it too late and didn't get the 200 o was supposed to due to my stupidity.

The issue now is that during this time i also applied for a part time job as a brand ambassador on campus to promote some internships. Basically 20hours of work in total where we have to hit sertain targets of sign ups and clicks on some links. However for a month i didn't do anything as i was concentrating on going to uni, sleeping on time and exercising. Again, i could have done half an hours every two days of posting on Facebook but i didn't. Some of it was due fear of annoying my friends or just drawing attention.
So the padt two weeks i had my ""manager"" tagging me and calling me to ask why i am doing nothing but i don't know what to do. I can't make people sign up or click links if they don't want to. Last night i did an all nighter to write long posts and emails with the intention to ask our careers advisor to send out these emails to our faculty and let people know about the internships. Well today i got a response from her that my email has deeply upset her and it's not her job to send emails on my regards so i get paid. I didn't intend to sound bad over email, i just wanted to get the reach to all the students in our faculty. So now, here i am, over half the promotion period is gone, I just posted on FB last night that i am a brand ambassador and all my friends reacted to this, i have no people signed or clicked any links yet, done no work at all, unintentionally insulted the person who is supposed to help me find a career and give me advise on the process, taken up a job i cant and dont know how to do, let everyone know that i am doing it and just want to quit. I am literally crying because of guilt, shame and anger at myself for being so irresponsible. How am i to hit those targets? How im i to quit the job and not make a bigger fool of myself? How do i fix this burnt bridge with the careers advisor? How do i repair this disaster on my CV? I am sure with no doubt this will look awful on my CV when i start looking for an engineering job. 

Please, i need advice. Is there  something i can do? Should i quit? Should i try to hit those targets even though I don't know what i am doing? How do i get this to not ruin my CV?  I did apologize to the advisor and she just sent me an email she will be happy to send two emails i write but i feel so deeply ashamed. I hate myself for never doing things i have taken responsibility for on time. I am even more afraid tgat this will result in me being a totally unable person once i start a real career. i really apologize for the wall of text but i have no idea what is the beat thing to do.

The problem was that what he told me seems very different than what it is....as the time goes on...the way he told me sound like it was a startup and he is trying to problems for the yacht management. But it turns out to be a huge global company doing completely different business like oil and shipping.  He never told me this...I had to find out myself ... he never really told me what business he is doing until I asked.

Additionally I am working in a self-employment contract which I had not even signed the contract yet..the first one gave me was a draft and it was written in 2012 for a different person. After few days he gave me another one but it was written in American law, which I don't even work at US.  Currently, I am still waiting for the new contract. What's more, now he tells me, just yesterday I should be doing  IT roles... like maintain website service and fixing there ""loading problem"" for there website...which is completely different than what I do...I don't have any experience or knowledge in that regard...

My guts tells me, this job is not right for me...to be honest, I am not even sure what I can help or offer them.  Is just to different than what I have been doing so far, and I just feel my boss doesn't trust me at all. He is never in the office and never stays in one place.

379,"So funny story...

Last year, I went on a shared family camping trip with my parents, my brother, my godmother, her husband and their daughter. I’ve been close friends with the latter since I was born as we are the same age. I have gone through phases of fancying her but I can’t seem to firmly decide whether I see her as a really cool “godsister” or a potential romantic partner. I still get butterflies when I lay eyes on her after a long stretch of not seeing her.

Anyway, we built a little makeshift toilet between our tents that we could use if we needed to go during the night. The second night, I was desperate to go so I did. I started pissing in the dark when all of a sudden a light was shining on me from the side and I turned around to find my godmother’s daughter standing there half naked. She was wearing a t-shirt but her lower half was completely exposed to me. She probably sleeps in the buff and thought there was no point in putting on panties just to go outside and pull them down to pee. After a moment of awkward silence she went “Oh shit! Sorry!” She then turned away while I finished up and I quickly rushed back to my tent embarrassed.

The following morning the two of us had an awkward conversation about what happened. I apologised to her for what she saw but she was like “You’ve got nothing to apologise for, dude! You’re hung like a horse!” She then apologised for walking in on me like that and I just responded with “Well, I guess we’re kind of even.” She looked at me all confused and asked “What do you mean?” Turns out she was so flustered by seeing me with my junk out that she forgot she had hers out too.

The funny thing is that we used to see each other naked all the time when we were really young. Because my mum and her mum are close friends, one would babysit for the other so we would share baths and stuff. Because of that it was kind of weird and surreal seeing her all grown up “down there”. I’d imagine she must have felt a similar way when she saw me as well.

We used to think of each other as boyfriend and girlfriend when we were like 4 or 5 because it made us feel all grown up. After that, we kind of grew out of it because we went to different schools. She recently broke up with her boyfriend, who was kind of a dick to her. The guy really liked manhandling her which really pissed me off. I’m glad she dumped him. She can do way better than him.

We see each other now and then when our families meet up so we’re still quite close in a way and we share a sense of humour. I go back and forth on how I see her. Part of me sees her as a super cool cousin or sister. The other part finds her really attractive as she is definitely my type. I’m really into chill, laid back girls you can have a laugh with and who aren’t high maintenance. She has also grown into a very naturally beautiful young woman, with little make up and minimal grooming.

My father doesn’t leave his bed all day and the last time he showered was three months ago, he belittles her on a regular basis. My sister who lives at home is mentally and physically disabled with impulsive anger issues. My little brother also doesn’t do anything to help. I try everyday to help her, I have to listen to her problems but she doesn’t change a thing to make it better. But somehow it’s all my fault and she always tells me I need to get help every time I try to talk to her about all of this. I know that she’s not right, I know that she’s the one needing help, but all of this makes me so afraid of getting really sick again. I don’t know what kind of advice I want, I don’t know if there’s any advice for this. I just need to hear that I’m not fucking crazy, I’m starting to doubt myself. Sorry if this is confusing, I’m not a native speaker and I’m very confused myself at the moment. ",13Nov2018,1
384,"I’m throwing a birthday party for my daughter this weekend. This is her first real party. I’ve never put one on before and I’m pretty nervous. 

Anyway, I’ve been hand making all of the party decorations and party favors. I’ve been slowly working on this for awhile now. 

We sent out her invitations and expect 9 kids to show up. There’s still about 6 from her class whose parents never texted to say they will or will not be coming (including one of her *favorite* friends who I kind of thought would be at least a for sure response of either yes or no since I’ve talked to her parents before). Anyway, I’ve made 10 sets of every party favor and treat item, so just one extra and that was more so because I did a practice run everything first then kept the practice as an extra “just in case.”

Now that the party is almost here, I have people telling me I should have made more extras in case more kids show up because not everyone RSVPs. Is this really a thing? I don’t want any kids to be left out because their parents didn’t respond, but I’ve already spent a lot more time and money on this party than I intended to. ",13Nov2018,1

388,"So long story short. I was offered a job at a company that doesn't have great benefits and doesn't have great pay. I do believe in time I could move up within the ranks easily or at least learn somethings and move into another company. 

It took about 8 weeks from my offer to my start at company A. I had also interviewed for other companies during the period prior to the 8 weeks. Company b I really liked me and said I was their chosen candidate but they needed to wait on approval from their parent company. This approval took the entire 8 weeks I was waiting prior to starting company a.  My gut knew this would happen but I needed a job and I couldn't risk not having one plus I knew there was always the possibility that company b would never get approval to hire.  Company b is one of those dream companies that actually care about their employees. It's very similar to the start up mentality. 

I've accepted company B's offer but I am unsure on how to leave company A because I had only started the position last week... I imagine I will be black listed from company A which is understandable. 

I need some advice on how I should leave company A.  The two weeks notice period has passed already, but not by much. If I were to just leave company A and just say this is my last day or say an emergency came up and I will need to move, will they still have to give me my paycheck?

Hello,

My partner and I have been together for a few years now, we’re both in our mid 20’s, married for almost 12 months and have an almost 2 year old child.

I love my partner, with all my heart, and I would never do anything intentional to hurt them, in any way shape or form. However, my partner has succumbed to a life-long condition that causes severe nerve pain, there is no cure, there is only temporary surgical remedies that may or may not help. This has effectively ground our love life into non-existence…. neither my partner, nor myself have high sex drives, but the complete lack of physical intimacy is almost painful after a while. The toll it takes on my partner is so severe they take weeks off work to rest, they can’t study due to pain, they struggle to parent through the fatigue… I love my partner with all my heart, they give my life meaning in every conceivable way except physical. When I said my vows, I meant it when I said “through sickness and health” and I have 0 (ZERO) intention to leave or do anything that may hurt my partner, but I feel like I’m missing something…. what the hell should I do?",13Nov2018,1
399,"Throwaway acc because he looks at my real one. 

So, I’ve been getting increasingly worried about my younger brother’s behaviour.

He’s only 12 at the moment, which is something I used to suspect might be a cause of this behaviour- puberty and stuff,,
However it’s recently been getting worse.
He’s been getting more and more irritable and aggressive, and he gets into arguments frequently with my stepdad (and occasionally my mum, but mostly my stepdad) and has started to say some really shocking things during them - it’s getting more and more common for him to threaten to kill my stepdad. Shocking, right? It really worries me. 
Today he made a joke that ‘we should kill dad and take the computer’ and when my dad left he said to make sure ‘I don’t kill her’ (referring to me) wtf??????? He framed them both as jokes but they really worried me. I don’t think normal 12 year olds joke like that.
He lies a lot a lot, usually about really random things, ie saying something happened that didn’t, making up lies as excuses for things that would be fine if he told the truth, stuff like that. 
He also makes a lot of self deprecating jokes... not something I’d usually be worried about, but they’ve become more and more common too. Mostly about not having friends. 

Sorry for the rambling, I’m just really worried for both my/my family’s wellbeing and his. I didn’t really know how to put my thoughts down, eheh...

Just noting - I’m a pretty worry-prone person, so I might be overreacting. 
I have no idea what normal 12 year are boys are like either... this could all be normal (but I doubt it.) ???

Please help. Thank you.

407,"This is my first time on this subreddit, I am still fairly new to reddit in general, and I am not sure if I am in the right place. I am feeling frustrated and in need of some advice about a Professor from my University and the right steps I should take or if I dug this hole for myself and she is correct in her response to my actions. Thank you for those who have taken the time to read my situation, I have put a tl;dr at the bottom since this is a long story. 

Long version: I have a history of chronic back pain and I had my first back surgery when I was 15. Fast forward to 10 years later and I was in need of a second back surgery to alleviate my inability to walk due to a compressed nerve. This is my first semester as a transfer student at a University and I had to find online classes since my health condition prevented me from going on campus. (the symptoms started after orientation and my original classes, that were on campus, were found). I found a couple online classes and did not know about my surgery for sure when I signed up for them. After the semester started and I found out about my surgery, I reached out to my professors and informed them of what was going on. Three of them were very understanding, but the fourth, we will call her Professor X., ignored all my emails, including the ones with my doctors notes about the surgery. There was a conference that was mandatory to attend for her class and I was afraid of failing since I was still recovering and unable to attend it. After 3 sent emails and no response, I reached out to the vice president of student services to ask what I can do since I could not get in touch with Professor X. and was afraid of failing my class. He reached out to the Assistant Dean who spoke to Professor X and said that she had responded to my emails, but they must have gotten ""lost"" somehow. (I checked my spam and inbox folders but there was nothing). Professor X said that I could makeup the assignment but she needed time to make one that was fair for the students who went to the conference. Fast forward to 4 weeks later, the conference happened and I still had not heard from Professor X. I reached out and asked about the assignment and she said she will let me know soon. Saturday she emailed me and said that I need to write a 25 page research paper to fulfill the absence. I am extremely upset. I understand that the conference was mandatory, but the other students had to just show up and listen, no other written response. I only have a month to do this along with all the other course work for 4 classes and I feel that this is unfair. I can understand a 10 page paper, even 15, but 25 seems extremely extensive. I am wondering how I can proceed. My boyfriend believes that I should reach out to the Assistant Dean to talk about the unfair amount of coursework, but I feel that it would create more problems. I feel like in a way she is punishing me for going over her head, but I never got a response from her and I was afraid about failing this class because of a my health. Any advice about how I can I proceed would be much appreciated as I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I am also wondering your thoughts if I was in the wrong. Thank you again.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Professor is having me write a 25 page research paper in a month to fill an absence. Absence was due to recovering from back surgery (was not able to sit or stand) and unable to attend a conference (for an online class). In need of advice about how to proceed with my professor and if I should reach out to the assistant dean about the unfair amount of coursework. Am I in the wrong? Thank you so much. ",13Nov2018,1

410,"A good friend of mine is currently battling an infection in his gums that will eventually move toward his brain unless he receives medical treatment to remove his teeth. All in all, the total cost comes out to $10,000. Major problem though is that he has never been good with money and has such a low credit score that no bank or medical debt relief provider will lend him the money. Every member in his family is in a similar pay check to pay check lifestyle and either cannot help him or refuse to help him. His own father refused to be a cosigner on a medical loan due to his skepticism of his illness and his ability to pay the money back. 

I have been fortunate enough in my life to be in good financial standing, earning and saving just above the median. He has not asked for my financial help, but theoretically I could be the cosigner of the medial loan and theoretically, I wouldn't be bankrupt if it so happened the debt were to fall on me. Being a compassionate person, these possibilities dwell heavy on me while knowing I could prevent him from dying. However, I know for certain that I cannot put myself and my wife in such a risky circumstance by potentially being liable of the loan. So now I need to ask.

How does one deal with the unfortunate circumstance of having a friend reach out before dying while knowing that grabbing their hand could either save them or drown you both? He keeps asking for advice but never explicitly asks for me to help financially but I can tell he knows I could if I wanted to. Our conversation is to the point now that I can't say anything supportive because we both silently know this will be the death of him and that I am choosing to let him die to preserve myself.

We are now both in our mid-20’s (she is slightly older) working great jobs and own a home so financially we are fine having a child.  However, she was born with Cystic Fibrosis (CF).  In terms of her overall health, she has done a phenomenal job since we have been married to keep herself in shape physically, mentally, and spiritually.  Her doctors have even been impressed as her effort to do this in college was much lower.

We are now to the point where most of our friends are becoming pregnant or already have a child and while she has stated she isn’t quite ready, next year late summer will be the time to start trying.  My issue is, I am terrified to do so.  For those unaware, the average life expectancy for someone with CF is 40 y/o.  I love my wife greatly and the thought of losing her gives me anxiety already and to add a child or children on top of becoming a single father has really hit me hard over the last month.  Over the last two years, she seems to have a strong baseline when healthy and doesn’t waver much from that line, but when she gets sick, her valleys seem to get a little deeper every time.  I am beginning to worry that a trend will develop into a regressing that baseline. 

To add on, since the disease is genetic, there could be the case that I am a carrier and if so, our child would have a 50% chance of having the disease.  I think I will have to have genetic testing done to know whether or not I am a carrier, but in the past this has been something my wife has said she would not prefer.

I am not sure how to bring this up to her.  I want a child so bad, but I in good conscious am struggling to tell myself it is OK to bring a child into this world that could potentially lose their mother before they reach adulthood or even worse, having the disease themselves.

414,"My partner and I have been house shopping and have found a house that we LOVE. After going to the viewing we wanted to get more info on the property. After a quick Google search we found out that there was a fire in the house in February of this year. We've contacted our realtor and he is getting in touch with the agent to get more info on this but we are still waiting and I wanted to get some other opinions in the mean time.

According to the article about the house fire it was electrical and started in the basement, the fire department arrived and got that under control, but not before the fire had gone up through one of the walls into the second floor attic. The article only vaguely said ""extensive damage ~100k"" the house was unoccupied at the time.

The house was built in the late 1800s and the entire exterior is brick. When we saw the listing it boasted being stripped to the studs and completely re-done, new electrical etc. We saw the house and it was STUNNING everything felt really good and high quality. We didn't notice any smells or anything amis we were in the basement (its unfinished) and I didn't notice anything. But we also weren't looking since at the time we were unaware of the fire. We never saw the attic, didn't think to look at the time. 

We were extremely surprised at the price it was listed at. Considerably lower than other properties in the area, despite being in an amazing location and completing renovated. But upon learning of the fire that must be why. 

Just looking for some advice on what others would do in this situation. I realize houses catch fire and are renovated regularly, it's not an anomaly. Depending on what the agent says when they get back to us we're likely still interested in the house. We would want to find a home inspector that's dealt with house fires before and has experience with it. I also understand that checking for mold is important since there could be moisture damage from initially putting out the fire.

I don't even know where to start. So I guess I'll just jump right into the main issue. I'm currently living with my cousin and her stepdad in a house that is currently owned by my Dad. We've never seen eye to eye, and earlier this year he moved down to Florida, 2 years after my mom passed. During that time he was still here, I had a full time job, and paid him rent. But things went kinda south for me and I've been without a stable job for about a year now. Fast forward to this year, and our relationship soured even more. To the point now where he's telling to leave or he'll have me evicted. A couple weeks back my older brother who currently lives in Connecticut reached out and offered me to come live with him and his family. Sounds great at first. I'll have a roof over my head, while I look for a new job in a new city, and a chance at a fresh start. This morning I received a text from him saying he'd like to come and get me on Sunday. States that I could only bring my clothes for now, no furniture, and that I will be staying on his couch for the time being. Not only that was my worst fear, but he also states he might be moving to Florida. My anxiety immediately kicked in. Because now my gut is saying this doesn't sound like an ideal living situation. First off, I have a bad back, so laying on a couch will only aggravate it even more. Secondly, I'm a somewhat quiet, private person. So always being in the center of attention like that doesn't sound too comfortable. Thirdly, say he does move to Florida and I find something full time. Now I'm stuck in state where I have to look for roommates, or move to another one and start all over again. It's very frustrating. He sent me this text around 8 this morning.

My sister, age 15, has become a total shut in. She remains in her room pretty much the entire day unless it's to grab some food from the kitchen, or to use the bathroom. She hasn't gone to school for nearly a week, and I can't figure out why.

I've tried so hard to figure out what might be wrong. I asked if she was being bullied, I asked if she might be feeling stressed or depressed over something, I've offered to take her to the doctor's, I've tried to ask her numerous times. Always, the same answer is ""don't bother me, leave me alone, stop"".

She doesn't seem to be communicating with any of her friends (which is strange, since she has many friends). Her teachers have asked, and I've regretfully let them know she'll be away for a little bit due to personal issues. They've thankfully been understanding and haven't pushed too far. 

I've tried to contact some of her friends and see if they might have insight, but they don't know. I've tried contacting teachers to ask if she's been bullied, but they claim she hasn't.

It's breaking me, I can't stand watching this. It hurts me to see her like this, but I just don't know what is wrong. What are my steps Reddit? What do I do? I don't have parental experience like my parents did, I don't know what is wrong. ",13Nov2018,1
423,"Lately I've been noticing some things about my mom that has rocked my world. She isn't normal, who is? There are some key points I'd like to ask your opinion on...

She has many ""routines."" We all have routines, we are all bound to certain rituals that relieve us of stress or forgetfulness, however my mom has weird routines. She can't go to sleep without turning the thermostat up two notches and telling the family if she doesn't get to sleep in a couple hours, she's going to come out and make food and try again. It's not too odd, but she won't go to sleep without doing this. She says many phrases exactly the same every time a situation arises such as me leaving for work, or her getting into the shower, her going to the bathroom (many more I can't think of right now) 
And uses names like ""number 7"" and ""the shed"" as euphemisms to describe these situations.

She is very open and will tell me literally everything that is on her mind. She will speak and you hear her train of thought. I always have to tell her to please stop talking. She is also not ashamed of anything like describing bowel movements and other things she should keep to herself.

She OFTEN asks questions she knows the answer to. For example, I told her I had an appointment at 11 yesterday. This morning she goes, ""when is your appointment?"" I ignored her. She said ""Eleven?"" And that marks yet another question she asks when she clearly knows the answer to...she seems to ask it to (or for) herself, not to me. You know?

She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I believe it to be correct however when she is manic, it is as if a child has entered her body. I become the adult and she becomes the jumping, playing, annoying, creative child. 

-She will come up with lavish ideas and no amount of reason will stop her. This is a manic symptom. Her latest idea is that she is going to become a shamen.. some type of priest. I admire her ideas, I really do, but when we're at Walmart and she has a fit when candy won't fit into her budget, it seriously damages her credibility.

- She will annoy me on purpose with guttural voices, silly phrases, and singing songs in weird voices. I understand she's feeling happy, and initially I always try to be neutral and wait it out but I don't understand why she finds it fun to piss me off. (She often does this until I leave the room and be upset why I left.)

Reddit, what do you think is wrong with my mom? Is there something wrong with her?

426,"I don't have anyone to talk to about this, and I still feel on edge and a little traumatized from last night. I can't get the scene off my mind. I would appreciate any advice.

I was sitting at an airport waiting for my shuttle, and this person sitting next to me asked if they could use my laptop for about a minute. I genuinely wanted to help, and there were many people around, so I didn't think that they would steal it or anything, and they didn't.

I handed the lady my Macbook pro, and she pushed the screen past where the hinge stops it from going further, and cracked the casing under it which ended up tearing open a part of my Macbook. I started crying uncontrollably as I've worked very hard to purchase this Macbook, and the repair will be expensive. The lady told me I was not even crying and was faking it, but I couldn't control myself, and I was completely humiliated in front of all of the other people. I was so distraught I didn't think of calling the police right away, catching her before she left, or asking another stranger for help. 

After about half an hour, I mustered the strength to ask for the airport's police number. I filed a report, and it turns out that the policeman thinks he knows who the person is. She is a homeless person that uses the restroom at the airport often and hangs around. She also told me she never used a Macbook before, which doesn't make sense to me why she would ask to use it in the first place. She didn't apologize either and just left. I was surprised because she didn't look homeless to me at all.

I realize my mistake with lending my items to a stranger, but it was a natural instinct/reaction for me to help someone in need. The policeman told me that I can bring my case/police report to Apple, and they might be able to do a repair for free; however, I don't have AppleCare+.

I'm wondering if anyone has gone through something similar or has advice. I don't have parents to talk to, and I'm a freshman college student. I'm not comfortable with sharing this story with my friends at the moment, and I won't be able to see a therapist for another month. I realize that this incident isn't nearly as bad many other traumatic experiences go through, but I can't get the incident off my mind, and I feel a little guilty for feeling this way about damage to my Macbook. I'm having trouble studying for my exams. I'm nor feeling suicidal. I think I have gone through worse things in my life, so I am able to stay relatively strong.

But I do not plan on being an entrepreneur and building something of my own, although I would like to. I'm not educated enough for that IMO but I won't rule it out.

I don't want to study and say later ,had I known, I would have done this instead of that. You know what I mean?

All I know is they interest me and I want to make better money, than my current career. Which is a basically minimum wage job.

432,"Currently in a relationship with a girl I love like crazy. However, sometimes I become very resentful and passive aggressive towards her.

The only reasons that make me feel this are based on a few fights we had early on. And the TLDR of those fights is that she was talking / flirting/ using affectionate words to other guys she had met online (we also met online).

Most of this happened very early on in our relationship. However I’m aware of her being in contact with one of her ‘online friends’ in recent months. 

Occasionally I’ll have thoughts of her being disloyal or wondering if I’m being taken for a fool by her, and these thoughts are so difficult to ignore.

I’ve brought this topic up with her a few times and she assured me that she loves me and my thoughts are unreasonable.

433,"Hey reddit, so I’ve recently gone through a pretty severe break up and was forced to move back with my parents. I’m 23(f) and actually haven’t lived with them since I was 14 due to their behavior. My father has always hit me/insulted over minor infractions and seems to always find ways to make my life miserable.  

A great example of this behavior happening less than a week ago.  Where he threw glasses at me, destroyed a bunch of my stuff and tried to take my car keys because I got a parking ticket ($25 parking ticket). I feel like it’s important to state that I bought and fully own my car, pay for my own car insurance and have already paid the parking ticket.  Yet my dad continues to use this ticket as an excuse as to why he’s entitled to my car (because I’m not responsible enough) this has gotten to a point where I sleep with my keys and a knife. 

My mother isn’t as bad as my father but continuously defends his actions and has been for some reason verbally cruel since I was a teenager. She’s constantly telling me that the reason he’s upset is due to me being a failure. She’s even recently recommended that I kill myself as my life “isn’t really going anywhere”.   

I know it sounds ridiculous that I’d deal with these f*cking a**holes but I don’t have any friends and I don’t trust homeless shelters and don’t want to be forced to adhere to a schedule/etc. I also have belongings that I have been able to safely store at my parents that I don’t believe I could  keep safely at s homeless shelter.

And to be honest I think I could easily beat my dad if he ever tried to directly attack me and have been able to keep him physically away from me since I’ve moved back( he is much older now). Also parents are not ALWAYS bad, sometimes we just talk about work or the weather and they are okay with me having a guest over if they stay in my room. 

The real problem is that they are making me depressed. Being told that I’m a loser, constantly being on edge, and having to fight for at least 6 hours a week is taking a mental toll on me that I honestly wasn’t expecting. I’m having a hard time not crying at work(where I’m a lunch lady lol)  and often contemplate suicide. I know this situation is not permanent but sometimes the mental pain just seems like too much. I thought being older, I would be stronger but instead I’m seeing my mental self image distort/collapse in real time. 

I have little to no credit and don’t make allot of money so moving out has been taking a much longer time than I was initially anticipating(although I do have the money saved up). How do I cope with the near constant harassment of my parents without crying in public/drinking myself to sleep? 


Tl/dr: I’m living with my abusive parents while I try to find somewhere else to rent however they are making me very depressed and I don’t know how to cope with the negativity.

434,I’m a 19 year old Bio/Edu freshman at a 4 year university in the USA who commutes roughly 4 hours a day from home(?). I’m an Eagle Scout and have perfect conduct since I’ve started school. I don’t drink or do drugs or anything. Judging from other people my relationship with my parents has always been a bit weird. They told me they would handle tuition which I trusted. Seems like this was a huge mistake since I got a call from the bursars office that not a cent had been paid about 5-6 weeks ago. I asked my parents and they said that they couldn’t figure out how to access the online billing for the school so they just didn’t pay even after I showed them how to. Last Thursday was the day I was supposed to register for classes.Nothing has been paid so obviously I didn’t I told them all this and that I would also lose scholarships and grants if I’m not registered. Last weekend after talking to my academic and financial advisors I called my grandparents and asked for advice they said they both could and would pay for my tuition this semester. Tonight my mother asked me what progress I made on getting a loan for this semester and I explained everything that had happened and she blew up and started cursing at me and asking how dare I do this and then she got my dad and he came in and got in my face yelling at me and then he grabbed me by the shirt and put me against a wall I pushed him away and then he came back and tried putting me against the stove and the stove top was on. My mom kept trying to get between us. I pushed away and moved towards the door. I tried one last time to talk it out and they still wouldn’t listen so I told them I would come home when I felt safe. I didn’t think they would take this well so I had packed a go bag but I didn’t think it would come to that. Unfortunately I don’t have my birth certificate or social security number just some state ID. I ran to my gf’s house and talked to her parents who had known what was going on. My mother called them and I didn’t hear the full thing but I think she implied that if they didn’t send me home she would call the police and say I assaulted her. I walked home and tried to talk to her and the whole exchange was really strange. She kept trying to get me inside and to come all the way upstairs to the bathroom where the rest of the family was I kept repeating no I don’t feel comfortable with that so she finally agreed to talk to me in the entrance hall even though she was cold. I explained for probably reason billionth time all the factors that made me do this and she agreed but I could tell it wasn’t actual agreement more just a yes shut up don’t make a scene come inside. I called my grandparents and let them know what has happened and their worried my dad will use this to cut them off from me and my siblings. Don’t pay it and they might get to see us. I love the major and despite feeling like shit all the time I’m passing all my classes with high B’s at least. I had to drop chem but I’ll probably try and take it over the summer or next semester.

439,"I'll try to explain why I am so de-motivated to see if anyone can help.

I started college this semester (Syracuse University) and when I started I was really excited and looking forward to the new experience. As the semester has gone on, I have gotten less and less motivated to do anything. I mean anything.

It's basically a chore for me to ever leave my dorm and do anything including: eating, showering, going to class, hanging out with friends, etc.

My college experience has turned from wanting to experience new things and the thrill of being on my own to basically not leaving my room and playing video games until 2am with my high school friends, then sleeping in too late and missing my classes early in the morning.

A good example of this is that I decided to just sit in my dorm room and not do anything and basically not eat for about 27 hours. I just went to get some food an hour ago so at least I did that. Showering and shaving has come to be a chore to me. I used to shower daily and now it's turned to every other day. I started consistently skipping my Tuesday and Thursday classes and even sometimes skipping my Mon/Wed/Fri classes (my favorite ones).

Something that somewhat contributes to this is that my college is very party-heavy and I don't really get invited to them nor am a party animal myself. I went to maybe 3 parties in high school and I don't like drinking or doing drugs.

I keep telling myself that I'm going to change but I never due. I was supposed to do laundry like four days ago but I keep putting it off and just wear the same stuff until I finally go do it one day.

The one thing that I still manage to motivate myself to do is homework. Usually I will do the homework and then not even show up to the class which gets me no credit (for some classes).

Is this depression? I don't feel sad or depressed. I still kind of enjoy college but I'm not so sure it is what I made it out to be in my head.

Any advice would be lovely. Thanks.

I had to move back when I didn't get hired immediately after college (house still isn't done partially because my dad had back surgery).  Luckily I am debt free (sorta paying off a car but I could pay it off if I didn't need to build credit (the credit system is aweful)).

Hi all, I'm a 21 year old substitute teacher who just recently moved back in with my parents. Long story short, my father was having a tough time with my mother and younger brother and I was dealing with a crappy roommate. We convened, and I moved back in to help out.

Now, my younger brother is 15, and just started high school this year. He had some issues with middle school, but he passed. However, this year he barely ever goes to school, blaming feeling sick and having migraines. He gets good grades when he actually does his work, so its clear that he's smart, but he's so addicted to his video games and his phone that he rarely wants to. Then he goes to school, gets anxious and upset that he doesn't know the material, and then doesn't want to go again. Recently he's been on the boat of ""I can't, I don't know how, etc., etc.""

Our mother has basically given up on him, and my father can't make more time for the kid, he's already working his ass off to provide for the family. I'm trying my best, but there's literally nothing that I can think of doing that would be of any help. It feels like the kid is being selfish, especially when it seems like he has all the free time to play games instead if studying.

It's difficult. I've got a lot on my plate as is, and everytime we try to explain to him that he has to try and fix his own problems, he gets all mad and upset. I've got a career, a higher education, and a newly formed relationship that I have to put time towards, not to mention trying to take care of myself.

So here's the story: The closest parking that I can use my dorm parking pass for is about a 10 minute walk. My boyfriend was visiting for a few days this week (I have a single person dorm, so he stays the night sometimes), so he drove up with his PS4 and a couple large bags of luggage. He was leaving today, so we tried to move his car as close as we possibly could to my building and load up stuff as quickly as possible because he was running late for a family event. He parked in a handicapped parking spot, which I understand is wrong considering neither of us are handicapped. I really didn't think it was a big deal at the time because there were about four empty handicapped spots still open, and he left his car running. After we were done loading everything up (about six minutes). We said our goodbyes, hugged, and I walked off. However, when I began to walk off a middle-aged woman(roughly 40) got out of her van parked on the opposite row of the parking lot and put her phone in the air and basically said something along the lines of, ""That was so disrespectful what you guys just did, and I want everyone to see how rude you are."" She said she had just taken a picture of my boyfriend and I, and she was going to post it on Facebook. I tried to politely explain that we were just loading up the car and she was right that that was rude of us and I apologized, but she said she didn't care and, ""wanted everyone to see."" I basically just said okay and told her to have a good day, walked back up to my dorm, and now I'm writing this. 

I recognized her as one of the workers at my dorm's dining hall, and I really don't know why but the whole thing made me really anxious. I don't really know what to do or if I should worry or do anything about it at all.

450,"I started a new job in a state office in the US about 3 months ago. Prior to starting this job, I had planned a trip with my (now ex-) girlfriend for the Christmas-New Year's holidays. However, she broke up with me and things were complicated for a while. I couldn't bring up or even think about the trip-- whether to cancel it or not. Now that things have subsided somewhat, we're on good terms, and she told me that she still wants to go on the trip. I hadn't told my supervisors about it because I honestly thought that we would cancel the trip. Since I only started working here recently, I don't have a lot of vacation time accumulated. I will have enough to cover most of it-- I think I'm only a day or two short. Our employee handbook says that there are unpaid leave options available, but no details about it are given.

I went home for a wedding recently and upon returning to school a week ago, I’ve let my work ethic become nearly nonexistent. I’ve slept through two quizzes and a test since I’ve gotten back and only cared about the test since that’s more of a hit to my gpa. All I’ve done is smoke weed and chill the last few days (no work nothing) and it’s been really nice but now I’m scared that I’m tanking my gpa. What can I do to get myself more motivated and fix some of the damage I’ve done when all my classes just make me roll my eyes and stay home?

Side note, I’m thinking of pairing my comp sci with neuroscience/psychology so I can focus my career on AI, would this work out? ",13Nov2018,1

They didn't say where they were from, so I freaked out and thought maybe it was a hospital or something because my 89 year old grandpa died and they were trying to let her know (she lived with him for years). I called back and it said ""thank you for calling X financial"" and I hung up. (Grandpa is alive and well btw). I let her know but she hasn't gotten back to me yet. Is this a scam?

453,"So I had an interview for a new job yesterday and was then offered the position later in the evening. The offer letter came in this morning with a proposed start date of December 10th. This position is in the LA area and I currently live in the Bay Area, so I would be required to relocate. I am also currently employed full-time, so I would need to give two weeks notice. December is generally a shitty time to transition with the holidays coming up and with such a big move ahead of me, I would prefer to start at the beginning of year instead. That would allow me to remain home through the holidays and give me more time to house/apartment hunt, while allowing me to get everything squared away with me current job.

A beginning of 2019 start date is about six weeks out from now. Is it reasonable to ask for a start date at the beginning of 2019 instead? If so, how should I go about it?

454,"Okay- this is gonna be a weird one to explain and idk if I'll get everything the first time around.

My mom, brother, sister, and I moved into a new house when I was 9. My mom worked full time as self-employer and I was often the babysitter of my younger siblings throughout the summers and evenings during school. We had a house phone so our mom could check up on us. It didn't take long before our house phone was getting its fair share of random telemarketers. Later on though, we started to get mysterious calls.

It started off as silent calls. Where we'd answer and couldn't hear a single thing and eventually the call would end or we'd hang up. The calls also would happen when my mom was at the house too. The weird thing was the calls came in at the most coincidental times. For example, we would all walk into the house after school &amp; work and literally within minutes the phone would ring. This would happen regularly throughout the week.

Later on, the calls got even creepier. We could hear breathing on the other line. My mom assumed it was some creep guy she knew from her past who was harassing us. We changed numbers a couple times- but the calls kept coming. 

As I got older, the calls became even more coincidental. I would literally walk into the room where the phone was after being in my room all morning and it would go off. Or I would walk into the bathroom and minutes later the silent caller would call. 

It was really flippin creepy obviously so we eventually got rid of the phone and that was more or less the end of the story.

I went to college and moved back into the house. For reasons I don't even really understand my mom got a new house phone line, with a new number. I work in the afternoon on weekdays- and as you can guess by now the calls have started up again. No breathing yet- but the same eerie coincidence of the phone going off as soon as I come downstairs or sit in the kitchen. I don't answer. 

Basically- do you think this creep is watching us? Or is it all just coincidences? My mom's main reason for keeping the house line is so she can call my now teenage siblings whenever they're home and their phones are taken up because they're grounded (happens often). It's perhaps a silly reason- but I'm not going to force her to cut it off.  And it's not like it's a huge burden- I just ignore all the calls we get on the phone. I just hate this underlying feeling that we've been watched/listened to for all these years like The Truman Show or something more sinister.",13Nov2018,1

457,"When I was younger my parents were on my case about not getting a loan when I was 19. Years later I’ve come back to the subject and am really curious but am seeking advice for a decision. My credit score stands at a 730 and I have enough income to pay a monthly rate if I can get one under 70$. If it boosted my credit score would I take a hit and then progressively go up monthly? 

I really wanted to put it into stocks if I got approved. I participate and watch very frequently but too stubborn to dump anything out of savings. Do people normally take out a loan for that purpose? 
I can see it in one perspective of being bad since stocks are a gamble, But ai was also going to go with things that don’t have insane volatility. I was hoping to essentially use a cut of the returns to pay the monthly fee but also profit off having extra shares from the loan and try to progress so forth. 

On my credit Karma they have loans that start as low as 6.9%apr that range from 5000$-$45000. Im assuming the companies that list the lowest apr apply to only the biggest loans.

I was looking towards a 5000$ loan but don’t know what a good apr is.

(yes a lot of this is my fault, I should have made this clearer during the interview and I am now paying the price for being way to laid back) anyway I was called into the office today and my manager told me that this is serious and I will have to have a meeting with some head of the department to talk about this, if it doesn't go well and they are not happy with my answers regarding the situation I will be `let go`. I really don't want this to happen, started 6 weeks ago and really enjoy the job.

Was thinking of printing correspondence with the university off to prove I have been actively trying to solve this. But instead I think I might take responsibility hoping they'd appreciate my honesty and upfrontness about the situation hoping they'd see it in the kindness of their hearts to continue my employment but I'm not even sure.

459,"I am not entirely sure what to do right now, my mom is planning on moving herself, my little brother, and pets out to go live with some old guy whom I believe is her sugar daddy as he's only having her pay 300 a month which includes ALL utilities and all she had to do is live with him and keep him company. I even have a picture of her letter she wrote with her little plans on. Tl;Dr at the bottom

Me and my partner both work the same job and make roughly a bit over 1k a month together.  Our rent is roughly around 750, internet for two months is 120, electric can be up to 300 in winter, around 100 in summer. We can make enough to barely cover the bills but neither of us have a driver's license or car and neither of us feel ready enough to just have this thrown at us. We feel like we need to ask around to have someone we can sort of trust and rent out half the loft to them, but we dont know what else to do. 

A little bit of backstory in case anyone is wondering if we did anything to deserve this etc. Etc., me and my partner are both 19 nearly 20 in a few months, no car or license, and tensions have been rising due to my mom creating a feeling of needing to walk on ""eggshells"" around her. 
She constantly blames us for everything she does or doesn't do, we constantly clean the house for her, (even though it's all her mess) but all she does is complain that we don't do anything, that we're lazy and 'selfish' (over wanting one date night a bloody month and to have a single day to relax???)  And that all we do is want, want, want and no give, give, give. 

We give her around 1200 a month to pay for Bill's even though she just bought herself a truck with 3k and has money left over, she has a job where she makes more than us and nearly 100 in tips every day (not a stripper just a really really good job) on top of getting her phone paid off by her friend for free (a new Samsung Galaxy 8+)

Not sure if this is the right flair because it kinda ties into both. My ex and I after a year of dating decided to split. Although we still love each other And the relationship was pretty healthy, he wants to travel and figure out some decisions in his life so we agreed to end the relationship. While we have a few instances in the upcoming months where we plan on talking, we have agreed on remaining no contact for the most part.


One discussion we had about a week ago was that I might be living in the city this upcoming summer where we met and he grew up while he is away traveling. It’s pretty far from my own home which is three hours away. He said that while he’s not home I’m more than welcome to hang out with his mom and play with his dogs. His mom is a really nice person and she means a lot to me. Plus she has many connections to the city I live in and has offered countless times to network me with people in the area. 


I’m just wondering if maybe it’s too soon for me to do so? We have only been broken up for almost two weeks now. I’m also wondering if maybe it might come off the wrong way like my intentions for wanting to talk to her seem insincere or a desperate attempt to remain in touch with my ex.

467,"By 'stereotypical nerd' I am specifically talking about nerdy guys who look like the guy in this photo - https://imgur.com/a/nRfdlD8

I also like looking up weird ways people have died and one time I made a forum thread about weird ways people have died (just out of curiosity) and someone replied about how some years ago a stereotypical nerd was being harassed so one day the nerd locked this person in a bathroom and then the nerd got him to the ground, put him in a scissor hold and choked him until he died of asphyxiation.

Something about that turned me on so much I kind of became obsessed. Every few years I look at news cases to see if it's happened again and it has. In 2014 in Oregon a man was found dead in his car. The bruises on his neck suggested that he was strangled between a set of thighs, and the victim was last seen alive at a restaurant with three stereotypical looking skinny nerds. There was one in 2013 too and the nerdy guy had a Facebook profile. His victim too died of asphyxiation when he put his neck in a scissor hold after an argument - the nerd squeezed his neck for ten minutes. I remember seeing the description of the case and when I saw that he was choked via legs, my heart began to beat rapidly wondering if a nerdy guy did it, and then when I saw his photo it was like a dream come true for me.

I already liked stereotypical nerds before all of this but something about this makes me really love them for some reason. Like I act super nice to nerdy guys all the time because I respect how deceptively deadly their thighs can be and I feel somewhat jealous of the people who died. Like maybe not to death but just having a nerd jump on me and wrap his thighs across my neck and give it a squeeze.

I probably sound like an insane person but I semi hope that a nerd goes and constricts someone to death with his thighs again soon so it gets into the news. I managed to find 4-5 cases since the 80's but it's probably more considering a lot of murder cases never make it into the news. Also I managed to find like 10 cases of people strangling people with their thighs and 4-5 cases were fatal and the fatal ones were...you guessed it, the ones from nerds. (The other 5 weren't nerds/didn't look nerdy)

It comes out of nowhere, it comes randomly, I can't do a thing to relax. I tried medicine to calm me down, it never worked, I tried exercising, I tried getting myself occupied, nothing. I have never smoked or drinked in my entire life, I live in a very... angry family, my mom gets enraged very very fast and it spreads like a disease. It's intoxicating. I have decent grades, I don't stress too much over school, I'm planning on studying medicine after finishing military service next gear. It's lately been getting much much worse. I have a girlfriend, she's a very kind, loving and gentle person, she's quite sensitive to things. A couple of months ago I have gotten to such a degree where I have considered suicide many times, a few times I almost did it, I have attempted it  6 months ago with overdosing medication. I have a chronic migraine, I live with pain each and every day of my life. Once I tried to open up to my girlfriend, told her about the suicide attempts, the thoughts, she's been super supportive over it and tried to help me a lot until eventually she gave out. She was so worried it started affecting her daily life, her grades declined, I has to snap out of it. One of the hardest things for me is being male. It's so riddled with old stereotypes on how a man is SUPPOSED to be and is so closed minded in my circle of people that I have nobody to talk to. I have tried the schools therapist, but after a few attempts it just made it worse. I feel guilty about bring emotional all the time, I almost never talk or complain about my emotions. But it has been getting serious as of late. I lack sleep. I sleep a few hours at night, even thoe every 2 or 3 days I get a lot of sleep which is nice. I have constant nightmares of either driving and crashing a car, being brutally murdered or being attacked by various insects. I wake up either i  terror, flailing my arms around myself or in cold sweat. I also have very scary dreams which are very hard to describe. A few months back my computer broke down and my friends of 10 years abandoned me completely.

472,"I am in an accelerated 1-year program located in an East Coast city. I've lived in this city my entire life and always attended inner-city schools that consisted of all types of backgrounds and personalities. However, even though my program is in my city many of the students come from suburbs all around the country. My problem is my city chick personality doesn't seem to mesh with the suburban girl personality. I'm not the type that needs friends but I understand that in this particular program its best to make friends so you have connections in the field after graduation. 

I really wish I could explain all the subtle differences between people from cities and suburbs. There small variations on how we talk, what we talk about, and overall I've felt that although people from the city can come off as aggressive we are still more open to different types of people. I can get on the sub or be in line at Dunkin and strike up a conversation with almost anyone but when it comes to the suburban personalities I encounter the idea of small talk seems nearly impossible.  With most of these girls, there's an overall lack of respect when it comes to how they talk to me and the things they say. I don't know if its because they've never been called out on it but it just blows my mind how common it seems to be in girls from suburbs no matter which state whether Michigan, Connecticut, or New Jersey.  

These girls are catty, talk behind your back but are friendly to your face, make smart comments to belittle you and seem to honestly believe you won't catch on. Outside of the program, I have my ways of dealing with that but, since I don't want to get kicked out of the program I just stay quiet and try to ignore it. I feel like where I am from if you have problems with someone it gets settled verbally or physically or you mutually understand not to get in each other's way to maintain the peace. These girls are extremely fake and I just can't go along with the charade. I have considered saying something calmy but I know that there is a risk of my anger coming out the more I talk. 

Two months in and I'm just irritated that I feel out of place in my own city, that I let these chicks get away with making smart comments, and that I have to suppress my thoughts/feelings and sit there and take it in order to not lose my spot. I love what I'm learning, my professors are great, the program is fun but then all the positive aspects of my experience get diminished by these annoying attitudes that I have to deal with. I want to network and make connections that may help me down the road, but to be honest, my pride won't let me pretend to like people I don't because then I'm fake, weak, and worst of all just like them.

I understand that I may seem to be attacking suburban chicks and I'm sure there are plenty negative to say about city chicks but this has been my experience. I even dealt with these same issues years ago as a freshman and I transferred out of that University quickly.  In general, mostly all my friends are girls from some major city or guys because tend to be less fake and much more laid back. (Unfortunately, there are only a hand full of guys in the program) 

I honestly don't know what to do. I just don't want to let these things ruin my experience and take my focus away from what is really important which is maintaining good grades and graduating. I need advice, insight, or maybe someone out there has been through the same thing and can help, please.",13Nov2018,1
473,"I (f 21) don’t like being touched. It’s not my thing. I’m not rude about it, but i tend to make it clear with every one including my family that i don’t want them touching me. This includes hugs, handshakes, anything really. It’s nothing new for me. I’ve always been like this. To many people, this is not a problem, but i cannot explain why i dont like being touched. I just dont. However, i have a friend (f 22), who is a touchy person.

We hang out all the time, and most of the time we have fun. For instance, we go to football games, or to lunch together often. We have a group of friends (6-8 people), who we tend to hang out with most of the time. I have made it clear, many many times thus far in the semester, that i do not want her touching me. This is not new to her as we went to high school together. Only, she makes a huge scene if i say or do anything to keep her from touching me. An example would be, when we are at a football game, we always get really into it. We love football. Well, when the team scores she will always for some reason feel the need to hug me, high five me, or touch me in someway. Or when the other team scores, makes a good play, or anything like that, she slaps the fool out of me. I usually, back away and say, “don’t touch me” or “please don’t touch me”, depending on how many times i’ve asked her not to touch me. She always gets an attitude which is fine, and she usually makes me miserable the rest of the game by mocking me to our friends, but never talking directly to me, if that makes sense.? Or like today, i was sitting at a curved two person booth, which could allow more, but it was a small table. I wasn’t expecting company while i was working on homework. She saw me and had all of our friends with her, which was completely fine. But she proceeded to sit uncomfortable close to me, practically on top of me. I said, “dont touch me” and she again, got an attitude and mocked me to our friends without directly saying something to me. It was annoying but whatever.  

I’m not a confrontational person, but i did pull her aside and talk to her about touching me, how i don’t like being touched, and how it was nothing personal, it’s just me. She apologized and said, “i’m a touchy person, sorry if you don’t like that but that’s how i show love.”  We all met up again at the library, and she then mocked the whole talk we had again without talking to me directly. 

I just don’t know what else to do. It’s not like what i’m asking of her is that unrealistic. I don’t think I’m being unrealistic at least?  It is just kind of disrespectful to keep touching me after I’ve asked her many time to stop. I guess, I’m just at a loss on what else i can do. 

Any and all advice is welcomed.

This made me constantly fight with her. I would make her cry so much. I would just be like get me shorts, get me a dress, let me grow my hair. The clothes were against her religion. I am not religious. My mom claims to be muslim, even though she gambles with my dad. This is significant because we pater became homeless. After homelessness we ended up in a rich neighborhood. Skipping a lot of the story now i live in a nice gated community, im just poorer than all my peers. 

My relationship with my mom is so strained. I feel like also because i live with rich kids i expect more. I think im very materialistic. I held so much anger towards my mom, i feel like she hates me. She had surgery and had to be on bedrest. The entiee time she was resting I annoyed her. I kept asking her to let me wear clothes i like. I made her cry every single day.

Now a few years later she lets me dress with less restrictions. But im clearly her least favorite child. I was the only one who put up so much of a fight. I went straight from a baby unconditionally loving her to our relationship being based on manipulations and hatred. At this point I think i want to fix ot, but even now i just don't know what to do. Ill be moving out in 2 years.",13Nov2018,1

I have met this girl from a mutual friend in a group setting few days ago in college. I see that she is a introvert person. One day in the exam week we planned to study in the library with her friend and our mutual friend. We somehow get to know each other a little bit, I crack some jokes and she did too. I have this problem where I become nervous around her even though I'm comfortable talking to other girls.  I have the feeling she is into me by few signs.

On that day 
	• Sits beside me (removing barriers) but she is quiet 
	• Doing her lipstick beside me (I think she is trying to get attention from me) 
	• A good eye contact 
	• I had to leave early

Couple days later on the first exam day I caught her checking me out across the hall and after the exam we met at the hall where I locked eye contact and I smiled at her while she started the conversation about how the exam went but the conversation was short because I couldn't make it flow and she found an excuse to leave. 

After some practice I have the courage to talk her but I want to ask her out for a coffee  (it seems that I am rushing things also we have about 4 more exams to take, I am assuming she might be stressful to do exams and she might reject me). 

Did I blow off my chance with her and should wait to ask her out after all the exams finish as a excuse relieve stress.

What should I do, I need advice or some guide me in this situation?

483,"Hey so when I first got my phone the associate setting up my phone said the name and credit card info under my original phone carrier (virgin mobile) will transfer to my new carrier (Telus) so bill payments will be billed automatically every month. This did not happen and no card was under the account so it didn’t get bill automatically. 

Around 7 months later I get a call from Telus saying we missed 7 bill payments and now owe $800+ within a WEEK or my phone gets locked from Telus. I was not aware when we missed even the first and second bill payment but Telus informed me almost 8 months later and now I have to come up with $800 for my phone to continue working.

Now the main thing is that when I bought the phone it was originally supposed to be under my dads name but it got put under my moms name and when I bought my phone I was 17 and in Alberta you have to be 18 or older to buy a phone/sign the contract. The associate sold me the phone alone without checking my ID and it was put under my moms name even though she wasn’t there and she didn’t sign a SINGLE thing agreeing to the phone bill so didn’t they technically illegally sell me my phone? 

Just wondering on what you guys think I should do, ultimately I’d want Telus to just cancel the whole plan and if I have to get a new phone so be it. ",13Nov2018,1
484,"I hate my face and my body, I have no beautiful striking features, nothing good stands out, i’m just boring, bland me. My butt is perpetually flat (squats haven’t done jack for me), my hips are nonexistent, my stomach won’t tone down it’ll just stick out like it’s bloated, my eyes are droopy and a depressing shade of grey, my lips are always chapped cause nothing helps them, my genetic dark circles make me look gross... I could go on for hours.

I see what men like, comparing myself to the instagram models and pornstars they lust after, and I am nothing like them. They have asses that make it look like they’re wearing a diaper half the time and lips that are seemingly about to pop they’re so big. But this is what beauty is today, apparently. If you look like me, you will only be begrudgingly settled for. Even if I try to be generous and loving, it doesn’t matter because i’m not attractive. Everything boils down to that.

485,"I am a junior in high school (16M), and since middle school, I have kind of  my self from developing friendships. Throustoppedghout seventh and eighth grade, I went to another classmates house exactly two times. It ninth grade and tenth grade, it got a bit better, but only because I met the sweetest, most understanding person ever. Now I’m in eleventh, and I’m ready to be more out there again, socially speaking. The problem is that other than the one kid I mentioned, everybody has already settled into their cliques. There is one group of kids I really want to be apart of, but they won’t take me in. When ever we hang out in school, we seem to get along just fine: talking, laughing, the whole nine. One of the kids in the group, let’s call her Jane, lives in my town, and we were hanging out pretty frequently. We went on walks together and did homework together and such. One time we were both up at 3am and we snuck out and walked together. The problem is I was always the one initiating; she never asked me if I wanted to hang out, I would always ask her. That was a problem for me in and of itself, but it also meant that the group of kids in school never even invited to lunch with them, let alone do anything outside of school. They even sometimes go as far as leaving a room together to talk amongst themselves, leaving me behind. I dont know whether they don’t like me, or they just don’t know I have an interest in hanging with them since I was so aloof the last few years. In short, how do I express that I want to be apart of the group, and give them the opportunity to shoot me down or let me in in without uncertainty?",13Nov2018,1
486,"So, I have this crush and my friend told him last year that I liked him and I was gonna leave it alone but then my other friends had to tell him shit about me that were ""relationship"" qualities. He got freaked out I think and I had to apologize to him for them because they got so crazy about this to where they threatened him. He accepted the apology and we didn't talk much after that.

Present time and my friend tells him again but she told me he said ""oh"" and smiled. He was already dating someone at the time and she told him that I liked him because she thought they were breaking up. They didn't for another couple weeks, but now I'm getting ahead of myself. So, this friend befriends him (my crush) and my own damn crush tells her over text for her to him my number so he could talk to me. 

I get this text from an unknown number and it says ""hey. This is ***** right?""

I almost shat myself because I knew it was him because my friend told me it was him but I got anxiety so I played dumb like I didn't know who it was. We kinda texted back and forth for several hours but here's the thing: he still had a girlfriend.  So he told me that we were just going to be friends and that hurt me a little but it was whatever. 

Cut forward and we aren't friends because I'm a shy bean. He breaks up with his girlfriend because she turned out to be a hoe. He starts talking to the friend a lot more now and she used to tell me all the great things he would say about me and at one point, he wanted to ask me out on a date. Eventually, he stopped talking to her about me. He's still single but I don't he likes me anymore.

488,"I'm 23 and male, ***She*** just turned 24  
She's shared a small room with me for a year, she came to live with my dad and I due to her ex being abusive human garbage in many ways, it was only supposed to be about 4-5 months, she got screwed over by her friend she was looking to move in with. and lost a job shortly after, so its taken a full year( I had planned on trying to move out with her but something happened to me)   
My dumbasss caught feelings for her back in February(although i am in no place for a relationship, I have to work on myself as a person with depression and childhood issues and get help there)   
I was going to tell her, but, we got real in talking one day in late March, and one of the things she said was that she was glad to have me, and that there was no pressure for anything, and that made me realize, I can't tell her, not while she needs me to be there for her, especially a home. She ended up living with me another 8-9 months  
She started seeing someone in May, which is great for her, I'm so glad she has someone FINALLY treating her well, but I still feel how I feel, although, I want her as a friend and nothing else, especially at this point and time there is so much I need to work on.  
Shortly after in late April I realized I had something wrong with my back/legs/pelvis, My chiropractor I've seen for years, helped me realize I had bi-lateral sciatica, and both my psoas majors and upper front thigh muscles(and pelvis muscles) are fully tense. I was a stage hand, and May 3rd was the last day I was physically able to work  
These last 7 months have been hell for me, day to day is hard, I've had tests done, my doctor thinks the issue could be starting at my feet, I am currently on waiting for session 4 of 10 for Physical therapy, I seem to constantly get worse, its a cycle of pain, body stiffness, and just mental agony  


She started working at my old company, and is training to be an LD(lighting director) so she had crazy weird hours, working different shows and stuff, and at shops loading trucks. I would normally wake up every morning as she was mostly ready, smoke a bowl with her(we live in California, and I very much need it for my pain) stretch, and just chat  
there were many things like that, which would just break the cycle of pain, and the company of my best friend just made all this easier  


I've been crying like a mother fuck on and off since she left, I can't figure out how to fill time, I used to love being alone and now I hate it.   
A lot of my friends that I do have I rarely see, they flake on me a lot, especially since the injury, she was the one constant positive I had day to day, while she doesn't live far, I can't drive, I'm now on her schedule and she was hard to see while she did live here, she hated being here because it was a constant reminder that ""all she had was a few dressers and some closet space"" and she felt like a burden, so often she would come home later which is understandable  
Which is why i am so happy she has the weight off her shoulders of feeling like a burden to my dad and I(she never was) and that she can finally have space of her own, to reflect on things and have time to herself and actually be happier in her day to day  
But my day to day has been awful, I don't like the adjustment period. I cant motivate myself to do almost anything, I've hardly eaten, and for some reason keep crying, I still have my best friend, by this big of a change is driving me nuts  


***How have you coped with a massive change like this***? I'm literally physically trapped to my neighborhood and have very little consistent friends. I have a general work plan for when I do get on my feet again, but right now, I'm just so lost without being attached at the hip to my best friend, my home feels empty and not like home now. She said its really heavy and weird for her too, but nowhere as near, she's also happy af because this is something she's been working towards for a year.   


TL;DR I'm physically injured 7 months ago, my best friend shared a room with me almost everyday for a year and I've had feelings for her for so long. Since the injury she's been my saving grace, and she just moved out, I don't know how to cope with my days now, nothing I watch/do helps break that weird empty feeling",13Nov2018,1

I usually go to town A which is 45 minutes from where I live, but I am going shopping for Christmas presents in a bigger place, town B, which is 1 hr 45 minutes away. I figured I would go to a nail salon in town B to save a trip to town A for just my nails. 

I am nervous to go though, because all of these shops are ran by Korean or Asian people and i’m not nervous because of that fact itself, but I have a hard time understanding accents sometimes, especially when I get nervous anyway. I’m nervous that they may say something or ask me a question and I won’t know what they said and I’ll have to ask them to repeat what they said. And i don’t want them to think I’m rude or something or being a certain way.

492,"I’m a college freshman living in a dorm. My roommate and I have gotten along so far and she’s really nice. However, lately she’s been on FaceTime with her boyfriend almost constantly. It’s every day, multiple times a day.

For example, on Saturday I woke up at 11 and she was on FaceTime until I left the room at 12 to go to the library. I stay at the library for 6 hours and come back to relax. She’s still on the phone for another hour and hangs up to get dinner. I think that finally she is done but no, she calls him again at 7:30 and is on the phone until 2 am. Most days are not this bad but it is still annoying and multiple times a day. Not to mention she never uses her headphones and talks really loudly. 

I have ADD so naturally I have a really hard time focusing. I don’t expect the room to be silent and I don’t expect her to be silent all the time so I can do my work. I spend most of my time outside of the room so she can do whatever she wants and be as loud as she wants when I’m gone. However, sometimes I’m tired or it’s really late so I want to spend an hour or two doing work. 

I get where she’s coming from. I have a long distance boyfriend too and it’s hard, but when I call him I call him when my roommate is in class or doing something outside. 

I’m an introvert and I just want some peace and quiet sometimes. I feel like I have a third roommate. I’m going crazy. I know I can’t ask her to stop FaceTiming because that’s really unreasonable. I don’t know how to take care of the issue because I feel rude asking her to talk to her boyfriend that she misses less so I can focus.

Now we live together (we go to the same university now) and Jesus Christ I can’t stand it sometimes. 
Everyone’s getting to their wits end with PJ and he just isn’t stopping, constantly needing to be the centre of attention. He can’t ever just have a normal day, every single day something has to go wrong in their life.
Before you say it, I’m not an insensitive asshole, I understand that he probably has something wrong mentally, but so do I (and most people for that matter), and I’m not an asshole. Also, it’s painfully obvious that they’re just copying what they see other people doing to try and make people think there’s something wrong.

I want to say to you my feelings and worries about career. First of all I should better give a little information to you about myself. If someone would asked to me how I see myself then I would reply that with I am curious and questioning but not talented guy. As you can estimate that I am also anxious and highly considering about my future. I am from Turkey and 21 years old. To me the country made me like that. The economic distress, political corruption, currency of ignorance among the crowd, religious distortion and its effectiveness, ready to explode people, injustice... The last one is the most frustrating to me but I guess it is same for all of us. I am a veterinary ""student"" in here who does not want to spend his one and only life. I would want to give my all strength to make my people and country proud. I wish there was a sole problem so I could make myself strong for to face it bravely. Sadly, ignorance is about scary rates in here. I am asking myself what I am trying for? For my family? people? country?! The government takes my tax and gives it to their neighborhood and then rename a part of it as ""scholarship credit"" and return it to me. They don't even look at the documents of families to agree for who needs it. I have a twin and he is also in university (further veterinarian) so it takes an economical pressure on us. We are under the limit of poverty by official report. I and my twin also separately live in another town and I am far away to them. I barely see my family because it is expensive to go and return in total. At the same time I saw that the rich president says that for students ""Don't get used to free, don't take scholarship instead of credit"" Can you believe? Even the president obviously wants to debit the future of a country. Just before they also strengthened the budget of presidency of religious affairs which is totally USELESS. I ask you now why should I give my utility to something that doesn't care of me? Is the duty that they did for me to give vital rights enough? Does it make me a payer to my country? If I am then I am also a debtor for any country they imported from. They take my tax and import food, technology, health etc. Not my country gave it I bought it. If not then the imported country gave me so my debt is on the country they imported. I am not nationalist therefore I will give my all handiness to the ones that care me. I am not born in Turkey but I just born in somewhere of world. I am a seed of world as like the others. When I left this sick country I will never feel like I am owing to it. I was fulfilled so to feel discharged I thought I better write. Thanks for anyone that read.

A while ago, my friend showed my whole friend group and I, his reddit account, telling me how he frequents certain subreddits and he was just showing me his comments. About a month later, I remembered his username and looked it up to see if he posted anything else that was funny. Instead, I found him talking shit about our friend group. So then, every few weeks, I'd check his feed to see if he left any funny comments or talked shit about me, and I was thinking how it could help me avoid to do things he was talking about ( like if he complained about me doing something that bothered him, I could try my best to stop doing it). Recently though, he moved away and I checked his account out curiosity, then found he was talking even more crap about my friend and I. Now, thinking back, I feel pretty guilty about doing so because its his account and all, but at the same time, he showed me his account and there's literally no other way I would have found it, since the username is so random.

I'm not comfortable with the grades that I am getting and I'm uncertain if I am going to be able to move forward in the program, though my grades are still close.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about what options I have if I don't make it through. I've considered different jobs in the workforce, IT, government jobs etc. But I just cannot figure out what I want to do. Something satisfying, being paid well is great, but not a priority. A big factor in all of this is my student loan debt which I have racked up over 5 years now with nothing to show for it. I know that I don't want to waste anymore time or money racking up a mountain debt at a university, just to not make the cut or even graduate with a degree. That is why I am posting this asking for advice, anything advice that is given is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned above I am currently in a 4 baccalaureate BSN to RN nursing program. I have always been interested in the medical field and enjoy what I am currently learning and doing in my classes. I also have a passion for technology. Before I entered the nursing program, I was in an IT degree program and I have always been that guy that people come to when they have computer questions or problems. 

I'm open to all suggestions and advice.",13Nov2018,1

She made some comment in which she called herself ""a proud trashbag.""

I said that, it's not mentally healthy to call yourself a trash bag.

She went ahead and claimed it's a ""positive Australian word"" and cited urban dictionary: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Trashbag

That term has the following tags on there:

514,"I am a 26 year old SAHM to two boys (6 and 2) and have been together with my husband for 10 years. He has a brother, who is now 14, I've known him since he was just 4 years old. When I first met him he didnt talk much. He would ask us to play Monopoly or some other board games and just answer questions with one word answers. I thought he just had a shy personality. My husband lived in the same home as his brother and mother until I got pregnant. He moved out when his brother was 8 years old. My husband was pretty much the only father figure my BIL had and so they both took it tough. I was very optimistic about his brother staying with us a few nights a week or whenever his mom needed help. I set aside a drawer for him and made sure i kept in contact with my MIL so he could come over. Well that got old really quick because on one end i was expected to care for him but on the other hand I could not discipline him when he left plates sitting around, shoes everywhere, and was generally messy. I will admit i didnt feel like it was up to me to teach him manners and how to clean up after himself and so i brought this up to my husband. I honestly dont remember the conversation but I remember feeling very angry and dismissed. From that point on i didnt want to babysit his brother anymore so i stopped answering phone calls to watch him. My husband would still bring him over on his days off and i would still be forced to clean up after him but that was less days then when i was at home by myself. Keep in mind i was also pregant, constantly vomitting, and emotional. An every weekend visit turned to twice a month and then fizzled out to once every few months. Eventually my husband stopped bringing him over and i do take responsibility in that, because it could have been an easy fix. Whether or not my husabnd or his mother didnt agree with me teaching him commom courtesy, i had the right to do so if he was under my care. We still visited his mother every now and then but then she and i began having problems. She didnt like that my husband was working and providing while i stayed home, she would say rude things like i should be happy she didnt tell my husband to get a paternity test (i have never cheated on my husband or any boyfriend, ever), and always had something to say about my parenting. I started backing off from trying to have a relstionship with his mother and focused on my own family. In those years, my BIL missed school SO much. Each year my MIL was threatened by the school because the absences were excessive and unexcused. My BIL didnt miss school to go out and cause trouble, he missed school to stay home and play video games snd the mom allowed it and would come up with every excuse in the book to justify it. Depite the fact that we were struggling in life ourselves we always tried to talk to him and her but nothing helped. Finally, last year, he stopped going to school all together. He had signed up to start an online school but was removed from the program for excessive absences. In that time we were going through a very difficult time with our second born. We did what we could but we also needed to focus on our sons health. We actually brought my BIL to live with us last year because we knew he was just losing himself in that room, but it was only a week before he called his mom and asked her to come get him. I was feeding him healthy meals (he was very overweight then) and we had rules he had to follow here. It was definitely a big change from what he had at home. When she came to get him i was so angry and told myself that i have done all i could and i just couldn't continue to worry about her son when she refused our many attempts to help. I stopped talking to her for 1 year. One month ago we received the news that my MIL was undergoing treatment for psychosis. My husband and I knew we couldnt allow for his brother to live under those circumstances so we recently moved him in. He is now 14 years old. His mother admits to feeding him nothing but junkfood amd mcdonalds. As a result he is morbidly obese. When he moved in all he had was the clothes off of his back and his computer. When we took him to buy shoes he was wearing 2 sizes too small. So far we have received power of attorney over him and will pursue adoption in the near future. I have gotten him enrolled in online school again and will be here very day to make sure he is actually doing his work (he is set to start at the end of this wek). I took him to the eye doctor since he has been without glasses for 2 years and I have a dentist and doctor's appmnt set up for him also. I hope his insursnce covers therapy because i strongly believe he will benefit from talking to someone. I talk to him a lot and try to get him excited about life but i only get one word responses. His mom nonchalantly tells me that he doesnt talk because she was always his voice and answered for him. I am heartbroken and angry for him but we can only take it day by day and fix what we can. The good thing is on the few occasions that he has played a video game in his room, i can hear him talking to his friends, so at least i know he is capable of having conversations. He has done really well adjusting this time. He still doesnt talk much and only answers in one word answers but he is eating healthy meals and followimg our rules. So now my question is, how do i get the smell to come off of him? There is always a stong odor coming from him even after showers (he showers every night). How do i approach this in a way that doesnt hurt his feelings? Also, he always leaves poop still on the toilet seat every morning when he takes a dump and it just ruins my day. Not only that but he leaves toilet paper full of smeared poop in the trash can that makes you regret walking into the restroom. No one wants to see/smell that. Basically I am hit with awful smells all day and it is really driving me crazy. The smell penetrates into my couches and lingers wherever he walks. Is this something I will just have to accept? I have been around morbidly obese people before and i have never smelled something quite like this. This post is super shallow but if you only smelled the smell that comes from him. I basically have to be peeing myself to use the restroom after he has used it and it takes so much courage to clean the restroom now. I love him and I even though this is not what i pictured for my life, he is doing good here. I just need help on how to address this smell!!!!",13Nov2018,1

Back and forth he runs with his shoes on, crying, throwing hard objects on the floor over and over, scraping chairs across the floor, and seems to spend all hours between 8am-10pm right over our bedroom. As far as I can tell he isn’t in any kind of school or daycare, just home all day.

518,"I tried to register for classes next semester but I had a hold on my account. It was labeled as “student misconduct” which usually infers cheating or plagiarism. No explanation, no class it was filed for, no professor explaining it so it’s just weird. I heard sometimes they make mistakes but it’s a rare occurrence. 

Don’t have enough friends to plagiarize (joke), I would never cheat on an exam, and past that I don’t know what happened? The last test I took was about a week ago, and my grades were all submitted so if I cheated then why would they put my grade in and not even talk to me about this?

I never got an email, phone call, or meeting with a professor/student misconduct person accusing me of cheating so to know it was just placed today was startling to say the least. 

I asked what I could even do? I know cheating in college is super serious and I heard that a “she said he said” usually almost always favors the professor. I have to state my case but my case is basically “nope I didn’t do it” which sounds VERY convincing. 

I also asked what were the consequences and they said (from what I interpreted?) that it’s basically a paper saying “I won’t do it again”. They said the absolute worse is suspension but I’m assuming since this is the first “incident” then the likelihood of that happening is lowered. 

I’m kinda freaking out right now, especially the weird circumstances. Everyone tells me usually it’s addressed as to why or the professor address it to you as well. I’m asking so many questions that at this point I might actually look guilty. Especially when I flush when I’m nervous :p

I have no idea what to do honestly. I’m having another meeting eventually with student misconduct but this is making me pretty upset. 

How do I even defend myself? What do I do if I’m falsely accused? I don’t even know the evidence against me so I can’t prepare my own case. Did someone mention something to the professor? 

Basically this sucks a lot.

519,"Ok so I (f16) have known this girl (17) for about 5 years but we’ve really only talked for 2. I’ve liked her for about a year and for the past few months I’ve been crushing hard. We are in all the same lunchtime extracurricular and some after school and we talk a lot during these. She’s also in one of my classes. She’s single and I honestly think she’s so nice, pretty, talented and just all around great and I want to ask her out badly but theirs a few issues. 

1) I’m like 90% sure she likes girls. She goes to pride every year and she owns a few rainbow things and just get that general vibe off of her. We’ve never brought it up in conversation so I don’t really know for sure. She’s definitely not homophobic though. 

2) Im not officially out...
Like most people just sort of know but I’ve never actually confirmed anything to anyone because of family issues. I think she knows I’m a lesbian but I just don’t want to randomly bring it up one day. I want to come out to her casually.  If we did date, I would not be able to tell my family and we couldn’t be too open about it. 

3) I’m really shy (so is she) and she’s older than me and I don’t know how to bring it up.  I feel like I don’t have the confidence to do anything. 

4) Whenever Im around her and her friends I get the feeling that some don’t really like me. Some Im also friends with but I feel like some of them just think I’m small and annoying. (Her family likes me though)

5) I’m also concerned that if we do date and eventually break up, we will still have to talk every lunch and after school. 

6)If we do last, she’s going to graduate soon and is seriously considering going to university away from where we live. 

Honestly I’ve fallen hard and don’t really know what to do.. 
If anybody has any insight or experience like this please let me know!! I genuinely really appreciate her and would love to go out with her. ",13Nov2018,1
520,"Alright reddit, I’ve found myself in a very tricky situation recently and I’m not entirely sure what I need to do. Throw away because my username would give my identity away.

The story starts 7ish years ago. I met this girl, well call her J as I was going through a really rough break up we instantly hit it off and became really fast friends. She was dating one of my friends at the time so we hung out a fair bit and even moved to hanging out on our own because we just had a lot in common. J helped me a lot through what was a really tough time in my life, I had just exited a very mentally abusive relationship and was doing a lot of healing. There were points where I felt hopeless and J was able to bring me back up by just being a good friend.

Well, as it happens life got in the way of our friendship. I started a new job, J transferred colleges, started a new relationship. We just never had time to connect anymore. 

About a year and a half ago I got a text from J saying her and her boyfriend were basically on the end of it and she just needed a friend. I gladly obliged and was happy to return the favor knowing that they did the same for me. Something was different this time tho. I didn’t feel like I was getting the whole story. I would get screenshots of her ex and her arguing but it was always at points where he was yelling at her, and she was just apologizing. I would ask her for the context or politely try to get more info but she would avoid actually giving me details.

The biggest example of this is that one night she called me as I was leaving work and said that she had been abandoned with no car, in the city, by a guy I wasn’t even sure she was still talking to (her ex that I used to be good friends with) and he had gone to tell her most recent ex about something she “wasn’t sure had happened the night prior” because she was so drunk and he was just being malicious and trying to ruin any chances she had of getting back together with him. It was a whole sob story. I picked her up because I wasn’t going to leave her abandoned. Made sure she got something to eat and tried to get her to tell me what happened. She again, skirted around details and wasn’t able to clarify on key details that would give me any context as to what happened.

I drifted out of her life again for some time, I tried to get my distance because I truly did not want the drama in my life. She came back around a couple months ago. At first things were fine. She was again happy with someone. She seemed to be stable and everything seemed to be okay but I was wrong. Again, I get these out of context screenshots that appear to be in the middle of them fighting her telling me she doesn’t know what to do, she loves this guy this time but they keep fighting and she’s not sure how to make it better. He keeps blocking her but then coming back in her words to “tell
Her how shitty of a person she is”. 

The worst part of it all is that this same girl has made threats on her life and I have actually been the only person to call the cops, or her parents and either call her bluff or stop her from doing anything. 2/4 times she’s actually made attempts on her life and if I hadn’t of called she probably would have died. Recently the threats have started coming back and I’m terrified that if I Do stop talking to her she will end up taking her life and that’s a guilt that I can’t bare but at the same time this relationship has been very taxing on me and incredibly one sided other than the beginning of our friendship where she helped me through my break up. 

I don’t really know what to do, or what to say to J to through this. I’m at the point now where I definitely think I need to break it off but I’m still afraid that something might happen.  Lately i feel like I’ve just been her friend so she doesn’t kill herself ",13Nov2018,1
521,"Hi r/Advice

I was fired for failing a random drug test. THC in a non-legal state. HR says zero-tolerance policy (I couldn't find anywhere in the handbook) and that I must be dismissed. This was my first misconduct. My management and team (25-40 y/o guys) were in tears when I left today, some of sadness, others of anger. Nobody wanted to see me go.

This was a great job around specific technology, and I really want THIS job back, as silly as that may sound. I worked/trained/studied hard for this specific job, moved 2 hours away and have been doing this for two years. Yes, every reason not to smoke...I'm dumb and regret isn't a big enough word.

I asked HR about eligibility for rehire. The response as best as I recall was ""*you could be, if you did something like went to a recovery program and say, held a good job for a couple years or something, we could—we can't ever keep you from submitting your resume*"". A pretty vague answer, but it wasn't a 'No'...I refrained from my Dumb &amp; Dumber reference, but I know there is a chance.

I want my job back so badly, even if it takes months, I'll wait (clean up) and do what's needed, but obviously can't wait years. I don't want another job where I won't be held accountable for smoking. I'll submit to any further tests with no complaints.

How can I make this clear to my company? I don't want to be a thorn in their side. I obviously can't pass a drug test today if I was rehired today. I have quit smoking, trashed my stash and gear. I found a local rehab facility that I will call tomorrow morning. I'm mid 30s and just bought my first house out here as a commitment to this company.

I've thought about emailing my CEO + my management (we're a 3,000ish employee company) to let them know I've entered a recovery program, am taking this seriously, inform CEO I have never had anything but praise from co-workers or customers, and 'fight' to get my job back. 

I know that's a big feat, but also know company policies change over time.

Am I out of my league? How should I approach this if I insist on trying? I feel I have nothing to lose, I feel I'd regret moving forward without trying.

I do already have related job offers in the larger cities 2-3 hours away. I could work remote, but I fear I'd end up smoking again if I know I can get away with it. I don't want those jobs.

Thank you for reading so much, I tried to condense.",13Nov2018,1

524,"9 months ago, a really good friend of mine named Paul that I knew for 10 years committed suicide on the 26th of December of 2017. This has made me feel very insecure and almost depressed. He lived 40+ minutes away from me. But the thing is he told me that we will go to Arizona to check out a school there. And we were supposed to hang out on Thursday the 28th. But I have no idea what caused him to take his life. I got the call from his aunt at 11pm on that Tuesday as I was going to bed that he is in the hospital. And my mom came in my room later and told me that his mom told her that he hung himself. I did not talk to face to face or see him that day. But earlier that day he uploaded a Snapchat video of him watching Lord of The Rings on a Macbook Pro with an E-Cigarette in his hand aka a Juul. And the regret I already have is why did I not go to his house that day? That's what is bothering me about my friends death the most. Is that I wish I asked him if he wants to hang out with me on that day. But I had no idea that he was gonna do this because there were no warning signs or I did not get any feelings that he was gonna do this. But he smoked weed alot and I heard later that he took XANAX(anti-anxiety pill) and mixed it with weed and painkillers and meth(my mom told me my friend had a cocktail of drugs in his system). But I am not sure if that was the cause of his death. I asked my Parents and Friends about why do I have such a regret of not reaching out to my friend that day because I wish I reached out to him and ask ""Hey wanna hang out and skate?"" or something? But they keep telling me to not have such regrets and there was no way that I was going to prevent my friends suicide. Why do I keep feeling guilty? I miss my friend. And I wish he was still here physically. But I heard he had depression and he never told me that he actually had depression. I miss my friend and I want him to be physically here again. What do I do? On the Monday(1 day earlier) that I saw him he was completely normal I did not notice anything strange in him his suicide just completely caught me by surprise. The 25th of December of 2017 is the last time I saw my friend. The thing I am trying to figure out is why he would do such a thing and not think about his friends? Cause I miss my friend so much. I wish I talked to him on the day he killed himself but then again I had no idea that he had depression or was planning suicide. But still I can only imagine if he would've been alive if I asked him on text if he wants to hang out. My friends suicide has been tormenting me and I keep asking myself why did he take his own life? I really wish I called him up but my other friend tried to call him but he did not respond to his phone call on the day he killed himself. I have been struggling to focus in class. I keep thinking about him day and night 24/7. The thing I miss the most is hanging out with him and skating. I wish I attempted to call him up that day and it's haunting me. I've been struggling to have a piece of mind because of this. Please help. Any useful advice? I miss my friend. His decision to end his life just completely sent shockwaves through my body. And lately I've just been trapped in this constant loop of why did I not drive to his house that day? The thing is on Snapchat that day me and my friends (including the one who ended his life later that day). We wanted to go go-karting but then one of my other friends said that they were busy. But I said that I am free and my friend(who ended his life later that day). Then said ""If we can't hang out today then let's hang out on thursday."" and I said ok. I thought to myself, ok, we'll see each other on Thursday and then I went to go workout at the beach. But then that phone call came at 11pm and it still haunts me to this day. But the autopsy shows that my friend like how I said before had (XANAX, Painkillers, heavy doses of Weed, and Crystal Meth in his system). I am not sure if that caused a negative reaction and caused him to have negative thoughts and then end his own life. But going back. I wish I would've driven down to his house and hung out with him maybe he would still be alive today I am not sure. I am not a fortune teller. But my friend who ended his life also told me like 4 weeks ago that there are days where he just wants to be by himself. I did not see any warning signs or red flags that this was going to happen. I wish I could talk to him face to face if I only knew he would do something like this. I feel lost and hopeless in my life without my friend. UPDATE 9 MONTHS LATER: I still can't get over this. This continues to haunt me everyday school, at home, and honestly the crappy part about this is that I have to live with this forever until the day that I die. I am having trouble focusing on school assignments because I trusted my friend. We knew each other so well that I did not think that something like this would cross his mind. I feel depressed and hopeless I don't know where I will see myself in life in 5 years. Weekends are not the same for me anymore. My friend lived in a nice place by the beach and he had a motorcycle. Last year things were better compared to now. I hate dealing with this type of mental torture. I sometimes wish I was dead too. I am at cross roads in my life right now. People just don't understand the mental and torturous pain of waking up only to know that your friend isn't here. I still can't accept the fact that he did something like this. The thing that is helping me get through this is YouTube, Twitch, and my other close friends. But I really miss my other friend Paul. People just don't realize how much emotional pain I am in right now. Not gonna lie I've been lately having a more negative view on life because this continues to haunt me it's psychological torture for me. It is a vicious cycle of feeling regret and thinking what warning signs did I miss?

525,"Hello!

So I have this friend and I really care about him but I think he is making poor choices but doesn't see it. I am worried because he thinks he has everything lined up perfectly when in fact myself and his other closest friends see so many holes it is becoming hard for us to hold our tongues. Here is the ""plan""

&amp;#x200B;

So right after high school he decided to not enroll in a 4 year-school but instead a 2 year community college with the hopes that he will finish his associates in one year and then be able to transfer to a 4-year school and finish his bachelors in 2 years. (1 year for associates, 2 years for bachelors = 3 years total for Bachelors.) Our chief concerns are that A) Will a college accept your associates as equal to their core classes? We are concerned that he is putting in the effort to get his associates and it won't get him exempt out of all of the core classes he would need to be exempted out of to finish his bachelors in 2 years.) Concern B) He says he wants to pay $0 for his undergrad. Is that really possible? He is not interested in applying for scholarships and believes the school she chooses will give her a full ride, and that she will be able to pay for it working as a server part time except that he also wants to make $16,000 for a trip. (Next point) C) and the big one - he wants to have a gap year in between his associates and starting at a 4 year school for his bachelors. This wouldn't be bad except that the company he is doing it with is very suspicious. Basically, the participant pays $16,000 and spends 9 months traveling three countries doing ""mission"" work. I put that in quotes because all of us close friends have looked into this company and there is no say of what the ""mission"" work is other than spreading christianity to non- christian countries. To me, there is nothing charitable about pushing your religion on others. According to their finances, less than 5% of the money raised goes to actual aid. This pisses 2 of us off especially because we have been on more than  20 combined. We have traveled the country doing mission work, disaster relief, home repair, feeding and clothing the homeless, all with faith based companies that have more than 70% of funds raised going to the people. We are getting tired of listening to him talk about this great mission work when in reality it is an excuse to travel the world by pretending to help others, all the while comparing shit work to the years of hard work put in by a few of us.

In Conclusion/A summary: We believe that the plan: Go to school for one year, get associates, travel world with a shitty organization (that, fun fact, has been known to hurt communites more than it helps even going so far as to having gotten an orphanage shut down) , finish bachelors in 2 years for free, then go to law school and then work for the UN. We are very concerned for him and would just like to know how we can help. ALSO: He mentioned something about a law that requires colleges to accept your associates as the first two years of school, meaning you start as a junior. Is this true?

527,"(14 year old female) Earlier in the school year, about 6 weeks ago, one of my closest friends (who we’re going to call Abby) blocked me on everything. No explanation, I was just cut off. She would run away from me and yell at me to go away if I ever approached her, and nobody knew why. She’s an open book and can’t keep a secret, but she wouldn’t explain why she turned on me. Two weeks later she posts on her Snapchat a meme that made fun of my best friend and I. I was  told about it and that my best friend’s ex girlfriend made the post, who we’re going to call Sarah. The post was humiliating, and since I deal with an anxiety disorder, I got really upset. I told my mum about it. She was pissed off, and wanted to contact the school, but I told her not to do anything and that it would all blow over. Since I’ve been bullied in the past, she was really worried about me and told Abby’s mum about it. Abby finds out about the message and told everybody about it, claiming that I ruined the reputation of her and Sarah. The message didn’t even mention Sarah, Abby’s mum is the one who told my mum that Sarah was even involved. I didn’t know anything came of it, because in my opinion it wasn’t a big deal. I didn’t agree with my mum, but she had good intentions and I really didn’t think anything would happen. The next day another girl, who we will call Tasha, made a post about me on her Snapchat. She didn’t use my name, but she said that I was the bully in the first place. I was so confused at first, and didn’t even realize it was about me because it didn’t make sense. There was a bunch of other nonsense in there, but since I didn’t tell anybody about what happened, nobody figured out it was me. The next school day, I’m blown up with messages from Tasha. She said that I ruined the reputations of Sarah and Abby and that they were crying about it. She said awful stuff about me. Every class change I got a new message, and it was terrible. Tasha didn’t even know what she was talking about, she wasn’t involved in anything. Tasha is kind of a “nobody” and only has a few friends, so I’m guessing she did this for attention. I explain my story and I’m really mature about it. In the middle of us going back and forth, I could tell that she knew that I was innocent after all because she kept on repeating the same thing over and over. For the next month, none of the girls talked to me, looked away if I made eye contact, and ran away if I got too close. Around this time, I got invited to the same party as Sarah. I decided to text her and ask how everything was, and she told me how bad she felt. I forgave her and was really happy about it. The next day, I tell Tasha about it at lunch. She immediately gets up and sits with other people, then blocks me on everything. I decided enough was enough. I create a google docs (the only platform I wasn’t blocked on) and send it to Tasha and Abby. It was one sentence, and said “I’m done with this tbh can we please move on.” Right after I sent it, Sarah told me that they wanted to report me for “bothering them.” Then I asked our mutual friends if they knew what happened, and apparently Tasha told everybody. And that’s where I’m at now. A bunch of girls dislike me, I lost a few of friends, and my reputation is ruined. Advice? ",13Nov2018,1

I hate my job. Never got a degree, I just sort of fell into this job, lucked out and had a decent interview in 2005 before the whole LinkedIn, FB social media shitstorm.

Got married, a kid, needed a steady w benifits so here I am now for a while at video post for a major ntwrk for 12 yrs. Sitting in front of a computer checking vid files for accurate metadata and it is fucking mind-numbingly abysmal. Dont even mention the droning meetings 2x wk. Company going through major layoff/relocation changes so lateral moves are thin and tbh I don't want to stay here much longer, this company isn't what it used to be. It's actually the complete opposite of what it used to be and ppl fucking hate it now. I hate it. They moved us to a new pldng and its awful. The culture is cold, weird and frankly I hate the industry, I don't even watch much TV or movies. Love working with tools, though, am handy, and of course, music. Rather be on my feet moving about as opposed to sitting down 8+ daily under heavy scrutiny microscopically looking at some shit I dont even care about, or at times, loathe. What are some college degrees/certifications that might fit my work style where I can make a decent ($65k+/yr) living for the next 15 years?

530,"I reached out to my ex (6 year relationship)to reconcile due to our break up. When we broke up we were both in a bad spot mentally. 
We broke up Aug 8th or 9th so it has been 3 months since we spoke. We both apologized for how the break up went since it was not very friendly. 
I am a very codependent person and I originally just messaged him because I am on step 8 of CoDA program ( make amends with the people you have hurt). But we ended up talking more and it lead to us agreeing to be friends now and meeting tomorrow. 

I am not sure how this will go or what the expectations are. Should I be more distant and cautious or should I be like I used to be when we would greet each other (hug)?

531,"I (26M) am trying to decide if I should tell my girlfriend how much money I have. My grandmother left me around 1 million dollars, that I have access to now, not inheritance I will get in the future. I do not spend that much of it and from the outside you wouldn’t guess that I have a decent amount of savings. I wear no jewelry or watch and my clothes are very modest and not expensive. I have a normal modest car and spend about 1500 a month.

I recently underwent a major surgery and am in graduate school, so I do not have a job at the moment. My GF and I are about to move in together and I feel like if she knew how much money I had it would make many things simpler. If she knew she wouldn’t have to wonder why I am able to not have a job, but still afford to buy things and pay for rent during this period. She definitely has an idea that I have some savings, but would be VERY surprised if she knew the true extent. I have encountered some awkward things related to money. E.G. I just bought a new car and her mom asked me if I was making payments (not appropriate of her tbh). I didn’t lie and said no, I just bought it. So she knows I have access to some money, as I paid cash for a new car (not an expensive one)

Furthermore, I am interested in buying a house in the next few years and when I discuss this with her it feels irresponsible since I don’t even have an income at the moment. But in reality a house costing 150K would not be out of reach for me/us whenever we want to make that move. Money it tricky subject, but in my family we openly discuss it. I know how much money my mom has and my grandmother and since college I have known exactly how much I have in my account. My GF’s family is different, her father recently left her mother and was not honest about his spending. This is partly why I want to tell her, since her father was so dishonest I want to be an open book for her.

My siblings ran into trouble lending money to their ex-partners and I know it can change things in a relationship. This is mainly what worries me, that she will think differently of me in a bad way. This is the love of my life and I want to marry her, so this isn’t some casual GF I am considering disclosing this to. I just feel like I don’t want to keep secrets from my GF and I wouldn’t feel awkward about certain things if she just knew the truth. However, I don’t want her to think I am made of money. She is the LAST person who would take advantage of me, or anyone for that matter, and is one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. I think she would be happily surprised if she knew. 

Am I crazy? Is this going to change the way she thinks about me forever? Is this a bad idea? Help?!

532,"So I was with a girl for overall 5 years my only long term girlfriend and I can honestly say my first and only true love of so far. She left me about 4 years ago clearly for another guy although she didn't admit it at the time and sorta of left me in a mess emotional and finacially.

 I was bitter for years about it but since have grown and matured. I've been in a few awful relationships since her which has taught me how good she was to me when it was good. I feel no bad feelings for her anymore she's still with the guy she left me for and I sort of feel a good for you if he makes you happy vibe. We live in a small town so I walk past her often and I often drink at the bar she works at and after all these years she still blanks me and is noticeably awkward which I feel is a shame.

She gave me some of my best memories and I wish she could at least be civil. I was thinking of messaging her and clearing the air saying she shouldn't feel awkward and I'm happy for her. Is this weird ? Bad idea ? It's been on my mind a while so any advice will be appreciated. ",13Nov2018,1

534,"Hi there,

I’m 24(m) and I recently found myself in a pretty terrible spot, my fiancé and I no longer have a place to live. Debt is starting to become a problem, and I’ve been out of work most of my life due to multiple mental illnesses (including bipolar disorder, OCD, clinical depression, and multiple anxiety disorders.) I also have physical issues as well.

We essentially become homeless on the 6th of the new year. My credit is actually being torn down by a large balance on a credit card in my parents name. (It was supposed to be an emergency card I was on for that benefit. Not that I ever used it.) 

While I have multiple “skills”, my illnesses make it impossible to live a scheduled life. Which basically makes me unemployable. I can program extremely well, but I have to use macros because my motor functions can’t keep up. (I do a lot of side work for local businesses and such. As well as some online work.)

The only other area that has seemed to work for me was driving, (Lyft, Uber) I like people, and most seem to like me a lot. I usually do very well - but my current vehicle is no longer acceptable. (Not worth the mechanical cost to get it up to grade.)

My fiancé is a full time student and definitely cannot handle the financial load. It’s also not as though I’ve done nothing this entire time, I know how to make money usually - even without holding a steady job I’ve been keeping us afloat. I even started a business, which my parents promptly took control of. I still own 51%, but that doesn’t mean anything as the “manager” has control of the company. (This provides me no new income, as they keep spending more money.)

We currently live with my parents, who no longer want us around. Which is understandable considering my conditions, they didn’t ask for me to be like this. However the more I look back, the more I realize that the situation wasn’t a fair one to begin with. ($800 a month for an 800sqft basement, with a bathroom but no kitchen and one bedroom.)

536,"Our family has been dealing off and on with a young adult that desperately needs help but refuses all attempts to help him. He refuses to work and is convinced that it’s ok to smoke pot and play video games all day as a career. He makes zero dollars an hour doing that. He does not keep a regular sleep schedule and gets very strange after being awake for 36+ hours (which is probably normal).  

He has been asked to leave 5 different family members homes including mine because of his erratic and nonsensical behavior. His longest stint was with me and that was 17 months. during that time I helped him get a job that he kept for a year but quit abruptly because he “didn’t want to work anymore.”  I was on several medications for anxiety and blood pressure by the time I asked him to leave. I asked him to leave after a month of hell culminating with him telling me he was just using me for internet and then dumping water on the living room carpet while staring me down. 

If you disagree with him about anything, even during a normal conversation about a tv show or whatever, he will become furious and yell or shut down and completely refuse to interact. He isn’t violent but he constantly claims he is going to kill himself and then acts normal and says he’s fine when the police are called. 

He has seen doctors in the past for psychiatric care but gets angry with them and stops seeing them and stops taking medication after they refuse to give him medical marijuana. 

It is literally a full time job to look after him. He is fully capable of caring for himself but he is unwilling. None of us want to see him end up homeless or worse, but he is unwilling to do ANYTHING. 

We all want to help him but we have no idea what else we can do other than keep caving in. He’s currently at the last home available to him and the elderly relatives he’s living with are certainly not equipped to deal with him. 

I understand that he will not seek help until he’s ready, but is there any way we can “force” him to get help? The police have stated that they can’t do anything unless they hear him threatening to or witness him attempting to harm himself or others. Which he has not done.

Is there anything more we can do?  Would an intervention be worth trying?  Are there resources out there that assist with things like this?",13Nov2018,1

Before the bachelor party, the best man sent multiple messages to everyone saying how he wants everyone to give him $50 so he could give it to the groom during the bachelor party.

A couple of weeks after the bachelor party, I get a text from the groom asking if the best man asked me for money.

The groom asked me not to say anything and that he would figure out how to deal with it.

Anyway, it's the fish-lens camera that's broken and not the regular one so it's not the worst thing in the world, but I'm not really sure what to do about it. The reason I'm on r/Advice is because;

&amp;#x200B;

1) Should I try to fix it. If so, how?

2) Should I tell my mom or wait until she inevitably notices and beats my ass for ""breaking my phone""

3) Can it get worse if I don't do something about it?

558,"Hey guys hoping you can help me cause I’m seriously stressing out and I posted this in another sub and people were trying to tell me I’m guilty of rape.

Last night was my boyfriends birthday and this woman that I bartender with also moonlights as an escort.

I hired her to have a threesome with my BF for his birthday which I thought he would really enjoy.

He is extremely pissed at me for it in general but also cause how I went about it.

I blindfolded him and tied him to the bed like we have done before. 

Me and this other girl took turns performing sexual acts on him. After he “finished” (which was like only a minute BTW), I toke off his blindfold and showed him the surprise.

When he realized that another girl had been taking turns having sex with him he began screaming like a little frickin girl and demanded that I untie him inordinately.

He just grabbed his shit and left our apartment and aside from one text saying that he needs space, I haven’t heard at all from him.

People are trying to tell me I raped him and being all dramatic.

Is there actually a chance that I could get in trouble for this? Even if i could its two women’s word against one right? He couldn’t prove it wasn’t consensual is what I’m thinking right

559,"I think at some point in my life, I started administrating my feelings in the wrong way. When I am under stress, I want to cry but nothing comes out of my eyes. If I am really upset (after an argument, for example), I feel all the emotions running through my veins and body to end up in my stomach. 
Maybe I am doing something wrong, like focusing my mind in other thoughts or scrolling through Reddit when things go wrong. 

I just feel the emotions should go to mi brain and out with my tears, but my brain feels “flat” and my “tears machine” is not working properly. Do you think I should try to focus on something or change my habits in order to cry? I don’t like feeling like this.

560,"I'm 22 and so is my boyfriend. We've been together for a year now. His abusive ex actually has nothing to do with him now, but somehow it still bothers me. Back when my boyfriend and I  were friends, it was actually amusing to hear his ex fight him over the stupidest shit. But yeah that wasn't cool. Possessiveness, extreme jealousy and self-harm threats were involved.

They were together for 3 years. My boyfriend was 17-18. Well, what's happened happened.

But... I don't have any self-control, so sometimes I check up on the abusive ex's tweets. It's very amusing. She will go on private for a few days and go back on public. She'll delete tweets that doesn't get likes, she never shuts up about chicken nuggets and never stops retweeting shit like ""THE PAST ISN'T ME!!!"" which is funny because she never really apologized for any of the shit she did. She also never passes the opportunity to talk shit about my boyfriend's zodiac sign. I think nothing about her has changed at all.

You can see I'm kinda judgemental. 

I don't check up on her everyday but if I already know so much about her uh, ""personality"" then I should be more concerned about myself. If I hadn't known she was like this... culmination of everything I disliked in a person, I would never have hated her in the first place. Wtf is wrong with me?

Really, I'm trying to focus all my energy into my personal goals and everything positive. Although I can't help but have this petty side. I wouldn't go so far as to actually bother her though. I've never hated on ANY of my ex's exes. I actually just dislike her for being... Her. Kinda get the feeling that she's still not over my boyfriend but it's whatever.

563,"Throwaway account out of embarrassment, I guess

&amp;#x200B;

First off, some details that might be important - I'm a man and just a couple months from turning 21. There are two hair stylists relevant to the story. I'll call them Mary and Sarah for simplicity (fake names)

&amp;#x200B;

There's this haircut place geared specifically towards men that I regularly go to and have visited for a few years now. Today, I was getting a cut and some colour in my hair (for the first time, coincidentally) from the same stylist I've been visiting for about a year now, Mary. Everything she did was fine - but the stylist at the station next to us, Sarah, is another story

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah regularly walked over to me while work was being done on my hair and talking. At first, it was just general chat. Then it started to get a little weird, asking some personal questions like ""Are you old enough to drink? Do you smoke? Do you do drugs?"" I was fine answering all those, but then the big one. ""Are you a virgin?""

&amp;#x200B;

And that just made me really uncomfortable. I could tell Mary was a bit surprised too, but as I understand, this sort of thing isn't too uncommon for Sarah. But obviously, my discomfort wasn't very obvious. Over the period of the session (which lasted about an hour and a half total), Sarah would continue to come over to the station, place her hand on my shoulder and sort of rub me. She continued to ask if I was a virgin even though Mary was obviously trying to get her away and I kept refusing to answer. I tried to play it cool, I guess, saying in a joking tone how some questions just go too far. Which was probably dumb. Should've just mentioned I wanted her to stop

&amp;#x200B;

But somehow, it just kept escalating. Sarah made jokes about masturbation, shook her breasts multiple times and squeezed them, intentionally pressed them against the back of my head. I just wanted to get out of there by that point, because it registered by then that for the first time in my life, I felt like I was being sexually harassed. Sarah did apologize a few times ""if you don't like it"", and again, I stupidly told her it was fine even though I really wasn't fine with it. Sarah also mentioned that I must be ok with it since I was laughing - she obviously isn't familiar with the concept of nervous/uncomfortable laughter

&amp;#x200B;

When I was finished and paying, I briefly talked to Mary and told her basically ""Hey, you don't have to say anything about me - I'd honestly rather you didn't, but that wasn't ok."" I mentioned how if a man were acting like that to a woman, I'm sure no one would be fine with it, and I told her basically how I felt as I'm describing here. I was relieved to hear her say she felt really awkward while all that was going on too, and she'll talk to Sarah about it

&amp;#x200B;

So anyways, I guess what I need advice on is.... what should I do? I don't know, I feel like I should call a manager or something, or leave something on their website. Maybe other guys are ok with a stylist being that promiscuous and touchy-feely with them, but I was not ok with it, and I was so uncomfortable that I just couldn't say anything about it, even if I felt like I really should have. It's been a good 5 hours, and I'm still fairly shaken from that whole experience. I'm really tempted just to forget about it and find a new place to get my haircuts, as much as I like Mary

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah. Sorry if that's a bit messy, but my thoughts are disorganized right now. Thanks for reading, and I appreciate input",13Nov2018,1
564,"My oldest brother is lonely. He has a good job, but has struggled with intimate relationships ever since I can remember.  I think it's safe to say he'll never have a wife or children and I think that deeply hurts him because it's something he's always wanted.  At the core, he is a very sweet person, but he does have anger problems.  It is extremely scary to be around him if you ever upset him, and after fearing for my safety a few times, I will admit I have stepped back a little bit. His old therapist ghosted him, and my family and I don't know why. We don't know if she was extremely unprofessional and the one to blame, or if he really is just impossible to help. I remember when I was younger, my Mom would encourage him to get help or improve himself and he would just scream at her and say the world/women should accept him who he is. I hate to say this, but it almost reminds me of incel type of behavior. I will say that he has always been good about trying to stay positive, though. He has a new therapist (who went to vacation for 5 weeks..), is always going out with a few of his friends/going to new places/trying new things. I can tell he is trying to get better.

&amp;#x200B;

He comes over **every** Sunday to my Mom and I's apartment to do his laundry. (He lives alone in an apartment, but his complex uses shitty coin op machines that don't work well, so he visits us every Sunday).  

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the problem:  I'm extremely busy and introverted. I work a customer service job that requires me to wear a retail mask that absolutely drains me by the end of the day. On top of this, I'm a full-time student.  I go home to be alone and escape, and honestly, seeing him on Sundays isn't something ingrained into my schedule like it is for him. Sometimes I'm home on Sundays, sometimes I'm working, sometimes I'm at my boyfriend's house.  He'll come over and do his laundry regardless if my Mom and I aren't there (he has a key), but it seems now that he expects my Mom and I to be at our house every Sunday, and then gets worried and nosy about where we are if we aren't there. This past Sunday, I opened and I was off at 3. I went to my boyfriend's house and spent the night for a few days because Monday was a holiday and I didn't have school. The first text I receive from my brother is ""Everything ok? Didnt see u at home or at work?"" This part already annoys me. My older brother will go INTO MY WORKPLACE LOOKING FOR ME IF I AM NOT AT HOME. I want to say this is like the third or fifth time. I am 27, you guys. I honestly find this behavior creepy and strange. This already annoyed me, so I ignored it and figured I would reply to it the next day. Lo and behold, I wake up to another text from him ""Hey, where u at?"" I said ""I'm at (boyfriends name) house. You don't need to freak out and look for me."" He responds ""Lol ok. I figured you went there""  Ok...? So why are you having to ask me a second time where I am?

&amp;#x200B;

He then sends me another random text about our brother, I send a reply. Then he sends me another text about how I should check my car and be careful because he saw power steering fluid in the garage. I send him another reply telling him it's probably Mom's car. THEN HE TEXTS ME ""Just had my teeth cleaned, that was the quickest cleaning ever had. Felt like she was just going through the motions."" I didn't know what to say to that and felt so smothered that I just ignored that one.  He sends me another photo on Facebook messenger later that night. I look at it, but don't reply, hoping that he'll kind of get the hint that I'm feeling bombarded.

&amp;#x200B;

Today there was a big accident on our highway. A big rig hit 15 cars. I receive a text from him to me and my Mom in a group chat ""Hey r u guys ok!? there was a big accident"", then sends me something else on Facebook messenger thirty minutes later.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a big jerk for feeling so angry about this because it's obvious my brother is lonely. I cry about it. I want him to get better and I have lot of guilt because I'm afraid that if I don't constantly let him cling/clutch/let him into every aspect of my life he'll get depressed and kill himself or other people. But at the same time, he needs to understand that I'm an adult and pretty soon I'll be moving out of my Mom's house and with my boyfriend....

&amp;#x200B;

How do I tell my brother that I'm feeling smothered and I have my own life? I need to tell him soon that there is going to be a time where I'll be moving out of Mom's and that it's going to become normal to not see or hear from me as much. I understand he's worried, but I'm almost 30 and keeping tabs on me is not only annoying, but inappropriate. I wish I lived far away sometimes so he could just leave me alone. I feel horrible saying this.",13Nov2018,1
565,"I work in the professional services sector. Surveying sector specifically.

I work in a department of 8 people im a company of several hundred - and am about middle high tier rank in the firm. A trusted pair of hands and well known for that in the company.

This year I am massively punching above my profit targets, outperforming my managers to an extent it could be seen as embarrassing for them potentially if I keep going at this pace to the year end.

Anway, a new line of work came in on Friday last week and no one was around to deal with it. Our team head sent an email to everyone in the team instructing someone, anyone, responds immediately. I was at work so I took the call and got on with it.

I followed up the call with an email thanking the new client aand saying we shall get back to them in due course. Normal protocol.

Following my email, one of my senior colleagues who was copied into my email to the new client then replied but only our team head really bitching about me. He said he is very annoyed about me cherry picking the ""good"" work. I ask for his advice too often, I.e. suggesting I don't know what I am doing at work, and then saying I'll no doubt be in touch for his advice on this job and take all the credit and that I've got a dreadful attitude. He criticised me for something I had not even done - that I might do it. I have taken up about an hour or two of this guys time in the last year with general advice (we are a team we bat ideas around - or so I thought!) so I don't really know what his problem is.

In my view this is all complete bs and he possibly just see's me as a threat now as I'm making lots more money than everyone else in our team for the company and am much more junior than these two guys. I also don't have support staff helping me like they do.

Here is the curve ball! My head of team and line manager then forwarded this bitching email to a client of ours!! I can only assume this was an accident as there is no reason to really do this and they're not even friends. And it's definitely not something they'd want to leak to a client - in-house moaning.

I am fairly friendly with the client so he forwarded it into me. 

My two colleagues do not know I received this.

Now I thought I had a good relationship with this colleague who was bitching about me - clearly I do not! This I have learnt.

I have worked at this company nearly 8 years and like it here but this has really surprised and upset me a bit that this childish shit is going on. 

My two managers are respectable people in the company it's surprising behaviour.

But I'd been keen to get people's advive and opinions on what I should do now. Knowing this does give me some sort of upper hand. I'm just not sure what - or if I should confront them about it? 

I work in a small industry where everyone knows each other really. ",13Nov2018,1

Few days ago I sent an anonymous message through an college instagram to my crush, on the message I said something similar to ""I think you're very pretty"".

Thing is, my crush got curious about who sent the message, obviously. And asked to know who sent it, I was a bit insecure about that but I decided to allow the instagram owner to share my instagram username.

My crush followed me on instagram later that night ( I think they did it because my account is closed and I don't have a display picture ), and I followed back... but it's  been two days since that and I was hoping they would drop a message at least but I got nothing.

So here i am. Should I start an conversation with them? Or the fact that they didnt message me is an sign of no interest therefore i shouldnt get in touch?
I mean, they know what I think about them so if they had any interest they should be the ones to get in touch,  no?.

Because he is not following the process the company is asking him to, he got sent an email from his boss saying if he doesn't work on the issue and try to fix it, then he will face consequences leading up to termination. His position is paid $75K a year. 

Since he got this email he panicked like crazy, and started talking to people and looking for another job. He didn't focus on fixing his mistakes. He applied for two different positions with company B; one position is paid about $50K a year, and another is paid $35K. What he is doing right now (his current job) is basically a combination of these two positions. He interviewed for the position that pays $50K, and interview went great, but today he got a phone call and offered a position that pays $35K. Now he wants to leave his job that pays $75K a year, and do one that pays $35K, and it same type of work, and same job duties with the exception of only ONE (one single difference). 

I have advised him to work on his problems, and prove to his current company he can do the job, but he's been with them for 10 years, and is sick and tired of them I guess and doesn't want to be part of it anymore. He lost his patience with them. I, however, have been helping him out for the past two weeks and tried to show him the ways to be effective and make his day easy by following certain procedures. I taught/showed him how to fix his issues that he's having, and he did start working on it. I know he CAN do it, but not sure if he wants to. 

I want him to improve and stay with his current company and have a decent conversation with his boss about the whole thing and I want him to admit to his boss that he did make mistakes, and would be willing to work on them and improve. He just wants to drop everything and go and work/do the same job for a different company for half the money. Is he being crazy? $40K difference a year is a huuuuuge difference, and I am not comfortable with him taking this offer. Even if he gets fired from his job, he can always get this $35K a year position in his line of work. Am I being unreasonable? I don't know what to think anymore...

573,"I have a problem. I'm in my second year in university and next year I'll be spending a year in industry to get experience before finishing my degree in my fourth year. I live in a student house with three friends, but I don't actually live that far away from home (this is mainly to gain experience living independently). 

My mother (60 years old) has chronic back pain and arthritis, its pretty bad, she struggles to walk around shops to the point where she no longer feels safe shopping on her own. I make sure I visit her every weekend or fortnight, depending how busy I am. 

Part of me wants to go out and experience true independence, get a job somewhere further away (I live in Wales but might like to go work somewhere in England). However, another part of me worries about my mother, I know she gets lonely and I feel like its my responsibility to be there for her. 

I have two maternal half brothers, one lives around the corner from her but he has a family with a second baby on the way. My other brother lives an hour away and works in the capital city (Cardiff). My dad spends a lot of time out of the house, while my mother mostly stays home. They don't get along brilliantly, my mother has been to see a solicitor regarding getting a divorce three times, but she always gets scared that she'll be alone and without a stable income. 

By the way, my mother isn't a total cripple, she is very independent. The house work, looking after the dog, cooking, looking after my nephew (three years old) and working a 9 to 5 desk job two days a week are all things she still does. 

Financially speaking, its way more beneficial to get a job near home and not have to pay rent. My mother also told me she was looking up ways to kill herself a few months back... then immediately told me to forget she said that. She used to take anti-depressants but stopped because she felt that it would encourage her to 'change the things that actually make her sad'.  It really upsets me, this is the woman that raised me and she's alone. 

Part of me thinks that she would want me to go and do what I want, but every time I see her I'm asked if I found a job nearby. The more I think about it, the more I feel the only real benefit to going far away is to get better experience with bigger companies.

574,"My grandma has been awfully depressed lately, saying things like how she’s waiting to die. Naturally no one in my family likes hearing stuff like this.

My 85 year old grandma (mom’s side) lives alone in a seniors only apartment complex down the street from my mom who works full tim. My brother and I are out of the house, but in the same city, attending grad school and college respectively. All of us try to visit grandma when we can, my brother and I probably 1 or 2 times a week. My mom probably maybe 3 or 4 times a week. My uncle also probably visits 1 or 2 times a week.

So even though we all try to see her, I get the sense that she’s lonely, depressed, and feeling very much like a burden on the rest of the family. 

I think that it would be beneficial for my grandmother to get a cat (not a kitten, but an old calm cat who does nothing but nap and cuddle). My grandmother used to take care of our family bird, but the bird passed away earlier this year. I am the only one in my family who thinks that this would be a good idea. My grandma says that she doesn’t want to be of trouble and she doesn’t think that she could take care of something like a cat. My mom, brother, and uncle agree, but do not suggest any other ideas. I’m the youngest of the family so it’s always seemed like the rest of them don’t take me seriously. As if everyone just skirts around the subject that grandma needs help because they’re too afraid to talk about her age and the topic of death on a whole.

But I really think that she could take care of an easy going cat, with a little help from the rest of us in the family of course. In addition to using senior-friendly litter box cleaning tools, and working with a pet shelter to find a cat that is easy to care for and doesn’t have any health issues, I think a cat could really be a viable solution to helping my grandma feel less lonely, depressed, and also give her a sense of purpose for her golden years.

What do I do? How can I make the rest of my family see it the way I do? Should I drop it? 

I’m only trying to help when it feels that no one else is. But I also don’t want to force my grandma to care for something she doesn’t want to, but I believe given time it’ll have a long term benefit.",13Nov2018,1

Essentially we broke up 6 months ago. Together 4 years.

He said to me ‘we need to talk’ so I suggested that he picked me end so we could drive somewhere.

He picked me up and parked next to a park on my street. He said it isn’t working and can’t ‘do this anymore.’ He blamed me for his university work quality going down hill (he had only seen me twice in 2 weeks) so I don’t understand how they would have been my fault. He basically broke up with me because he felt like he was living ‘2 separate lives’ with me being one of them and his friends and family being the other. We sat in silence for a few minutes before I said I was leaving, I remember my parting words were ‘I don’t know how I’ll get through this, but I will,’ to which he didn’t respond and I walked home. He hasn’t contacted me since.

I tried so hard to get on with his family but they were always so rude to me or ignored me…and he was never able to relies that and just decided that it was my fault they acted that way. His friends I found were not the nicest of people (bitched about people loudly while the person is a few feet away etc) and his best mate from uni openly said to me ‘he wasn’t taking any friendship applications as I already have an army behind me,’ which I found quite repulsive. All in all they were not really my type of people, but I was still polite. He started to be with them all the time and never invited me or tell me what happened. But I still stuck around.

Heya reddit,

Thought this would be the most appropriate place to post as the people in my life have problematic attitudes towards mens mental health.
I'm a girl, I've been assaulted and raped by a few men but I'm over it and open about my experiences with my mates. One of my male friends confided in me about being raped by two other older boys as a younger child (cocsa). He didn't believe this was rape bc ""boys can't get raped"" and when i convinced him it actually was, he broke down and this started a spinal of bad mental health.
I'd pulled him a few times at parties, and had sex with him in the summer although it deffo wasn't good sex. I don't have any feelings towards him, but in part because of this, I feel responsible for his mental wellbeing and checking up. 
He's seeing a counselor, whos referring him to a doctor and specialized therapy which is difficult because alot of r*pe resources are female centered (ik bc i've been to them lmao). He said he had PTSD and i got annoyed by this because my diagnosis and medication i need was so difficult to get so self diagnosing bothers me alot.
Our friends don't like him, they basically bully him. But they keep bullying him because his reactions are so extreme and edgelordy, which obviously makes the bullying worse. Despite feeling partly responsible and empathetic seeing him suffering, I've also started to dislike him 
However, I want to stop the bullying a bit because I don't want him to harm himself or make his mental health worse while he's vulnerable. I don't know how to go about this without ""outing"" his trauma. In particular, they keep calling him gay, and because they don't know about him being r*ped, I can tell its really getting to him. At the same time, I don't want to be his mum and have to stad up for him for every little thing.
I don't think he's a suicide risk btw, he seems hopeful for the future and uni. 

Completely self aware - this sounds really unsympathetic and i'm aware of my role in this. I would really like some advice about how to act, how to support someone so clingy, and how to make my friends stfu. We stan anonymity.

581,"So this guy was sorta touching my friend in English class without her consent. She sits in front of him. One day she showed up to school wearing sweats cause she was like “it’s a lazy day” and when she went to English class and he started touching and messing with her waistband and she continued pulling his hand away and whispering for him to stop. Well she repositioned herself at one point and he took this as his opportunity and stuck his hand all the way in her sweats and under her panties and touched her. She said she scratched his arm and pulled it out. After she went to the bathroom and cried and immediately texted me. It’s been almost a year and she still hasn’t told anyone because she doesn’t want her name to be out to the whole school. I tried to reason with her that it’s sexual assault because he clearly wasn’t taking no for an answer from you. Not to mention he opened his mouth about it and almost everyone knows, but they don’t know that it was my friend exactly. I need opinions as to why she should tell or if she shouldn’t.",13Nov2018,1
582,"I landed an amazing opportunity early at a startup that will likely be a google/facebook in healthcare. I also am still in university until next spring 2019.

I have also slipped into a clinical depression because my degree is uninteresting to me and has taken me 7 years to complete. But finishing is my top priority currently. The biggest reason for my depression however is that I have social anxiety and have managed it incredibly well over the years until getting in at this startup where I have to be super analytical and not as social. I am disturbed a bit because I feel like I’ve emotionally flatlined from the the stress of the startup and have become something of a business robot obsessed with the hustle. My important relationships have taken a hit and I’m feeling it. I’m concerned Iv skipped a step jumping aggressively into my career and seeing my friends enjoying their college experience building strong friendships and romantic relationships I have an intense fear of ending up rich and alone. 

I haven’t dated in a year and half and my social anxiety is getting the best of me lately. 

I have a lucky opportunity to get on a fast track to becoming a bartender which is appealing because it may allow me to step away from the stress of the startup and refocus on having fun, jump start my dating and social life while also finishing school. But it may cost me an incredible learning experience and possible early high level position in my career. 

I recognize I’m young but am just stuck between what feels like a black and white decision between the last of a fun/social college experience and a career. I really just want friends, a family, and the means to support it and am feeling like maybe I should take a step back and enjoy this last bit of college that I have left. But then again I do have great friends and mentors at this startup too and am questioning whether its a black and white picture that I need to be a bartender to meet girls and socialize. But also again, it would be a lot of fun to travel the world as a bartender while I’m young and then focus on my career later. But then il miss out on building a strong foundation for my life and family and a once in a million lifetimes opportunity at this startup. 

Either way I’m grateful to have to choose between two amazing opportunities and realize either way that it will take work and dedication but I am feeling a bit paralyzed with the decision and choosing the path to achieve my goals and satisfy my needs.

Greetings and salutations, Reddit.

I’ll trim the fat and get to it. This is about my workplace and deciding my future.  
 

I’ve worked at a ma&amp;pa lumber mill for nearly a decade.  
 I worked eight years in retail and now I’m on our residential and commercial installation management team. I have been on the team for a couple months but I’ve been familiar with my two major counter parts for a long, long time (everyone here interfaces regularly one way or another about various subjects).

I’ve always known our company was a little bit less than reputable; people always skim away from talking about it or acknowledging it, sort of like we are playing pretend or sweeping it under the rug. However, I do not believe our reputation has ever been on the “bad” side of the line; we hold various accounts and are a preference when it comes to some big-time development and construction companies in our area (Western BC, lower mainland.. booming huge markets). With our rep being mildly questionable, I have always felt a hidden bit of shame working here.  Lately I am more and more unsure of our leadership and my stress is growing (probably normal for moving up a position or two?)

Anyway, 

This last week our project manager was abruptly away from the office; I had to fill in his role and mine.  
 I quickly learned that we are lacking in a huge variety of ways; skill and management being the two hugest issues; we definitely take on more than we can chew and we absolutely have not been running things properly, but it’s by design of the GM… Nothing we do seems really… professional. No one seems happy with us, and our top brass seems very arrogant in their decision making process and tend to make choices based on that. It seems by nature our owners are, like anyone else, out for themselves above all and hang a heavy head any time we are obligated to stand up by our credentials or word.   
 

In short:  
 We’re late often  
 We take off early sometimes  
 We don’t clean some sites

We take longer than others to complete jobs

Our specs aren’t often up to par with plans…  
 

I feel like we should be posting our ads on craigslist as handymen rather than an installation company. Don’t get me wrong, when the work is done it looks great and aside from average deficiencies I’m proud of what our guys finish with (most of the time)… which is unfortunate as I do not think the builders are, but how can I blame them when I don’t believe they are paid very well?

On top of my immediate responsibilities which include scheduling, building contractor relationships, generating pick and material lists, managing our residential installers, loading them/unloading them... I myself am experiencing some issues.

&amp;#x200B;

  
 Namely I am spread out sort of thin.  
 I’m expected to still help retail up in the yard, I’m expected to track large sales and quote on my own, I’m take care of the yard dog (which is fine because she’s lovely), I’m expected to help in the mill when needed, I handle almost all procurement for the office (furniture, some machinery, random easy things, computers, laptops, vehicles, etc…) That’s all fine! 

\-I’m now also expected to handle property management for a few residences my employer owns… Okay, what?

\-And now I’m also being pushed from residential into commercial installs as well as inside wholesales… right. Not what was explained to me. I was told I’d be “challenged” but this is not what I had in mind. What’s my future goal? Where is my track leading me? Did they set out a track? Are they just so unorganized they don’t know where they need me? What am I doing?.... My title is “project coordinator” isn’t it?

\-The accountants have a brutal natural instinct to bring any invoices not collected to me… what?  
 I’ll track an invoice down over the web all day anyway.. But when you are constantly asking me to track down the same invoices from the same places despite explaining to you most of them are recurring subscriptions and where to find them?...  
 Most of the time the accountants show zero interest in understanding the location from where the charges have come… Just that they have a paper copy in front of them at that instance in time.

Any tech related issue… comes to me?

Any confusion regarding anything outside of the normal spectrum for another person at this company, seemingly comes to either me… or our General Manager, who is one of two direct bosses of mine.  
 

&amp;#x200B;

It’s become clear to me that the more I am present, the more useful I prove myself to be, the more everyone else forgoes their position’s responsibilities in honing their management abilities… the more it becomes a huge problem and not just for myself. 

The biggest thing here is, I am not trying to whine. I CAN do these things, which is clearly why they come to me. What it does mean though, is that we are so out of whack in every sector of this company that we –need- an office super hero to come and pull everything together to make sense… That’s even the general consensus between staff members and they have all indicated I am the guy.

I’m glad to be a super hero, and I want so badly to not be loved by my peers but to produce quality and consistency in my work and add whatever positivity to the company I can while I hone my own skills, in which I have no training FYI… Eight years of winging it and learning on the go.

I’m so confused, to be honest. I don’t know what I am going to do.  
 

On one hand, I see busy work, always getting my hands into different things and experience, even if it is not hands on or properly trained.  
 

On the other hand, the frustration, the chaos, the arrogance, the pettiness, the condescension, the carelessness and the misunderstandings… These are all things I can’t personally address between people and are the real root to why we are where we are. I do not believe a young man who went from fast food to a retail yard to an install branch agent has the skill set, knowledge or experience to address and fix these rooted issues and all of the above issues.

I want so badly to say my problem rests in my self confidence… But realistically, for me, I am scared.

What should I do? I am not educated... I just don’t want to go down with the ship.

Anyway, TL DR  
 

Should I try to save this ship or fucking jump?",13Nov2018,1

589,"All 3 of us were in a group of about 8 super close friends since freshman year of college. In our senior year, my friend, my not yet girlfriend, and another guy went out drinking. At the end of the night, my friend and my gf went home together in a separate Uber and were both pretty drunk. I figured they were going to do stuff and was sad about it cause I liked her, but shook it off shortly after.

A few weeks later she comes out to our friend group that he sexually assaulted her. He aggressively kept trying to make her touch him and he kept touching her. She said no countless times. She eventually gave up and he fingered her and performed oral on her. Then he tried to make her do stuff again and realized that she wasn't going to... So he masturbated right in front of her....

After hearing this, me and my friend group were furious and had an intervention with him and brought him to tears. I was deeply upset about the whole thing and found it hard to be friends with him afterwards.

5 months later, I'm dating my gf. We've been dating for 5 months and I plan to propose soon. Since we've been dating, there have been a few times where she spontaneously cries about the whole event and how she sorry I have to deal with it (even though she's the real victim). More and more details continue to come out about that horrendous night. I later find out that after that night, a week later, they MADE OUT sober. He AGAIN tried to continually force her to make her do sexual things and she continually said no to the point where she got up and said she was too uncomfortable and left.

For me, it's so hard to think about that night she was assaulted and the fact that she willingly went back to him the next week to make out. I realize she was probably lonely, confused, betrayed, and didn't want to accept it. It's just hard for me to understand.

I realize that the whole situation could've been worse and he could have raped her, but even so this whole situation has really been a struggle for the both of us. I want to be a good boyfriend and future husband; I want to be strong and be there for her. I'm just not always sure if talking about it with her is helpful or not. It usually ends with both of troubled and upset. 

We both uphold Christian values of waiting to have sex until marriage; so at least he didn't take that away from her. But technically my friend has unfairly been further with my girlfriend than I have and it sickens me to the bone

How should I mentally handle this situation so I can be stronger for my gf?

Sorry for the long, probably poorly-written post. But these thoughts still trouble me sometimes and I'm not sure what to do with them.

591,"For example, recently me and my mom had a discussion over whether we use 10% of our brain or not. When I see something that’s blatantly wrong I try to correct it. But she’s like “we haven’t discovered everything yet and we use 10% of our CAPACITY of our brain” and I’m like “??? No we don’t.” and pull up some sources (Scientific American) and try and convince her (maybe that’s the reason why? If someone’s set-deep in their belief don’t try anything?) Because another example would be if anyone tried to convince ME of something Sciencey that I just KNEW was wrong and they’d correct me I’d be a bit miffed too (but I’d be like “oh ok I get it now.” If I was indeed wrong.)
So that’s probably why, but it IRKS ME when someone’s like “well better luck next time,” or “you’re just a teenager and think you’re a know-it-all but I’m an adult so I have more life experience!” (Usually this is true)

I’m trying my hardest to get my life together. I’m 27 and a complete mess. My partner died of a brain aneurysm when my son was 2 months old.

I didn’t sign up to be a single mother. This wasn’t according to our plans. I’m so lost and hurt and angry and confused... he left me here with a baby all by myself.

My son is now 2 years old (27 months) and it’s still so severe. I’m having hard times bonding with him, 1 on 1 time, he mainly will sit with his iPad and and/or tv . He also goes to daycare.

I feel like shit and I don’t want to feel this way. I just lost my job 3 weeks ago due to an emotional breakdown at work and I have zero motivation of finding a job. He goes to daycare and I lay in bed all day until I have to get him. I am running out of my savings that I barely had together because I also have been ordering food for every single meal. (Perfect timing to go broke!)

My advice I need is how to fix this? I have called every single hospital in the area for PPD resources, I have called 211 nothing is available in the NW OHIO area. I have gotten a therapist that specialized in depression and haven’t gotten better. I have tried posting to Craigslist and fb to start a support group and no bite.

594,"As my username suggests, I’m deeply depressed. I’ve lost my friends due to moving away and just outgrowing people in general. All I do is work, sleep, repeat. I actually like my job now but there needs to be more to life than this.

My family life is horrible. I’ve come to understand that my mum doesn’t love me. She’s always told me how she wanted to abort me but the three doctors she went to said no. I pay half the bills in the house as she’s a single parent which leaves me with next to nothing. I’ve had to take out credit for her with which she promised she’d pay me back but she hasn’t so I’m in a lot of debt and can hardly save because of the rent and bills I pay. When I bring it up she says I’m ungrateful although half the time she’s verbally abusive so yes I do complain about having all these responsibilities at my age (I’m 21). It feels like the roles have reversed ever since I was six I’ve been looking after my siblings!!!

I’ve never had a boyfriend, never kissed anyone and never had sex. I’m pretty okay in terms of looks and know I have a great personality but have never been able to connect with a man that way. I guess due to low self esteem and fear of rejection and just fear in general!

I have a crush on a guy at work and no doubt he has a girlfriend and no doubt he has no interest in me. It hurts because this always happens! I’m attracted to someone and they either have a gf or if they do like me I self sabotage. It’s so intense that when I’m around him I feel sick! If it helps I don’t know his name or anything about him, I just see him around a lot and am crushing so hard.. sounds so stupid!

595,"I work completely independently and I travel to different car dealerships in my area to photograph their inventory for their websites. My boss manages a small team of 5 people. 

Recently I’ve had several occasions where he has not told me things I need to know... like direct requests from the dealer and a huge one just last week was that I’m ALSO supposed to take videos (haven’t been trained on videos yet anyway) at a new dealership that I got set up over a month ago. He called me last week, said hey I forgot to tell you this by the way, also I’m going on vacation for a week. I made it clear that I hadn’t been trained on the videos so he forwarded me two emails from his boss with a bunch of training videos... and only one of the training videos was what I needed. 

Today I am taking photos at a new (to me- this is my 6th time coming here) dealership, and was approached by the dude in charge. (I took over at this dealership because the photographer before me was too busy and I had time.) Anyway, he spouted off with a bunch of additional criteria for the photos and honestly... this place doesn’t pay my company enough to make these kind of demands. They have the lowest per car cost of all my lots, and to meet every demand this dude is making I have to move each car MULTIPLE times while taking photos. About two dozen shots per car, absolutely no branding in any shot besides the actual make of the car. First shot must be in front of the dealership sign, but this blocks the entrance so I can only have it there for a few moments to take the picture. The location and placement of the signs nearby, plus the other two dealerships with clearly visible signs make this task almost impossible. 

So, when dude in charge told me this I raised my eyebrows a bit but remained cool and said ok, do you have a suggestion for a better place to photograph so we don’t have to worry about those other signs in the photos? No, just move it he said, and then got a bit of an attitude and said “that’s what I said I wanted” then he just walked off! So apparently, he’s communicated this with my boss already, and I just went through every email my boss sent me regarding instructions for this dealer- nothing. 

Guys.... how do I say something without implying that my boss is doing a shitty job? And how do I suggest that the dude in charge here needs to slow his roll a bit and be cool with a glimpse of the ford logo in the background of one or two shots in the set? ",13Nov2018,1
596,"To preface this, my friend and I are both 14, and this is in the U.S.

So I’ve been friends with this person for a really long time, and her father’s always been rather strict with her, and that’s just how some people raise their kids, but recently it’s been getting pretty bad, to the point where I’m wondering if it counts as child abuse. 

He’ll throw away her sketchbooks (she really likes drawing), take away her phone for no reason, prevent her from watching TV or reading or basically anything but just sitting there. Even though it doesn’t affect him at all, he’ll stop her from going to after school activities and from seeing friends. 

Apart from that, he verbally abuses her, calling her a ‘failure’ and scorning her dreams of becoming an artist. He also blames her for his failing relationship with his wife, tells her he regrets having children and all kinds of awful stuff. He also leans right politically, which isn’t really a bad thing necessarily, but he often uses deragatory terms, especially to the lgbtq community (which she is a part of) and to people of color (which I am), and makes her very uncomfortable. He hasn’t been physically abusive to my knowledge, but she has admitted to me she feels uncomfortable being alone with him. 

I know none of this sounds especially bad, but it’s really affecting her grades (which he screams at her about) and her mental health (he refuses to allow her to see a therapist). I really don’t know if this is normal or not, and even if it is, if there’s even anything I can do to help her?

598,"Hi everyone, I’m not quite sure what to do here, so I’m posting for some ideas. 

My new-ish roommate (we’ve been living together now for about 3 months) is in an extremely volatile relationship, with lots of ups and downs, breakups and getting back together, etc. At the drop of a hat, they will get into an argument and break up. The next day, they are usually back together, and it’s annoying. When we moved in together, they “weren’t together,” but he’s around often and has slept here at least two nights a week since we moved in. I expressed at the outset of us living together that i don’t like him &amp; would prefer him not being around. I haven’t brought it up as a problem, since I’m in grad school &amp; it doesn’t really affect me much since I’m not in the house often at all. 

But then last night something happened that’s altered my opinion of the situation- they got into a drawn-out fight where my roommate’s boyfriend said that they were broken up &amp; he was going to arrange someone to beat my roommate up. I’ve always disliked this guy, but threats of violence are across the board awful &amp; now I feel unsafe as well as unhappy with him in the house. I also learned he’s expressed these threats to my roommate previously, which concerns me.

599,"Hi everyone. Thank you in advance for checking this out.

I am a 21 year old male driver living in Metro Detroit. On my way to work in Detroit this morning, I was driving on a three lane road. Keep in mind the actual accident happened in Detroit. I am in the center lane. A car a little bit ahead of me in the right lane turns right onto a side street. Another car is on that side-street looking to cross the direction of traffic I’m in, enter the median, and turn left to go in the opposite direction as I am. Also keep in mind that he had a stop sign, while I had no sign nor any traffic lights to adhere to. While the car to my front right is turning, that car on the side-street floors it to get to the median. He clearly doesn’t have the time to make it, and I don’t have enough space for my brakes to fully stop my car, so I t-boned him right at about his driver’s side door. I was going about 30mph, which was the speed limit there.

My airbags deploy. My full coffee that was in the cup holder splashes everyone. The only injury I had was hitting my thumb knuckle on something, haven’t quite figured it out yet, but it was nothing serious at all. There were a total of 4 or 5 passengers in the other vehicle, which was a 2017 Toyota Sienna. My car was a 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix. I immediately call police for a car on the scene, with a patrol car luckily about a block away. Shortly after I see that my car is leaking at least antifreeze. The cop tells me to drive it into the right lane of the road as to not block traffic, and I’m still able to do so. The police ask for my information, which I provide, and eventually ask my side of the story. The police were mostly talking to the other driver, a 47 year old man. Once they come to me, they only talk to me for about 30 seconds to a minute, reaffirming what they heard from the other party and basically muttering to me things like, “he had a stop sign, he needed to yield to traffic” and at no point pointing any fingers in my direction. I say this because by the end I wasn’t sure if the other guy was given a ticket or not because I was focusing on different phone calls.

Another point to bring up which I believe is important is that the other passengers in his car were people he was driving around for his job. They weren’t exactly people he knew. His boss ended up coming to the scene and taking pictures of my car and asking my side and not refuting anything I said. When I took a picture of the guy’s license, it was a chauffeur’s license, as opposed to a regular operator’s license. Anyways, I take pictures of his license, insurance, my car, and his car. I’m also given a police report number and told to go to the station to receive the report in no fewer than 3 days. I also call for a tow truck through AAA, my insurance, to bring my car to a collision shop near my house. My boss was very nice enough to come pick me up, bring me to the shop, and back to work. Very grateful. So anyways, to my dilemma.

I do not have full coverage insurance. I have no fault. In Michigan. So the only way that I’m looking to be compensated is through either the driver and/or the company that he is employed by. I guess my question is, how exactly do I go about this? I filed a claim with AAA and they said I don’t have collision so there’s not much they can do. My car is at the collision shop right now. And the police report won’t be ready until at least Friday, 11/16. Do I contact his company and ask them to reimburse me for damages? Do I get the exact estimate before I do that? Do I wait for the police report before I contact him and/or the company? Do I take this straight to court? I’m really new to this kind of stuff and any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you all so much,

As I my head hit the ground I instinctively rolled with and I heard a couple pops in my neck, that’s the only thing that bothering right now. It went kind of like [this](https://youtu.be/Bdr2j5oD2dU) since i instinctively rolled with it.

Is my neck just sprained and should I just take an ibuprofen, or should I get it checked out by a doctor. It kind of feels like I slept wrong but it’s little worse. And it’s kind of in my upper trap area and on the lower side of the neck.

Comments, critiques, or advice is appreciated?",13Nov2018,1
602,"Hey all, my boyfriend and I moved to Cleveland, OH a couple of months ago. We're using our vacation time to visit his family for Christmas, so we're looking at spending here in town. None of our family members can come up as they are hosting their own thing, and we haven't really made any friends yet! The acquaintances we have met all have plans smh. We're hoping we can wiggle our way into someone else's Thanksgiving plans but we understand it's usually a family and close friends thing and don't want to butt in where we're not welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any suggestions on how we can make a two person Thanksgiving special, not super lame, or maybe even memorable? Thanks!",13Nov2018,1
603,"Hi everyone. I've been really paranoid lately and would like to know if anyone has any insight into it or ways to get over it.

I'd say part of my paranoia goes back to about March of this year during a very, very ugly situation that I could write paragraphs about but that's not really the point of the post. The gist of it is: Eventually after breaking up with Ex#1, I got together with Ex#2. They knew each other. Ex#1 eventually accuses me of emotionally abusing him but his reasons are untrue and his behavior is shady and unfair. Ex#1 also tells me that if I hurt Ex#2 he will come after me/make my life hell/something like that. During this entire process I lose all of my friends because they believe my Ex and not me. I did not abuse Ex#1; he actually abused me but I don't want to go into that. Eventually I also broke up with Ex#2 but it was not an ugly breakup, I was just not at a good place personally to be in a relationship. As far as I know, Ex#1 nor my ex friends have done anything or planned anything to hurt me.

But that's part of my paranoia. I am paranoid that Ex#1 or my ex friends are planning to do something to hurt me because I broke up with Ex#2 or just to get back at me. I live alone and I think some might know where I live because before the whole fiasco I told them where I was living for next semester. My main reddit username is also something they could easily figure out is me and under that account I've posted about living in my building on my college's subreddit. I also told them about my planned class schedule before the fiasco, AND I have two classes with one of my ex friends (one of the classes only has 10 people and so he has easy access to me). Besides very minimal interaction with this guy in my classes, I have not interacted with any of my ex friends or either ex boyfriend this semester.

Realistically, they weren't bad guys (all of my ex friends were dudes, I had no female friends, I'm female) with the exception of my ex and I don't think they would do anything, but for some reason I can't shake this feeling.

Since the tiny possibility that one of them might do something to me, I can't stop the paranoia from growing. When I'm walking alone in the dark, even for very short distances, I find myself constantly looking around for anyone around me and if someone is there I monitor them closely. I walk quickly. I've also been varying my routine a lot, usually I stay in my apartment alone but have been going to work at various places around campus on different days of the week and at different times, not always consciously. I vary how I get home (shuttle, friend's car, special ride service done by my school). I've been hyper aware to double lock my apartment door. If I even spot one of my  ex's or ex friends while walking around campus, my heart leaps out of my chest, I do a 180 degree turn and walk the other way and have to hide/sit down for 5 minutes before I regain composure.

That's the gist of that part of my paranoia. The other part is for the past week, every single night I hear several large booming sounds outside, at varying distances away. Sometimes they sound like fireworks, sometimes like an actual explosion, sometimes like gunshots. The other night I was just leaving my building to go to dinner and heard two close together noises that sounded just like a shotgun. My college town is definitely not very safe (besides campus) and gun violence is common nearby. With all the gun violence on national news, this is really scary to me. I have no idea what these sounds are and I'm becoming afraid to walk at night at all. I asked people on my school's subreddit but nobody really knows.

My paranoia seems to get worse every day. Please help me. How do I get rid of it?",13Nov2018,1
604,"Hi everyone, sorry for bad formatting, i’m on mobile. i’m a girl and a hs junior (canada). last year i had an argument with my mom that ended in her hitting me a lot and leaving a cut on my lip. i don’t even exactly remember why, just that i didn’t talk to her very nicely in response - then that happened. she was clawing at me and my dad had to come between us, and i was furious. they didn’t want me to go to school after that, but i stormed off in tears and went anyways. 

one thing led to another and i found myself talking to a school counsellor about everything and telling them about  how my mom would hit me when she got mad at me for as long as i could remember. how she would would shut herself in a closet with me and keep hitting me while i cried at age 5. since the counsellors are legally obliged to contact a social worker in this situation, that’s what they did and the social worker opened a file for my case. 

that day my big sister texted me and said that i acted rashly and was not considerate to my mother and that i didn’t know the consequences. me and my sister have and have always had a good relationship, so what she said kind of hurt my feelings. once the situation cooled down everything went back to normal. we’re happy and a normal family. 

a year has passed and we’ve been ignoring the social workers since. but i’ve started to believe what my sister said and i feel incredibly guilty now. i blew it totally out of proportion, if i hadn’t told anyone this wouldn’t be resurfacing a year later and inconveniencing my parents and sister who wasn’t really even involved. i overreacted and acted selfishly out of anger and desperation just so i could tell somebody about everything that happened for the first time. and now today, i get called down to talk to the social worker at school. she says the file can’t be closed unless they come to our house and talk to the whole family. i’m worried about what will happen, my mother has a special disdain for the social workers; she says they probably can’t even raise their own kids well. she also really didn’t like the idea of them coming to our house. but nobody knows what happened today yet, and my family doesn’t  know that the social worker HAS to come and talk to everyone in order for this to be over. i’m worried about the consequences, this is all because of my rash decision. how should i go about dealing with this? was i wrong for telling the counsellor in the first place? because this has happened before and we managed to move on without outside help, so i regret it a lot in hindsight.
