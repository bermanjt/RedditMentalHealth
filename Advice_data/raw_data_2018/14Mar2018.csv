The past few dates he has been kissing me on the cheek (which really surprised me because he is more shy), and he asked me to go get dinner with him and go for a walk after around this pretty lake nearby, so idk but I have a feeling he may kiss me? I have never kissed anyone (I'm 20F btw), so can anyone give me some tips? Thanks! :) ",14Mar2018,1
1,"Hey

I'm graduating with a graduate degree from university May 15th. I've already accepted an offer (which i am very happy with) at a company. However, they have informed me that my start date is October 9th. This gives me four months with absolutely nothing to do.

A couple of restrictions:

1. While I could take money out as a student loan, I'm already $157,000 in debt from school.

2. My parents have told me I'm not allowed back home to live with them for 4 months.

3. For personal reasons, I'm not allowed to leave the U.S.

Does anyone have any suggestions of cool stuff to do? Self-improvement? Temporary / fun jobs or internships.",14Mar2018,6
4,"Let me get into this story by saying that environtmentally, everything is fine. I have a great group of friends and a happy family that provide for me, so I have no room to complain. However, lately ive been anxious, down, and having a plethera of intrusive and ocd like thoughts. I can’t help myself but worry all the time. I know this sounds stupid, but It started ever since I recieved a brand new computer. It was great and I was enjoying it alot until it started acting up, which got me very worried since I was majorly paranoid I would break the computer like I did my previous one i had a year prior. The anxiety, worry, and constant “googling” started from there, which did not help at all. Every few weeks I encounter something small with my computer that absolutley drive me crazy.

The intrusive thoughts started when I ran into a low-grade virus on my computer, and I started worrying about the thoughts in my head rather then my computer (which I completely removed from the system but still worried me somehow). The thoughts were nothing but disturbing, and it got me worrying about my overall mental state. I would never do the things I would think about, which is what scares me the most. 

The confusing part of the whole situation is how this material object is causing me so much distress. Its just a material object? I shouldn’t be feeling this way? 

The only way I am coping with these feelings is distracting myself. I would always try to have something to do which only momentary relief.

If anyone is able to help me on explaining why I feel this way, that would be great. Thank you for reading.",14Mar2018,1
5,"About a year ago, I became friends with this girl and we recently clicked. We would constantly talk through text and skype for hours and time flew. Once college started, she started to lie to me about a lot of minor stuff but it started to get out of hand. One of my closest friends were also close friends with her the things that she told my friend were complete 180 from what she told me and it started to slowly anger me because they weren't needed to lie about. At this point, I started to develop feelings for her and she knew. She would normally play along such as trying to hold hands, be close things couples do. Then I got fed up because my best friend and I started to discuss about the things she told us and my best friend told me to cut her off because they noticed it was annoying me. After I stopped talking to her, she would constantly ask my best friend why I was acting in such a way, me and her talked, we fought and she kept on still lying so I decided to permanently (try) stop talking to her. Flash forward to to now, about a month later, she constantly still tries to talk to me and avoids me if i'm hanging with another girl. I still feel guilty for not telling her the entire reason and think that she deserves to know. So should I talk to her? ",14Mar2018,1
6,"Life is moving hella fast for me at the moment. Almost finishing college  and have applied to uni. I’m planning to do computer science at Reading however I’m scared I’m going to become lazy. Also I enjoy creative side of computing like website design and photoshop stuff. 

If Im being honest, I actually dislike computer work but idek what I want to do with my life. Computers are easy, but arent they for most people. Hence the choice of computer science at Uni.

7,"I'm currently working in telecoms as a software developer for a year but I hate the role and it was really frustrating me so I wanted to do something different. A few months ago I applied for a master's degree (it's a UX type course) and I got accepted.

So I am going back to university in September and I have 5-6 months to push through. This means I'll be leaving my job at the end of August, but I haven't given my notice yet (I'll do it closer to the time).

I don't know when to tell my manager or not about my decision to do this master's degree. I get on really well with him and he's supported me a lot.

Do I tell him and perhaps he might switch me to doing things similar to my course or is it better I keep quiet and don't say anything until I send in my resignation notice, in case he decides to let me go?

8,"I just graduated from college and am currently living with my parents. My best friend from college wants to fly in and visit me.

11,"So, I broke my S7 digitizer and LCD when I dropped it about a month ago. There's a few reason's I want to get it fixed. The main reason is I have a ton of notes on there that I'd like to access, main thing being the pw for my pw storing app(don't know the correct term). Also, I was thinking (hoping) I could unlock it via the T-mobile device unlock app and use it for Sprints 1yr promo they have going.

One big reason I don't want to fix it, I didn't love the phone and I don't want it to become obsolete shortly after fixing.

My other option is finding a new phone I like, preferably $200 and under that I could unlocked (if I wanted to), and that is comparable or better than the S7. I'd like something with expandable memory, but not a must. Also, android is really the only option.",14Mar2018,1

19,"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about 15 months. I'm at a point where I know that I should breakup with him, and kind of want to, but I keep just not doing it. I love him, and he makes me quite happy, but he also makes me quite sad/mad/etc. 
He was dating his last girlfriend until about two months into our own relationship. He said that he didn't know how to break up with her cause she was addicted to drugs, but I witnessed the breakup happen over Messenger, and read back quite a bit in their messages, and I just don't buy it; later on it came up and he then blamed it on her being suicidal, and had an obvious 'oh shit' moment when I said 'wasn't it drug addiction?'. It more so seemed like he kept her around for money. From starting college up until when we started dating, to my knowledge, he slept with 4 girls including me. He maintains that he's never cheated, but considering everything I do. Also, he fought pretty hard for the breakup not to happen and was obviously upset during it (I was sitting on my laptop across from him as it happened).
At one point he was mildly physical abusive, but he's always been mentally/emotionally abusive. His humor for the most part revolves around things he knows bother or upset me. Whereas if I joked like that with him it'd be a WHOLE issue, and has been the times I attempted it. 
Also, since witnessing the breakup, and now knowing when his behavior is sketchy, I have often checked his messages. Which normally I'm not alright with, but I really couldn't trust him anymore. I've seen him hit up a number of girls, tell them they're cute and ask for their number, tell them to hit him up, tell people he's not in a relationship, and basically just lots of lies. He lies all the time and it's not hard to tell, but every time he just acts so offended that I'd ever even accuse him of such a thing that it ends up blowing over cause I just don't know how to handle such a blatant lie. 
The two times he had a phone it stressed me out so bad. I found a large internet history of porn of 15 year olds on both, a couple younger. I've found 'creepshot' videos on his phones, my laptops, and my phone, but he maintains that none of them were ever him. He's taken some while at work, and actually a month ago I came out of my room to see him filming under my roommates door while she was in the shower. He immediately deleted the videos saying they were all 3 seconds each and you couldn't see anything, also saying that her boyfriend was in there and they were having sex and he just wanted audio proof. This lie makes a little more sense with context, in short her boyfriend should not be in our apartment whatsoever. I recovered the videos and it amounted to like almost 3 and a half minutes of video where you could clearly see her naked in the shower for around half of the footage. He got angry at me saying he'd never do that when clearly he'd taken creepy videos like that before, just not of a friend in the shower. This was really the breaking point where I fully decided that I had to break up with him. It died down since then, but the past few days he's been messaging an internet friend that lives states away, but they've been more than fairly flirtatious. I told him I saw the messages and he got mad of course, and he's been deleting their conversation every time he messages her back ever since. In the past he's gone out of his way to only delete things I know he doesn't want me to see, saying that he always deletes his conversations. Of which is 100% false. 
Overall my issue is that I love him so much, and he makes me happier than anyone ever has, and I've never cared about a person so much, but the bad started outweighing the good a while ago. He drains me, my money, and everything I have really. But it's so hard to let go. Especially because I can't afford my apartment without him and will have to break my lease. It's not like I've never addressed things.. I know I should breakup with him but I just fall short every time I decide to do it. Please encourage me. ",14Mar2018,5
20,"I'm Currently a college student attending a Community college. Throughout high school I got high grades on exams but I never attended class. from K-8th grade I attended was those elite academy after schools so I ended up learning the materials by 8th grade. Once i entered high school, I wanted to socialize and ended up getting in with a bad group of people and ended up cutting a lot and doing drugs. This heavily impacted my college chances and I ended up going to community college and I absolutely hate it. I decided to turn my life around and maintaining a decent GPA while trying to break habits from high school such as cutting. I tried to apply for tansfers to different uni's but I've been rejected so far. What should I do? I really want to leave.

21,"I'm really upset with myself.

Yesterday I got a call from someone stating that because I make my credit card payments on time and have a good credit score (which are both true), they offered to lower the interest rate on my card. I asked if they were Bank of America and he said yes.

He asked for my credit card number.. I was hesitant at first and said ""Bank of America would never ask me for that information.. I'm a little hesitant to give it to you"" but he of course smoothed me over and I ended up giving it to him along with the last 4 digits of my social. I know. I'm fucking stupid.

**This is where it's sketchy**. He managed to pull up my account information with my credit card number. He knew the balance I owed and when my next payment was due which made me think he really worked for B of A. How the hell did he get this information? He also kept asking me if I have any other credit cards.... wtf.

Immediately after I call Bank of America and ask if there was any record of them sending out a courtesy call to me to make this offer. They said no, and also informed me that they would never ask for a credit card or directly call me for offers. They also stated that if B of A ever calls me, it will be from a 1800 number. (The number they called me from was obviously masked because it was the same area code I lived).

Anyway, I canceled my credit card and they're sending me a new one in the mail.

I don't know if theres any other safety measures I should do.. I'm scared out of my mind that my identity was stolen? Is there a way to get a credit report to make sure no one is opening accounts in my name? Are there any other safety measures I should do?

From now on I'm not answering the phone. If it's important they can leave me a voicemail or send me a text. 

Edit: I want to also know how he managed to know my account balance... wtf.

23,"So here's the sitch, right?  So as the title says here, I've had this particular friend of mine for about 10 years now. Our level of friendship has kind of wavered here and there due to her moving away for college, but for the most part, we're super close. She was at my name change court date (to fill in for my absent mom) and my final choir concert at college, and she's a great friend through and through for over a decade!

Only one problem though. This fall, I totally did the one thing you're never supposed to do as a lesbian with a (presumably) straight girl, or a close friend, or both.

I developed a crush.

I don't know what happened to cause it, but like, ever since last fall, my attraction changed around, and something about her appearance and scent and just...everything suddenly became super attractive, you know? So because I also love her to bits as a friend, I haven't said anything, in fear of ruining our friendship with a declaration of love which is unlikely to be reciprocated, right? ^(I mean, she's only had boyfriends her entire life and never come out to me, so I assume she's straight)

Only complication is, as she's told me, she's planning to move from North Dakota/Minnesota to Oregon after she graduates, and is pretty set on it. Which like, good for her, and FB will always be a thing, but once she heads out, it might be the last time I see her in person for a LONG time.

Which is making me question myself. I normally would have never confessed anything to hr before because I didn't want to ruin our friendship. But now, with the news that she might be gone in a couple months, I'm SUPER conflicted. It's either:

-  I never tell her how I feel about her, and we likely don't see each other for years.  I don't see anyone else in my life, or on dating apps, or anyone else as near as compatible as I'd be with her.

- I tell her, she isn't into me, and it ruins our friendship. I would be so lost without having her as my rock to talk to and work through good and bad times.

- The very rare possibility that she would have feelings for me, and we end up together and live happily after.  As much as I'd love for this to happen, to chase after this I feel would be stupid considering the meager odds she'd have feelings for me.

I'm so lost. What do you all think I should do?",14Mar2018,3

I don't know why exactly she gave me this look, perhaps its because I've never smiled at her when I've seen her around I don't know or perhaps she feels like I stare to much. Again I don't know. I've been thinking of responding non verbally just for my own self satisfaction. Especially after the look she gave me, I don't intend on talking to her at all. Clearly Im looking for advice and I understand if your immediate response is ""get over it"" however like I said, she actively invaded my subconscious so its not that simple",14Mar2018,0
26,"I'm a full-time college student who currently works at a hibachi restaurant.  On average I'd say I make about $9/hour on tips (our $2 an hour is used on taxes so I just get paid tips).  I'm still in training so I only get to keep 70% of my tip and it'll probably be like that for at least one more month.  I'm not sure how good I have it here (doesn't feel that good tbh) since I've been in training for 4 months now, and the rules keep changing every week (usually adding more work) like having us do food prep differently and cleaning (wiping the whole table and chair 3 times in different ways).

It's not as bad as it used to be, and we're getting more flexible scheduling, but it's also a lot stricter.  I'm kind of tired of working here and still being in training (I'm not as close to my coworkers as I'd hoped, so it's also kind of lonely).  But I'm not sure if I should quit and go work somewhere else since I'm familiar with everything already and know that I can always pretty much get days I need off.

I'm scared to work at CVS because of how much everyone seems to hate working there, but I don't think I can get a pharmacy technician job anywhere else without any experience or training.  I also don't plan on working much so it wouldn't be very encouraging to hire me.  I'd probably get paid about the same, and maybe even hate it more, so should I just pay for training to work somewhere else and keep my job in the meantime?

There's also a jewelry store hiring people and it starts at $13 an hour, but they'd want me to work full time (which I may be able to get out of since they're also hiring one of my coworkers, so we could both work part-time to cover the shifts?  Probably not going to work that way, but maybe?)  This could also be more similar to a pharmacy tech job (retail) to use as experience.

tl;dr
I hear CVS is evil, so I'm scared to work there even though I have been wanting to try working as a pharmacy technician somewhere.  I don't think my chances of getting a job without experience or training anywhere else are very good.  The job I have now is a lot of work (hibachi server), and I'm a little burnt out by it, but it's got flexible scheduling and I'm used to working there.  I'm in college so I can't work a lot.  Is working at CVS really as bad as it sounds (worse than the job I have now)?  Should I just pay for my own training/registration and get a pharmacy tech (or bank, or jewelry store) job later?",14Mar2018,5

She says that she doesn't make enough to afford the house anyway so I could buy her out if we broke up. If she was in a place at that time where she was able to buy me out I'd be fine with that also. A coin flip would even work for me in the case of a disagreement. We are both very amiable easy going people and I don't foresee a dramatic breakup if it were to happen.

I tried playing cards with her (choosing kids games, like Beggar Your Neighbor) but she could not remember the rules and I was constantly reminding her. I know she didn't enjoy that, as she is very aware of her memory issues. I have to tell her a story 3-4 times over several days before she remembers it.

So my friend and I (she's a girl, I'm a guy) have been discussing for the last couple of weeks and recently she said she had been acting weird because she thinks I like her as more than friends and she's afraid she'll hurt me because she's in a really committed relationship with her boyfriend. Right now they're both doing an exchange semester abroad, even though in different countries because they couldn't get in at the same place. I guess I do like her, but I honestly would never try anything, because I really respect her and the guy seems like a really great guy (though, sometimes it sounds like he doesn't like me, but I really get why he wouldn't like a guy who hangs out with his girlfriend in a foreign country), but I really care about her and she says she really cares about me and I believe her.

After she said the thing about not being comfortable, I said that in that case I could not really do much, because that is how she thinks and I cannot change that.

Right now we are not really talking and, of course, I miss talking with her, but I understand how she feels so I'm not about to try anything weird. But it still feels bad, man. I just want to know what I could do to make things easier for myself.

Her birthday is coming up soon and I'll just text her some congratulations and nice wishes, because I really don't want to make things more awkward.

Truth be told, I feel our friendship might fall apart after this and things will probably never go back to what they were, so I guess I'm just trying to look for ways to cope with that. If it does not fall apart, that would be great, but I'm trying not to get my hopes up.",14Mar2018,1

When I try to talk to my parents or family about it, they are very harsh and 'don't want to waste their time on me anymore'. I didn't have the most supportive family growing up and things like sexual, verbal, emotional, mental abuse were met with anger at 'weakness.' It led to me being vulnerable to anyone who was nicer to me than they were and looking for acceptance any and everywhere (read: in the wrong places, time after time). I feel like I walked around with a target on me, and still may.

TL;DR I need to learn how to be a strong, self-focused person who does not give my power away to others and does not live in the past.",14Mar2018,2

It's been 6 years I joined the military after graduating. She has been in and out of jail. Me and my wife stopped by my hometown on our way to my next duty station. I saw her about an hour ago and she is very pale, skinny, and sickly looking. I feel if I turned her in she would be safer in jail and wouldn't OD. Just the thought of me having to do this hurts me.

51,"Hi, I’m Lia. I’m thirteen years old and in eighth grade. Sorry if this is hard to read or badly written, i just need somewhere to say it so i’d really appreciate if someone read it. For the past few months i have been steadily become less and less close to my best friend Mikayla. We used to be really close and i was so happy. We had a wonderful friend group consisting of her, me, another girl named Ella, and a boy named Will. 
We became a really tight group over the course of seventh grade and we were closest at the end of the year. thinking of these times make me the saddest because i didn’t even see how happy i was. Will changed over the summer and wasn’t very kind to Mikayla, which i now see is a reason for her wanting to leave us. But now i’m rambling. So around christmas this year, was when Mikayla really separated from the group that is now just me and Ella. She has started to only talk to her basketball friends and seemingly tried to cut us off in a way. 
Although i know Mikayla can be friends with whoever she wants, i miss her and my group a lot. i know it’s not going to be the same because she hasn’t been a great friend and neither has Will. I love Ella, and she’s an amazing friend who i spend a lot of time with. But sometimes a group is really important and i miss it so much. I didn’t even see it coming.
The reason I can’t just talk to Mikayla is because i know how she’d take it and i know how she’d react. She was always sweet, but i know that she knows she’s manipulative and that she can never let someone confront her. She would either see it as “i miss you and miss talking to you” and think “i better hang out with my old group so nobody thinks i abandoned them”. I don’t want her to hang out with me out of pity.
She could also see it as “why did you leave us???i  am so mad at you” where she’d then ignore it and not try to change anything. I know her. i know that if she really wanted things to be how they were back in seventh grade, she’d have left things how they were. 
she used to approach me and talk to me. she’d text me after school and we’d sit together at lunch. now i feel like her last priority under everything and everyone else. not to mention, her basketball friends are some of the rudest and most condescending people i have ever met in my whole school.
I miss her, and yet i loathe her. I feel helpless and angry and the same time and i don’t know what to do. So.. advice?

53,"My mum is not a well woman. She has many ailments but she is strong and carries on. We have our differences from time to time but overall I have the upmost respect for her. (She raised me alone) 

However ever since we moved to our most recent house (8 years ago) the next door neighbor hates us. Were not what you'd call upper class citizens, were decent folk but we're loud and merry. We like to watch the football and have a drink. 

He does not like noise past 11pm, and doesn't tolerate much. 

I've had run ins with him in the past alot because he always shouts at my mum. 

One time which I'd say was the most serious was a few years back when he made her cry. She went to check on another neighbors horses as she thought one was trapped. After she returned he volleyed a barrage of insults at her and upset her. My mum has a thick skin so this means he was unpleasant. 

I went over like any son would and gave him what for. I rarely resolve with violence, I spoke to him in a stern manner and explained he is not going to talk like that to my mother again. He proceeded to push me off his doorstep and try and push me back to my house. This didn't go well for him as I'm 6'2 and 15 stone in weight. He is 5'4 and much lighter...the situation got ugly and the police were called. 

I have now moved away for university, and my mum is facing a tough time with the goverment, as they've taken away her disability car and shortened her money. 

She has to do things I used to do when I lived at home such as cut up logs for the fire (very rural area) this is a struggle for her, instead of offering to help her like any responsible person would, he decided to scare her by banging on her window and shouting at her that cutting logs at 9:30 pm is too much and she has to stop. 

In a few weeks I return home for a short while before returning home for the summer. 

I want to confront him about the way he speaks to my mum but I feel it's been to long. If he does shout at her again, how should I approach it? I feel if he comes at me arrogant or aggressive I might not have the self control to not smack the p**ck. 
Any advice on how to deal with this?

He said, quote, that when I turn 18 he’s going to shake my hand never talk to me again and when people ask how many kids he has he’ll say 2 and the 3rd one died. 3 being me.

59,"Hear me out before jumping to any conclusions.

At my former employer, a local health club, we had a lost-and-found. One of my co-workers was given the task of managing the items and enforcing a policy of donating any unclaimed goods after a 30 day time period. Things like sweaty t-shirts and water bottles ended up in there. Naturally, there was also a separate collection for more expensive items that had an annual or biannual expiration date (I can't remember specifics.. it was just never freakin' emptied).

Until one day, the co-worker was told to empty the expensive items section. I ended up coming across a really nice watch. Checking the log, this watch had not been claimed in years.

I've taken it to accredited jewelers to have them take a look.. not only is the watch real, but it's worth quite a bit of money. ~$5000. Going through the sales process made me privy to a ""background check"" of sorts, where they request your address, description of person (ht, wt, etc.). This is to prevent the sale of stolen goods. It freaked me out. I did not steal the watch, but I also can't tell for sure if it's been reported stolen.. Ya know, if the dummy who lost their watch at the gym submitted something as a last resort.

I've searched online lost &amp; stolen items databases with details of the watch. Nothing has turned up. It's been several years since and I still have the watch in my possession. I really want to sell it and move on. It's just sitting in my drawer, does not fit, and I could really do other things with the money. But I also don't want to get into trouble unknowingly selling stolen property. How do I safely go about selling this watch, if at all? Any advice is appreciated.",14Mar2018,2

62,"I have a spending addiction. Please help. A little background: I'm a 21 year old female. I've had a rough childhood that consisted of a mentally unstable mother who used cocaine and a dad that wasn't there as much as he could've been. I was neglected to some extent; living in filth and some days would go without eating dinner. I didn't have much of a role model, my dad didn't teach me the importance of finances and developing safe spending habits. My mom, while she made a livable living, was extremely not smart with money. She would go into debt buying pure bred dogs, like over and over, really expensive things, ate out almost incessantly instead of saving money with groceries and making meals. She was also a bad person and owed a lot of people money but I won't get into that because that's not the point. Until 2 years ago, I had lived with my parents and then when I was 18 they kicked me out (Not because I was a bad kid but because they were both intolerant and weren't there to raise me and my dad believes in raises kids until they are 18 and kicking them out). I lived from house to house, thank goodness for friends, and got two jobs and made money. I didn't know how to save it though. I was constantly short for rent when I finally did get a place to stay. Desperate for a fix, I reached out to my cousins, aunts and uncles. They loved me and gave me a chance that even my own parents didn't. They let me live with them, patiently loved me even though I have insecurities and scars from my childhood, taught me family dynamics, helped me get into college, and taught me how to be smart with saving money. They emphasize it's not what you make but what you spend. So fast forward, I got into a little bit of credit card debt when I moved out of their house into my boyfriends and I was buying lots of things to make it feel like home and was just pretty reckless with money. Although I successfully paid it off, I have more medical bills than one can imagine. I had been institutionalized for feeling suicidal, gotten dental help which I was neglected of for years thanks to my cousins and Uncle and aunt who encouraged me to get my health taken care of. Doctor visits, braces, etc you name it. Every month I pay for my phone bill, car insurance, gym membership, gas, cable &amp; electric bill, as many medical bills as I can handle, and now I'm starting to pay off my car as well. And I've paid for my own speeding tickets, when my car had issues with it. I pay for food which I think I do pretty well with because home cooked food is much cheaper and last longer than going out to eat a lot. I try not to buy bottled water and just use canteens and any available water I can get. So I have learned about saving financially and I have gotten better but there's still a problem. My family wants me to prove to them I'm learning to be a responsible adult and so they said they won't help aid me to go back to school until I have $1,000 saved in my account. It doesn't sound hard if only I didn't have medical bills as well as my new car payment. Plus, I don't know how to cut back on grocery spending and be happy. And also, I think I have a spending addiction. No I don't go out and buy a bunch of expensive things but usually a dollar here a dollar there at Walmart that really add up. I'll go in for buying one thing and leave with 3 things. This has really destroyed my relationship with my family. They watch my bank account (long story but essentially they're doing it to help me and monitor what I'm doing) and I'm constantly feeling guilty, watched, and confronted for even simple purchases like from the food store. I know I have an addiction because I will obsess over certain products or something until I end up buying that product. And if I don't, I obsess. I feel happier after I buy something but the feeling doesn't last long. I think I'm scared of not having anything or doing without or being in poverty like I pretty much was when I was younger. It's just hard because growing up my friends had families who really cared about them and still pay for everything so that my friend just has to do really well in school. I know it sounds petty and I don't mean it to be, but I do get very envious of that. I have major depression and I guess sometimes I use buying things to fill an emptiness and I've seen a therapist but he can't explain to me why I addictively spend. And I know people say you can stop if you really want to but I genuinely feel like I just can't. It's like a rush that takes over me, a compulsion, my heart will beat fast over it. I don't really have any other addicts, not to substances or anything which is good. My mom maybe had an addictive spending issue along with her borderline personality disorder and other issues she has. My family is full of alcoholics and mentally unstable people if that helps. I'm sorry this was so long and disorganized. But please could someone help me, why do I do this how can I change and how can I save 1,000?",14Mar2018,2
63,"About a month ago I moved in with my best friend. The first couple weeks were great, but lately she’s been neglecting her responsibilities. One of these responsibilities is a dog that needs to be kenneled when nobody’s home. I’m definitely a homebody, but she likes to go out and hang out with coworkers and her boyfriend after work. Plus her friend has been in the hospital the past couple weeks so she spends time there too. All these things would be fine, except for the fact that she doesn’t come home beforehand. She either doesn’t care that her dog is kenneled for more than 12 hours, or she assumes that I’ll take care of her (take her out potty, feed her, play with her). I love dogs and it makes me really sad that she (the dog) is being neglected, but I refuse to take care of her dog. If I give in, it’s going to become a normal thing and I’m not okay with that. And her kennel is kept in the living/dining area, so I’m not able to sit at the table and eat dinner, or watch tv, or do anything in the communal area, without the dog whining and barking from the kennel. All of this is in addition to her not keeping her cat’s  litter box clean, not doing her (and her bf’s) dishes (especially when the dishwasher is empty), and her not telling me when she has guests coming over.  I’ve never been good at this sort of thing and she’s very insecure and gets extremely defensive and snaps whenever someone so much as insinuates she’s doing something wrong, so any advice you have is greatly appreciated.

I get tested it comes back negative. About a year and a half later I get the symptoms and am told I have herpes and around that time so does my girlfriend. I prolong that relationship way to long because I am scared of being single with herpes. Eventually I get courage to break up (a month ago). I am currently am so content and happy with my life I love being single. But I have herpes. 

I really dont know what to do I havent told anyone. I am on medication (valtrex). What happens now? I really want to peruse relationships and or have casual sex but the idea of telling someone I have herpes terrifies me. I go to a small university and if it got out although I dont really care I think people would probably judge me. Being in university is already pretty hard I am paying my own way through without any other financial help. I am not trying to have a pity party but it feels kind of unfair (I know sex is risky). Even talking to girls now is kind of scary. I really want to kind of explore and meet new people how do I do that with herpes?

Are people really going to be okay with it if I am on medication and use condoms, there is a bunch of websites that say your reading into it to much but honestly I dont know how I would of responded if a girl told me before my diagnosis.

What do I do about going out. By this I mean what I do in cases where I am drinking at a club and a girl is interested in me. Morally and practically do you think for one night stands a person is obligated to disclose.

Around three months ago I went on a birthday camping trip with some friends organized by ""AC"" and ""MK"", a couple who wanted to gather our friend group for MK's birthday camping celebration in California. It's was a great time, fun was had by all but alas I had to leave the group early for work on Monday (I tried to get Monday off like the rest of the crew but couldn't swing it.) I packed up my gear Sunday night and used little red wagons provided by the campground to get my stuff back to the car. It's a beautiful small, six site campground on private land run by a very sweet hippy family. They live near within earshot and made us the most amazing blackberry pie I've ever had. 


Looking back now my sleeping bag must have fallen off the wagon while I was rolling it back to my car, anyway I threw my stuff in the car and headed back home to get ready for the work week. Got home around 1:00am, threw my camping gear in the storage unit under my place where I'm normally keep it and didn't give it much more thought. I realize I should have taken inventory of my stuff but I was wiped out and tired, just ended up heading to sleep. 


Several months later now and I'm packing my gear for my next trip and realize that I don't have my sleeping bag, I immediately remember that the last time I used it was on the AC &amp; MK birthday camping trip. I pop open the gmail thread with everyone who was there and send [this](https://imgur.com/rrELjQ1) message, within an hour AC responds with [this](https://imgur.com/6qimVXp) message. I'm STOKED as you can imagine, the bag was found! I bought it for a few hundred bucks with a little inheritance money after my dad passed and traveled around NZ with my brother so it's got some real sentimental value (all the more reason for me to have done an inventory of my stuff I realize.) 


Anyway, I'm so happy that AC &amp; MK ended up with it that Monday when they loaded out and brought it back home with them. I will say though that it's a bit strange that they didn't send of a quick email to the group ""Hey somebody left a really nice sleeping bag behind that we found on Monday, anyone missing it?"" I mean...I was the only person to leave early so who else would it belong to? No one else was using the camping property we had rented from. Anyway, about a week goes by after AC mentioning that he had the sleeping bag and so I sent him a text and [this](https://imgur.com/5ooz3ev) conversation happened.


I feel foolish for not have been super alert about each of my items when I left the camp site but I also feel strange that when AC &amp; MK left the camp site to drive back home with someone else's sleeping bag they didn't mention anything. No quick text? No email to the group thread we had been using to coordinate the trip once they got home saying ""hey we have a nice looking sleeping bag we found, anybody missing it? 


I do remember getting a Venmo request a few days after the trip from MK/AC for the campsite fees &amp; food/booze we all shared so they were aware enough to do that.

Anway, I'm open to any and all opinions. I realize I fucked up but I also kinda want to talk to them about the lack of follow through on their end, they could have left the stuff there at the sweet hippy couples house and I coulda cruised back up with a huge ""thanks for holding on to it"" while enjoying some amazing blackberry pie and picking up my sleeping bag.

So I am a 15 year old male, and I am on the short side compared to most others (5’3”). This will be important later.

I have this “friend” that I’ve known since 2nd grade. For the first four years he was a great friend, always hanging out and always fun to be around

The last few years have not. Now I understand everyone does mature during middle and high school years, and it can cause some changes in personality. That is exactly what happened here.

Throughout middle school he matured early, but his personality changed as well. He started becoming more aggressive, and treating me worse and worse.

Since then our relationship has sort of deteriorated. On one hand, he and I do still enjoy hanging out sometimes, we share the same like of memes, we can sometimes get along.

But other times he’s a complete nightmare. He’s tried to break into my house three times. He will constantly do things that I ask him not to. If I try to stop being friends with him, he’ll follow me around. He is very pushy and wants to know everything. He will often get into my (and others) faces.

Now it’s important to note that this is not a two person deal. Him and I both have the same core group of friends (neither of us have moved), so it’s very hard to cut only him out of my life. I have talked to my other friends and they do agree that sometimes he goes (way) overboard, but they don’t want to cut him out of the group.

So I guess what I’m asking is, what do I do from here? I’m not really confident in my ability to ignore him or anything like that. I’m just wondering, should I try to end the friendship or try to fix it?",14Mar2018,2

My problem is that I struggle with making a commitment like this. I have a lot of other interests that I want to pursue in life and I see so many possibilities and choices...

I could go to engineering school and work for spacex.
Or be a politician and run for office.
Be an amazing fitness instructor or artist.
Or be an budding entreprenuer and make something amazing.

All of them sound amazing, but I’m sitting here wondering if any of them is right for me and whether or not I can live with the decisions I’m trying to make or willing to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve them.

At the end of the day, I just want to be happy and find something I can be ambitious about. Leave my parents house, finally make some money where I can finally do the things I want to do and find some kind of meaning or goal to run to that’ll give my life meaning...

And what’ll truly make me happy.

Before I begin I want to say that she is 19 and working part time while going to school and living with her mother. I am 21, also going to school and working and living with my parents as well.

I will say that the future I want to have doesn't quite match up with hers. She is very dependant on me emotionally, even said ""You're the only thing that makes me happy"". She is kind of clingly, but not in an offsetting way, just needs me for constant validation.

She is under a lot of stress. Work, school, housework, lack of food and funds, major depression. I'm scared that if I did leave her, she would actually commit suicide. She's aware of her situation and the drain she puts on me, both financially and emotionally. ""If you want to break up with me I understand"".

So, I’m not really even sure where to start. I’ve had depression all my life and I’m very insecure about myself and living life is a constant struggle. 

One thing I really hate about t myself is how fucking weird I am. Like, I think something is wrong with my brain. I’m really scared to say this but I get off to thought of me gaining weight. I’ve always thought that big girls were very sexy and I’ve recently got into the feederism community. Upon doing that I’ve started to eat excess amounts of fast food in order to gain a bunch of weight. And doing this turns me on or the thought of someone help me gain weight. I masterbate sometimes over 10 times a day because my weight gain turns me on so much. I can’t even get off to regular porn. What is wrong with me? Sometimes it turns me on to imagine me so fat I could barely fit in a car or through a door. Sometimes I really want to do it too.

I don’t really care about the health problems that would come with it. I’ve tried killing myself 2 times. I still wish I was dead.

99,"**TL;DR** The person I love most calls me one of her ""best friends"" but is hot and cold and it's driving me insane

For some backstory that may help: I'm a girl, I have social anxiety disorder, I already go to therapy, I am attracted to her but its too complicated, and yes I recognize my need for more friends but I absolutely suck at  keeping them and feel like I've given up on hoping to make more. 

For this part I don't even know where to start. My friendship with her has been up and down from the start. The second I met her 3 years ago I thought she was so cool, but kept my distance because I could tell she thought I was kind of weird. I was intimidated by her and we didn't talk until we were on a trip together last summer. She alternated between clingy and guarded towards me the entire trip, but towards the end I held her while she was crying. She avoided me for a while after which broke my heart, but a week after we got back home she said what I'd done was exactly what she needed and proceeded to text me everyday since, confiding in me about the big and small, crying in my arms a couple times, and eventually calling me one of her best friends. 

(And yes, we text everyday but I try to only text if I have something to say and leave the conversation on a high, whereas she's the one that will ruin it by trying to text me until the staleness is unbearable and it's just a lot of pressure sometimes because she has so many friends and though she told me I'm in the top 6 I still have a lot to compete with.)

The problem: I can't feel secure and satisfied in this friendship no matter how hard I try. In many little ways she shows a line drawn in the sand between me and the other people she's close to, and overall I feel like she's more critical of me simply because *I'm not them.* Her favorite people complain to me that she's too affectionate, too clingy, texts too much, gives too many gifts, etc; what she does for others I do for her even though she's not invested in me like she is in them and a part of me wishes she would give me a chance because I feel I could appreciate what they don't. The way she treats them I treat her and the way they treat her she treats me and it's so ironic. She both tries constantly to impress me and is annoyed by my attention and I can never find the right balance. She keeps talking about how much she likes quality time, and clearly her ""best friends"" aren't interested but when I try to suggest something fun we could do together she is reluctant and dodges making plans. I wanted to show her that I'm interesting but she's not impressed by my interests and talents. She likes to be known on a deep level, and I can sense her emotions but not as naturally as her best friend/sort of crush can so she doesn't really value that and I feel like a failure. I always want to be the one to be the hero that saves her day and I hate that I think like that, I feel inferior to her favorites often, it's like if I were the only one or number 1 that I wouldn't have to constantly prove my worth. I wish we had a ""thing"" of our own to bond on so I wouldn't keep comparing myself to them but she never lets us have a thing that is ours for too long. She also doesn't remember things I like or ask about what I may be going through, but that may be because I'm three years older. I always want to talk to her but after it's been good for a while and we seem to be getting closer she'll have a day where it seems like she's fed up with me, so I give her space and it's back to the drawing board but it makes me so anxious that she needs space and a reset from me that she never needs from the favorites. We text everyday, but in person-and often in text too-I'm usually too afraid of saying something annoying to say anything at all, so it's harder for her to connect with me, and she also doesn't seem motivated to anyway, she usually ignores me in groups if one of her favorites are part of the conversation. She started us texting I love you to each other, but now if I text it first she often ignores it-if I say it aloud she ignores me-but still makes it seem that the love isn't reciprocated even when she does text it back by saying ""Love you!"" Instead of ""I love you."" I can be too focused on being perfect, often missing things or interpreting everything as a sign she hates me and feeling like I'm letting her down and I just wish I could ask her ""WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME"" but she might not even know.

On one retreat a couple months ago she was so sleep deprived that she lost all inhibitions and started treating me like I was the best thing to walk the earth. It was hilarious, but it was nice to have her want me around all the time and me not even have to try so hard. But then the next day she was so cold to me and I don't know if I messed up or if she was just back to normal. A part of me always wonders what it would be like if she was that open, loving person toward me all the time and I often wonder what happened. 

One of her favorite people told me ""You chose her...but she has to also choose you."" It's the classic You're Not Your Favorite Person's Favorite Person ""problem"" that I guess we all deal with at some point. I feel myself getting possessive and obsessive and all the things I promised myself I wouldn't be, and I'm trying so hard to hide it from her but fear she can tell subconsciously. 

People tell me to stop being friends with her all of the time, but one I don't want to stop and two this is something I need to get to the bottom of because so far my friendships tend to turn to this direction and I want to know why. I feel like I'm the toxic person and I just want to learn how to turn this friendship around.",14Mar2018,3
100,"So here's the deal. I am newly married and have had a rough patch in the job and career areas of life. I have been unsure what I've wanted to do, but have taken a lot of interest in the real estate game. I've been working for an insurance company and that has burnt me out. I floated my resume on Lensa, ziprecruiter, indeed, glass door, and LinkedIn in order to find jobs in my area. I have gotten several offers, but the strangest one was from an Italian real estate development and brokerage firm based out of Italy. Upon further investigation and talks with their personnel manager over email and a few phone calls my wife (an architect) and I have cultivated a natural and healthy degree of skepticism into the jobs credibility and legitimacy. That being said we aren't sure if it's a scam or if I am some middle man. On the other hand, the job has been validated in several ways. I'll break it down. I accepted a realtor position. Part of my job is acting in fiduciary with monies from American clients and sending it onto offices in Europe via money gram or western union. The training period is specified to be 2 months and at the third month I am to get a license. The pay is excellent (because the company, ""has no overhead in the US and thus can pay our employees a higher wage"") and there is also a 5% commission for all transactions that I clear and send onto the European hq. Here are my delimmas: there is a lag in communication due to time differences of timezone, the company uses western union a lot (which is a sketchy way to send money) also money gram or other p2p systems, I am to use my bank, walmart, etc. to cash or deposit the monies that are to be sent off (whichever is easier as I am dealing with checks in the first place because ""our clients have every right and usually do pay via check and US checks aren't processesable in italy""), it's a hassle calling the number they provide as all the ladies I talk to are Italian and speak heavily accented English, I've inquired about speaking to an American employee in a similar role as me and have had difficulty getting that done as ""our employees are confidential and will need to give permission before you may contact"" (1099 i guess comes with those restrictions). On the other hand, with every discrepancy there is an equal amount of validity in the position: a job description that is thorough and informative, a gameplan for employees to follow, a signed contract, somewhat clear instructions provided by the trainer, outlines for the companies long term growth into the US, ive purchased a docier with the italin business bureau that validates the comapny, no payments or personal information required on my part (until after the forst probationary month when i will have to give my liscense etc in accoradnace with us employment law), very good earning potential (something not advertised or heavily matketed by them. They dont seem to call any attention to this making me think its not a scam) etc. Etc. For every concern I have i am met with mostly valid and thorough defenses. Overall it doesn't feel scammy to me, at least not until they say I have to send them money before the check clears, and they absolutely emphasize that it should clear quickly but that there is a bonus remuneration if I get the money to them in 24 hours. So, I am at a bit of a loss. It's too good an opportunity to pass up, and I am too skeptical and traveled to let myself be duped, but something will smell fishy until I've done more with the company. 

Ps. There is simply too much information for me to put it all in this post (so take each line with a grain of salt), but so far I've approached the position with great care and attention and they have given me no reason to not trust them. I just want your thoughts.",14Mar2018,3
101,"Background: I work at the in-patient food services of a certain hospital and I have been here for a little over a year now. I remember when I first started, some old timers who have worked there for a long time ( 5 years +) asked if I was getting bullied and if so, just ignore them. At that time, I found it odd but I never really felt like I was being personally attacked but more on criticized because of my mistakes and I didn't mind it then. I was new so I thought it was normal and took at as a learning opportunity.


As time goes by, I did notice that they (older ladies) seem to enjoy gossips about each other, complaining behind each others back, and ratting out one another. At first I found it funny, and figured that as long as I keep my head down and do my work, I should be fine.

Fast forward to today: I have been working a while at the department, been commended even for my hard work by both patients and supervisors and night managers (not bragging but just for contrast). A trusted friend/coworker informed me that while she was talking to the diet tech (similar to a supplement supervisor but much lower in rank) about being guilty for not being able to help me because i was swamped, the tech told her not to worry because ""she's lazy"" (referring to me). And she was surprised because I am far from it (tonight was actually one of those shifts i only took 15 of my 45mins allotted break to help catch up and make sure my job is complete). it's quite known that her and I are friends that time, the tech seemed to have forgotten or probably doesn't know. My friend tried to defend me saying I wasn't ( I really am not) but the tech insisted.


When she told me this, I let it roll over my shoulder and told her not to worry because people know better. And I genuinely thought I was okay until now. Being the overthinker that I am, I couldnt help but feel betrayed because that tech was one of the people who commended me and told me I was a good and Hard worker... And I don't know how exactly to feel or what to do. Should I tell my supervisor about it? Is this HR material? Is this something that I need to talk in person with those imvolved? Just ignore it?...


I know this also happens in other workplace environments so maybe... I can learn from this experience when I move on from this job.

102,"My boyfriend (21) and I (19) have been together for 3 years and lived together for 2. Two months ago his symptoms started. He previoiusly had severe depression and at the time he had been off of his antidepressants for about a month. At the end january he smoke weed for the first time in awhile and he had the worst anxiety attack of his life, I believe this is what triggered the symptoms to start. He came home after smoking, crying, thinking that the FBI was going to track him down. I brushed this off as his anxiety attack as he had never said anything like that before. The next few days he endlessly researched things on Wikipedia and came to the conclusion he is the next messiah of this generation. I was worried but I thought it was a breakdown of sorts. He started losing sleep and panicking about bombs being hidden in the house. He broke our basement door and smashed his glasses. At this point he was hearing voices. I then admitted him to our local hospital and they only kept him for 3 days and sent him home. He was given new meds. Over the next couple of weeks he continued to check in our attic for bounty hunters and stay awake. Every time I would be doing my college work he would try to break my laptop because he felt the FBI were listening. He then went back to the hospital and stayed for a few more days. He currently is slightly better but the voices are still strong. He worries I'm being targeted by the government and he need to protect me. I try to keep him occupied and take his mind off of things but when I talk to him he just stares at me in silence. Is there anything I can do that may help him cope more?

they kept saying this. now, one of these two people already dislikes me from past things happening - just last year, he literally kicked a soccer ball into my computer only because i told him that what he said was wrong (we were talking about computers and he said that phones were more powerful than computers, and i was just saying that it's very unlikely, but it depends on the phone, this doesn't really matter though). anyway, like i said, he already disliked me.

i started writing an email to a higher up, not because i wanted to be a snitch, but because i was unsure what was even happening, and if money was involved in something like this, a large action can be taken in my country. i just wanted to know what was going on, so i sent the email.

""Hi,

In the last session of Wednesday (today) I was in the Steam elective, supervised by (teacher). During this lesson, a couple students (A, B) were leaving class every few minutes, and searching for something. It was likely money, from another student. I’ve been told that it was $10 worth of C’s money. I’m not inclined to believe this, given the person that said this was A/B. The reason that I am bringing this up to you is the fact that $100 was mentioned, and I’m not 100% sure what happened. Nonetheless, a large sum of money has been mentioned and brought up, and I feel that this is something action should be taken upon. There are a fair amount of “witnesses” per se in the class, and these can be shown to you when asked.  

(Also, this is not my complaint, but as I am writing this email, they are trying to “blackmail” me, and continued to say certain things to me that I didn’t appreciate, but again, this didn’t bother me too much, and it was mostly A).

I’m sorry if this should be seen as me being a “snitch,” I just feel that this whole thing should be figured out, as a large sum of money may have been involved.

Thanks for reading.""

(A) is the person that kicked the ball into my computer.

That paragraph with ""blackmail"" wasn't really me complaining,  i just thought i should mention it, and looking back, it wasn't really suitable for me to say.

nonetheless, i sent the email, and they started telling me that no money was actually involved and that it was all a joke. i wasn't inclined to believe them, so they started saying i was a snitch, a nerd, and that i should go back to the library. again, these names are pretty stupid and petty, so i didnt really care about them.

was what i did right? i just wanted to get to the bottom of it - if someone's money was taken, i want to make sure that it's given back - i just wanted to do something right for once in my life.

please, was what i did even remotely right? even my parents are calling me a snitch and saying no one will ever want to be around a ""snitch like me."" i shouldn't let these names get to me, but they do, especially from my own goddamn parents",14Mar2018,1

105,"We met when I was walking up to the door of the grocery store and she was just asking me what I'm doing. I saw her later at the checkout, literally trying to go trick or treating, hoping the person at the grocery store would give her something I guess.

From appearance she seemed clean and my town only has about 600 people in it, so it's not a hotspot for vagrancy, I thought she was just drunk and being dumb, but then I notice she's not wearing any shoes.

She asks me for a ride, she gets in, I ask where I'm taking her, she just says ""just let me out when you get sick of me.""

So I went to drop off my groceries and head over to a friends house, where I'm staying the night tonight. I can't take her inside, not only is she a complete stranger but she's acting either drunk/high or literally mentally unstable.

I say that because she keeps talking in a weird way, like repeating conversations she's heard before or something, it's like her way of explaining something is to narrate the events, rather poorly at that.

Anyway I didn't come to the realization that she might not just be  drunk, but actually somebody who has some mental problem, until I had driven to my friends town, about 30 miles from where I picked her up. She said she had friends out here but when I got here she didn't have anywhere in particular she wanted to be taken.

So then I didn't really want to drop her off in the cold with no shoes or jacket or anywhere to go or even a phone... I realized she may not have known I was going to take her so far from where we met, and where she presumably lives as well.

So I let her sleep in my car, outside of my friends house. But she's just out there talking to herself.

She had some papers with her, she was recently released from a small county jail after a 5 day stay over marijuana possession. She's eluded to the fact that her husband gave her the black eye she is now sporting, and he's also in jail, and the state took the kids while they were in jail. But I'm just piecing that together from fairly incoherent conversations.

Anybody have any thoughts on how I can help her? She just strikes me as being a depressed loner who is either really fucked up on drugs or really fucked in the head, but even if the case were the latter... I don't feel right abandoning her on the side of the road or something. I don't want to call the police, she didn't threaten me or make me afraid for my safety, just is very difficult to converse with and a little obnoxious.

I thought about taking her to a hospital, to see if maybe she's just too high or if she needs some sort of psychiatric help or something. So far that's the best thing I've come up with, but I'm sure after having just been released from jail on possession, if she WAS high, the results at the hospital would likely put her back there again.

Thoughts? I'm sure a lot of people would say I should have never helped her at all, should have never done this or that, but as somebody who personally has NOBODY in life, and also suffers from severe depression, I thought... if I were in a state where I couldn't behave rationally, I wish there were somebody to look out for me, rather than take advantage of me or something.

So I'd love to hear what you guys think I should do next. I'm about to lay down for bed, she's out in the car - hopefully sleeping - but probably just hiding from ""snakes.""

My car is not valuable, nothing in it is valuable, and she doesn't have the keys. Worst she could do is bust out my windows or something probably, which honestly would suck but I feel like she's worth the benefit of the doubt. She's been out there about 4 hours, it's really cold out... but I left her with my winter coat and a pair of thick gloves.",14Mar2018,4
106,"Around the end of 2015 I was studying at university in the big city. For various reasons, I ended up having a series of severe panic attacks over the year, and eventually my parents decided that they were pulling me out of university because they ""couldn't afford to keep bailing me out.""


Ever since then, I've been living in my parents' house, finishing my degree online, stuck in my hometown away from my friends. And I absolutely hate it.


Back in Big City, there were job opportunities, fun things to do, professional networking events, more space, just more people my age who shared my interests. Here, everyone is either a miner or a nurse, the economy is shit, there's almost no entry level jobs in my degree field, nothing to see, nothing to do… it's so frustrating and oftentimes I have difficulty getting to sleep at nights because I get so scared that if I fuck up, I might have to spend the rest of my life here.


I don't have a lot of friends here, and the majority of the ones I do have are scatty and just want to sit around playing video games and avoid thinking about life or the goals that they don't have. I'm still in contact with some of my friends from the city (who I went to school with) and I see their snapchat stories of going out and having some fun on Friday nights, when I'm getting ready for work in the morning or just trying to catch up on study. They've finished their degrees, starting their adult lives and some of them have travelled to London to start jobs over there…. I haven't left the country yet.


My parents and brothers don't respect me. My brothers both work full time- one is in a trade and one is a trainee engineer who got a full time job through a friend of my dad. All they do is talk about tractors and mechanics and since I don't really know anything about that, I just have to sit on the sidelines of every conversation that they have. Even if I try to ask my dad a question about what they're talking about, he just says ""you don't have to worry about that"" and continues with the conversation. It just makes me feel like a baby.


I have a part-time retail job,and have made a few connections through networking and cold calling local people who work in my field. That has helped a lot but the message that I'm getting that, although Hometown's economy is starting to get better, the place I need to be if I want to develop my career is the Big City… I look for jobs in the Big City online and there's just masses of jobs and internships in my field popping up by the day, compared to not a lot here.


Last night, I decided to speak up and tell my parents that I want to move back to Big City because there's so much more opportunity there. They flipped it. My mum said I couldn't afford to rent there on a retail wage, I was uncommitted and unmotivated (which isn't true), and that I have no idea what life is like in the real world and how to support myself. I tried telling her that I should try and go now so I could try and get some experience to compete with all other kids my age who will be going for graduate jobs this year, but she wouldn't listen. My dad flat out forbade me from moving until I finish my degree at the end of this year.

108,"Friend and I were supposed to meet up to look over a house I'm looking to rent. I specifically asked him to promise me he'd show up and he said yes. We had a minor argument later, not a big deal at all. I forgot about it a minute later.

On the day, I texted him without any response. Called him a bunch of times but got ignored. I clearly saw him as ""Online"" on Whatsapp but he outright ignored me. I asked him why he was respond and he just said: I'm busy. 

I normally wouldnt care if someone ignored me over an argument but this guy gave me an explicit promise which he didnt deliver. Besides never trusting him with anything ever again, I feel that cutting him out entirely is a valid response at this point. Am I exaggerating?

117,"**Short version:** Ever since I was young I've been fascinated by the mind and perception, so I've wanted to do psychedelics for as long as I can remember. About three years ago, however, I decided I wanted to be a cop. The two are more or less irreconcilable, as few departments will hire you with a history of drug use beyond a little weed (lying is out of the question). I decided a few months ago that being a cop wasn't for me, and resolved to jump into the world of mind-altering substances, but a conversation with a new friend has made me reconsider; retiring at 42 with a pension is a pretty sweet deal, and I have the rest of my life to do drugs. **Do y'all have suggestions? Things I haven't considered? Advice, perchance?**  
  
-----Extra details-----  
  
**Background:** I've spent the last six months in what feels like a transitional period. I'd call it a mild crisis. I just finished my associate's degree, I'll be starting my junior year at [whatever college accepts me] this fall. I've always been terrified of death, and recently I've been trying to come to grips with my mortality. This also bled into a fear of catastrophic climate change, which is a minor factor in the decision. Three months ago I temporarily moved out of my home country to try and fix myself, as I'm lonely and not happy with the person that I am. I think that's all the relevant background info.   

**Reasons for policing:** I think I was initially drawn in, at 16, for cool points, but it turned into a serious interest. I've never actually *wanted*, or felt drawn to, another career. The only other option I can think of right now is politics (but to try and mitigate climate change, not because I think it's interesting). Law enforcement could be a good way to get into that. Police work seems fulfilling, and that matters more to me than the money. I respect people who choose to do it (with good intentions) and I think it would help me get closer to the person I want to be. I'm passive by nature, and having a plan makes it much easier for me to do things. If I disregard law enforcement, my fear is that I'll amble around vaguely until I realize I do care about money at 45. It's a stable career that pays decently, and if I retire after twenty years I should be very well set up for whatever I choose to pursue next.     

**Reasons for psychedelics:** ""Do copious psychedelic drugs"" has been on my bucket list for as long as I've had a list. If I wait until after college and a law enforcement career, I think I would be missing out on an incredible opportunity for personal growth and development while I'm young enough to act on it. Psychedelics can be a powerful tool for self-exploration and insight, which is something I'm definitely in need of right now. The science also suggests they can help with fear of death, which I could use some help with as well.   

**Reasons not to become a cop:** ""I'm scared of not having a plan"" isn't the best reason to do something. I think our drug laws are messed up, and I don't want to ruin people's lives over arbitrary/immoral laws. Shift work, especially graveyards, shortens your lifespan. Given my fear of death, I'd like to avoid that. Given the state of the environment, spending my whole career driving an SUV around would definitely take a psychological toll. It seems selfish to take a job that I'm interested in, as opposed to going into science or government to try and fix what I see as the most pressing issues. Working nights, as most officers do for the beginning years of their careers, would make farming very difficult. Unfortunately, I'm quite set on having at least a subsistence farm/homestead situation set up for the rest of my life (or until we can all upload ourselves into computers).    

**Reasons not to do psychedelics:** I have some good reasons to be a cop. I can always do drugs when I retire, but if I do them now the law enforcement door pretty much shuts. I've turned down so many drugs already, what's a few more years?

118,"**tl;dr:** Hired resume writer who I thought was good choice. Delays and mixed messaging leave me completely frustrated. Nothing has been written yet 3 weeks later, not sure what to do.

**Background:** I had been underemployed for two years. I feel like I haven't been getting as many interviews as I should. Likewise, my resume is starting to go out of date. After researching some writers and talking to a couple people I decided on one and paid. The writer I chose seemed to genuinely care, knew my interested area and claimed to have an idea on how to go forward.

**The main story:** It then just went south so quick. After giving her the payment we scheduled a call to talk. Due to scheduling conflicts that took a week. She then needed an extension for a couple more days. On the day of she called the wrong number despite me giving the correct number twice (once in original phone call email, once in the rescheduling email). This was despite us talking over the same phone number when I was looking to hire one. It was then completely pointless of a call. She treated me less like a recent graduate and more like a mid-career professional. She wanted me to have certain area expertise and the fact that I had experiences in different jobs and in different parts of organizations (such as outreach, internal affairs, etc.) annoyed her. We ended the call with her saying I should focus on what I want to apply for in terms of organization structure.

So over the past week I was pretty lost, and she didn't at all help. I had an interview, and the email seemed less ""here's some actual support/things to consider"" and more ""cover my ass"" like ""our clients find our process really helps them do well in interviews"". She didn't even ask me what interview I was going on! Then I came to her with my concerns, since to me the jobs all required the same skill set and all listed the same requirements in the posting. She suggested a job in either X or Y, then later walked back X, then I got an email from her agency saying they had Z opportunity pop up and saying she thought I was interested in it. When I asked her expressing my skepticism she said I wouldn't fit into Z and responded as if I suggested it. So I get that it was a spam email the agency probably sent everyone currently talking to their writers but I'm still absolutely frustrated that she was acting as if it was my idea when its her and her agency sending mixed messages.

**Where do I go from here:** So now it's been about 3 weeks, not one draft has been written, and I'm incredibly frustrated more than normal with the job search (which is normally a frustrating process). I want to bring up asking for a refund, but I can't find anything on her agency's refund policy and I am worried she will not only tell me no refunds but also then give me a shoddy product in return just for asking.",14Mar2018,2
119,"I'm in college right now and I have never been that big of a person on school. It's something that for the most part I haven't worked as hard as I should be or put in as much as effort as I should be, it's not because I don't want to it's just because I don't find school as interesting as some people would. It is really hard for me to put forth effort in school. But all of this changed when at my college i joined the real estate club and attended one of their events. At the event their where five speakers that talked about their experience at my college and what they do in the real estate industry. After the event the people on stage handed out their business cards to everyone. One of them eventually became my mentor. When I had my first meeting with my mentor the first thing he said was ""It's a cold world out here and other than your parents nobody cares about"". He then went on to talk about how a good gpa is so important in college. I then revealed to him that my gpa is bad at the moment and he told me his story of how he had a bad gpa in college at first and he didn't realize how important it was to have a good one. He then went on to tell me that no one cares about me or him and how much he regrets not putting more time into his studies in college early. Pretty much the whole point is after I had this conversation with him it completely scared me to the point where all I did was go home and excel in my homework and classes. I had never really done with before either but I was putting more effort, time and attention into my classes and trying harder. This only lasted for a week and the point I'm trying to make is how can I keep this going so I can keep excelling and doing well in my classes? What tatic can I use? How can I keep It going? Also how did that conversation make me want to excel in my classes even more? Thoughts?",14Mar2018,2
120,"So, the thing is I'm an international student of medicine with a scholarship. I earned it because in high school I had great marks.

The first month I was really motivated, studying and attending most classes, but after that I got poisoned and had to stop taking my meds for a week. From this point on, everything went straight down: I stopped going to classes, missed several exams and have ""academic doubt"" (failed classes which I need to pass). I don't know how to solve this problem, I don't want my classmates or teachers to see me, everyday I wake up I don't want to get out of my apartment, but I know that I'm on a very fine string right now on the way to deportation.

Last week, friend b asked to come and stay with me also this weekend and I stupidly said yes to her too (I'd just found out about her mum and felt I couldn't say no) 

I told friend a and he said he wouldn't come down if friend b was here. I asked him if he could explain that to friend b and if they could come to an arrangement between themselves. He refused because he said he hadn't made the arrangement with her. I then had to call friend b and explain that friend a wouldn't come down if she was here (she still likes friend a and is sad that he doesn't like her).

129,"So, I'm designing a game. It will be a medieval, survival, open world PRG, if things go to plan. It's still just an awkward mess of ideas, concepts and hopes. Nothing is official. But I would still like some help with naming. See, I'm not good with names in general. But medieval names? I have trouble naming one off the top of my head, which you may find odd considering I'm making a game based in medieval times, but shush. There's a reason for that that isn't important right now. It will take place on a fictional island and I want the name to start with an ""A"", and be called something along the lines of ""Abby"" or any other version of ""Abby"", because I wanted to name it after my girlfriend.

TL;DR: I need a name for an island in a game I'm making and need a medieval sounding name that starts with ""A"" and preferably sounds similar to ""Abby"".

Random NPC names I can just grab off a list but I usually like to have the names of special characters and locations to have a special meaning or origin behind them, so I may post on here more requests for name ideas so... anyone who's good with medieval names, keep in touch?

132,"So, I decided to start playing Dungeons and Dragons with some friends on tuesday. Invited some people, and... I'm super uncomfortable about half the jokes they make.

Turns out, 3/4 players are bigots. And It's not a surprise to me, because I've heard them talk in private and thought ""Sure, everyone is entitled to their own opinion."" But, holy shit, get 'em in a room together and it all becomes constant anti-semitic jokes.

What was I expecting, right? Well, not this.

We played cards against humanity tonight after a long session of character creation, and it made me rethink if I really want to have these people in my life at all. Sure, there were fun moments, but then every joke became ""Fuck the gays/jews/africans/afghans/islamic."" I just about had it.

I've naturally drawn some distance from these people, but since I started this whole DnD idea up and they were very proactive about it, I decided ""Sure, why not? These two know each other, one of them will bring his friend, and I can get this other friend down for this. Sounds good."" I regret this so much. I'd feel like a total asshole just straight up cancelling it after only two sessions, but then again, they are total assholes and every time they open their mouths I just lose my cool a lil' more.

Worse, there's this guy there who loves to belittle me, hell, everyone and anyone at any chance he gets. And not the kind of fun-poking-joke you would expect from a friend. I recently got kicked out of college, and he just made a joke about it in front of fucking everyone, and I went ""Dude, too soon."" And he just went for it HARDER. Didn't apologize, didn't even care. Conversely, he is also the guy that has stayed up with me past 3 am helping with my studies, and we've shared what I feel are genuine moments.

Then comes the fact that he's homophobic, transphobic and just about every phobic, while I'm out as bi to most my friends, and transgender to some. Not him of course.

One of the other guys is someone I've known since I was like 8. And he's always been straight with me. Only he got fucked up somewhere down the road, and I don't know how/when/why, but this guy who was like a brother to me growing up, became this crazy conspiracy theorist who believes lizardfolk low-key run the world, and the zionists are behind it all. Of course the anti-semitic asshole eggs him on while simultaneously belittling him for being a dumbass, and then they both laugh at it.

I'm just fucking baffled, and it's clear as day to me that I should not only stop this toxic circle jerk, but that I should probably cut ties with them, just on the fact that I'm uncomfortable around them, and that one of them is an active piece of shit, tbh.

I just don't know how to do it and have a lot of mixed feelings about the matter. I never liked this side of them, but thought ""Sure, I can turn a blind eye to it, because it's not all of who they are."" And it's not. But it's this big, glaring bit that the harder I try not to look at it, the more they remind me of how big a part of who they are it is. 

I really suck at confrontations, and get guilt tripped easily, without anyone really doing much at all. I just go about the whole business in my head and go ""Maybe I'm being too harsh.""

But enough is enough, for fucks sake. I need advice on how to tactfully cancel this whole thing. I can probably let the friendships naturally fizzle out and keep my distance, but even then I fear I'd feel terrible about it, especially towards the guy I've known over half my life.

134,"I didn't really know where else to go for this, so I figured I'd ask here. Without diving into too many details, I graduated high school in 2008. In the years since graduation, I've attempted to take courses at the community college closest to me, but never managed to complete a degree. The best I've ever done is earned a few gen-ed courses. My problem has been a lack of motivation to say the least, and I developed a habit for dropping classes. On my transcript with that school, I have over 10 'W' withdraw credits in addition to a D and an E. It's an absolute disaster.

I want that to change. I want to finally earn a degree and start getting my foot in the door to a real career, I've wasted too much time. I want to start over with a fresh start. I desperately want to find a way to rid myself of the 10+ withdraw transcript. That's when I had the idea of attending a different community college and starting fresh with a brand new transcript to build on. Can I even do that? Would a CC out of my county even accept me as an out-of-county resident? But more importantly, if they did, would I be forced to transfer my transcript over from my first CC? Or would I have the choice to not transfer and start as a first-time student?

Or would it somehow be in my best interest to just remain at my current school, and re-take the low-grade D and E courses to bring the GPA back up? But what about the 10 withdraws? Surely that's something major enough to make me want to switch schools entirely to avoid it becoming a likely issue with employers.

147,"A friend of mine is dropping all her contact with friends, with family.
She's honest and sweet but she has some problems.
She's easily persuaded and can get down really quick. There's about 5 people she's considering friends and not much family only her mom and stepdad.

She's been in a relationship for 2 weeks and all these 5 people have said she's talking less because her boyfriend doesn't like her friends. Today she ran away from home to live with him. She's completely isolating herself. 

I still keep talking to her and persisting but that's gotten me an angry phonecall from the boyfriend already because I was 'getting in the way of his relationship'. but she didn't seem to think that was a problem. 

I need advice, how to get through to her. If this goes south she'll end up with nobody left and then I'm afraid she'll try something stupid again.",14Mar2018,1

Obviously I’ve never seen the show I’m going to, so I can’t say for sure I’ll hate it, but knowing myself as well as I do, it seems highly unlikely. Is there anything I can do to distract myself during the performance? Or perhaps a way to sort of force myself to enjoy it?

Basically to sum it all up, I (and a couple of other friends I chatted with) were talking about how we were excited for college but sorta afraid of the transition because all we've ever known was being a child and having our parents provide for us. And since this will be the first time in our lives that we're living away from family and kinda have to take on new responsibilities (paying tuition, food, room and board, other essentials that require budgeting), I thought about moving out just to get adjusted before leaving. I for one do not take big changes very well and have really bad anxiety so I don't want to freak out mid semester from being homesick and not being able to focus on studies. I wanted to see if other kids were thinking the same and their overall opinions on the matter but they seem to think it's a waste and silly. They also allude that their parents have them covered and they suggest chilling over the summer, but again I myself and others can't just casually live at home without paying rent. It's complicated to explain, I know, but I just wanted a second opinion from some folks who are older and/or actually came from the same circumstance as my friends and I.

155,"Hello,

My 34 year old brother has been depressed for atleast 5 years now, never officially diagnosed but all the signs point toward this. He's unemployed, never showers, gets mad for extremely petty things, hates himself and blames all his problems on my parents.

His daily routine is waking up at 2-3pm, eat and staying in his dark room gaming and jerking off all day.

I also think he's sexually frustrated because of all the crazy shit he says to me and his ""friends"". Here's a couple of examples of what he did/said to me. First he came up behind me and started grinding(I'm his younger brother btw) while I was doing the dishes, kept asking how big my dick was and asked ""Why can't I ever fuck your armpit?""

So yes, he's all kind of fucked up.


About the possible drug addiction.

Every month he gets some money, about €1200 total, from his disability. And a few days later it's already all gone.
He doesn't pay rent, doesn't pay for anything at home and has barely any bills. He also has major sinus problems, constantly blowing his nose and there's always blood. My nephew told me that my brother confessed to him that he did cocaine, this was about 6 months ago I think.

So the bloody nose, loss of appetite and constant temper tantrums for the most petty shit on the planet is why I think he's still snorting cocaine. I have no real evidence or experience with drugs so I'm just guessing.



About me coming to reddit for help.

You might think I care about my brother, but I do not. I really would not care if he just disappeared or died. I do this purely for my mother who is slowly becoming depressed because she doesn't know what to do with him. Whenever I try talking to my mom she becomes angry and dismisses me and keeps watching TV. She hopes that the problem goes away by itself.

158,"I grew up with three brothers, the one who is the closest to me in age is the one I am so angry at constantly. I can give many examples throughout childhood of why my anger is felt towards him, but it’s been since I moved back home after college when things have gotten genuinely bad. I wish I could say that we were at least screaming at each other every night or communicating in some way, but I guess the best way I can describe it is that we are essentially using Cold War tactics on each other. 

My reason for being angry at him is that in my mind is the he is the most selfish, self-serving, fool that doesn’t even realize he’s like that, or if he does he doesn’t care. He contributes nothing to our parents house that he’s been living in rent free for the last six years after failing out of college. Our parents even pay for his gas money and other expenses from time to time, and he does nothing to repay them for their kindness, no household chores or even spending time with them. He works out so this apparently gives him the right to eat all the food from our fridge even items that we need to make dinner for ourselves later in the week, he doesn’t even seem remotely remorseful for that or offer to replace them. I could even forgive fin for some of these things if he just spent time with our family rather than treating them like a door stop. I don’t respect him, at all

The worst part is that I hate myself, either because I feel like I’m being too nice to him, and therefore don’t respect myself, or because I get so angry at him that I feel like it would hurt any future relationship I have with him. I really want to be close to my brothers, when we’re older with kids and families I want us to do stuff together as a family, but I just constantly feel like he doesn’t even care to be apart of ours. 

I’ve tried to talk to him but he gets so defensive that’s it not worth the effort. I have more things on my plate than trying to put energy into a relationship that I’ve never gotten a ounce that he’s the least bit interested in a relationship with me. 

I’m not financially secure enough to move out yet but I’m working on it. I just need someone advice, please. ",14Mar2018,3

So I first start, I was not exactly raped, more like sexual harassment. Did not happen by a woman either but .... to this day when I think about it, I still sometimes get those goosebumps

*(think of it like the whole uncomfortable feeling you feel if your whole body is covered in cockroaches or ants or the uncomfortable that there is something crawling out of you from the inside)*

It happened a few years ago so I do not remember the event exactly like yesterday but I do remember it a bit.

It happened when I was around age 18 or age 19 I think and where I wait for the bus for college, you met a few people but I was always a bit lonely and felt really estranged from the rest of the world becuase i suffered from depression for a long time *(that time, it was way worse)* and had trouble interacting with people becuase the last time I tried to interact with others,  I was severely bullied so it left a mental scar in me.

Any way, I eventually made friends with a guy who worked in the airport nearby. He was around his 60s or 70s. Never borthered to ask or even ask what his name was, I was just glad that I made a friend for once in my fucking lonely and miserable life that time

One day, he had to take the bus with me and we sat together. It was a very bad for me becuase the depression hit me to the core that day and I remember that the guy tried to comfort me.

And I meant .... comfort me.

He put his hand on my leg, almost very close to my groin. I remember he was smelling my hair too and I remember him telling me to go to his place and make me comfortable.

During that time, I did not do anything or say anything becuase I was so severely depressed that I did not care but I declined his offer anyway.

But the thought stayed for a while later and it finally hit me that this guy was REALLY close to me and when I thought about it, it made me really uncomfortable and it still does to this day.

But the biggest discomfort was that for a long time feeling alone, I felt that I made a friend regardless of his age and I realised that I made friends with a potential predator. 

To this day, I feel like a big idiot that I did not know the difference because my social skills were so poor that time. I felt like a big fucking pathetic moron and I let him get so close to me during that day and becuase i was so apathetic that day, I let him get REALLY close to me. That thought alone made me feel really uncomfortable that I let him get that close and it hit me to the core and that I was too weak, too less of a man to even notice it or even stand up for myself.

It made me feel so sick to my stomach and the image of him and me ... doing it while feeling helpless or not even being able to do anything about it, that image was stuck with me for a long time and to this day, I express a lot of self-disgust for it too.

*(surprisingly, this was the time when I feel very uncomfortable or feel very anxious or feeling 'naked' in a bad way, I have a strong urge to masturbate. I am not sure if there is a link but I do not remember having this feeling before this event happened)*

I know that this sounds a lot like an exaggeration over a more incident with someone where not even a rape happened or not even penetration but the thought of it, the image of me having let someone get that close to me and I was too much of a pathetic fucktard to even doing somthing about it, that disgusted me to the very core and I sometimes still have nightmares about it

*(yes, I told this to my therapist one day. There is a hunch that this is a strong emotion for me because I might have experienced something like this before during my bullying days but repressed it. And yes, I suffer from severe self-criticism and self-destructive thoughts and behaviors and have a sheer low self-worth that if self-esteem was a real thing, it would have been as fragile as glass. But I am working on it and it takes time)*

I never told anyone about this because 

1. I am a guy. Despite there is a lot of awareness lately that even males can experience sexual harassment or sexual assault, there is still that taboo inside me that because I am a male, I should stand up for myself and act like a man

2. The thought that always comes to my head if I am over-exaggerating about this. There was no penetration, no forced sexual assault, nothing *(thankfully)*. But my reaction to that event and I ruminated it over and over and over and over again, it left me with a disgusting feeling in my head and made me feel very pathetic about myself and there were times that I was angry too. So I wanted to keep it to myself so that I would not be judged and called a SJW considering that these kinds of people are getting a lot of negative attention lately",14Mar2018,0

169,"Hey Reddit, (I hope this isn't too lengthy), I'm in my early 20's - outta college by a couple years now - and I recently started a full-time job in my field. Aside from the longish commute and shit pay, it's a fantastic entry-level position. And I could move up internally. The career path I chose is one where I will never make good money probably but one where I can be proud of my work and look forward to doing it. I worked for higher pay right before this in a similar field and it was soul sucking. I don't need money to be happy, but I'll be damned if it doesn't help. For example, I'm living at home, I can't move out (which would make me happier) until I make more money. Additionally, I'm still uncertain on this career path, and in general what I'm passionate about. 

I'd like advice on where to go from here. Right now, I'm telling myself to stick it out for at least a year because it could turn into something better and it's still good experience plus I'm saving up money. I have a habit of running away, which I'm desperately trying not to succumb to, but I can't shake the desire to learn how to speak fluent Italian and move to Italy to take language classes and work as a tour guide or something close to my field (communications/journalism).

I'm in dire need of financial stability but ""normal jobs"" after a decade of trying that route, a brief failed stint as a Royal Marine recruit, rejections from countless jobs, negative feelings towards my own skill, and basically just failing at everything that matters has destroyed my ego and left me in a very bad depression with insane amounts of anxiety and insecurity.

180,"  I've (22M) been close friends with this girl (25F) for about 4 months. Met her about a year ago when she was dating my cousin. Over the course of the last few months we got closer and closer emotionally, which is normal for my female friendships I just have a higher emotional comfort around them. 

  We got comfortable staying over at each others places and sharing a bed. After a few nights like this we ended up hooking up and having sex. When we had the sex talk a few days later she expressed that she didn't want to date anyone right now and that me being her ex's cousin (practically brothers) wasn't something she felt overly comfortable with. For a few weeks I was a bit hurt about the situation, I'm a very physical person so the sex got me a bit attached in that way. 

  About 2 weeks ago I started getting the sense that she was talking with another guy, and was intimate with him at least in the same way me and her are. We began talking a bit less and it just seemed a bit more distant, but I undestood maybe she wanted to give some space after I expressed interest in her.

  In an attempt to get close again I decided to ask her to be my wingman, as I figured if me and her won't work out romantically. I might as well have her help me, since I still want her to be a big part of my life. 
  
 She liked the idea and we plan on trying out the wingman situation this friday. I guess what is very different about our friendship is that we still have some level of physical intimacy even though we aren't pursuing anything together, the sex was a one time thing, but about once a week I will still stay over at her place and we will cuddle, pretty intimately at that. Holding each other in our arms, holding hands, spooning, etc. 

 For most guys this would be awful, since no sex. But I'm a huge cuddler and it makes me feel close to people, I'm a bit feminine in that respect as I prefer it over sex anyway. It's more meaningful to me, even as friends. At this point I'm not hung up on her emotionally, our friendship is fine, we are back to talking a good amount, she gives me cuddles whenever I want, and she wants to be my wingman.

183,"LONG POST - I ask for serious life advice, thanks everyone!! 

I'm a 17 year old boy who is about the start the final year 12 exams, I don't have much passion for school as all the subjects I'm studying were pushed towards me as I was expected to be a lawyer by certain individuals. When I was younger I was interested but the prospect of it, but undergoing that career path has long since left my mind. 

My life triangle:

Social Life - 4.5/10
Grades - 5.5/10
Sleep - 2/10 (medical condition) 

My currently enjoyed activities:

Gaming
Learning/playing piano
Soon to be Boxing (Despite being a 5'8"" still growing kid I like it as it makes you fit and teaches self-defense) 
Reading horror stories eg. r/nosleep
That's it so far for that. 

Friends:

I don't have the fortune of having one best friend with whom to share everything with as my current best friend is even better friends with multiple different people. My regular friends aren't really the sensitive, close people to talk with, rather the people to just play games and have a fun time with. 

Family:

I'm not emotionally close with my family, they know next to nothing about my true personality. My father hasn't decided to see me  or my siblings for nearly 6 years so I've become emotionally damaged and highly envious of families with both parents. My sisters always have my mother to show them the way of female life whereas I don't have any father figure to teach me the ways of my own life (my mother's efforts are truly impressive mind you) My brother is not a person I want to learn from due to certain reasons I'd prefer to keep discrete. The only person I've ever had teach me first hand aspects of being a man is my grandad who I look up to the most aside from mother. So yes I am disconnected from my family in many ways. Personally I've always wished I had a big sister as they usually end up teaching you better things and not teach you the path of being a deliquent.

Relationship status:

I am not socially awkward with females or anything, but occasionally I don't know what to say exactly and I get a little flustered. I haven't ever had a legitimate girlfriend before (don't be too harsh) and I've never really gone out of my way to try, I'm not being ""up"" myself or anything but I've always been taught the way of being a gentleman to the females, I'm not some white knight fool or anything, just a traditionalist and I want to give one girl the best life possible and make her feel wanted and cherished. So in summary, no girlfriends yet but when I find one I want to make her life great.

So with ALL of that information about my life shared to strangers on this website, I need some advice regarding the following:

How do I find motivation despite the current issues life hss thrown my way?

Should I bother to attempt to find a girlfriend at this stage of my life?

Advice for school? I'm performing badly and I want to improve but I see no reason to, what should I do here? 

Should I bother to try and mend family life or just leave that part alone? (my father can be contacted but I'm not sure if it's worth it) 

Is it too late to find friends in life? If not where can I find people with similar interests and hobbies? 

I have an array of different mental and physical health issues that I'm not bitching about, With help from mother these issues are being slowly fixed! I'm not afraid to admit I have real OCD, not the highly publicized bullish*t that people claim to have, it picks away at my mind constantly with terrifying and disgusting thoughts always plaguing my head and causing random outbursts of anger, I even foolishly hit myself on purpose but I think I'm over that, I'm just afraiding of doing something to another human as I personally am not a rude or violent person. I've chosen to tell you this simply for context.

190,"I’ve had this problem for a few years now actually and it’s only gotten worse over the years. 

My school has a strict dress code and part of it is being clean shaved everyday, I have no problem sticking to the other rules but this one specifically troubles me. Every time I shave I break out in a rash of razor bumps and ingrown hairs, and my beard grows at the rate that it’s considered breaking the rules a day after I shaved and it’s dark black from all the times I’ve had to shave in the past three years.

I’ve tried everything to prevent rashes and ingrown hairs (“shaving maps” creams and lotions, conditioners, aftershaves, aloe vera) and even tried electric shaving as an alternative, all of which just reduce the breakout slightly or do nothing at all.

The school forces me to pay for disposable razors and shave with nothing but water, which I once got a bacterial infection from called impetigo, which is just plain disgusting.

I’ve gotten doctor notes excusing me from shaving daily but the school won’t accept them. I’ve even gotten a note claiming I’m a Muslim and shaving is against my religion but the school just doesn’t care.

It’s not like I’m not asking my school for special treatment or anything, I’ve tried everything but they just keep on putting rules above my personal health and making a HUGE deal out of the simplest issue and I don’t know what to do anymore. I just can’t help I have shite skin.

I don’t think this is the same thing. I absolutely love my wife, and our life together, and our relationship is far from failing.

I don’t know if I’d say I’m depressed, but I’ve recently been feeling somewhat unfulfilled in life, and the idea of raising a child together and teaching him about the world and everything in it just really sounds like an amazing thing.

I’ve talked to my wife about it and we agreed that it probably won’t happen for another year or two, but I just wanted to get some advice on how to look at this.

197,"What is the best course of action for me to take? Budget has flat out refused to offer any reimbursement at least 3 times. Local district attorney (I'm a resident of California, but the Budget office was in Rome, and the reservation was made online via Kayak)? News channel investigator? Kayak? Small claims court?

Story:

My girlfriend and I recently took her mom, and her elderly grandparents, and grandfather's sister to Italy for a 2 week vacation (their first time traveling internationally). Our itinerary started in Rome and ended in Venice (with stops in Florence and her grandfather's small ancestral town outside of Rome). To facilitate the travel between Rome and Venice, we reserved a rental car to pick up on December 26, 2017 at 9 AM from a specific Budget location.

We were required to be out of the apartment we rented at 11 AM on December 26th. Upon my arrival at the rental car office at 8:30 AM (the opening time listed for this office), it was closed. I called Budget customer service at 8:51 AM (1-877-477-5807) and they suggested I wait for another 20-30 minutes and if the office was still closed I could call back to cancel the reservation. Obviously this was not going to help me with the rest of my group needing to leave the apartment by 11 AM. I waited a while longer and when no one showed up to open the office, I left at 9:36 AM and took an Uber (added expense of 20.69 euro) to Roma Termini train station to see if the Budget office there could help me.

Upon arrival at Roma Termini train station, the Budget representative stated they were out of cars at that location and could not help me with the fact that the other office was closed. I also spoke to another car company at that location and they were also out of cars. It was now past 10AM and with time running out until we were out of an apartment (with 3 elderly travelers in the cold of winter in Rome), we decided to contact an NCC (private driver) that we met the previous day to see if he could drive us to Florence. Fortunately, he was available and agreed to drive us for 500 euro. With NCC on the way, I took another Uber back to the apartment (added expense of 19.21 euro).

NCC dropped us off at our hotel in Poggibonsi, outside of Florence. We had planned to use our rental car to get around and explore this area. Below summarizes the added expenses in Poggibonsi.

December 27th
 
To San Gimignano: 30 euro via NCC Claudio
Return from San Gimignano: 40 euro via NCC Simon
To/From Dinner: 80 euro via NCC Claudio

December 28th 
 
To Poggibonsi train station: 40 euro
 
Once at the train station in Poggibonsi, we took a train to Florence (added expense of 45.60 euro). Once in Florence, the elderly travelers took a taxi to the hotel (added expense of 20 euro) and the rest of us walked 15 minutes. Again, Uber does not operate in Florence and we took taxis to get around Florence on December 28th and 29th for a total of 136 euros.

From Florence to Venice, train tickets for 6 people were over 400 euro (since it was last minute) but I was able to find another NCC to drive us for 400 euro.

To summarize the expenses we incurred due to the Budget office being closed:

39.90 euro for Uber in Rome
500 euro for NCC from Rome to Poggibonsi
190 euro for NCCs in Poggibonsi
45.60 for Poggibonsi to Florence
156 euro for taxis in Florence
400 euro for NCC from Florence to Venice

The total expense of not having a rental car was 1331.50 euro. The cost of the rental car would have been $487.64 (due at pickup) or approximately 410 euro. Therefore, the added expense was approximately 921.50 euro. Not only was this a significant financial strain on our trip, this experience was been a significant emotional strain as well. This trip was the first and only international trip for my girlfriend's grandparents and grandfather's sister (and a trip to their ancestral hometown at that) and it was marred by incompetence and unhelpfulness on the part of Budget. Not having the freedom of a rental car seriously affected our ability to get around efficiently at our own pace and had a huge detrimental impact on the trip. These memories cannot be remade, and for that I am truly regretful -- regretful for putting my faith in Budget. ",14Mar2018,1

200,"INCOMING WALL OF TEXT


It all begins when my 18 year old cousin moved in with me to study at a college in my hometown. Now, I'm 19 and in my house, it's just me and my mum, after my father's passing in 2012.

So, he starts living with us (since 2017) to complete his studies. I consider him a little brother. We do everything together. Watch movies, play games and all that. I trust the guy. Whenever he needed money, he'd ask from me and I'd happily give it to him but recently, he started asking for money saying that he needs it to buy books and all that but instead I later find out he uses it to buy snacks and all that. Basically using my money for purposes other than what he says to me. Stuff like that has recently made me lose a little bit of my trust in him. 

But those trivial small things. I never paid too much heed to those things until this particular incident. Last december, I bought this black t-shirt with a tiny green lantern logo on the chest. I loved it and wore it around everyday. Then, I guess I kinda just stopped wearing it because I forgot all about it until yesterday when I caught my cousin wearing this t-shirt. When I saw it, it still didn't click that it was my shirt. I even asked him, ""Nice. Is that new?"" and he said yeah. As I said this, I caught that little green lantern logo on the shirt and THAT is when I realised that it was my shirt from december. I didn't say anything to him at the time because I didn't want to make him feel awkward. 

I spent the entire day depressed because I trusted him and he pulls that shit with me. I didn't even want to tell my mum because my mum would probably just kick him out and I didn't want to screw up his education because my mum supports his education financially. His parents are not too well off. But it killed me that my cousin, whom I saw as a little brother does that to me. 

I did what I think was right, I confronted him privately about it last night and called him out for lying to me and saying that the shirt was new. He replied back saying that he thought it was our other cousin's (she comes by once in a while) and that he found it in his room and started wearing it because he didn't think it was mine.

Now, I don't know if he was telling the truth but nevertheless, I told him that if he took it because he wanted it, he could have just asked. He returned the shirt but now keeps distance from me. Probably because it's awkward for him now. 

I'm just wondering if I made the right choice in calling him out over the shirt like that. I'm not even sure if he was actually telling the truth about him thinking my shirt was actually the other cousin's. 


TL;DR :- Cousin might have stole a shirt from me. Confronted him about it. Now he keeps distance from me and it kills me because I considered him a little brother.",14Mar2018,1

We get along super well, and he is my best friend. This is my first long-term relationship. My boyfriend is into small, petite girls / Instagram fitness girls. I'm tall and broad, literally the opposite of what he is usually into. He talks about women that look like the opposite of me, and has never actually complimented my body. Whenever I send intimate pictures, he just goes ""nice."". And whenever I show a model that is similar to my body type, he doesn't care for it. Whenever I show a slender girl, he does. I compliment him constantly and show a lot of attraction towards him. I understand that he has a preference, but all my friends have boyfriends who constantly talk about how beautiful they are, and they are so proud of them. I feel like I shouldn't be the way I am, as if I'm taking up too much space, like I am not feminine, attractive and cute, because I'm so broad. I used to not mind the way my body looks, but since I've been with him that confidence slowly went away.  I don't think he realises that he hasn't complimented me / that it makes me so insecure.

211,"To preface, I have been in my current relationship for over 2 years, and I am so so much in love with him. 

YET, I still find myself having vivid dreams about my ex, who I was with for 4 years. These dreams are always super vivid and put my mind on him for the day or following days after. 

Usually I just brush it off and let it pass, but, not only was last nights dream realistic, but after I woke up from it, I later continued the dream. 

It just seemed odd, and has put me a little out of place for the day, and now I can't stop thinking about it. 

I have done everything to put my ex out of my life, as he was both physically and mentally abusive, but I still find myself in these situations. I don't know if it so much that I miss him, but I almost long for him in a way. Our families were close growing up, and before we ever were in a relationship, we were very close friends. 

I had always thought of him as my ""soulmate,"" I guess. Despite everything, he was one of the only people in my life to understand me on a deeper level than anyone else. 

We ended on a nasty note, he basically stalked me and would threaten to steal my dog while I was at school, hurt or kills him self, among other things. Because of that, I regret that there was no real closure between us, but I felt I was doing what I had to do at the time to keep myself safe and from falling back into everything. 

Sometime I have an urge or reach out and see if he is ok, but I know better not too, and I don't plan on doing so now. 

I'm just curious why, after all this time, I feel I can't let it go or move on from him, even though I've been in a loving and supportive relationship for over 2 years. For the most part I have moved on and I love my current boyfriend to death. I have no doubt in my mind that he will be the one I marry and continue my life with.

This was my first time hanging out with this guy outside of work, and he was not my boyfriend or even a close friend and I honestly think that's an odd thing to immediately do. I don't want to introduce anybody until I'm ready, and sure they're going to be a regular part of my life. But my family thinks I'm disrespectful and rude, and they're pretty much saying I can't go on a date or hang out with anybody without asking for permission and letting them “screen” them beforehand to decide if they're suitable. I think that's ridiculous as an adult woman living in the 21st century, and  it suggests I have no good sense or discretion about who I choose to hangout with. And now I am genuinely afraid of ever telling them who I'm hanging out with or letting anybody pick me up at my house, and would prefer to lie because they refuse to respect my boundaries.

I'll often rush through conversations near the coffee maker because I don't know what to say and I'm not sure if they want to talk to me. I'll say hello quite quietly if someone says it to me. Etc.

This is where the problem kind of takes place. My ""friend"" is constantly passing her work on to me a majority of the time. I work as an IT Admin for this small business so there are a lot of times when things are slow for me and I don't mind helping at all, but in recent times her work load has been primarily shifted to me.

228,"Hi, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. I really only lurk reddit and I'm using a throwaway because this is really personal. Here's some background (wall of text, sorry):
I've never really had a good family relationship. Growing up, my mom was an alcoholic, my stepdad was extremely religious, and my dad was pretty much not in the picture. I am an affair baby as well. I have two half siblings who have never really treated me well. Only my brother and my mom (she's been sober for quite a while now) have treated me well as of late. I developed anxiety and depression really severely in early childhood, but everyone in my family always wanted to blame it on something else. My dad always told me to ""just think positive"" and believed that would magically make it all go away. My mom even blamed it on eating sugar, which is pretty ridiculous considering it runs in my family.
I moved away for college a year ago to get away from all of this. My dad didn't want me to move. He's a control freak over me and wants to be in my life even though he's only contributed money--no emotional support whatsoever. He calls me and wants to know everything. He calls regularly and wants to know my friend's names, majors, what they're like, where they're from, what their parents do, etc. 
My best friend and now SO lives where I moved to and I'm overall much happier here. His family treats me like one of their own and I could never be happier. My dad doesn't know about my SO and their family, he wouldn't approve at all, so I am scared to tell him.
I used to get straight A's in high school, but now I'm pushing myself less but it makes me happier. I think I always tried to get attention from my dad through my grades to no avail. 
My dad is never supportive of anything I do. I think the only time he was supportive of me was when I had an eating disorder, and always pressured me to lose even more weight. 
I called him yesterday and he said every time he talks to me over the phone I'm more and more of a disappointment. That was a really big blow to me. Especially considering how I remembered something he said to me before I tried to forget when he said that.
Last summer when I was home, he told me that during a time I lived with him (I had no one to take care of me but him, so I moved in before I started high school) his girlfriend and her daughter hated me, so he hated me too in order to impress them. They would poke fun at me, exclude me, just treating me generally awful when my dad wasn't around. Whenever I would discuss this with my dad, he denied it and yelled at me for ""refusing to get along with them."" He would often tell me how women get jealous and I was just vying for his attention because, well, I am nothing but a ""typical woman"" to him. When he told me he did it to impress them, it all clicked in my head.
I have never been hurt so much in my life. I really, truly don't know how to love someone who can do that to their daughter. Obviously, the easy answer would be to cut him off. But he supports me financially, even paying for the portion of college scholarships haven't covered. My mom and stepdad don't have the money for that, so I would never ask that of them. I think sending me money is the only way he knows how to express compassion, it's like the only thing he has. 
I just don't know what to do. It hurts me so much to think about how much he's hurt me. I want to reach out and try to understand him. I hope that he loves me beneath everything he's told me. But he's so strong headed I don't think it's possible for him to understand my viewpoint.

tl;dr: My dad says I am more and more of a disappointment every time I speak with him, but he has never really shown me affection besides sending me money and paying for tuition. I want to repair my relationship with him, but do not know where to start because he's so strong headed that I don't think he'd listen to my view.

229,"Hey Reddit, so my roommate is moving out and has packed a bunch of my stuff. Our relationship has been strained for about 6 months and we've hardly talked due to an issue with her general irresponsibility around the apartment. When we have talked she's been very viscous and uncooperative. 

She's been packing to move out for a week now while I was gone on spring break. When I came back yesterday I noticed a bunch of my stuff is missing from the common areas. It's small stuff like mugs, kitchen utensils and some food items. However, it is my stuff that I bought with my money. 

I addressed the issue with her and she's claiming she doesn't have any of it. Our apartment is tiny, there is no other place this stuff could be. Before leaving for spring break I cleaned and put all my dishes/cutlery away and put the rest in the dishwasher and ran it. Those are the only two places my stuff could be and it isn't there. In hindsight I should've taken pictures of where everything was, this isn't her first brush with taking things that aren't hers. 

She is one of the most stubborn people I've ever met and I really don't want to have to make this an argument and have it go around in circles because I'll just end up without my stuff and a bollocking from her. What should I do? ",14Mar2018,1
230,"Hi everyone,
I've got a mate who joined our school at the start of the year. We became friends and had some good laughs, and everything was going well. About a couple of months ago, he started winding me up in Maths, when a new girl (who I think he likes) joined our class and who sits in front of us. Now, every lesson he keeps putting me down in front of her and it's not even like he's trying to be funny. He just patronises and insults me, and when I try to tell him to stop he just carries on regardless - but he doesn't (or he does for about 5 minutes) and the girl laughs along a lot of the time. He's OK outside Maths, but in our group of friends he's now started to have a go more and more often. 
I'm quite a peaceful person, but I really don't appreciate him doing this and it's getting to the stage where he does me more harm than good. What's the best way to approach this - should I try and find new friends, or just be straight with him, or is there another way to fix it?
Apologies if this sounds like a pointless school drama, but it is upsetting and any advice would be much appreciated.",14Mar2018,1
231,"Last week my(20F) boyfriend(22M) broke up with me after an argument that was more one sided (me). We have been together 5 yrs, live together and do not fight often at all. I left to stay with my parents for a few days to let everything cool off, and when I came back, we talked and we are back together. I didn’t go into depth with our conversation. Today I text him and asked him for reassurance that everything was okay, because something just feels off now. He replied “ I love you, I was thinking I made a mistake cause no one would love me as much as you could. I wouldn’t want to find another love. I love you.” 
It is reassuring to know he loves me. But him saying that he couldn’t find anyone else that would love him more seems kind of off putting. I would have felt much better if he said that he couldn’t love someone else more than he loves me, instead of vice versa.
I’m not sure if I’m just overthinking it. Please let me know your thoughts, and please no hate. ",14Mar2018,1
234,"I’m 23 years old, and have been in college since 2014. I started out at a private university playing football, and got hurt halfway through my sophomore year. Had to get surgery and take a year and a half off of school. Now I’ve been back to school for two years (public uni), and I’m behind schedule. My back (what I injured) continues to cause problems for me as sitting in classes causes a considerable about of pain, especially for someone of my size (6’6”, 315lbs). 

I struggle with attending classes due to the pain but also because I really don’t feel invested in my schooling. I am on track to get a political science degree and go to law school because my father is a lawyer and that would allow me to get into the field directly out of law school and have some connections. However, I find myself less and less motivated to do so, not only due to the decreasing interest I have in law, but also because I have not had much in the way of help in planning my future. 

Football was the main focus of my high school to college transition, while less importance was placed on what I’d actually be doing with my life. I’ve only worked at a select few jobs including construction, bouncing at bars, and now my current employment at Olive Garden. These don’t seem to be great resume builders but it’s all I have. Despite going to a “college prep” high school and getting good grades, nothing/no one really prepared me for how the college world works, and how to maximize my time in school. 

I just don’t know if I should buckle up and finish my degree, or should I drop out and look for another way to advance in life. I am scared to do so because I have thousands in loans from my time at the private uni, and I’ve put this much time and money into it already. So it seems to me like I have no other option than to continue stumbling through school, even though I hate it. 

Redditors, I am simply wondering if anyone had any advice, or anecdotal insight that could help me in my struggles. Best of luck to you all, and hope everything for you is going well. ",14Mar2018,1
235,"My mother passed away on October 22 of last year of cancer. I finally bought a copy of ""The Grief Recovery Handbook."" It is highly regarded and a pioneering book for grief. In it, they talk about finding a partner to work on recovery with. They mention you can work alone but that it is highly recommended to find a partner to work with. They suggest finding someone at work who has recently lost someone, the grocery store, health club, religious or social organisations, etc. Basically any where. 

Long story short, I sang at a funeral for a man who died a month ago. He was the owner of a business I frequented. One of the nicest and kindest individuals. I'd met his wife before, but only a few times over the past few years. At the funeral she hugged me and told me the only part of the service she'd cried was when I sang. She then sent me a brief message thanking me for my kindness in singing, and was appreciative. Long story short, I do know her a bit. This being said, is it weird to ask her if she'd like to also read this book and be my grief recovery partner? They suggest finding someone who went through a similar but not exactly the same loss. Obviously I know I may get turned down, but she's the only person I know at this time who has lost someone recently. It was her spouse though of 26 years, and he's only died a month ago. Would it be weird to ask this? Has any one else experienced a similar loss? I just don't want to work on this alone. I think it would be better for me to work with someone.

I also have ADD and take medication that destroys my appetite, so I have even less energy through the day. It had a substantial affect on my psyche because I felt extremely isolated and stressed for two years. Most of my work I could pull out decent grades, but the math grades suffered. I was seeing a psychologist but it didn't seem to do much for me, and I just felt hollow inside. In the ninth grade I moved across the country and entered a private school. The moving was very stressful for me, and interacting with the teachers made me unfocused. I got through everything except for mat, which I failed. The school agreed to put me in ""Foundations Math"" which is the bare minimum needed to pass high school with. So it went fine the first year, because I was still trying. Howeve,r as I entered grade 11 there were sharp pains within my abdomen. Turns out all this stressed had caused me some sever IBS, and my math work began to suffer again. Now I'm in grade 12 and am still facing most of these problems.

I have been driving my coworker home for a little while now (because of the winter weather we have) and I am getting tired of being the one to have to always do it (with no compensation for time/gas)

I dont like conflict and want to find a way to tell him nicely; my reasoning for feeling like this is due to the fact that he only talks to me when he needs a ride/always imposes it upon me, instead of waiting for me to ask...

245,"Finally after searching for ever I have one job offer for sure and I'm hoping another by next week since I feel very confident I will get the position for the other placed I interviewed for (I would rather have this position)

Anyways, the actually job offer I received was for a Clinical Assistant position at an addiction recovery institute that's non profit. Bachelor's required and a CDCA certification (which they will pay for since I don't have one) and they wanted to pay 13.45/hr. I declined and said it's not economically feasible for me to accept the position. Then they asked what my desire pay was. Really minimum I would go is 35k and I told them that. They said they will talk to some people and call me back. Well they called me back 4 minutes later and offered 15 an hour. I assume they are desperate to fill this position. I told them to give me until next week to think about it.

So...while I wait for the other place to call to see if I got the job, which pays 15 an hour but it's 5 mins from my house (the other is 35), and all my previous experience and people I know/will get to know will be better for me accepting this position I'm waiting to hear back from. IF I don't get this position, do I think I can call back the other place that offered me the job and ask for 16, if they say no, maybe 15.85/hr? If so, how should I go about doing this? Really I want 35k, and I feel that's reasonable to ask for with a place requiring a bachelor's and other certifications, which would be 16.82/hr.

She also disregards everything I say and only talks about herself. If I don't reply to her within an hour, she sends another text. If I still don't reply, she sends a third text. 

I told her the other day when I saw her that I don't like small talk, which is why I don't really text because I prefer to not talk if there's nothing to talk about. Even with this information, she continues to text me on a daily basis from morning to night. What doesn't make sense is that she's the most bland texter ever. I'd give her a few sentences as a reply then she'd reply with no more than five words. When the conversation ends, she just starts up a new one by asking ""Wyd?"" again. 

She's extremely clingy and it gets worse every time I hang out with her (which I try to avoid doing often). She already had a few close friends cut her off before, but she doesn't know why. She also talks shit about one of our other friends, yet does some of the same things herself. 

Everything is just negativity all day every day, and she uses me as her diary.

As the title says, I feel lost. Not the kind of lost where you don't know where to go in life, or where you don't have anyone you care about or that cares about you. A kind of lost that is somewhat deeper (?), as in I don't feel understood, and I'm not sure if I will ever be happy, and I'm fucking overweight and I've tried so many times to lose weight but somehow it has never worked, and my grandma died on Monday and she got me thinking about all of this. And I also feel alone and the world scares the shit out of me because there are so many things, and you can never grasp all of them and things that I dont understand scare me sometimes. I have a feeling I might be retarded or schizophrenic or something and everyone is just not telling me because of some reason.

I feel like I wanna say so much, I think so much, but I never really do when it matters. SOmetimes I feel like I have a deep understanding of the world and people, but then I remember how little I am and that I might just be another number in the books. I have a lot of ""friends"", I think they are my friends because I like meeting up with them and doing stuff but I really only have two or three close friends that I really trust. I don't want to cut my friends off, but I really don't know as I am too fucking shy to reach out to them and they also never really reach out to me.

I feel like my main problem is my weight. I think I can be super confident but my body is in my way (184 cm, 6'2 that should be - 125kg or something like 275 pounds). When I try to stick to something it works well the first week or so but then I slack off. There is not just one moment where it all breaks down but slowly always. I have thought about getting a tattoo like Casey Neistat to remember to stick to my plans. Also I love to drink, but every time I do I end up being wasted as fuck and not remembering anything, which is super embarassing and I hate myself for not knowing my limits in eating or drinking or really anything and I just wanna be happy but it seems so hard. Also I just started crying because I dont know what the fuck is going on and Im just hoping to feel happy one day and this is very overwhelming. And now I just noticed that I havent been thinking about this much or anything since I got to my computer, so technology might be numbing.

Now, I am just completely panicked about the idea of having no one to talk to and no one to do things with. I don't see myself even leaving my house much anymore because I have nothing to do. This is making me feel really fucking upset and I have no clue how to handle this situation. 

I should add that I do have social anxiety and although I am taking medication it's not as easy as just going out and making friends and joining clubs and sports. I struggle a lot with making friends and keeping them. 

If anyone has any advice on dealing with this, thank you. ",14Mar2018,3

278,"28 year old male, just graduated college about 8 months ago with a Bachelors in Psychology. Currently $42,000 in debt (college, car loan), with about $12,000 in my savings.  Currently renting a house and do not own one. Through college I managed a bar making about $40,000 a year but quit 3 months ago do to anxiety/ depression/ overall unhappiness in life. Took up Uber driving, flipping things on Craigslist, freelance writing, and recently invested in film gear to do shoot promos for small businesses. I am currently overweight, lacking motivation to do much but lay around all day and deplete my savings. I live with my girlfriend who is in college, but I pay my own way and am a “piece of shit” on my own terms. I’m just in a slump. Pinned between my anxieties (agoraphobia to be specific) and depression. I feel I will be a case of “failure to launch”. I’m in total crisis with not much going for me but tons of potential if I can stop being a coward and avoiding life. Has anyone been here? What should I do with my savings? How should I face my fears? How do I end this chronic depression? I fear turning into a total waste of a human (which I currently am.) any advice would be much appreciated.

I put it into lost mode and put a phone number to call, and/or to contact me on face book. Ive had uber put me through to him 3 times, and all Ive gotten is voicemail with no call back

I have his name, the location it was turned off at, and his license plate number. I considered going over there and seeing if I could find him, as its only about 10 miles away.

I'm struggling with some loneliness right now. I haven't been to a psychologist yet but today my university announced that there will be a department specialized in helping students.
I'll give you a little background for better understanding of my situation.

I'm 20 years old and I'm a psychology student. My parents work in another country and I've lived alone at our house for two years until in came to university. 

Right now I'm living with two people that I really hate. We were friends in the beginning but they don't respect me at all. My only friend isn't a student so he is working in my hometown and I can't talk to him often because of our different schedules.

And besides this I have no one to talk to. I don't have any friends at university, just small talk everyday nothing substantial.

I don't know what to do until I'll get an appointment with a psychologist. My life is very dull, I feel empty. I have tons of questions and but I can't find people who are willing to talk about things like old music, politics, technology, etc. 

I definitely suffer from loneliness but I'm afraid that I might have anxiety and or depression too.

286,"Hi. My current job is closing the location that I work at and is giving me the option to work the same position at three other locations. This is difficult for me because I chose this particular location for its convenience. It's close to my house and I can therefore walk to it, since I don't drive. The next closest location I could be transferred to is more than an hours walk away. In other words, there's no way that's feesable. 

Now, can my job really just tell me that I have to transfer like that? They don't seem to offer and sort of compensation for this, and if I don't accept it, they want me to sign a form basically saying that I ""voluntarily resigned"".

The problem: He's an American and I'm a Canadian.

How would they go about anonymously gifting me money? 

Things we've looked at so far:

* Amazon gift card - they would need to sign up to a .ca account and eGift me the card and it's not anonymous as far as we can tell.

* PayPal discloses first and last name.

* Neither or us are into crypto, and I don't believe the amount would be enough for me to cash out of something like coinbase anyways.

* Prepaid credit cards are a triple whammy; they won't snailmail me one, I'm not comfortable accepting just a number/CVV/expiry through text and we can't figure out what cards are purchasable in the US and usable in CA. This is kinda the last ditch effort if we can't find anything else.

292,"From losing weight to saving money.
I dont even know where  to start anymore, the last time i tried really focusing on losing weight it took over my life. I didn't want to do anything other than lose weight. 
Now,  almost a year after having my son, I have started to gain weight. I'd say about 30 lbs; maybe more, but I just can't stop drinking pop and eating chips. Ah chips.. chips and salsa with a nice cold Dr. Pepper. I've told myself so many times that this is the last bag. Maybe not this week, but last week I had 3 ""last bags"" of chips. And not the small size either. 

Saving money. My situation would totally allow me to save about $200+ a month, but not the way im living. Instead of saving I would rather spend 20 bucks on an uber instead of bussing. I would spend 20 bucks on snacks even though I know I should be staying away from my kinda ""snack"". 

I also smoke cigarettes, that doesn't necessarily break the bank, but spending 20 bucks every other day towards literal garbage is saying that I dont have the self control i need.

293,"I have no idea where to start. I just want to say I'm sorry ahead of time for how longwinded this may be; will definitely take the time to think out a meaningful TLDR at the bottom. I am very much at an end of a long drawn rope and am very afraid of my future and have had no one to turn to for so long for help. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read what I have to say and respond in any way, thanks.

I'm going to get right to what I want to say (which is a lot) for the sake of words lol. As a highschooler I was abandoned by my mother and left with a poor family that was friends of ours and at the time my brother who was 2 years older than I had just graduated and was homeless refusing to come live with us because of how the family I was with were choosing to live (the household had animals, feces, and far too many people and was disgusting and loud.) My mother also tried to abandon my father who had cancer at a hospital and shortly after he died when I was 14 and left my brother and I a nice social security benefit until our normal high school graduations would be, which of course went to our mother to be used for us. Which never happened. This is such a hard and painful thing to write out because I'm 21 and have never once talked to anyone about the experiences ive been through since i was a child and I am trying so hard as an adult to maintain my functionality and be healthy and happy. I was abused mentaly and physically by mother as a child and after my father died she abused me physically and told me I was just like my father whom she hated.

Now I am an adult living with my brother moving around constantly at the whim of his job in extreme debt with a dead end job that is barely paying my bills. I can not stand the life I'm living, my brother has obviously checked out a long time ago and it breaks my heart because we used to be very close and communicate well. I have no one left, no family, no friends anywhere near me and barely any money with my name on contracts for lease... What do I do? I know its a desparate and vague question but please I am so lost. Someone tell me that there is a way or answer for me.

306,"First time posting in /r/Advice. Greetings from Pittsburgh!

I have been in the business I am currently involved in for over a year. From May-Sept. of 2017, I was essentially a third-party sales rep for Verizon FiOS (yup, I was that door to door guy). I left my company due to a few factors ranging from what the actual job was (d2d sales is, at times, soul-crushing) to disagreements with how our office/the larger company (CydCor) was (is) run.

In December of 2017, another manager on a different campaign (energy this time, not Verizon) moved her office to another part of Pittsburgh. I began recruiting for her and, while I do enjoy talking to some cool people everyday, the same problems persist from within way higher up in the company. At the end of the day, I know I am recruiting people for a D2D sales position with the ""promise"" of eventual promotion to Management. This is made worse by the fact that the company has moved to Connecticut, so I am now remote recruiting from home (which does sounds lovely, admittedly). It is a rare for a recruiter to be allowed to recruit from so far away for such a long time (until Sept, 2018) when they expect me to move up to Connecticut to recruit from the office once again. I bring this up because my boss really did bend over backwards to get the higher-ups to be OK with me remote recruiting until Sept. I feel  terrible possibly leaving her, but also know that I am replaceable. She would find someone in probably a week to replace me, but she and others have invested time and money into helping me become an above-average recruiter.

It is now mid-March and I am feeling kind of down. I wish to pursue something in a field that I am most intrigued - mobile tech. I used to work at Best Buy Mobile and genuinely miss helping  people with tech all day. I am now  considering applying to a full-time position at T-Mobile but am not leaving that as the sole egg in my basket. 

For context, I am 23 and in a relationship with my gf of over 4 years, and both wish to move (just not necessarily to CT). We are both financially stable and wish to pursue careers in mobile (me) and/or PR &amp; Advertising (both of us). 

Any advice? Do we (gf and I) go to CT? Do I pursue another path? What do you think?

*I have discussed this with one of my former college professors as well just for a 3rd party's take: she says I'm young and to follow my passions.

Thanks all

TL;DR - Not entirely happy with current position but $ and time has been invested into me already. Need to move states to continue this position by Sept. and am considering leaving the business for something that I am more passionate about. What do?",14Mar2018,2

The specialist told him that the break would heal on its own, but also stated that, unless he undergoes a complicated and expensive surgical procedure, he might have arthritis in that ankle 20-30 years from now. My husband only has so much paid disability time, and told the specialist that he did not want to have the surgery, which would require another whole month of recovery. The specialist then changed his tune, stating that he saw what might be a bone chip on the x-ray— something that had not been mentioned previously, and was not visible on the x-ray— and that he probably needed to have a metal plate put in. He insisted that my husband return for a series of expensive CT scans, which are not covered by his insurance, and following that, surgery. The doctor gave him a boot but did not provide any further care instructions, insisting that surgery (any surgery, apparently) was the only option.

A little background information. My girlfriend and her friends are on a dance team, specifically called drill that has a lot of intensive hours and requires full time commitment in their daily lives. My sister happens to be the senior drill captain of the team, and due to my girlfriend and I, my sister and her almost have a unique relationship compared to the other girls on the team.

This couldn’t be further from the truth as dating me brings no edge in her making the team next year and my sister who oversees the tryouts shows no favoritism to no one. Only to good dancers. 

Yet these girls are berating my girlfriend for having a relationship with me. It’s gotten so bad that she said she needs two weeks away during tryout season. As hard as it was for me to hear that, I respected her decision and I allowed that. I feel like there’s more I could be doing to help. Maybe I need to talk to my sister about something.

Before you ask why I don't just ignore him, he's been a decent friend as far as online friends go but I'm noticing a pattern in his behaviour. The following happened over the span of a year.

I believe he lacks both empathy and remorse. Keep in mind this is online so I don't know if the same things apply, but I think that no normal person would do the following...

Pretended to build a friendship and trust in order to scam someone from his gaming community for over $500, laughed about it with his friends (this is before I met him). The guy he scammed is now severely depressed a year later and my 'friend' still shows no sign of remorse. I just asked him yesterday if he felt bad at all, he said nope, he just helped the poor guy 'crawl out his shell'.

Acts like your friend and spends time (again, online playing games) with you, but when serious topics about mental health and personal issues come up, he's nowhere to be seen. 

Uses personal flaws to tease or poke fun at you. Would say things like ""do drugs /u/ilovechems you're more fun high"". Offers no apology or remorse when called out, just excuses ""I was joking dude"".

When challenged or ignored, he resorts to personal threats/personal attacks to feel in control. When confronted, says that he was joking.

I was dealing with gaming addiction for some time, recently have stopped gaming and he is constantly messaging me trying to get me to play with him. I don't know if I'm paranoid but I told him ""yeah you want me to play so you can laugh to your sick self about how you made me play"" and his response was ""why do you always think I have some sort of sinister egotistical agenda?"" That fucking creeped me out! 

So I told him today that I think he's a sociopath (bad idea, I know. If I'm wrong, I look like a dick, and if I'm right he'd never admit it.) At first he threatened to expose some personal information when i said i was going to ask another of our friends opinions, then said he was joking. Well, I told him pretty much what I wrote here and he didn't deny any of it, just tried to deflect it all. When I told him that by not denying anything, he was just confirming my suspicions, he said that he was just humouring me the entire time.  

Then he accused me of being delusional and said since I'm accusing him of mental health problems, he would list all of my personal flaws (which he really knows nothing about). So I told him to go ahead, I have nothing to hide and I'm happy with who I am, nothing he says can surprise me. 

And I haven't heard back since. I know this is a stretch, but do you guys think I'm dealing with a sociopath? And I do realize that it's a bad idea to accuse people of shit like this without proof but fuck it",14Mar2018,1

331,"So I have been employed by a company for nearly 3 years. I wan originally employed to do probably 4 jobs.
Over the time we have had various staff leave and I have been thrown in the deep end with their work loads.
I have learnt probably 3 different peoples roles and have taken it upon myself to learn new things as well because I found them interesting. I have never got an ounce of recognition or a single cent extra.

The company owner is down at the moment and recently pulled out receptionist into a meeting. She didn’t give many details but basically that her role was changing and she was pleased.

Now, I feel like I work my ass off, I pretty much know our entire database and have put in a good effort. She is constantly out smoking, never does things on time and talks a lot. I feel so down that my efforts aren’t recognised and they haven’t even thought to speak to me about it.

I feel so down right now and that I could just walk away from this job. I do enjoy it, but I’m starting to hate it. I get in trouble for petty things compared to what other people get away with(she admits she gets away with a lot to) and I feel like crap. 
Receptionist has been here about 8 years, so I’m new compared. However I know the system far better and can do a much bigger variety of things.

I have been waiting to see if they will pull me into a meeting, but so far nothing. We live rurally, so not a huge amount of job offers floating around. What do I do. ",14Mar2018,2

I mean is he for real? I'm guessing my head was slightly in the way, you know in his line of sight, but still, who acts like that? Nothing like this has ever happened to me.  Why couldn't he just ask me to move a little?

334,"Okay so, my older sister lives about 400 miles away with her family. Our parents are separated. The days leading up to MD, my sister is texting me, asking what I'm up to for MD, and wondering whether or not she should invite mum down Saturday to Monday. I tell her I'm working unfortunately, but to go ahead and ask her and see what she says.

Saturday comes round (day before Mother's Day) and my sister texts me saying, **""Mum isn't coming down, she's too tired. If you get a chance can you pop round after work tomorrow?""** I say, **""yeah, I was going to anyway""** - but my rebellious child ego state was thinking, **""for fuck's sake, I don't need you to tell me that/order me about/tell me what to do. I'm a grown adult. Of course I'll go round!""** - anyway, she sends a thumbs up.

It's Mother's Day. I work from 05:30 through to 18:30-ish. I go home, get changed, then go visit my mum around 19:00. She's already cooking something. I give her, her card and present. She's obviously not the happiest and complains about Dad coming over earlier and being his usual pathetic self (how he went through her mail, moped around, etc.). Then she complained about being invited down at short notice, and how my sister told her to just cancel/postpone her appointments with her clients/students and come down.

Now I know my sister has the best intentions but I think she fails to understand our circumstances, and lives in her own little bubble where we dance to her tune.

So in asking our mother to cancel her appointments and drive a total of an 800 mile round-trip at short notice, she's inevitably ruffled a few feathers. And on top of that, I feel like she's ordering me about; and our dad is a pathetic waste of space where all these problems emenate from in the first place.

So Monday swings around and my sister texts me saying **""Did you see mum yesterday? She seems in a right mood""**

All I had to say was **""Yes I went round. She was fine with me.""** End of story. The issue isn't mine. It's between her and mum.

But no. In trying to resolve the conflict, I told her both mine and our mother's grievances with her and made the whole thing completely worse. I tried as best as I could to say it in a reasonable, adult way. That she can't expect mum to drop everything and come down, and that she has to have faith in me as a son and brother that I'll take care of things. And we haven't heard anything back from her since.

Now the dilemma is that she would send us funny whatsapp pics everyday of the family, like a daily report. But that's stopped and my dad has cottoned on that something has been wrong since sunday.

So I'm wondering what the next step is.

**Do I need to make the next move and initiate a level of dialogue with my sister or do we just need to let the air settle?**

*TL;DR - sister tried to make sure mum was going to be okay on Mother's Day by inviting her down for the weekend (800-mile round trip), which would have meant my mum cancelling on her students. Asked me to check up on her. I felt patronised/being controlled. Mum was annoyed at being asked to cancel on her clients. Sister didn't know what was wrong. I told her the problem. Family fall out.*

336,"Hello. I'm a 17 year old student studying in Mumbai, India. I came to the decision of moving to the US in December which is quite late. I went to a career counsellor, my parents paid all the fees and stuff. The counsellor gave me a list of 10 univerisities that will take me. I do not intend to come back. The recent change in the visa policy of the US government has made the amount of students moving to the US drop by 27%. Also my father will be spending approximately $35-40,000 for my university. His company's turnover has decreased ny approximately 50% in the last 5 years. He is still willing to send me by taking loans and stuff. Now the thing is, I am a very average student. I don't work that hard and always chose the easy way out. I was very eager to go but because of all the restrictions on immigrants regarding the jobs after graduation and the immigrant policy, I'm feeling extremely demotivated to go.

339,"I'll preface this by saying that I work nights and l don't expect everyone to cater to my schedule.

I moved in to a home last fall. It's in an area where the homes are packed a little tightly together, maybe 10-15 feet between each house on the sides.

My neighbors all have dogs, which is totally fine. I have two pups myself, my wife is a vet tech, yada yada. We love dogs. The issue is that the neighbors on the side of my house where my bedroom is, literally right outside my window, let their dog stay outside all day. It wasn't a problem over the winter, but it's warming up and they're leaving him out unattended more often. He sits by their back door, 15 feet from my bedroom window, and whines/howls literally all day until they let him back in.

It's been absolutely ruining my sleep, and it's beginning to affect my work. I don't want to make enemies in my new neighborhood, and I don't have many ""rights"" for complaining being a night shift worker, but is there anything I can actually do? How do I go about talking to them? I'm new to this neighborhood and would like to remain on good terms with all of my neighbors. I wish I worked day shift, but my job pays me too well for doing nights.

My band practices at my place once a week, and I always make sure we cut off the noise the second that it starts to get dark, out of respect for my neighbors. It's only one day a week, I've checked with a dB meter, and the noise outside is quieter than a normal conversation. I wouldn't be so annoyed about the dog if it wasn't happening every single day.

And yes, I know earplugs are an option, but I can't even watch TV in my bedroom without hearing the dog howling over it. It's driving me insane. I've thought of leaving them a letter, but it always sounds too passive-aggressive and I don't know that it would solve anything anyway.",14Mar2018,1

342,"So a coworker and I are having communication issues. She is very new and very...sensitive. Every time I try to correct her or instruct her or even answer one of her questions, she gets defensive and snappy and goes off on a rant about how the front desk is her responsibility and I am not her boss and I have no right to tell her what to do or how to do it or report it whenever she doesn't do things ""the way I want her to."" (Read: the way outlined by policy.) I am a pretty blunt person, pretty socially awkward although I can put on the face when I have to deal with customers, but it doesn't really matter in our industry and most people figure out pretty quickly that I don't mean anything by it and I try pretty hard. Another relevant fact is that I've worked here for 3 years longer than her and did the job she currently has for like a year and a half. Most of our department is newer than me and the manager relies on me to help her train, teach, and correct new employees. She has asked me to do some of the things this coworker has flipped out at me for doing.

I tend to take constructive criticism about my communication skills pretty much to heart. So when I told my manager that I didn't appreciate the way I was being spoken to and I didn't want to help this woman dig her way out of the massive hole she was in or deal with her in any way anymore, at least until she made it clear what behavior is and is not appropriate between coworkers, and she said she would speak to this woman and then mediate between us in a meeting, I consented.

During this meeting, my coworker denied that she ever got defensive, lashed out, or interrupted anyone (I have two coworkers with stories similar to mine), denied any possible responsibility for the tension between us, claimed that I yelled at her, immediately claimed that everything I said was untrue or a misrepresentation almost the second I finished a sentence, insisted that she was almost never emotional (my boss confided to me yesterday that this woman is in her office several times a week crying), and suddenly began claiming that all our other coworkers are terrified of me which I'm honestly not even sure how that came up, and said that the issue was not communication but trust. She said ""I'm failing at my job"" several times despite her constant and ongoing insistence that her ""system"" is the best way and no one has any right to criticize it.

At the end of the meeting my manager asked us how we felt about the conversation. I told her that if my coworker wouldn't admit there was anything wrong with the way she spoke to me she certainly wasn't going to stop  speaking to me that way so I still didn't want to work with her on front desk duties, and in fact needed some time away from her in general. (My boss can't afford this. I'm the only person who knows the job as well as she does and she has her own job to do without holding coworker's hand 8 hours a day. Coworker is also several months behind on appointment requests and getting more behind every day.) My boss said she wanted us to have another meeting a week from today to work on our communication.

Reasons for me to work this out: I may be up for a promotion that involves leadership soon and handling this badly would affect my consideration for that; I may be given a new position to start my own program at the end of the year (which will be in part dependent on this department answering emails in a timely manner); I care about what we do and don't want people or animals to suffer if we can help them.

Since the meeting my coworker has been using what I would consider inflammatory and highly dramatic language every time she speaks to me. Told me I implied she was a ""dogkiller,"" asked ""Can I ask you a question even though you want to kill me right now?"" which may not be relevant but is over the top and annoying.

So my question is - as all either of us has is she said/she said, the only way to resolve this is through parlay. My boss has high expectations of me and my coworker's behavior leads me to believe the bulk of the burden will be on my shoulders to pull us through this. How do I find compromise with someone who refuses to acknowledge possible faults, calls me a liar at every step, and seems to me to be a degree of unstable? And if this is not the place where can I crosspost?

TLDR - I have to make peace with a possibly unstable coworker who can't admit she makes mistakes and won't compromise on anything unless she's talking to her manager and I genuinely can't figure out how to communicate with this person.",14Mar2018,2

I'm not intelligent, I'm shit at every single thing in school, can't speak to anyone and have barely any confidence.

I fucking hate high school. I was told to be more sociable but when I try I just get shot down. I'm beginning to think I'm that kid no one knows but doesn't really like. I don't really fit in, and that sucks. People say ""it'll get better"" but does it really? I used to get bullied and still occasionally picked on for having ginger hair, I thought this was because of the high school mentality some people have but the other week someone yelled at me out of their car shouting ginger. My sister got this when she was in uni too. I don't complain about this because people obviously have it worse than me but I'm really getting fucking sick and tired of being picked on for my hair colour. 

All of this just contributes to my low self esteem. Idk, I just hate myself and don't really know how to feel. I wish I knew how to change and find out what was wrong with me so I can fit in.

351,"Ever since I was a little kid I have wanted to be in the military. I used to play soldier outside with my friends, watch the military channel and war movies with my dad, and play military themed video games (call of duty, etc). As I got older I began playing airsoft, a game similar to paintball but with more realistic looking guns and more emphasis on military simulation. I had even planned on enlisting in the Marines since 9 th grade ( im in 12 now). Up until this year I was dead set on being in the military, I joined the gym and dropped about 70 pounds, and I spent time researching things about the military. In my AP govt/econ class my teacher talked about the corporate world and i decided this would be a more logical path for me to follow (more money, freedom, and just overall easier). But till this day I feel conflicted. Whenever I see a war movie or a military themed video game, I think i want to do that, or Im not worthy to be playing or watching this if im not a part of the military. I know these are irrational thoughts , but i dont know how to not think them. I also feel like if I dont join and serve in the military that im less of a man and not as tough. This is again a super irrational thought. I try to talk myself out of the military by telling reminding myself that im too much of a wimp to handle being screamed at, that im too out of shape to be able to handle the physical requirements, and that im a lazy person who absolutely loathes exercise, which is a necessary part of being in the military. I just want to know how to stop thinking the military is going to validate me as a man and how to stop thinking that i need to join the military.

353,"I have a staff member who had a terminally ill grandmother. She is a decent employee, average on her best days but not a star by any stretch of the word. Often has wild swings in temperament from day to day.




So during the course of this illness I granted her every single request to leave early. There was a day she wanted to go be with her just because it may be her last opportunity; I let her take the day off. I offered to send her home with food (we are a food place) for her family.





The night before the hospital told her her grandmother might pass I rearranged the schedule and gave her the following day off.




After she passed, the employee asked if they could leave early this week and then have another day off for the funeral. I said yes.





Today seeing the employee I asked if she was holding up, gave my condolences and and asked if there was anything I could do. She walked past me and literally said nothing. Ignored me.





Now tonight she has requested (with less than two weeks notice) a full weeks vacation to “recover and mourn” this loss. I have never been thanked for all of the bending over to rearrange shifts, I have been ignored on several occasions when offering my support and her temperament at work has greatly deteriorated. Her general performance as well.





Due to all of this I am inclined to deny her vacation. Company policy is 6 weeks minimum notice on vacation requests. I feel like I’ve bent over backwards to accommodate and be kind to her while she grieves but at this point I think I’ve done more than enough. Perhaps if she had been even a little thankful or even just a better employee I’d do it but it is clear to me she doesn’t care tremendously about the job anyway.

My roommate has brought five men over since December. The first time she asked and I agreed but explained it made me uncomfortable. The second time my daughter was only one week old and I lost my cool. She didn’t say anything  the second time and I looked up and there was a guy coming up the stairs. When he was still here at one AM I pulled her out in the hall and said he needed to leave. I was pretty much screaming at her. Not only was my daughter one week old I was recovering from a c section. Last week it was some random guy over and she trashed the kitchen and kept him in her room. Tonight it’s some guy she has known a week. 
I’m actually watching my nephew who is seven for the next few days. So not only is she bringing these men around my 10 week old, it is now my nephew. 
I do have a boyfriend ( not the father of my child I left an abusive relationship at eight weeks pregnant) and to be fair he came out of nowhere but at least it’s consistent. He is deeply religious and has a high ranking position in the military. He adores my roommate but finds her to be a bit of an airhead. We really care about her and just feel she is naive. It’s annoying us both. We really feel she is putting the entire household in danger. I can’t stay with my boyfriend as his kids are much older and don’t know of me yet. 
At this point I’m considering breaking the lease. It’s a huge risk to my daughter and myself. I have tried to talk to her but she basically ignores me.
