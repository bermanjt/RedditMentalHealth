3,"Im 18 years old and skipped a grade in my early years so that’s why not having a plan in my hands right this minute isn’t getting to me too much but i need to figure things out.

I graduated high school, took a semester of nursing classes at a small college (Pasco-Hernando State) in my home town and ended it with a 2.8 GPA, decided it wasn’t for me, and switched to engineering. I have a 3.4 GPA now. Im coming up on the end of the classes my college offers towards my degree and I need to find a college in florida that’s not uber expensive to dorm at. 

FAFSA completely and totally gave me the middle finger on a single dime of aid but I have the Florida Bright Futures Medallion scholarship paying for 77$ a credit hour. Im here asking, does anybody know of any college specific credits or grants that can help with the money, or just any one’s in general i don’t know of yet? 

The college I’m at now (Pasco Hernando state, as mentioned) has the “PHSC Foundation Grant” and they picked up the entirety of the tab that bright futures didn’t pick up besides the cost of books. Im sure they cant be the only college with a similar grant/program. Im open to anywhere in the state of florida, except I’m not a particular fan of tampa (I would go though, if it came down to it) 

I really need to find a dorm college because the closest college to my house that offers my course is a 102 mile round trip",01Apr2018,3

6,I am currently working as a Co-Op for a lighting company that ends in late May. I graduated from college last Spring and have  been working for this company since September. I am incredibly discouraged while submitting job applications since I spent my Summer last year applying and only got four interviews. I have my degree in Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering but I keep getting down on myself about my actual abilities and thinking that I won't be qualified for any job. I also want to relocate to somewhere completely to to start over again. Any advice on how I should move forward? I feel so lost at this point.,01Apr2018,1

This is my friend Ashley telling her story. When this is written in 1st person it’s referring to her not me. All replies are from her.

Me and my friend Jessica are good friends and we always play pranks on each other but it’s all in good fun. How do you think I should get her back?

Me and my bff Jessica were on a ski trip with our school. We stayed in a hotel and got to pick who we shared a room with (as long as we were the same gender)

Me and Jessica were in a room together. After one particularly cold ski with the rest of our class we went back to our rooms to have hot showers (the room had 2 showers)

When I was in the shower she knocked on my door and said, “OMG look mr Stevens(our teacher) is locked out of his room!” I did not want to miss it. It sounded hilarious. I grabbed a towel and peaked out but didn’t see anything. I was about to tell her but then she pulled of my towel and locked me out.

I started banging on the door screaming things like, “this isn’t funny!” And “let me in please!” But she didn’t even reply. I tried to cover my self but a few maids passed me and didn’t even say anything to me. I went to walk to my friend Stacys room just round the corner to see if she would let me in but just as I peaked round the corner I saw my crush and he only saw my head so assumed I was dressed. He noticed me and said “hey Ashley” and started speeding up towards me.

I wasn’t thinking straight and I really didn’t want him to see me so I turned back and ran to the end of the hallway but it was a dead end. Not thinking straight, I decided to get in the elevator. It arrived and I got in but it opened into the restaurant area. Some of my friends saw me as well as strangers and it felt like everyone was laughing at me.

The desk gave me a spare key and I got back into my room to find Jessica just sitting there watching TV!

I would like to confirm me and jess are still on good terms but I gotta get her back somehow!",01Apr2018,3
8,"I'll start off by saying that I am the baby of my family and one of the only girls. My only other sister was trouble and my parents have tried their hardest to not have me grow up like her. I am extremely close to my mom and love her dearly but there are times it seems like she is treating me like I'm a child. She has had some difficulty acknowledging that I am an adult and has for awhile. 

When I was 18 I had my first kiss and when she found out I kissed a boy on the a first date she yelled at me for 45 minutes calling me a slut and whore for it. I've always had a difficult time talking to her about relationships and sex because of this. She will typically see the negative side of any guy I bring up even without meaning to. 

On to the issue, last night I met up with my friend Alan(24M) at about 8pm. Before I leave she always asks who I'm going to hang out with, if it will be a late night and/or what I'll be doing. She tries to play it off like normal conversation but it seems a bit nosy to me at times. I tell her I'm just going out for a bit and don't know (I prefer not to start telling her who because she questions me nonstop.) Anyway, I leave and we end up hanging out until about 4am. My mom texts me asking if everything is okay and I assure it is and that I'm heading home. She gets a bit upset.

I wake up this morning and she won't really look at me. Finally, we have some coffee and she starts questioning me about the night before. She says ""I know you're going through a phase that every child goes through where you think I want to know your every mood but that isn't the case. Your mature in some areas but you really need to grow up in this area much quicker. You didn't update me on if you were okay or anything and what if something happened to you? It was really rude of you and I don't like when my daughter acts like that. It is a matter of respect."" I did understand what she was saying about maybe not giving her a heads up but she was sleeping until she woke up from a noise and the house was properly locked up.

She then continues on ""... I need to know who you're going with so incase something happens to you I'll know who to look for. I need to know where you're going so I'll know where to start looking."" I'll go on by saying that she has not met the majority of my friends and I know many Alans. I start to get a bit upset and she begins to cry and telling me that I'm young and pretty and sometimes out alone and that worries her.

I felt bad and asked her that I don't plan out my nights but prefer to go with the flow so would it have been a better situation if I had texted her at about 3am saying that I was okay? She looks at me like I'm an idiot and tells me no because she keeps her phone up incase one of us (her kids) needs a ride and the noise will wake her up. I should tell her earlier in the night if it will be a late night.

My brother who is a few years older doesn't have this issue with her. I'm aware we're different sexes and completely different sizes physically but it seems like he can be gone for 2 days and she won't even care but I feel like she is expecting me to tell her my every move even if she said that wasn't the case. I feel like I'm a 16 year old kid again and I'm very upset about this whole situation.

I'm in between jobs right now and can't afford an apartment but I hate to think I'll have to move out just so I can leave and come in without having to send a detailed note of who I'll be seeing and what I'll be doing. Is my mom crossing a line or am I not respecting her the way I should considering I live in her home? I usually keep her updated but I was having fun and didn't see the harm in it. She was already asleep so I don't see the big deal here. Help?

Sorry for any format issues. Thank you for your time!",01Apr2018,2
9,"I've had a thing for this girl I know for about a year and a half now. During my senior year of high school, I met this girl, lets call her ""E"". She was a sophomore at the time, and we had a pretty difficult class together at the time. I think we hit it off strong, there was a Halloween dance that was cheaper if you went with someone, and she seemed pretty bummed out that no one had invited her, so I did being nice, at the time I didn't really think much of her. During the dance, which was the kind of event where you went and just hung out with friends at a table while the DJ did his thing, E spent the first hour or so with her one friend she found, and then sat alone for about ten minutes before I found her. I can't remember what I was doing, probably taking pictures with people, I went as Donald Trump and got into a mock fight with a Hillary. After that, I found E, took her by the hand and over to the table with all of my friends, and the rest of the night was pretty great. It's important to note that E is pretty introverted, and someone who seems kind of unsure in how she'd like to express herself. One day she might dress and act goth, the next she's in bright colors and extremely outgoing. So, I think when I took her hand, I might have made a mistake, or flustered her, or something. In the beginning she barely talked to me, and the rest of the night we were almost inseparable. Nothing of major note other than hand holding, but I was pretty happy, considering I'm kinda beta.
After the party, and I'd say into the months following into December, we were constantly texting, and talking in school when we could. Nothing super important; just small talk or about things she enjoyed or heard about, I was just happy I had someone to talk to. It was probably around this time I started to ask her if she wanted to hang out outside of school, in which she was normally busy, aside from studying in the public library. I can't remember when this next part happened, but sometime between Christmas and February, E told me that if I was catching feelings, that she wasn't interested, and just wanted to be friends. At this point, I was pretty much obsessed with her, but played it off as if I hung out or offered to with everyone I knew, like a typical beta cuck.
Months past, and I think I didn't do much to help my case in class. I'm somewhat conservative, and the class was all girls aside from myself. Needless to say, there were some conflicting opinions, and I stupidly would voice what I had to say whether it made people mad or not. I've always told people what I've thought if they ask, I hate being fake. it also happens that I really suck at arguments, since I don't drop things until either they or I apologize or at least recognize the other persons standing and let them know about it. I probably pushed some things to far, and it seemed like E didn't even want to be my friend anymore after a while. I graduated, summer pasted, and I'm now in my second semester of college. E recently got into a relationship, and then dipped out of it after who knows what, but considering I know both E and the ex, it was probably because they were too awkward to hold a conversation. I've held my feelings for E all this time, and I saw her today in the gas station while since I'm home on Easter break. I was thinking about the Lab report I have, and forgot to say hi. I messaged E afterwards apologizing for not saying anything, and I got a pretty, lets say blunt, response, something that I'd send to someone if I didn't want to talk to them, but didn't want to be rude and say outright.
What do I do? I really don't want to give up on my feelings for E, but I doubt I ever cross her mind.",01Apr2018,3
10,"I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm 17M and unable to do really anything because my mom won't let me do it. I have to beg and plead to go to anything- it doesn't matter what it is really, wether hanging out with friends our just doing something by myself. I have to tell my mom when and where and exactly from what time to what time, which isn't that big of a deal if she didn't call me multiple times during whatever I'm doing (calling me every hour and making me leave really anything at no later than 9:00, me constantly just begging her for 15 minutes at a time to let me do something/stay). 

She doesn't trust any of my friends unless she knows their parents and everything about them and where they live like I'm 8. She's very opposed to any of my friends driving me anywhere under any circumstances and once again this is something I basically have to beg for to do. Im frustrated because she'll yell at me about how everyone else my age has a job ( she forced me to quit my first job because my coworker got pissy and pushed me over) and drives ( It's near impossible because to get a driver's license in my state while under 18 you need a slip from the school after driver's ed, I moved schools right when this was supposed to happen and lead to a cycle of both schools reffering their problem to the other) and calls me lazy yet at the same time while inhibiting anything I try to do outside of school. 

Just today I wanted to bike to my friends house and I was reminded why I can't do anything. I argued with her about her treating me like I can't take care of myself and she basically replied with 'im just this way, deal with it. Those other kids parents don't care that's why they do what they want' I then asked her if that means she thinks she's the only parent in the world that cares about their children and she replied yes. I don't get to do anything social really because I have to go to Saturday and Sunday school every week from 10am to 9pm.

I don't think this is going to stop even when I'm in college and maybe even beyond that. Im not even that concerned about the social part, I've grown up too busy for many friends, the part that bothers me is denying me to really do much by myself. What do I even do?",01Apr2018,1
11,"Hey, looking for some different points of view here....
My wife has been a photographer for 10 years. Most of this has been in a professional capacity, with the last few years being extremely good, busy, and lucrative. She is very artistic, ahead of trends, and does well with the 30-40 demo. 
Lately, past clients have been sending her messages about another local photographer who is blatantly ripping off her ideas and aesthetics, sometimes shot for shot. Lowballing and charging next to nothing, of course. It's only escalating and feels like it's watering down her brand and creating confusion.
It's gotten to the point where we have accurately predicted (multiple times) when my wife will be ripped off, and the timing is so obvious and not subtle at all.

What should we do? Confront the photographer in private and tell them how uncool this Is? Do nothing and let the market decide? ",01Apr2018,1
12,"Please help – REALLY need advise and comfort!

M22, while drunk, received unprotected oral from a stripper. For just about 30 seconds – but such a big mistake! A week later noticed mild burning when peeing (no discharge that I could see, though).

16,"TL;DR - should I rerelease the two lost/stray dogs currently held in my backyard, or take them shelter that will kill them if they aren't claimed in three days?

Full story:

I found two dogs wandering around outside my house yesterday. They were very friendly and were right outside.my house, so I ushered them I to the backyard and closed the gate.

My plan was to keep them contained until their owner claimed them. I've done things lime this a few times before, and the owner had always contacted me within a couple hours. As usual, the dogs aren't microchipped. I posted to Facebook (we have a local lost and found pets group), Nextdoor, Craigslist, and reported them to the city shelter, but I've heard nothing. I also contacted our local no-kill options, but none have space. 

I can't keep the dogs; my wife is both highly allergic and 9 months pregnant, so having a couple stray dogs around is not an option. We need them gone sooner rather than later. Would it be better for the dogs to simply open the gate and turn them loose, or to take them to the kill shelter?

As I see it, the pro of rerelease is that they won't be killed in three days if they aren't adopted. They might go on to lead  long, happy lives. Of course, they might also get hit by a car.

The shelter keeps them safe from cars and such, and if someone is looking for them, they might only be checking the shelter. The shelter only holds unchipped dogs three days before killing them, though, which is awful. 

Help, please. ",01Apr2018,2

I am afraid of pulling it down and, while my hands are full, having a spider falling on my face, or even just thinking it had, panicking and falling off of the chair and breaking something. 
What are the chances of spiders being in a kitchen light fixture that was regularly used? As well as the chances of it falling off of me.

- 28 yo

- Graduated with top grades in Computer Science

- Always had excellent job reviews/feedback

- Seen as a leader in my team at work

- Most people who knows me think I'm smart

- Deep inside, I know I'm not smart but hard-worker.

- I'm highly competitive with others. Not in a harsh way or making it public, but I constantly compare myself with others. (Huge explanation of my scores/skills/achievements).

- I'm constantly trying to adquire new skills to keep being different from others.


I'm starting to realize that I'm constantly improving my skills to keep holding the image other people have about me.

Even when I think I'm learning things I really like, most of the time I'm struggling with high anxiety of achieving mastery.


So, in escence my feelings are:

- I'm really unhappy about my behaviour.

- Even though I know that what others think about me shouldn't be a huge deal, somehow I can't control it.


I can't figure out what should I do. This doesn't seem to have an easy fix, and it seems that I should commit to some kind of new habits or ways of thinking to start finding my true self.


I'd appreciatte any advice to change the situation I'm in.

23,"So I graduated highschool last year and ever since I've been thinking about getting out of this garbage town to get some life experience and new friends. Thing is, I've never had a job and most of the programs I've seen available online require a year of experience or something like that.

I live in a place where pretty much the only jobs available are at fast food places or grocery stores and I've applied but still haven't got a job.

39,"I'm a senior and about to graduate from high school in two months. I worked my ass off the past four years to all around make myself look like a ""strong candidate"" for college. However, I've never enjoyed school, so pushing myself through my classes really took a toll on me and was more often than not the root of a lot of depression and anxiety. 

Unfortunately, I think I burnt myself out and have absolutely no desire to go to college this upcoming fall. Around September/October I thought the feeling might just be nerves, but as time has passed and all my friends are getting insanely excited for school, my dread has gotten stronger and stronger. I decided it would be the smartest decision to not push myself into a $30,000 decision yet when I'm this confused and unsure. 

I'm taking a year off to work and travel a little, which i've been saving up for, so I will not attending college this fall. You would think I'd be happy about this, but truthfully I'm not. I guess I'm relieved, but I wish I wanted to go SO badly. I know I'm going to be missing out on meeting so many people and doing fun things and having independence. I keep wondering if I made the wrong decision, because I feel like I'm going to miss out on ""the best years of my life"" if I decide not to go to a regular four year university. 

I know that tons of people don't go to regular college, so if anyone has any insight on this, I would really appreciate it. I think this time in a persons life is notoriously confusing, but I never realized how shitty it would make me feel :/ ",01Apr2018,2

So I’m not sure if I have ocd but I’m health classes I’ve had checking if something is locked impulsively even though you know it is locked was always in the book. Every book every article and I struggle with that but also with open doors that should be closed really send me into an anxious state where I can’t focus and this is especially true in school.

 It was so bad one day I had to speak to my physics teacher who’s understanding but an older middle age man who kinda stared at me like “what the hell bro” which is understandable, but still, it was uncomfortable.

But I think the worst one was in this classroom when a closed door that had been closed all year, 146 days but this one day another teacher left it open and i only noticed and I was asked a question mid lecture and I didn’t even here him until he called my name the third time. It’s a serious problem for me.

42,"TL/DR : My dad has fits of rage over minor things, punching holes in doors and a lot of yelling. Even over small altercations.

My dad gets angry a lot. My brother is 15, he's going through a rebelious phase. He sometimes disrespects my dad or says something to antagonize him. Sometimes it can be really small and he'll just get really angry and say fuck off. Or something of the sorts.

They get in large arguments a lot, and it gets so over the top. My brother will push his buttons and my dad will just explode, so will my brother. My dad has punched a hole into my brothers door on a few occasions.

After most of these occassions he comes back upset and apologizes for his actions. Its like he isn't self aware during, just after.

A few different stories for some background,

When i was his age I had a similar dillemma, bad grades slightly rebellious. One day my dad was going through my shitty grades with me and was agitated. I was overwhelmed so i decided to walk away.

As i walked away he said "" did you just fucking flip me off?! "" he chased me up the stairs, and I locked my bedroom door. He smashes throught the door, and starts yelling. I throw a cup and yell "" wtf dad "" I try to leave my room but he wont let me leave, im sobbing and having a meltdown.

About a 6 months ago my brother and dad got into a large argument, leading to physical altercation. Where my dad held down my brother while my brother tried hitting him. Somehow my brother had a bruise on his face.

My sister says she gets anxiety because of these issues of these fights. They happen right near her bedroom and its scary scene for her to hear.

It feels wrong. I used to get a lot of anxiety over my grades because of him, im not sure how 'normal' yelling contests are in other families. But it seems like my brother and dad cant have an argument/stressful discusion, without it turning into one.

49,"Hi all,

I just signed a lease for a new place today. I saw the unit very briefly and didnt notice any issues, except some cleaning that needed to be done which I assumed would happen once the LL found a leasee. 

I came back to the apartment today and it wasnt cleaned as I expected. I would say it is about 80% clean, but the fridge/freezer need to be deeply cleaned, hardwood floors need cleaning, etc. 

In addition to this, I noticed that the window mounted AC device is a huge security concern. It was seemingly not installed properly and allows for opening the window easily from the outside to anyone who would know that its possible. Not only this, but the security “flaps” on the side of the unit are not mounted, and can just be slid to the side and have the window lifted. 

I feel like an idiot for not noticing this when I walked through the first time and today, the LL just gave me the keys and left without doing any sort of initial walkthrough. 

Kind of panicing as to what to do here. I would not feel comfortable having potentially expensive stuff in there during the day with the security concern, much less having my GF be there during the day or any time without me. 

Please help, Reddit!!

Also, I have sent an email to the LL with these concerns, just no response yet.

We visit as frequently as possible, and both my mothers are aware that we have sex and sleep in the same bed when I go to visit him at his apartment. I’ve always been honest and upfront about getting on birth control and being responsible. 

Fast forward, my boyfriend may be joining me and my family for a vacation at our summer home, but my parents were very clear that we would not be able to sleep together “on account of my little sister,” who is 13. 

I, personally, cannot see any merit to this. My boyfriend and I both started this relationship as consenting adults and obviously continue to do so (if anything, setting a good example for how intimate relationships should be). My sister and I are obviously not on the same level (even though she might think otherwise).

57,"Whats up guys. This is a sensitive subject and i'm not sure if i'm going to offend anybody. I definitely hope not. i'm definitely embarrassed even posting things but this community has helped me in the past. First, a quick intro. I am a 25 year old white male from the midwest- born here and lived in the same State my entire life (though we moved around a few times).

A few weeks ago, someone brought something to my attention that has been weighing on my mind a lot and I feel conflicted, confused, and even a bit angry. I basically just want some answers, and that's why I'm here. We were at a sports bar watching the game. My best friend invited me to join a group of people who knew each other well, so naturally people took an interest in me as the ""new guy"". Everyone was chill, and they seemed to take an interest in me, asking about my favorite music, hobbies, interests.... 

After talking about myself to the general group during the beginning of the night, the conversation split into multiple little conversations around the table and I was mainly talking mainly to the dude sitting next to me.   It was very noisy anyway and hard to keep up with everything going on around me.

When I told my new conversation partner how good the Black Panthers movie was,  he burst out laughing and told me that I seem ""completely fascinated by black culture"" and asked me why I don't ""have any interest in things white people do."" I was nervous at the time and didn't really internalize this comment. I was shocked but just brushed it off with an awkward laugh and we moved on. 

Over the next few days what he said really started bothering me. Dont get me wrong, I understand in a way where he is coming from. My favorite musicians are Drake, Nelly, Jayz, Kanye, etc. Its not because of race, I just like chill music. I used to be a diehard Kevin Hart fan and went to his shows a couple times. I'm into playing ball and play a couple times a week. I had a Kevin Garnett poster in my dorm room in my freshman year. I've always taken an interest in social justice causes and went to a few campus protests before, but standing up to police brutality isn't about race to me. Its about equality.  And yes, I was a huge Obama fan and even helped volunteer part-time for his re-election campaign in 2012. I grew up in a liberal family and his message of tolerance, respect, and unity moved a lot of people. I think he was one of the most inspirational political figures in years and that's why I got involved in his campaign. It was never about black or white for me. 

So on one hand, i'm resentful that he called me out for my preferences in movies, sports, comedy, music. Its not racial to me, and i like what i like. I think it wasn't his business and he was really out of line in saying that. 

But on the other hand, i have to be honest with you guys. I gave it a lot of thought after the guy said what he said and realize that struggle to find a single white entertainer, athlete, or public figure that I respect. And in a way, I have to accept that it is a little unusual. But maybe at the end of the day it doesn't even matter, right? Everyone drifts towards their own natural interests and it is what it is. 

I guess i just want to know...is there anything wrong with my preferences? Why have I turned out the way I did? How should I have handled the situation? Should I be angry or am I making too big a deal of this? Is this entire post just overanalysis of something completely meaningless?  

TLDR: I am obsessed with black culture and I don't know why.

There is a girl we work with that I get a long with as well, but I have started to take a problem with. In the past, I have noticed that they talk quite a lot at work. To be fair, we all have a lot of down time. Everyone really talks to everyone, although, I feel the talking appears to be some what flirtatious. I had mentioned issues to him about them talking about personal things at work. Such as her telling him about her relationship problems with her boyfriend. When I brought this up to him he would tell me that he couldn't control what she said to him and that he was doing nothing wrong. Fair enough, but I still mentioned that I felt weird about the whole thing. So then I find that they sometimes text each other outside of work. In my opinion I find it wrong considering I had a weird feeling about it and also because I think her behavior is flirtatious. He told me that she texts him and that all he does is respond and that it is harmless. I then find an app on his phone called FriendO and find out that she is the only one added on his profile. It's basically an app where you learn and ask questions about each other.

I told him that this upset me and that I thought it was weird, and we got into a huge fight over it. He ended up deleting the app and saying that the app was not a big deal to him anyways.

So two weeks later I walk up to him at work and I notice that he had re downloaded the app, and was playing with her on it. He tries to hide it and distract me by saying ""Oh you've got something on your eye."" I obviously ignore the attempt and tell him that he is being unfaithful and a liar. Later at home we have a big blow out argument and I ask him if he still texts with her even after I said I don't like it and he said yes. I ask to see the texts and or the app and he refuses saying that its his right to not show me anything. We have been together 4 years, and he has never said anything like this before. He said that he is not hiding anything, but ""knowing me"" I will find a problem in his messages with her because there could be ""smiley faces or laughs"".

He explains that we have different fundamental ideas on boundaries. -He believes it is totally fine to have private conversations with her through messages. -I believe he has given me reason to think that there is something weird going on, and that I should have the right to question him on it. -To be fair, the girl at work talks to all of the guys and texts them as well, but that does not excuse his responses.

59,"About 4 weeks ago I got into my first car accident. I recently moved from a small island with only two lanes to a big city. I always had driving anxiety, even on my small island and when I first moved here a few months ago I had anxiety but enjoyed the highways and going fast. I adjusted pretty well. However one day I was dropping my boyfriend off at work and I was making a left turn to get back onto the main road. It was a tight turn in/turn out and a bigger car wanted to turn right in so they were letting me go,(to make sure they had enough room to turn and not hit me) I looked around them and the coast was clear but the truck behind the car who was letting me go, got impatient, switched lanes and hit me as I was turning out. It was deemed my fault by police and my front bumper fell off and I dragged it under my car about 100ft until I could pull off the road. His truck spun out and he ran onto the sidewalk. Im traumatized. I had to drive the next day to get to work and have been driving every single day since then but the anxiety keeps getting worse I start thinking, “that car behind me probably wants to hit me for the fun of it”, I stayed in a parking lot for 45 minutes because it was crowded and I was scared of reversing out. I picked up a shift at work and ended up working 10 hours instead of 4 because my other shift started at rush hour and staying at work all day seemed better than driving for 10 minutes in rush hour, I waited 10 minutes in a parking lot to make a left turn and got honked at. My family keeps saying “you just need to drive more!” “just get in your car and go!!” but they fail to realize i’m driving every single day but the anxiety doesn’t go away and my thoughts about driving keep getting worse as the days go on. i want to move back to my small island because of this, i dont want to live here anymore all because of that fucking car accident. driving over here is very aggressive compared to what im use too. it doesnt help that i got a ticket and had to pay $240 for a class, with money i dont have, to get the ticket off my record and another $750 to pay my insurance deductible. im barely making ends meet and trying to recover from this but its so hard. i dont know what to do.

My aunt and cousin share a bedroom right next door to my sister. Lately her boyfriend has been sleeping at our place almost every single night, of which she did not discuss with either me or my aunt beforehand. The thing that bothers me more is the fact that I can hear them have sex anywhere in the house no matter how ""quiet"" they try to be. Before my aunt and cousin began living with us I have had issues with my sister having loud sex and having her boyfriend over unannounced. I have brought it up to her before, but only via text.

In a roommate situation, this wouldn't be a big deal. But I live with a very shy and reserved aunt and cousin who are too meek to say anything. They don't even leave their room unless its for my aunt to cook. I don't know if they're bothered by the sounds but I come from a relatively conservative Asian family so I feel like my sister should be more considerate. If it was just me living with her I'd let it go, but with my aunt and cousin living in the room right next to my sister's, having to endure that almost every night...it's insulting and awkward to me.

I know this is easily solvable by discussing it with my aunt and talking to my sister face-to-face, but she's scary to deal with sometimes. If she isn't responding angrily, she'll rudely brush it off as not a big deal. Am I in the wrong for asking her to refrain from having sex in the house while our aunt and cousin live with us? She could easily just do the deed at his place, but he still lives with his parents. How do other people deal with this when it comes to family?

Perhaps, my adversities are linked to my self loathing or my constant self depricating jokes? I don't know. Honestly , as the days go on, I find myself hating life and my own being more and more. Why live? I'm just going to have to with pain and angst. I've even gotten worse with my weight; I've managed to gain 30 pounds *and* I had to cut my hair.

77,"I grew up in Cincinnati which is a decent enough place, but the weather in the winter is awful. The city itself isn't very scenic either. 

Later I moved to Pittsburgh for college, and sorry to you Pittsburghers but I absolutely hate it.  The roads are awful, (it takes at least 25 minutes to go anywhere) there's even less to do than there was in Cincinnati, and the weather is just as bad if not worse.  Pittsburgh is also even uglier than Cincinnati.

It's like when I reach the point where I tell her she can have me, or make a move, she doesn't want me.

I chose this job, not for the money, but to work with specific people I wanted to work with, to avoid another much higher paying job I felt dead at and to get some exercise. But I'm such a good worker that they're constantly manipulating me to go past my limits in hours. I asked them from the beginning not to give me long shifts, but the moment I walk in the door I'm being told I'm going to have an extra long shift that day.

109,"Ok so I just got laid off work last week for 5 weeks. I’m at home its 5am and I was up watching tv. I heard a noise outside my house and looked out the window.  There were 2 guys messing with my car. As soon as I saw them, they saw me and ran away.  I made eye contact with one of the guys. They hopped into a 2015-17 Dodge Durango and sped off.  

I called the cops as soon as it happened. They asked the basic questions and checked for fingerprints. Nothing. They didn’t find them. They left a small crack near the door lock.  I was stunned and thought to myself who might’ve done this.  It’s a nice car but why my car? 

So I went to bed a couple hours later. When I woke up, I was thinking to myself “do you remember seeing the getaway vehicle before?”(The black Dodge Durango) And I did. About 2 months ago  it was 3:30 in the morning I was pulling up into my driveway after a long day at work and saw that same Durango parked across the street with all the lights on just sitting there as if it were watching me. As I got out of my car and started walking up to my front door, the Durango slowly drove off. I thought it was odd that they knew to be outside my house at 3:30am right when I get off work.  So then I got the impression that someone from work might’ve sent these guys. 

Now there’s this one co worker of mine who been acting pretty suspicious lately.  We’ve been working at that job for almost 2 years now. I really don’t talk to him. He’s a pretty quiet guy near me but not next to others. I’ve never had a problem with him. He stares at me a lot and I’ve gotten the feeling that he’s been taking pictures of me. I can go into this more but don’t want to waste too much of your time. So I searched his name on Facebook and found his profile. Now here’s the weird part. A small portion of his friends list is located on his page. And that’s when I felt like I recognized one of the thieves that I made eye contact with. Lets call him Mike for now. I clicked on mikes profile and went through this pics to see what I could find. I noticed he has a lot of pics of him with his best friend. So I clicked on his best friends profile and went through his pics and found out he has a Dodge Durango. The same getaway car that was used when they tried to steal my car. Now these pics were from the inside of a Dodge Durango but this guy has pictures of him standing next to his street sign also. Btw these
 guys are heavily involved in  violence and gang activities. I googled the street name and found out that it was only a few miles away. So I drove to that street the next day and saw the same BLACK Dodge Durango parked in reverse in a driveway as if they were trying to hide the license plate with 2 old car parked in front of it. Now I’m thinking that my coworker sent these guys to my house to steal my car. So the next day I went to the police station. 

I went up to the counter and told them I know who might’ve tried to steal my car the other day. They told me to that they will have a detective call me the next day and sent me home.  3 days have gone by and NO CALL!  Now taken it’s Easter weekend here I keep telling myself they will call Monday but what if they don’t. Do they care? What should I do? What should I do about my co worker when I go back to work next month? Any advice?

113,"Sorry, this might be very long since I have had no one to tell this to...

Back when I was young,  I was the stereotypical A+ annoying asian kid who asks way too many questions in class. My life at home was a little different, I wanted to be ""cool"" and basically revamped myself for high school. I was always extremely nice, and because of that people used me as a doormat and took advantage of me. I started developing mild depressive thoughts when I was 12 and by the time I was in Grade 10, I my grades were starting to fall off and I had two secret attempted suicides that to this day no one knows about. In Grade 11 and 12, I was skipping class to cry at home and I had eventually dropped all of my useful math and science courses and settled for night school. By the time I turned 18 in grade 12, I spent my days seeking validation from online strangers on reddit by posting nudes. I barely graduated with a 65% average, and didn't apply to university that year.

During my year off, I partied like crazy the first few months. Back when I was in High School i had a curfew of 5pm and wasn't allowed to socialize and this newfound freedom allowed me to live out my fantasy of being a normal teenager. I lost a sense of who I am, broke up with a boy who was very good to me (he had moved to the other side of the planet) and got myself a new boyfriend who was belittling and abusive towards me. I had planned to save up money from working this year but ended up blowing it all on this crappy boyfriend. I applied to University since I hated feeling like I was accomplishing nothing, but because of my grades I couldn't make the cut off for the schools I wanted to attend. I went to an Arts school instead, purely based on my portfolio (I was always talented with arts and design, and I'm very lucky to have gotten admitted without even making the academic cut off). 

2 weeks into the new school year and I realize I absolutely HATE the major that I chose. The only reason why I chose this major (illustration) was because my friend told me I was very talented at it and would get an offer 100% if I had applied; originally I was planning on choosing a different major. I realized this is definitely not the school for me, it had nothing I was hoping for (clubs/extracurriculars, residence, general opportunities...) and on top of that, our suicide rates / stress level topped any other university and it made the atmosphere very very depressing. During that first year I was commuting 4 hours a day to get to classes I absolutely hate with people who are just not good for me. I ended up flunking 2 of the courses, I was in a constant slump and got placed on academic probation. I missed the deadline to transfer schools because I didn't know how to with such shitty grades so I decided to stay for year 2 to try to bump up my grades. That same summer I got put on antidepressants but was told to stop taking them when I got sent to the hospital.

This year, I'm passing all my courses but still feeling depressed and anxious all the time. My GPA right now is probably 1.00 (~64%) since I can't bear to put any of my creativity towards work I absolutely despise. All of my professors tell me the same thing -- that I can be doing so well at this school if I just tried to enjoy the work but I genuinely don't and half ass everything...

I really really want to end up doing Architecture or User Experience but with my grades, I can't transfer into a university to do something relevant to those fields. I just missed the deadline by a few days to apply anyways and now I don't know what to do anymore. I can't go to a community college either, as I know the weird asian little kid part of me will hate myself to the point where I will want to self harm every single time. I can't take time off to figure this out either since I will just bask in self loathing... wtf do I even do at this point?

I feel like I've thought about this long enough and need to get off my ass and do something... anything. I don't know what to do.

127,"Hi all, 


I was just sat out on my porch and somehow dropped my phone through a gap in the slats. I know it’s still working because I was listening to a bloody play and I can still hear it. 


There’s no way of getting under there and I super don’t want to call my landlord for his help. The gap is maybe an inch wide and I’d say it’s four feet down. Sounded like it fell on leaves or something soft. I marked where it is and put a bin bag over it so it hopefully won’t get wet. 

I don’t think trying to get something to stick to it would work because it would need to come up on its side. Google just keeps coming up with stuff about replacing porches or getting animals out. 


Thanks for any help ",01Apr2018,2

133,"*First of all, I want to state that I'm not unhappy or suicidal at this moment. My life is great; I have great people, job, living, and I have a confidence my future will be great. *

**warning: super long, serious contents**


I am [21/f] who's turning 22 soon. I graduated from college not a while ago. Luckily I got a high paying job for an entry level. I love my job, and my boss treats me very well.

I am living on my own. I don't live w/ my family since I moved out.  Since then, I honestly never wanted to contact my family again.

I was grown under a **very** abusive parent. My parents divorced right before I was born. I heard people saying they divorced because I was a daughter and they fought a lot because my father's family wanted a son (I'm originated from Asian background). Probably, because of that reason, my mom treated me badly. I don't know why, but she always favored my sister more than me.

Unlike her, I didn't get a chance to go to school field trips if there is a cost. I wore cloths that were too small for my sister. Because I was wearing same cloths, and my classmates called me 'beggar' behind my back. My sister got all she wanted: very expensive doll (BJD), sewing machine, swimming/math classes. 

I was outstanding in classes even though I didn't have all of that. To be a perfect daughter, I brought good grades. I did most of chores when I was 8 to help my mom out just to get a bit of compliments. I was so thirsty at love even though my mom would beat me crap out of me for small occasions like 'not putting cloths on hanger', or 'not able to memorize English words', 'putting extra soda on her coke'. It was most likely when her mood was not good. 

There may be some occasions when I deserved to get beating when I did something wrong. But I was really young at that moment, and I can still recall the moments very well. I still remember the first time I got beaten. It was when she told me to put a plug to electrical outlet and I didn't know where I was supposed to put it. She called me 'stupid' and something, and beat me. I recall that was really cruel beating for the first time in my life. It was before I went to kindergarten. 

I have a lot of memories when I got beaten up badly and my friends asked me where I got all the bruises on body. I just told them I slipped and fell. 

I still don't understand why she would treated me like shit. She once said that I am always fine with whatever I have, so she did not really care much about me. 

Anyway, I always imagined that I would kill my whole family. When she was  being nice to me, I would regret that thinking right away. But as it was more often and often that I get beaten for no clear reason and my mom/sister would bully me like I don't belong there, I became a monster that I am going to grab a knife and kill them when they come back from shopping. I was just 8.

Also, another memory I recalled while writing this. My mom hated leaving food in storage. So she would throw the leftover food to my plate even though I didn't wanna eat it, she didn't let me leave the table. So I had no choice but eat it. It kinda made me hate eating itself I guess.., and I am grown extremely skinny despite of it. 

Anyways, I think it will be a couple of books if I write all that shits I experienced. And I don't think anyone would like to read it, so I won't talk about all the details here.

Luckily, I did stood that for 21 years and now I am living by myself. 

There were so many times I wanted  to kill myself, but I survived. My mom 'gradually' stopped beating me so it wasn't as often as when I was young. I think she learned to like me later. She would talk to other people that how I am popular on all these social networks, how fast I earned college degree, how fast I got a job after graduation, etc. But I feel like if I didn't have all that, would she still hate me? 

I don't wanna kill my family now, but I really don't wanna care about them. I don't want them in my life. I don't hate them as much, but they feel like a family to me. I don't even know what a family is like, but I am really confused now. I am not sure if I will 'disown' the family relationship like it never existed before. I am not sure if I will be sad if my mom passes away. And thinking about it makes me feel like a monster. Is it a right thing that if I am thinking this away toward my family? 

She gave me a place to sleep, supported my college tuition, and I think there were some times she loved me. Still, it is my family.. after all, I know there may be a lot worse cases than me. Maybe I just can't forgive the past.

I started making money with freelancing since I was in high school. And it went directly to my mom's account. She did not let me use any of it saying 'it goes to our whole family's living expenses'.

Even after getting a job, she took control to my bank account and my salary. When I buy something with my card, she would look up the purchase history and talk that I use too much money or why I bought something. Like before, she wanted to manipulate my actions whatever I do.

I recently told her that I will take care of my bank account since I am living on my own, she said she used all the money I've been making for the past years, and I said okay fine, but I am not gonna let that happen that from now on. l made a couple thousands since I was in high school, but since she paid my tuition, food, and living expenses, I thought of it as 'paying back' to her. It's not a big deal for me anymore.

 Now I can use my money as I want. And I have a steady income that is more than enough for me. I am happy about that.

In these days, she still tries to keep in touch with me and asks me to do something for her. And I really.. don't wanna even reply her. But then I think, she was a single mom and she may had a rough life too. I 'm now confused how I feel about her. I guess love-hate relationship?...
 
It really bugs me when I think that I wanna disown my family or I won't invite any of my family to my wedding ...or something. At the same time, I am not sure if it is a moral thing to do. 

I never told any of my story to someone. So I just wanted to hear how other people think. Any advices are welcome. 


TL/DR; 

1. I had an unfortunate childhood under an abusive family. 

2. Now I am 21, living on my own and I love it.

3. I wanna disown my family but idk if it is a right thing.

I’m a 19 year old girl that works 2-3 times a week in a restaurant in my neighborhood. It’s not essentially to earn money but I suppose I’ve always wanted experience and despite the low income, I LOVE my job! It’s close to my house and the people I work with are great.

However, recently some older guys (20s) have started coming to the restaurant and they just so happened to live in the same neighborhood, some of them even living in the same apartment building as I. Most of the time they’ll ignore me(?), answer disrespectfully and very often stare me up and down(which I find really uncomfortable). This was not a problem in the beginning but now it’s gotten to the point where they’ll ignore me and ask a male waiter to serve them the food instead, which is pretty embarrassing in front of co-workers and other customers. I usually ask the boss to serve them in my place (he knows why) but he leaves early and most of the time they come to the restaurant when he’s gone.

I’m not sure how to deal with this? They’re usually respectful around other males like my dad or brothers. I don’t want to tell my family about this because of many reasons, the guys are violent and involved in gangs, my family won’t believe me or take me seriously, etc....

142,"I need some advice. I started working at a lab in october of last year. I was so excited because I had been out of the science world for about two years (not by choice; I had worked for a pharmaceutical company that went under and I had to take the first job I could get, which was in tax management. ) After I accepted the position, my manager (the lab director) told me: ""If you get to a point where you are going to walk out, please do me a favor and just talk to me before you do so."" Of course, I knew this was odd but I didn't want to let it get to me.

I had gotten a position in the mass spec department. The first week of the job ended up being pretty brutal. I was working with a coworker who had his Ph.d. He gave me a difficult time over everything that I did. Some examples: he told me I wasn't allowed to sit in the 'good chair.' When I was weighing acid on the scale, I was doing it too slow. He criticized me for taking notes and told me I was not to write anything down when he spoke. He also told me it was clear that I had absolutely no experience working in the medical field. This was completely untrue, as I had participated in paid internships in college and published research papers. In my interview, I was very clear about my prior experience and was upfront in admitting that I would need to learn the precise methods practiced in this particular lab. When my manager asked me how everything was going, I told him that I did not believe that it was going well and I felt uncomfortable. When my manager spoke with my coworker, he immediately stated that I must be making everything up and that he refused to work with me. My manager told me that I should go back and just wait until things blew over. 

And so I did. But no one in the mass spec department would speak to me or even make eye contact with me.

After this ordeal, my manager moved me to another department with a few twenty-something girls. Within a few months, these girls started spreading a few different rumors about me. 
1.) I was sleeping with my boss (NOT true) 
2.) I was doing school work during work hours (also NOT true) 
3.) I was making more money than people who outranked me ( I don't know if this is true, but I never told anyone at the company how much I made).

I spoke with my manager about the aforementioned rumors because I was really upset and because I didn't want any of the stupid office politics to impact my job. I was busting my butt, working 60 hour weeks...doing everything I good to be a good employee.
So, the thing is, my bosses are not quite appropriate either... About two months after I started, My manager asked me, point blank, if I had a specific mental disorder (I'd rather not say which one). And the truth is, I do. I felt really awkward because I'm not typically open, especially about that, but I also felt obligated not to lie. So embarassingly, I admitted that I did. I don't think my manager is a bad person. But some of the things he says does hurt my feelings. Once he said, ""a lot of people have things wrong with them, but you, you're clinical.""
The assistant manager is worse. He lies a lot and thinks that he more intelligent and all around better than everyone else. He makes things difficult and fines a way to argue that whatever I do is incorrect. Once, he told me that ""email is not an effective mode of communication."" Even though the company policy is to utilize and check company email daily if not more frequently. Another time, he said, ""we have to stop hiring all of these Indian women who cry all the time."" After he said that, I felt really uncomfortable and talked to my manager. Nothing was done.
My manager, in the past, has commented on how different I look without makeup. The overall tone felt negative. The one day I did wear make-up, he said, ""You didn't look like that last week.""
Today, the assistant manager told me that I sometimes look like a cake-face and ""go too heavy on the eyeliner.""

There are more little instances, but this job is really making me feel awful. I've tried to mention that these things bother me, but when I do it ends up being my fault because I'm ""too sensitive.""

151,"I apologize if I am in the wrong subreddit. This just happened and I would like someone to talk to anonymously. This is the only subreddit I know that would be fitting. Please feel free to move/delete/message me as needed if I have made a mistake. 

I am currently living with a host in a foreign country as part of a program (but not a study abroad program affiliated with a university or anything, it’s pretty loose with no direct leader that you meet, just makes it easier for you to find a host). The host has been very nice, welcoming, and made me feel comfortable and safe. However, he also has someone else living with him that works for him. I guess you could say that he and this person are friends and colleagues. 

I had a great time at first, but later, the colleague started saying weird things to me like randomly calling me beautiful, saying I’m special, joke that he would cry when I leave, etc. I didn’t know how to react at first, so I would always brush him off or change the topic, etc. One time he invited me to ride on the back of his motorcycle and I politely declined. 

The part where it gets complicated is that I originally really liked the colleague, I found him to be an extremely kind and friendly person. He clearly has also been having a rough time recently (for the last 6 months) and he said he hadn’t seen anyone during this tough time as he was living alone. It was only recently that he moved into the host’s place and he is trying to pick himself back up. I sympathized with that and enjoyed getting to know him. I was always professional - I never did anything flirtatious or showed him any special attention compared to others. I simply enjoyed talking to him and showed my gratitude as part of common courtesy for his kindness. 

But then things started getting weird... he must have liked that I was nice to him after what he’s been through lately. When the compliments started becoming more frequent, I brought up my boyfriend in conversation in hopes of giving a signal. Yesterday I also pretty much didn’t talk to him even if he walked by, to show that I’m not interested and that I want distance from him. I also decided that if he was giving me weird compliments again, I would tell him directly that they make me uncomfortable. Unfortunately I didn’t even get a chance to do that as he suddenly kissed me on the cheek today. 

The details of how it happened: we were in a part of the house alone (I was showing him where to find something, there were 2 other people in the kitchen a bit further down, but within shouting distance, so I didn’t feel unsafe), he suddenly kissed me on the cheek. I was immediately upset by it and told him it wasn’t not ok. I then closed the door and stayed in the room. After a few minutes when he saw how upset I was, he came over and apologized over and over and he seemed very sincere. The host was away for a dinner at this moment. 

Maybe about 20 minutes after, the host came home. The guy who kissed me then immediately told the host what happened and apologized to the host for his actions as well. I planned on speaking to the host anyway but was trying to collect myself first. The host then came to me and asked to talk. He apologized too and explained his colleagues intentions (because there is a language barrier between me and his colleague who kissed me, and the host usually translates for us). According to the host, the colleague who kissed me didn’t do that romantically, but because he likes me a lot as a person (?? Not sure what this means or what to make of it?). However, both the host and the colleague admit that it was very wrong regardless of intention. The host has a daughter my age but the colleague does not have children and doesn’t seem to have a wife as far as I know. 

I feel very confused. I’m very disappointed because I thought this guy was a great guy but now my image of him is completely tainted. I also thought a lot about giving him the benefit of the doubt - for example, that he doesn’t really seem to have anyone in his life to give him consistent love and care, that he had been alone and depressed for the last 6 months, and so maybe when he met me, he appreciated my kindness towards him and didn’t know how to handle it...?

I don’t know what to think right now. I don’t know whether to believe the interpretation or not (that he was not trying to do anything romantic) because randomly calling me beautiful and saying I’m special isn’t so platonic. At the same time, he did seem pretty sorry after and his apology seemed very sincere. He said he would stay away from me if I wanted. I just don’t get it at all. If he respected my personal boundaries so much, then why did he kiss me on the cheek to begin with? But also, this is a foreign country (Japan) where I think understanding of rape culture, sexual assault, etc. is at a lower level than where I’m from. Any advice and clear thoughts would be very greatly appreciated regarding on how I should feel about all of this and what I should do (I’m leaving in 1 day so I’m not too worried about my safety). Also, I do plan on reporting this to the staff of the program so that they are aware. 

P.S. Yesterday I prepared a small present for both the host and his colleague, and a note to each thanking them for letting me stay. Now I’m not sure what to do with it... should I still give it to the guy who kissed me? In the note to the host I even said “thank you for giving me a separate room because it made me feel more comfortable as a woman” but now it’s just kind of weird to say that given recent events. 

Thank you so much for reading through all this. I want to be mad but I’m having trouble painting this guy as a bad guy because he was such a great person at first... I really hope that there is another interpretation, but I should probably just accept that he’s a creep despite his kindness.

158,"Hi everyone,
I’ve had a friend who I’ve known since I’ve been alive, and we have been part of the same circle of very close friends for around 4 years now. However, this friend is occasionally extremely selfish. 

For example, he refuses to buy cigarettes, insists he doesn’t smoke, but bums a cigarette of someone every time the other smokers go out for one. I know it doesn’t seem like much, but it’s expensive and essentially everyone is paying for two people to smoke. It seems obvious to confront him, and we have slightly, but it doesn’t work because he fears confrontation and assumes it’s us being nasty. We need something more indirect, or that passes of as non-confrontational. 

Another occasion is, we had a dinner party with a few drinks, and he tried to pass off his alcohol into the “shared” bill so he’d pay £8 instead of £14, although I corrected him. He then persisted to ask for a hot cross bun from my friend, who paid for it out of his own money, then went in for more without asking. I brought over a huge bar of chocolate and he asked for a few squares, of course I said yes. I left the room for a few seconds and he’d eaten most of the bar. 

He sees himself as above us and smarter than us, because he clearly believes we don’t notice these schemes because it’s almost impossible to confront him. He actually wouldn’t tell us his mother’s maiden name (came up in casual conversation) because it’s a common security question. He is no posher or richer than any of us, I live directly beside him, and everyone’s from a relatively middle class background. 

I just want an insight into his head, as these are only a few examples of the shenanigans he’s pulled. He just takes and takes and takes and it seems as if that’s okay to him, whereas he is extremely selfish with his own things. Any advice on understanding him, or trying to confront the situation would be much appreciated. ",01Apr2018,1

166,"We live in the middle of fuck all and I have barely any friends. Any time I try to join any sort of club or gain any interest in anything my parents will always make an excuse to stop it. Sometimes they say that they can't be bothered to take me, other times it's 'weird'. I spend most days asleep with nothing to do. I've never been in a relationship and very rarely do I get access to the Internet. I have no way of meeting people or getting away from my house. My parents are constantly abusive towards each other and my dad is always insulting me and punishing me. I can't ever work out why. He seems to have an inflated sense of pride and can't stand living with other people, and he wants to force everyone else to live like it. I get constantly bullied at school. I've had all of my school work destroyed on three separate occasions so I'm failing my exams. I've been in a mental health service but they just refused to believe anything I said and turned me away. I feel so alone. ",01Apr2018,4
169,"So I started talking to this girl about a month ago now. We initially began talking because her first language is French and I’m a language nerd, so I asked her if she’d tutor me if I helped her with German. So yay, that all worked out!

But since then I feel like I’ve really begun to like her as more than a friend. But I think she might also feel the same way. We have a couple classes together, and we’re usually talking in person if we see each other there; and if we’re not talking in person we’re usually texting, and we’ve both started flirting a fair amount. She seems genuinely interested, so that makes me less nervous about it, but I’m still not sure about the current situation

I invited her over a couple days ago to watch a film, and she seemed really enthusiastic about it. She told me at least twice a day how excited she was about it. But once the day actually arrived, a minor family emergency arose and she had to reschedule. We ended up talking most of the night anyway, and she kept mentioning how much she wished our plans had worked out, how she’d rather be with me right now, etc. 

I guess the thing that makes me nervous is the timing. I mean, at this point I’m pretty sure she’s at least interested. I’m just afraid maybe it would be too early to try and take things further, but I really don’t know. Should I just go for it when she’s over next?

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!",01Apr2018,1

174,"I’ve been wanting to get this off my chest so if some things are out of place or if any of it doesn’t make sense please bare with me cause I’m so uncomfortable and nervous about it right now 

I’m nineteen years old, straight, and a virgin. Now before your like “oh my goodness, another typical post about a younger guy complaining about the lack of confidence he has” trust me this is worth your time so please keep reading. 

I was bullied, harassed, and belittled for being a virgin by my friends and even my dad made fun of me for it. 
It destroyed my confidence then one thing led to another, it made me really insecure about myself. I think I’m ugly, I’m very hesitant to approach a very attractive women in public, it gets in the way of school, the list goes on and on. It made me so insecure that my insecurities put me in predicament that’s a two way street where I go down the path to embarrassment or go down the path to being in so much trouble.

For example, about a month ago I started to use a phone sex hotline. I spoke to so many girls including a woman that are so much older that me. It was so fun and I was hooked on it ! I learned so much that I got carried away then the unwanted happened. I had two thousand dollars in my bank account and by as of March 20th it was all gone, completely. My dad tells me he’s been receiving mail for the past month that are for me (I don’t know why he didn’t came to me about it a month ago) he shows it to me and it shows the number I’ve been calling, my phone number right beside it, and the money I spent. Which explains why he’s been asking me if I spent all of my money for a good two weeks until yesterday. I told him that I did not make these calls and that I’ve actually been in counseling with BetterHelp for four months. He assumes that Better Help scammed me and he was very adamant we go to the bank and get to the bottom of it and get my money back. He called me an “idiot, dumbass, fuckin idiot, etc” for an hour when we had our conversation about the matter. I was so anxious that I had to lie to him. 

Should I tell him what I have been really doing ? 
That I spent all the money I had left on a phone sex hotline... how do I go about it without him getting upset at me for it ? 

My post history, oh my god.. what is my problem? Am I perverted ? am I just a horny teenager ? 

Lack of self awareness, immature, stupid, financially inadequate, etc say whatever you want and I’ll agree with you... 

My insecurities brought me here and I know I have to face the consequences but I don’t know which path I should go on.

176,"Maybe it's simply because I'm a young woman (22) and a kind person, but I get many texts from people (mostly guys) everyday. 

There are two guys who make sure to text/call me everyday (even when I don't respond). I respond to them when I feel a little bored or when my female friends aren't there to hear me vent, but sometimes these guys' texts can be overwhelming (long, frequent, and inane). I also don't really enjoy talking to them on the phone because I find their voice/convo topics irritating at times, but they call me nearly everyday (but I do pick up when I'm bored). One of the guys calls me just to mostly talk about himself - he calls me his best friend, but I have NEVER felt a really close connection with him (even after knowing him for nearly 10 years).

The thing is, I usually appreciate texts from my female friends. But they're not as receptive as these guys, so I rarely talk on the phone with my female friends. And women never spam my phone - it's pretty much all men.

178,"Hi, hello. The thought has been swimming around in my head for a while now and it bugs me to even say it out loud, but I think my parents are emotionally abusive.

I don’t think it’s their fault at all, they used to hit my eldest brother but when they figured out that was wrong, they didn’t know how to discipline their other children. Then they just let my second oldest brother do what he wanted because they didn’t know how to keep him in line, and when me and my brothers growing up they just figured out that they could yell at us.

It wasn’t even that bad, they arguments either ended with them or me crying. When I was younger I didn’t know how to deal with it so I would just go into my room and sob for hours, and or have a major panic attack. Then of course I’d calm down and then contemplate my life on earth and why I should take my life because it’s causing others pain. They never hit me or anything, the worse thing that’s happened that could have actually hurt me is my mother threatening to cut me when I was 10. 

Of course, if you’d brought that instance up to my mother now she’d deny it ever happening. That happens frequently. I have a very strong memory, my father was even considering me having a photographic one at some point, but whenever I bring up something my mother has done (e.g, calling my brother the worst mistake of her life) she denies it and then tells everybody that I’m making up stories? It got so bad to the point where I became the boy who cried wolf, but I’d never falsely cried. My own brothers didn’t even trust me. The guys I’d shared a womb with, didn’t believe a word out of my mouth. Maybe I’m just going crazy?? I sure feel like it.

I don’t know if this is for everybody but she also says who I hang out with. When I was thirteen I remember a particularly bad experience. I was going to a museum for my friend’s (call them Jordan) b-day party, and on our way there one of my other friends (Dean) calls me. I consider myself to be a very open-minded individual, and Dean so happens to be a trans-male. My mother figures this our because my brother has mentioned to her before about a trans-male by the name of Dean. She starts screaming at me, about how I DARE hang out with that THING and how ”she” is just a little dyke who “think she’s a boy”. She then started accusing me of sleeping with him, and yadda yadda yadda. Then she threatened to delete all lgbt friends off of my phone or else it gets taken away, I lose privilege to all communication in the house and I get moved to the next school district. 

Then she busts out with this fabulous line, “YOU don’t control YOUR LIFE! I control YOUR LIFE! You don’t decide who your friends are, I DO!! ME!” And of course she starts breaking down and telling me how she loves me and just wants our relationship to be better, because I treat her like shit and look at her like shit. She then drove us to our childhood home and told us to take a walk. She then joined us and pretended like everything was alright and offered to take us to all these places we haven’t been to in AGES. Which was nice? So she doesn’t WANT to yell at me, she just wants to keep me in line? Maybe she thought that they were bad people? Dean was student council president and Jordon ran a tutoring program for ADHD and dyslexic kids who had trouble in school. But maybe she just immediately thought that they were corrupting me?

It’s the same thing with my father, he dragged us to a church seminar at 11pm and afterwards in the car he started screaming at us for falling asleep and making a fool of him. 

And maybe I do treat them like shit, unconsciously. A lot of the time when they asks me to do something it takes me half an hour to and hour to get it done because I’m usually doing other things. And I’m very sarcastic them a lot of the time? Maybe their words ring true, because they’ve called me a lot of swear words, so it can’t be for no reason...

I really feel like I shouldn’t be complaining, I’m still a minor and my parents have given me everything. They complied when I wanted to go vegan, they gave me my own room, they paid for all my school supplies and clothing, they even got me a freakin’ KEYBOARD! I’m betraying them by even complaining about them! 

I just really need some guidance here, my friends have already threatened to call my school counselor if I don’t do it myself. I guess they finally decided that my house was no good for me (because of a particularly bad occasion that occurred this week). They genuinely think that I’m going to end up hurting myself because of what my parents have said to me. I’m not even sure emotional abuse is a real thing, I feel like I’m just being a huge pansy. They keep saying I might die if I stay in my house longer?? Sure, I’ve planned out my suicide once or twice after my parents screamed at me for an hour, but I don’t have plans in following them through?

179,"I've been in a relationship for almost three years now. We've been through a-lot. Towards the beginning I started talking to another girl, and while no physical cheating took place, I came clean I had feelings and she was torn apart. Self esteem absolutely destroyed, trust was thrown out the window, tears. I felt so terrible. I promised again and again I'd never do something like that ever again and she took me back. Although we were together it was a living hell for a good six months. I felt guilty because she didn't do anything, etc etc.


Fast forward two years later we have finally chilled out. Life is fantastic, our relationship is great. She is the perfect woman of my dreams and I really would like to spend the rest of my life with her. Last friday I was chilling at my friends house and  he wanted to invite this girl over. We both know her, she seemed cool. Anyway she gets there, we smoke her out and have a great time laughing and what not. Eventually later my friend turns off the lights and we all lay down and watch Netflix. My friend kept leaving the room to go do something. I was dosing off and the girl found her way to lay up next to me. She knew I had a girlfriend. She knew how much I loved her, but she didn't care. I fell asleep off and on and she got closer. She kept trying to make a move and I tried to avoid her. She eventually grabbed me and started to kiss me. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. I wasn't thinking clearly, maybe it was the weed combined with my lack of self discipline. 

We ended up kissing a bit and I pulled away. I instantly regret it. Realizing what I had just done that could not be reversed. It settled in and crept up like poison. Disgusted of myself I walked home without saying goodbye. I couldn't sleep. The guilt has been eating at me ever since. I feel so damn guilty. My girlfriend is the best girl and more than I could ever ask for. She didn't do ANYTHINg to deserve this. I broke a promise. I am scum. I wish I could take it back. Ive cried really hard lately and can't take this anymore. I don't want to tell her just to relieve my guilt and destroy her and our relationship. But she has the right to know, right? I'm tossing and turning. I can't decide. 


Do I let this go and live with the guilt? Moving on like nothing ever happened? Should I channel the guilt into being the best boyfriend I can be? 

Or should I come clean and be honest. Telling her would absolutely kill her self esteem and ruin her. I really don't want to do this. She doesn't deserve the pain. God I hate myself. I'm so stupid. I can't come up with an answer so I'm posting this for advice. ",01Apr2018,0

I process all of my emotions through my stomach- and I was sick as hell all day- vomiting diarrhea.

Yesterday morning I had an epic story where I went to this random coffee shop that was -the nicest one in town- to take a shit in their toilet instead-- but instead the smell of coffee hit me and I vomited uncontrollably all over their outside coffee patio. (followed by an 1 hour+ of uncontrollably sobbing)

I find this story has a lot of potential of being a good bar story- with a little bit of proper wording i feel like I got myself a good life story here.

So when my old bestfriend arrives, i tell her this story and she's like ""you were gonna stink up this poor coffee shops's bathroom?"" and then when i told her about the vomitting she was very ""You have no shame and that's not a good thing.""

I don't know if she's just grieving or what- but I've been a barista, I've cleaned up the NASTIEST shit from coffee bathrooms-- and to be fair if the costumer can get it all IN THE TOILET- then I couldn't care less.

The father is a chef for a successful restaurant (only open on weekends) and the mother is an ER nurse (also only works on weekends), so I have worked pretty much every single weekend (Friday-Sunday, at least 24-26 hours each weekend) for the past two years for this family. I had even babysat for them the day their son H died. The boys were/are wild and very disrespectful. They talked back to me, punched each other in heads, and on one occasion H tackled me because I took his Playstation controller away after he had thrown my phone into the woods behind his house. I'm a very patient person and that's one reason why I've stuck around with this job, not to mention the money is pretty nice too. But I'm tired of feeling taken advantage. The parents are unorganized and never tell me when I'm supposed to work until usually the day before, so I have to schedule my weekends around their plans. And that's another thing--I'm a senior in college about to graduate in May and I should be out enjoying my time with friends before I move out of state and start law school. I'm considering quitting because this weekend for Easter I had the option to go home and visit my family that I haven't seen since Christmas, but the parents I babysit for said that they desperately needed me this weekend. I needed the money so I said okay. Turns out they didn't need me after all, which I found out yesterday morning, so I wasted this entire weekend alone not making any money while all of my friends went home and spent time with family. 

I'm conflicted because I really love L and consider him almost like a son to me, but I cannot keep being pushed around by the parents who 1) don't discipline their children and 2) are so unorganized that it interferes with my schedule. I dread going to babysit every time Friday rolls around. I never know if I'll be able to pay bills on time because I don't know if I'll be making money that weekend.

It‘s not a typical student loves teacher story. I love her as a person as she is one of the most sunshiney individuals I have ever come across.


What do you HONESTLY think, if I would write her a letter, telling her how i feel about her but not in a „i’m so in love with you“ way but more an appreciation letter idk. 

Do you think it would come off as creepy, weird, cute, just embarrassing or something else?

Side note: She leaves our school in a couple months and I want to give it to her on her last day including my phone number IF she wants to tell me what she thought about it but also that she is nowhere near obligated to even give me a response but just that i needed to get all of this off my chest.

TLDR at bottom 

I'm a 22 year old guy and I'm a bit bummed out. I have been good friends with a group of guys for around 1.5 years, and we usually go out to bars/clubs. They push me to do better in school and provide positivity in my life, but I'm beginning to believe that they really don't care about me, no matter how much they say they do.

I have expressed that I have been having trouble in school, due to my prior depression which is making it harder to function and get back on the high horse. These are some of the contradictions I see:

1. Tell me how much they care about me

2. but then they lie and use me for rides to the bar, pressuring me to drive them even though I am low on gas/don't have much money

3. I am going to be honest and say that I get the most women in the group, am the most handsome and sociable (I have been told this many times, and I Do get the most girls out of all of them, it's just a fact) and I am beginning to believe that they are sticking around simply to feed off of that and learn from me

4. But, if I'm talking with a girl at a bar, they will try to swoop in and ruin it. I have expressed this many times, and they still seem to not get the picture. Actually, there have been a few cases where my ""best friend"" drake has actually **asked** a girl for her number after we have hooked up **all night**

5. Which brings me to my next point. Drake has expressed that he is jealous of me, and he is a competitive person, which is why I think he sticks me around... although I'm beginning to think he really doesn't care about my best interests

6. Yesterday night, I expressed that I needed to be home early because I was having issues with my father and curfew etc. (Dad doesn't want me out too much, for valid reasons). Then they pressure me all night to go to drakes house and smoke weed, saying the usual manipulative things they say, like ""you're a man, fuck your dad! Live your life!"". After which, my friend Gary *tries* to leave even though I expressed that I wouldn't be able to take drake home, and he agreed to take drake home. So basically, he tried to sneak away and leave me with the odd job

7. I don't have a high paying job or a degree. I'm a hardworking college student, but somehow I'm always paying for drake's stuff or driving him around, even though he has a full time marketing position in manhattan

8. On top of all this, I simply dread going out with them sometimes. For instance, I was being eyed down by a blonde girl last night who I swore was out of my league, and was collecting myself to get in the zone and talk to her. I express this to Steve, and he immediately taps her on the shoulder, taps me, and says ""hey, this is (OP)"" to which I am obviously pissed, because I have no problem approaching women myself, and it makes me look like I didn't have the balls to do it. I mumble my words and then lie and say I have a girlfriend and walk away. 

9. We go to the same bar **every weekend** for the past 1.5 years. On top of the bouncers being stuck up rejects and douche bags, it is getting old and I have been going to Manhattan lately. I have had success going to Manhattan with my brother and his friend, in terms of having a plain old good time, and picking up women like a 20 something should (and not like my old friends do, by messing me up every night)

TL;DR and question:

My friends suck and I want better influences in my life. Where can I find new people as a 22 year old? I am into music, hiking, sports, etc.",01Apr2018,5

TL;DR: People ring my unit (and building mates) at 2 am. I think it's incredibly rude but don't know if I should/can do anything.

Recently I moved into a new apartment in NYC.

A few weeks ago I woke up to the shrill sound of my intercom ringing in my room. I also heard a soft buzzing, which I realized was from my other building mate's units being buzzed as well. I checked my phone - it was 2 am so I was pretty shell shocked but also very tired. I was really scared from the whole thing and thought it was a homeless person messing with me (probable in NYC). I wanted to call 911 but was too scared to move. 5 minutes later the buzzing still won't stop. Finally I hear ""help I'm locked out"", &amp; a neighbor buzzes the guy in before I can. I'd imagine the others in my building were equally scared seeing how long everyone waited to let this guy in (the buzzers in all of our rooms are loud - I'm sure everyone else was awake). I hear the guy loudly thanking us as he walks up the stairs, slurring his speech (assuming alcohol's a factor here) telling us the whole story of how he got locked out. As if ringing our bells wasn't disruptive enough here he is telling the entire story now that we're all awake! It took me 45 min. to calm down and fall back asleep.

I was still pretty heated the morning after this, and exhausted from the whole ordeal and still felt my mind buzzing. I decided against telling my management as I want to be on good terms with my neighbors if possible.

Recently last night at 2 am the it happened again. This time it was a different person who sounded sober, and was let in faster. That being said it's annoying nonetheless that she thought it was okay to just buzz all of us given the time.

I'm honestly kinda upset at how frequently this happens (these events were a couple weeks apart). Is this just a norm for living in NYC? Why do people assume it's okay to wake their building mates at 2 am? Can't they wait in a hotel lobby until the morning when my super's awake? Am I being insensitive? Should I contact my property manager or is there nothing they can do (there are cameras to identify who did this)? Am I overreacting?",01Apr2018,5

221,"21 m. This last fall I re-enrolled in college after taking a 1 year hiatus. During that year I lived with family is Central America, worked 45 hours a week and fell in love with the culture. I was happier than ever, exercising and debt free. I lost my attachment to money past being financially independent and was more at ease with life. 

The issue started because growing up I never felt like college was an option, it simply was the next step. I felt pressure to go back and get my degree. I decided to apply to some universities in order to go back and finish.

I have never liked school expect for the social aspect. My grades have always been average and I have have never put in extra effort. In high school I had plenty of friends and even when I attended my first college I had made many close friends. But being a transfer I feel like everyone already has their friends. Social circles were set and I was an outsider.

My first fall semester back was okay, but after living in the real world, school life felt so fake. Classes seem boring and pointless. I’m in many classes with kids 2-3 years younger than me and have nothing in common with many of them. Because I didn’t care for the subjects or people in the class, I stopped going to classes, put in close to no effort and stopped studying. Luckily I was still able to pull off a miracle 3.0 GPA also I felt as though I did good enough to continue.
 
My second semester started off significantly worse. I waited nearly a month to buy any books, rarely go to classes and have stopped doing much of my homework. I feel like I’m drowning because I’m beginning to fall behind. I have started to realize I don’t care about my major and see nothing in my future. I have stopped exercising, have student loans and am in debt to my parents with no current income. I feel like im falling into depression and the anxiety of my situation is making it difficult to sleep. My only friends are my roommates and I honestly don’t like them that much. 

The only thing keeping me here is the feeling that since I came back, I can’t quit again. I already left a life I loved behind and feel like I can’t go back. I don’t want to be a disappointment. My friends from high school seem to be doing so much better than I. They’re going to new places for internships, being financially independent and traveling the world. I just want to keep up. I don’t want to waste my parents energy and money nor do I want to be a disappointment but I have no idea what to do because I’m simply unhappy.

TL;DR Went to college one year, dropped out, lived in Central America for one year, came back to go to a new university. I hate it, have no friends, dislike my major and want to quit again.",01Apr2018,3
222,"So I was at a party at a friends house the other day, and I kind of hit it off with this girl. We were visibly flirting and laughing, and she was squeezing my cheeks and my friends were playfully mocking us and prodding me on.

Later on, we all sat in the hot tub outside and drank a fair bit. As I sat next to this girl, I held her hand (while being very careful to check for any signs of distress or discomfort). She seemed fine and comfortable, so I sort of let my guard down. I slowly started making moves on her, listening very carefully for the words ""stop"" or ""no"", should she have had said them, and to my knowledge, she didn't. I wasn't holding her tightly either, and she could have easily moved away at any time. This is where the situation got seriously weird. 

Under the water(we were still in the hot tub), I was playing with her tits while she was literally grabbing and squeezing my d*ck. (Keep in mind the hot tub was on, so no one could see underwater.) Above the water, when I tried to kiss her, she shied away and looked uncomfortable. I immediately stopped, and my friends were like ""alright man you gotta pick up on the signals now, i don't think she's into this"". I was very confused, and I wasn't sure how to respond. 

Once we were out of the hot tub, (it was like 4 AM), I went to go sleep on the couch. There was plenty of space on the couch, and if she felt so uncomfortable, she could have easily moved to the other side. But when she got on the couch, curled up right next to me, leaving little to no space between us. Then, she started pushing herself out so that her butt came right into contact with my dick. I put my hand around her stomach and wanted to sleep, but she literally moved her hand so my hand went up to her tits. 

I woke up a few hours later and went home. Yesterday, my friend who was at the party (someone who I considered one of best friends) texted me on Snapchat that him, 2 other friends that were there talked with this girl, and based on what she told them, they all agreed that I had sexually harassed her. She claimed she had nightmares about this situation. I was flabbergasted, as she had made so many moves and had so many opportunities to say no, and if I heard even a sliver of this, I would have stopped immediately.

But in the hot tub, my friends only saw above the water, and saw me trying to kiss her and her shying away, and the way this girl told the story made it seem like she repeatedly refused but I kept persisting. This isn't going to be a police issue, but my friends said they can no longer associate me after what happened and have removed me from all social media and communications. 

I feel like a f*cking monster, and if I caused this girl any type of pain, I don't think I can forgive myself. But given that she made so many moves and was clearly reciprocating, did I sexually harass this girl? I've been wrestling with this for a day now and it's honestly been driving me insane. What the hell should I do? Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.",01Apr2018,6
223,"Hello,
I am considering moving to a place I have never been before and where I know no one. I will give a run down of my life situation this far, hopefully it is not too depressing, lol.

I am 35 years old, no kids or wife.

I have no debt. And a car that is payed off.

I have lived in South Dakota my entire life, except for 2 years when I was in middle school my family moved to Missouri but we ended up moving back before I was in High School.

I have never traveled outside South Dakota, aside from those 2 years mentioned above, and the largest city I have ever been to is the one I currently live in which is about 130,000 people I believe. (this is sad i know :) )

I will pretty much do anything when it comes to a job. I have spent the last 15 years or so working in manufacturing but am open to doing any type of work.

All of my family lives near me and I just feel the urge to make a leap and start a new life somewhere else. I have around 100,000k saved up from my years of working. Currently my plans are to stay in South Dakota until summer is over...maybe around September or October...and then move.

I guess the advice I am looking for is if anyone else has made moves similiar to mine, where you go some place unkown to start a new life. Are there any specific small or large cities that you guys would recommend I look into? 

I have looked at places like Florida, California, Colorado and I guess my options are fairly open on where to go so it is kind of giving me anxiety.

I don't really get attention from girls in person but, to my surprise, I've already matched with a few good looking girls and one in particular seems pretty interested. 

I've made my intentions clear that I'm not just looking for sex and she says she isn't either but she has made pretty clear on her end that she is eager to get with me. 

I was nervous about using these apps to begin with because of the image they have of being hook up apps rather than dating apps and I don't really expect her to think I'm a virgin if I am on them.

And I don’t have a problem with religious people or anything. I believe anyone should be free to practice whatever belief they want without being harassed or punished for it. My family isn’t super religious (at least my immediate family), but they’re talking about how they want to go back to going to church and being religious and such. They know I don’t really care for religion, but they don’t know I’m an atheist. I know for a fact that telling my mother will break her heart. I love my family to death and I don’t want them to view me differently for this. Overall they’re very accepting people, and raised me to accept everyone no matter what. Hell, they even told me if I was gay (although I’m not) they would fully accept me. That’s part of the reason I am so unsure about how they would react. My original plan was to wait until I moved out to tell them, but since they’re getting serious about this and are prepared to do this, I know that I might need to tell them now. They even have been trying to get me to go to Midnight Mass with them on Easter (we celebrate Greek Easter). I don’t want to just “suck it up” and “deal with it.” I don’t mean to offend anyone religious, but I personally don’t like the idea of celebrating religion.

2 months went by and I started talking to another girl I always had a unspoken thing for and we started a relationship. It was under wraps but over time got public and the first girl really was hurt and that sort of ended our friendship because she felt I wasn’t honest with her and blindsided her.

She was emotional about it and so was I but she forgave me. And still told me she has love for me before she left.

Here’s what’s been happening:

1) I’ve gained ten pounds even though I’ve been eating a little better, I’m 6’2” and now weigh 160 lbs

2) I’m hungry all the time now, but only for meat like chicken beef or pork

3) My arms are like... bigger? They’re not flabby but they aren’t body builder arms either they’re just... thicker

4) My thighs are so fat and I don’t know why

5) I physically want to work out more, not mentally. Like my body wants to work out and I don’t know why???
(I don’t know how to work out tho and if I do I just use the treadmill at the school gym)

6) I’m starting to get chin hair if that’s related... maybe I’m going through a second puberty??

Is this normal? Is something wrong with my metabolism? Should I see a doctor or something?",01Apr2018,1

251,"Hi guys and gals. A little background first:

My parents and I immigrated to Canada about 15 years ago from China, all of our relatives are still in China and we just visit back and forth. My grandpa on my dad's side has been critically ill for about 2 months and my dad took two weeks off to go China and see him. He is scheduled to fly back to Canada tomorrow. Last night my dad flew to Beijing (my grandparents do not live in Beijing) and is resting up a bit before his flight tomorrow. The past two weeks have been very taxing on my dad's health, he is a skinny man to begin with and over the last couple of weeks he had lost over 15 lbs. He's been with my grandpa every night in the ICU and helping with other family stuff during the day, so everyday he's had less than 2 hours of sleep. He's developed a fever and is generally in very bad health coming back. 

So now I just learned that my grandpa passed away last night right after my dad left for Beijing. As of now my dad doesn't know yet and the family plans to not tell him until he's returned to Canada and had some time to recover his own health. Grandpa's funeral is scheduled to be the coming Friday and my aunt is looking after all the necessary matters. My take on this is that if it were me, I would like to know because should my dad pass away one day (knock on wood) I would like to be there and say goodbye. The difference is that my dad is in very bad health condition himself and I have to agree with my aunt that the news may just crush him. So my question to all of you is: should I tell my dad? What is the right thing to do here?

Thank you for all your inputs!

TL;DR: Grandpa passed away and my dad is in bad health, should I break the news to my dad in his condition?

252,"He makes me feel guilty and gives me crap because I like to spend a lot of time with my mother and sisters as opposed to him and my brother. I'm just closer with them which is why I spend a lot of time with them. He doesn't support my career choice to be a Nurse because he thinks it's a woman's profession. When I told him I wanted to be a cashier once, he told me ""I always thought that was for women."" I told him, ""There are many male cashiers."" He was like, ""Yeah all the lame guys.""

He compares a lot of my behavior to women. He asks me why I never want to spend time with him and my brother. He tells me he wants me to spend time with him and his brother to be around the men and I am growing up to be a man. He tells me he's only trying to help me. I'm not doing anything wrong. Me being around my mom and sisters doesn't make me any less of a man.
When we do chores together he talks down on me, he belittles me, yells at me, makes me feel stupid, etc. He tries to intimidate me when we do chores by saying things like ""You're going to get a dose of manhood."" I hate being around him and doing things with him because he brings my mood down and is stressful to be around. When we're doing chores he'll tell me ""I don't want you to think I'm being too hard on you but you're growing up to be a man."" Being a man doesn't mean being disrespectful and treating someone like shit.

His intention is to try to make me into more of a man because he doesn't think I'm masculine enough. When I lived on campus at college, I never called him because I never had the desire to. When I talk to him, it's like I can't be myself. I called my mom all the time because she is less judgmental, more fun to talk to, and accepts me for who I am. He would text me and tell me ""Hey call me sometimes."" He's unaware of his behavior and why I don't want to talk to him or be around him. Maybe if he wasn't so judgmental and mean I would call him more often.

My dad also has a bad temper and has a history of losing it. When he's angry it's very scary. I also don't like to spend time with him or go out with him because he has a bad attitude, is disrespectful at times, and very uptight. Being around him is like walking on egg shells. I'm gay and in the closet. He's also a big homophobe and is one of the reasons why I'm not out.

I can't wait to move out and live my own life. I only talk to him because we live in the same house and he's unavoidable.

257,"So I am writing about my concern for my roommate, I feel like I need to do something drastic and heres why. '

Shes 20

90k in unforgivable student loan debt pursuing a nursing degree and a psychology degree despite getting turned down 2 or three times from nursing school. 

constantly talking about her mental illness, breakdowns, issues and general psychological issues to anyone who will listen. 


Has family in Hawaii that are pretty much no help or awarness for her, they let her take all this debt for nothing and also signed the responsibility on to her.  She lives in washington

Is on SSRI's but they clearly are stunting her ability to feel necessary emotion or develop self-awareness because she pretty much chatters on all day without a care in the world. 

Constantly watches television on nights with huge deadlines, and talks about doing so. 

Refuses to eat anything resembling healthy food, which im sure feeds into her depression. 

Refuses to address any of her spending habits, despite clearly needing to rethink her lifestyle, which is essentially buying as many books as she feels like and watching shows all day. 


says she cant afford therapy and will be unable to afford getting prescribed the medication she is using as soon as the prescription runs out. 

So yeah im pretty sure shes suicide risk #1 and I dont know what hotlines/organizations would be worth calling because talking to her has proven useless, like talking to a 4 year old she makes excuses for the most basic of stuff. Not to mention just being a generally bad neighbor/roommate ( weird pod-like living situation, dont live in the same room as her) . She herself has talked about checking herself into a mental institution, which would also be an option ? ",01Apr2018,3

From my understanding I need a 12RL needle for lining, but upon selecting it in the web shop I get the option of different sizes. Could really need some clarification here!

264,"So, me(16Male) and my mom are supposed to be moving in a few weeks and we currently rent a house where I live with her and my cat. My mom is remarrying and that is why we are moving, but the soon to be step-dad has a couch in the ground floor living room. From what I understand, The soon to be step dad would want the cat to be declared in order for her to live there. (I have only heard this through my mother). Originally we had thought she would be getting the surgery last Friday (3/30/18). Well on that Friday I didn't really think much of declawing, I know all of the cats I had previously were declawed but we no longer live with them, and I figured declawing wasn't a big deal. So that morning I had put my cat (who I had raised since she was less than a month old) into a crate and my mom drove off to give her the surgery. I went back to bed as it was very early in the morning and I decided I might as well do some research into declawing just to know what was gonna happen, And thats when I found some disturbing information. Specifically, the practice being banned in a large part of Europe and advocated for in many U.S. Cities, and all of the possible complications afterwords, as well as psychological problems which I also focus on. So after this I was kind of in shock as to what I had just sent my cat to, and thats when I found out my mom had got the day of the surgery wrong, it was actually Monday morning 4/2/18. I was relieved to hear that it wasn't too late to stop the procedure, but now my dilemma is this, and I'm going to be completely honest, I feel much more educated and knowledgeable than my mother and she is stuck in the 1950s. Anything regarding change is too liberal for her and after some arguing I managed to get out of her what I was searching for, which was essentially ""I care more about my new husband more than my own son"" Her wording was more along the lines of ""Im below my husband and your below me"" and that pissed me off because she's still believes vaccines cause autism and I am an A student in honors an AP classes, and she divorced my dad and caused a shit ton of problems earlier in my life, I preferred my dad but then he died so I was stuck with her. 

That's a little bit of background/rant as I just had and argument with her about this

The thing is, she wants to declaw my cat to protect one couch in the new house's living room, She won't listen or hear me try and show her the alternatives, She thinks the people advocating the ban of the practice are just liberals (which somehow means they're wrong just because they're liberal?) and when I pressured her about it, I think she may have blatantly said she cares more about the couch than my cat (Which she has expressed a lot of love for). I suggested alternatives, literally to just try anything before we go through with amputating all of her fucking nails and bones and tendons in her paws and she just doesn't seem interested.

I'm not a very good writer so I apologize if this is hard to read, I just don't know what to do. I was thinking that since my room is on the top floor of the house and nobody else will be up there, we could just put a gate at the top of the stares and close off the banister railing next to it and essentioally lock my cat upstairs in exchange for not going through with the procedure. I hate locking her in like that, and I would prefer we let her roam the couse, maybe coat the couch with something or put scratch pads next to the couch?

What should I do?



So quick update: I've managed to convince her to try covering the couches and putting scratching post next to the couch and if need be I will buy the nail caps, but if she scratches anything once she goes straight to the vet.",01Apr2018,3

277,"okay so. firs 27(M) I moved to a new town, got a new job. Tried to make friends with a female co-worker. Genuinely, actually just friends, not just saying that. During small talk with girl she lied about having a boyfriend and I don't know why. She has one and said that she did not. I happened on her page on facebook, he's handsome and they look good together. I have no reason to believe she is at all attracted to me, she hasn't indicated it once. I asked if she had a boyfriend during small talk the first time I worked with her, as just a sort of generic question like ""Where are you from, are you married"" like that. Since it is sort of a generic and common question it doesn't feel invasive either. This girl, around me, sort of talks less and makes less eye contact. She's very polite though, and sometimes I make a joke and she laughs with sincerity. So, I think it's a working relationship that's mostly indifferent but still retains a positive impression. We're basically just co-workers that don't hate eachother. We are the same age and the same ""style/type"" which was why I tried(and failed) to make friends with her. 

So. I'm sure she's not into me. Why'd she lie?

I'm just so curious, not particularly about her but it's like ""Why do people in this situation act this way"".

I recently broke up with my gf after a long time. She was my first gf and also the first girl I managed to 'pick up' somehow. Anyways, I wanted to get some more confidence towards strangers after the breakup so I decided to go out clubbing with my mates. But this time I tried to focus on girls, not just drinking and dancing. Eventually I came across a group of girls that stood right next to us. We started dancing together and made eye contact with some of them. After a while one of the girls started getting closer to me. So I tried my best showing  her my interest and got a little bit more touchy. BUT NOW IT GOT WEIRD:
So I stand behind her and grab her waist here and then (a little bit shy but still intentionally) and just moved around with her. But then my brain stopped functioning. I had legit no clue what to do next. I never ever was in a situation like that. I knew that I had to make a  step to get forward but I had know idea what that step is... So we were just kinda stuck in that 'level' until she and her friends decided to move on...

I don't even hate myself for that retarded action. But for the next time this happens, I would love to know what the f*** normal people do in that situation. So reddit, can you help me out?",01Apr2018,1
295,"Im gonna run a couple lists of stats by you before I begin.
The list of expenses my parents have taken on in the past year:

2-$1500 cruises (one which I went on and one without) that have yet to be payed off.
My mom traded her $200 a month sedan for a $495 a month truck.
My dad traded his outright owned sedan for a $425 a month truck.
My dad bought an old jet-ski outright for $2000 and a factory new one for $280 a month.
The two of them are saving up first last &amp; security to move into a $2200 a month house (our current one is $1200).

Now here’s a some other stats:
Cost of tuition with my scholarship for 1 year at U of South florida: $6410. This also comes with a 110 mile a day round trip and some online classes I’ll probably end up failing.
Cost of tuition and room &amp; board with my scholarship for one year at Florida State U: $10800. FSU’s been my dream university to go to since the 8th grade and my GPA would be at least .8 better.
They believe FSU to be a frivolous, unnecessary expense, going as far as to call me dumb and say id be “committing financial suicide” and have called USF the better option.

297,"Firstly, some important context. I'm in high school, And have been suffering from mental health issues for a few years, though they've only been particularly bad in the past year or so. A short summary of it is that I've had issues with anxiety, low mood, ADHD and Low self esteem, it gets to the point where I have considered suicide. I think the only thing stopping me from having done so is how much of a wimp I am.
I am seeing a psychologist but I am only in the early stages and have only been fully diagnosed with ADHD, though she has said that I have clearly had issues with the others.
The problem is that it's in my nature to hide my problems. I've done drama for a large amount of my life and as such am adept at hiding my feelings. The issue though, arises when I try to talk to people like my parents and friends about it. They say that if it was truly as bad as I say I would've talked about it more. They even accuse me of trying to get attention, which is far from true. My father even says he thinks I don't want help because I not actively following my psychologist's advice! I am trying as hard as I can but at current am finding it hard to adjust and statements like that make it harder. 
I love all these people dearly and don't want to cut them out of my life or even fall out with them. I simply want them to understand why it's so hard for me.

 Last year my brother complained to my SIL that I abused him recently (me and my brother are in our 50's). She sent an email saying she was tired of hearing about how I abused him and another complaint about me, (that I'm not grateful enough around them) to me . I asked my brother for specific incidents. I asked her for specific incident. She said I was no longer welcome in the home. 

Now, my other sister is in town and my mom wants to get together at the brother's house. I said I was told I'm not welcome over there. So apparently my mom told my SIL and she said to my mom, its okay I can go over there. 

To me, that doesn't resolve it. Or the bigger issue of gossip claims of abuse. My mom is nearly 90. She wants us to get together at the home. 

This is just one of many issues of passive aggression.
Advice please.

Edit: TL:DR   SIL told me I was no longer welcome in her home (the home I grew up in, she/my brother bought from my parents) because I wasn't grateful enough and she was tired of hearing about me abusing my brother (there was no abuse, in fact, when talking with them I don't disagree with either of them or challenge them or tell them anything negative about them).

March 9th they let me know they want me back for the second round and that they will confirm a date with me later

March 19th they inform me that March 23rd will be the next interview 

March 23rd I meet with the hiring manager and her boss and discuss my background for about 10 minutes, we then go into a conference room with about 9 other people who make up a large portion of the remainder of the team. They each asks me a question and this last about half an hour. The hiring manager informs me that they will be aiming to make a decision by the 28th.

Yesterday I get an email from the hiring manager saying she wanted to touch base and let me know they need just a little more time making a decision.

Today I got an email asking if I could call her before the end of the work day. She informs me that the team wants me to go out to dinner with them on Tuesday at 6:00 pm for food and drinks. Then, on Thursday I will be meeting with the director of the department one on one for a 30 minute meet and greet. She said not to worry about bringing my resume and not to worry about being ready for interview style questions and it’s just a meet and greet.

My husband is a quiet guy, and really sweet and introspective and intelligent. I am outgoing and loud, high strung, plus I have OCD and an eating disorder which add to the stress I cause. He was never abusive in any way until about halfway into our marriage, when we were coming down after a week of adderall use that I pressured him into. He was horrified with himself, horrified that it had happened, he said it was just the comedown and I believed him, and so did everyone else who saw the injury, because he is really not like that.

But it kept happening. And now it happens a lot. And he is a LOT bigger than me, and I am not well physically, and our kids will remember this.

Our rent is VERY late. I don't have any means to leave. I get three shifts a week waitressing and it's hit or miss. My Saturday shift, I pocketed six bucks because we were so dead. I usually make about $50. My physical condition isn't allowing me to work much more, and whatever I do make has to go towards our immediate and dire needs, like food for our kids and gas for the car.

But I'm scared. I have no idea what to do. I don't know if this will ever stop and I cannot destroy my kids by making them watch. I am not well physically or mentally, I require medication and monitoring (during times when I'm reckless about food, right now I'm taking care of myself as best I can,) and I worry that leaving will place my kids in another dangerous situation and make their lives worse.

I just need to figure it out. I know, deep down, I can't fix him. I can't make him want to be better. But I do love him, he has loved me through times when I know I wasn't loveable, and honestly I think I triggered this in him by encouraging him to do stimulants and being shitty during the comedown. But my kids are the victims. They didn't ask to be born into my mess, and I can't keep them around danger. They deserve the world, I just don't know how to give it to them.

310,"Greetings!

I am undergraduating in Economics. I try to be very diligent when it comes to my studies and I am always striving for good grades while also trying to learn the content as best as I can.

A very intelligent and known (around my campus) teacher noticed my performance and he said he'd mentor me throughout the course. He's invited me to watch classes on more advanced topics, directed to graduate students.

Of course, I was quite happy for this opportunity and I accepted it right away! I have watched a couple classes and did summer classes with him that were incredible and I could grasp most of the content.

Recently, though, he told me to get some credits in probability classes (advanced courses) that are very hard and I am unable to solve most of the exercises. This is affecting my performance in other mandatory classes and if I get a bad grade on the probability classes, I risk losing a scholarship that has been incredibly useful to maintain myself while studying here.

I don't want to disappoint my teacher, but if I'm not learning and I am mostly having difficulties and frustration, should I keep going? Even though if I risk losing a way of sustaining myself throughout college? I do feel weak when I think about giving up, but isn't accepting that you are not fit for the test a way of winning?

At this point I’ve been told that I’ll be a fat cheap bride and that I’m going no where with my life 🙃 

I’ve noticed that if we have dinner at their place that I will get SUPER sick almost immediately after eating. I’ll get hot sweats, have the runs, and feel like my stomach is as hard as a rock. I’ll have the same sides (veggies, bread, etc) as everyone but my main course will be different (due to me being a vegetarian). 

His dad will always say “I made this especially for loveandrockets96 so no one else can have her meal”.

I'm still a resident of Texas and intending to move back there (or somewhere that's not Oregon) after undergrad. I need TX paperwork.

I’m almost finished my General Education, so it’s coming to the point where I have to pick a major and would prefer to stick to it with no regrets or time wasted. This has been a big stressor of mine. As of right now, I don't plan to get anything beyond a Bachelor's degree. I’ve boiled it down to these three (in no particular order):

—Accounting

I try to not use it as a bible, but my Meyer-Briggs is ISTJ/INTJ, and I’ve read that a lot of ISTJ’s are happy as an accountant.  I’ve always had an interest in money. I worked at a minimum wage job for a couple years and even logged my wages on Excel and even calculated how much my net gain would be after taxes. I found that very enjoyable. 

Concern: I don’t really enjoy math classes. I’m not bad at them, but it’s hard for me to force myself to care about it. 

—Psychology 

Psychology has got to be my greatest interest of all time. Ever since I was maybe 11 or 12, I started showing signs of having psychology-related thoughts.  I absolutely love thinking on a daily basis about how/why we all think what we think and how our childhood contributes to make us who we are. 

Concern: According to what I’ve read, you don’t make much money unless you get a Master’s degree. The thought of being a social worker isn’t very appealing to me. I also worry that psychology should simply stay a hobby of mine and that it wouldn’t be right as a career for me. 

—Information Technology

I’ve spent much of my life on computers and enjoy solving problems. Over many years, I’ve convinced myself that this (or programming) was the field for me because I could do it without socializing much. 

Concern: I’ve never felt passionate about anything regarding working computers. I don’t really know what to expect or what they even really do. I know it’s not IT, but I took a Programming Fundamentals course and only felt slightly interested. 

———

—Info about me:

I’m honest, punctual, logical, practical, and matter-of-fact. I’ve had social anxiety my whole life, so I don’t particularly enjoy being around many people at once or having the spotlight on me- however, I can manage it these days. I love making lists in general and organizing my thoughts. I’ve spent a lot of my life in front of a computer, so I know what I’m doing on them for the most part. I currently live in Texas, USA if that makes a difference. Probably will move to another state once I’m fiscally able to.

The father is a chef for a successful restaurant (only open on weekends) and the mother is an ER nurse (also only works on weekends), so I have worked pretty much every single weekend (Friday-Sunday, at least 24-26 hours each weekend) for the past two years for this family. I had even babysat for them the day their son H died. The boys were/are wild and very disrespectful. They talked back to me, punched each other in heads, and on one occasion H tackled me because I took his Playstation controller away after he had thrown my phone into the woods behind his house. I'm a very patient person and that's one reason why I've stuck around with this job, not to mention the money is pretty nice too. But I'm tired of feeling taken advantage. The parents are unorganized and never tell me when I'm supposed to work until usually the day before, so I have to schedule my weekends around their plans. And that's another thing--I'm a senior in college about to graduate in May and I should be out enjoying my time with friends before I move out of state and start law school. I'm considering quitting because this weekend for Easter I had the option to go home and visit my family that I haven't seen since Christmas, but the parents I babysit for said that they desperately needed me this weekend. I needed the money so I said okay. Turns out they didn't need me after all, which I found out yesterday morning, so I wasted this entire weekend alone not making any money while all of my friends went home and spent time with family. 

I'm conflicted because I really love L and consider him almost like a son to me, but I cannot keep being pushed around by the parents who 1) don't discipline their children and 2) are so unorganized that it interferes with my schedule. I dread going to babysit every time Friday rolls around. I never know if I'll be able to pay bills on time because I don't know if I'll be making money that weekend. I'm also conflicted because I know they won't be able to find another babysitter better than me...I'm not trying to sound pretentious, but the only babysitter who lasted longer than me only worked for three weekends in a row. And I have been there for two years. 

I hate confrontation and I don't want to ruin any relationship we have because I do care for this family and I know they've experienced hell in losing their son. I just don't want to be taken advantage of any more. My parents were upset about the whole issue and have offered to pay me what I would have made if I quit, which is a big deal because my parents never give me money. So the financial part is taken care of. Should I hand in my two weeks notice?",01Apr2018,3
