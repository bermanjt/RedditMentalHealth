0,"I had relations with a girl when I was younger. She moved away and we lost contact. Fast forward a few months, I met my (now) wife and we eventually have a baby. Now, I love my kid and wife with all my heart, so much that i'd give up many of my own bad habits and our bond is tight. My wife has put up with so much, and my child is my most dearest daughter. We have been through soo much together and we planned on having another. 
Recently, my past girlfriend reaches out to me, after 10 years, and says I'm the father to her kid. I met him and I felt we needed to test to make sure. 
It was positive. 
It was my first and only son but the love I have for both of the women in my life have had all my love this whole time. 
They both are aware of the situation, of course, but it is my wife understands me when I state that I do not love my own son. 
She consoles me to have much more contact, but that love for him just isn't there for me. 
How can I learn to love my own son? I know what its like to be without a father so giving up my rights to him is out of the question.

Face to face it tends to go better, but even then sometimes I just go retard and nothing comes to my head.

3,"Hi, fellow Redditors. This may be genuinely interesting and may provoke some paranormal believers to say their input on this (and please, don't tell me ghosts and shit because I believe in none of that) but this legitimately creeped me out and I was wondering if I ask my friend to go to a doctor, or confront him again about what happened but here we go; I'm sorry if this is wrote in such detail but that's just a habit of mine when I explain things. My apologies to anyone reading.

So, last night, me and four others decided to crash at D's house (we'll call him D, I don't wanna give names) because his parents were away abroad for a week. We just smoked some weed, and chilled out in his bedroom with music etc. 

So later that night, it was time to start calling it a night and three of my friends went home, which left me and J in D's house and he allowed us to stay over (considering me and J live very distant, and public transport was not running so late at night except taxis and you know, they're expensive as fuck). 

So our best option was to just stay over, and get a bus or train home in the morning. So, me and J were put into the lounge where we slept on two seperate couches, and D slept in his room up the stairs so we couldn't really see him after we put ourselves to bed. 

So, me and J talk for a bit then we fall asleep. It was a good night.

2AM hits, and D start knocking lightly on the lounge door. It wakes me up first, and being half-asleep and barely conscious, I thought I was hearing things so I rest my head down on the pillow again. 

He knocks again and confused, I say ""D, what are you doing?""

D, who is outside in the hallway, says ""GET FUCK OUT OF HERE"" (literally his words, that wasn't an error). It sounded like he was extremely mad and said it while gritting his teeth. I thought he was just being a dick and joking around. 

""What?"" I say.

D tells me to get out of his fucking house and starts breathing really heavily. I'm really creeped out at this point (even though I'm a lot stronger than D), so I tap J to wake him up, and I told him that D is acting ""fucking weird"". I had to get my phone out to see because it was pitch black, no lights were turned on anywhere even where D was.

D started hyperventilating and J heard this and just said ""What the fuck?"" and we looked at each other totally puzzled. I was ready to grab something and defend myself if I need to.

But D walked away from the door and I could hear him walk up the stairs (his last words I heard were ""YOU FUCKING --"" and he was growling as he walked up. Fucking creepy) 

I was still half-asleep so we went back to sleep and I woke up the next morning and remebered what happened, but I thought that it was just a dream until J asked me about last night. I confronted my friend and he said he knows nothing about it, he was sleeping in his bedroom, and that I must have been dreaming. But we were not if J heard the same thing.

This concerns me alot because my friend has an anxiety disorder, which he normally handles well but I'm not sure if he blacked out or something during the night and thought we were intruders. Should I interrogate him about this and maybe ask him to seek help?

5,"Soooo I'm a telemarketer for a small HVAC company. Worked there for a year and 1 month. When I started it was easy and somewhat enjoyable. I got along great the other employees and never had any issues. It was a fine job other than being a bit boring at times. 
Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and things are totally different. There's a new manager who is extremely mean and tough on us. He harassed me for going to the bathroom a couple of times - in my defense I was sick and needed to blow my nose. I didn't wanna take the day off because I'd lose a day of pay and I didn't wanna blow my germs all over the office because I felt that was rude. So I went to the bathroom and few times to get some tissues and whatnot. Took no longer than a minute. There was also a new woman starting and she sat right in front of me and I didn't wanna be a loud ldistraction with my illness. I got very upset  at his comments and let the owner know. 
The day after that, I come to work and my desk is moved right in an area that allows him to spy on me and everything that I am saying. I have BAD anxiety so this set me off a bit. Then the first person I called for the day goes OFF on me for the script I used. The script that the new manager told me to use. I had a breakdown and ran out. Come in the next day and the manager goes off on me and calls me a liar! Says that I am not making all the calls that I say I am making. We tally up all the calls we make everyday. I AM NOT LYING ABOUT HOW MANY I WRITE DOWN! I was flabbergasted but I took it. I told him he was mistaken but he emphasized that he'll be watching me and listening to me everyday. I am so hurt and confused. No one ever asked if I felt better or if I was ok mentally. I thought I was appreciated at my job but I guess I was mistaken. 

What should I do? Was I in the wrong? Please help. I need advice. ",24Feb2018,1
6,"Recently my fiance left me, mainly due to us growing apart over an event we agreed upon. I'm in my mid twenties, and we're both still in school.

We decided to have an abortion because we both don't have full time jobs and are only about halfway through school - it was practical. I live in a west coast Canadian city. 

I'm usually pretty good with controlling my emotions. However, I did not foresee the loss of a child having such an impact on me, which is being exacerbated by the person I've considered my soul mate choosing to move on from what we had - I guess the abortion affected her much more significantly than it did myself, nonetheless I am still very much lost.

The advice I am looking for is how to move on from a break up, and how to deal with the loss of a child - or more succinctly the loss of MY child. 

I'm fairly left when it comes to politics, and have always been pro-choice. However, I did not realize or comprehend the emotional baggage that is attached to such a decision. I'm currently rethinking my values and life and where I want to go next. ",24Feb2018,3
8,"First of all, thanks for reading. I'm going to do my best to keep this on point and try not to ramble.

First of all, I'm 31 years old and about 2 years ago, I moved from up north down south to help my grandparents, and to also relocate so I had a better chance of staying sober. It's been really successful and I occasionally have a few drinks but its rare (My drug of choice was prescribed Percocet and Valium after a car accident, I've been clean since June of 2014 and moved down here October of 2014). Moving down here was the honestly the best decision I made. It got me out of a selfish environment and allowed me to save a little money while also helping two people who could really use help around the house etc. My grandfather was diagnosed with Parkinson's in the middle of 2015 and slowly but surely, he started to really show a lot of symptoms. Things he used to insist on doing like raking up leaves, or just basic things around the house he could no longer do, and I really didn't mind picking up a few more basic things. To be honest, these people have always been more of my parents than my actual mom and dad, so I would do anything for them. Now, after my grandfather was diagnosed with Parkinson's, he rear ended someone on one his rare trips to the library (We had been pushing for him to willingly give up his license, and he had stopped driving as much, but still would get bored and sometimes go to the library when no one was home, and he drove to count money at church every Friday. After his accident, he willingly gave up his license, and I agreed I would drive him to appointments any time he needed as long as I got some notice for my job, and to the library on some of my days off, and Fridays to count money. Due to this, my hours were cut from over 40, to about 28-32. My grandmother only charged me 200$ a month, but she started refusing to take money from me, even when I insisted, or just put it in her purse, it always found a way back whether it be ""surprising me with a steak dinner"" or picking me up socks and shorts and other stuff I never asked for. I addressed it a few times and would do things like fill up her gas tank for her, but after a while I just accepted it and left her the money to do what she wanted with it. Now before I go on, I want to make something really clear, while I said I would do anything for them, I also had a life, so there were times when I was unable to drive him to the library, and I missed a couple weeks driving him to count money, so I am in no way claiming I'm a golden child, I just always did the best I could for them and it seemed to be working fine on both ends. I NEVER felt like I was taking advantage, or that I was doing so much for them I didn't have a life.

Ok, so cut to November 2017, my grandfather fell out of bed in the middle of the night and had a major stroke, not sure if the fall caused it or vice versa. That's when everything changed. He was almost completely paralyzed on his left side, could barely speak, and was in need of serious rehabilitation, and most likely will be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. This is when the shit hit the fan so to speak. My family has always had a really tumultuous relationship. My mother, her sister(my aunt), and her brother(my uncle) have always had on-again off again relationships. I don't know if it was inherited from my Irish ancestors, or what, but my grandfather didn't speak to his sister for years either. Anyways, my uncle and my aunt did not speak to each other for almost my entire childhood. I never really knew why, so when my aunt came to visit my grandparents after I had moved down, I asked her and she reluctantly told me. I'm not going to go into details, but it was pretty heavy stuff, and I confronted him pretty straight forward about it the next time he was down. He vehemently denied everything and now looking back, I think he resents me for asking. Sorry for rambling, just trying to get all of this out so there is some context to our relationship.

After my grandfather's stroke, my aunt and uncle went into a frenzy to get down here ASAP. My grandmother was overwhelmed enough by the situation, but they managed to somehow make this about them and their travel arrangements etc. My uncle is also in charge of their finances and Power of Attorney, and he started to seriously look at their finances and notice that my grandmother was spending a lot of money on groceries and buying a lot of decorations for around the house. He addressed it and she agreed to cut back a bit as they might need the money if things aren't covered by medicare or my grandfathers insurance. So after my grandfather is released from the hospital he is sent to a rehab, and it was just an extremely stressful time in general, things kept being handled incorrectly but it was amazing how my aunt and uncle put aside their differences to spend hours talking to insurance and hospital personnel.

So about 2 weeks ago, I took a trip to get away for a few days while my aunt was going to be down so I knew my grandmother would be taken care of etc. When I get back I am told my uncle is coming down, and he's moving down for the foreseeable future. My heart sinks, because him and I haven't really gotten along since I confronted him about my aunt and him not speaking.

The first day he was here, everyone got along great, it was actually really cool to see everyone joking around and eating together in peace. My grandmother was ecstatic and I actually thought to myself that this might work, but we still had A LOT of work to do. That night I actually sat down with him and watched a hockey game and just told him straight up that my grandmother was worried we were going to butt heads and get into an argument. He told me he did have some issues with my sleeping habits (I do like to sleep in til 10:30-11 am on my days off if I can, and I am a night person), but as long as I pulled my weight we would have no problems. I was so relieved! So my grandfather was being cleared to come home, and medicare was supplying a hospital bed and a lift to get him up and down and some other necessary things. We needed to get rid of A LOT of stuff in a very little time. I worked with my uncle almost the whole day the next day measuring and clearing out their bedroom to make sure everything would fit. We got along just fine. And then it all went to shit.

We were sitting in the living room, and my grandmother, aunt and uncle were having some wine before dinner, I came out and sat with them for a bit. I don't remember what we were talking about, but it turned into my uncle kind of busting my grandmothers chops(lightheartedly) about how she is kind of a hoarder and needs to get rid of some of her stuff. I made a comment about something in the garage that could go, and his entire demeanor changed. It was like he had flipped a switch and become a completely different person. I call this personality switch ""The cop switch"". My uncle is a retired police officer, and while I respect all officers, I have found some of them to be difficult to deal with in their personal lives sometimes. My uncle can definitely be that guy, he is extremely alpha, has a really bad temper and can be completely impossible to talk to rationally when he flips that switch.

He asked to show me something outside, and opened up a little spackle bucket with a bag in it that had about 5 soiled pairs of adult diapers. I had known that my grandmother was prone to accidents, but I never really kept track of where she kept her soiled diapers unless I was home and helped her clean up. I had always thought it just a bucket for weeds or something. Apparently this set him off and he unleashed on me like I had never seen. He called me a ""lazy, worthless sack of shit."" ""freeloading loser"" and then showed me a trash can I used to pick up the yard where there was about 4 cigarette butts. He was furious, and when I tried to counter with ""Listen, I'm a smoker, I don't smoke in the house and only on the patio if it's pouring rain outside, and even then its rare"" He wanted none of it and continued to completely lose his shit, so loud that my grandmother, aunt, and a neighbor came outside. Now, I am not a fighter whatsoever, and get pretty shaken up when I'm faced with someone screaming in my face. I stayed pretty calm and just tried to deescalate things as much as I could, but after being told I was ""a fucking worthless piece of shit who should just fuck off and die and save everyone the trouble."" I lost my temper and called him a fucking asshole or something, I can't remember but I'm not a wordsmith when I'm shaking from adrenaline. After about 6 minutes of being berated inside the kitchen now, I just walked away and tried to have my grandmother and aunt calm him down. He seemed to, and my aunt came to me and said ""As long as you pull your weight, no more sleeping in, etc, then he's willing to assess the situation. Now at this point, I've calmed down enough to realize that no amount of changes I make are going to make dealing with this man any easier, and I tell her this, but agree. He overhears this and starts on me again, getting right in my face and he fake swings at me and I flinch. ""Yeah that's what I thought, you're just a freeloading scumbag little bitch"". I leave the table and just go to my room. I talk to a friend of mine to see if I was in the wrong in any way, besides losing my temper and swearing at him. I hear him flick on the bathroom light, and he yells ""LIGHTS OUT AND I DONT WANNA HEAR A FUCKING WORD OUT OF YOU"". At this point, I just called it a night.

I woke up the next day and my grandmother was an absolute wreck, I have never seen look so out of it, eyes completely bloodshot from crying all night. She doesn't want me to go at all, but she's intimidated by my uncle, and also, she loves him too and we really do need some help. I go to the rehab place and try to talk to him and I'm met with the silent treatment all day. We practice moving my grandfather from his wheelchair to bed and vice versa a few times, help him with physical therapy, and then head home. He completely ignores me when I arrive home, and in my room I hear him screaming at my grandmother that ""YOU AND [MY MOMS NAME] RAISED HIM TO BE LIKE THIS, HE'S COMPLETELY DISRESPECTFUL AND IMPOSING HIS WILL ON YOU. ITS DISGUSTING. HE NEEDED MORE DISCIPLINE."" my grandmother is sobbing now, and I've had enough, I'm 31 years old, and I know I'm in no ways perfect, but I also am not going to be constantly berated and called a piece of shit when I know the few little quirks I have are pretty easily fixed.

So my question is how do I deal with this man? I don't want to go anywhere, I want to help my grandparents, and they want me there too. My aunt and mother both agree that he was completely out of control that night and were both scared of him. I cannot deal with feeling like an unwanted guest in the house. Medicare has agreed that they will pay for a home health aid, so I just don't see why he doesn't go back home to his wife and kids, instead of destroying our lives. I'm sorry guys I know this is really all over the place, but I am just so freaked out by this and I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm living with a ticking time bomb, and I don't know a lot of people in my area, so finding a place in the short term is going to be difficult. Just any advice would be great. I'll update this when I get out of work and fix any mistakes.",24Feb2018,4

I ended up telling her on Tuesday, and the response was not something that I really liked reading (Yes it was online, I have way too much social anxiety to do it in person, and I assume she would be the same), she said that she was in a relationship, which I knew nothing about when I said it, and that she would love to stay friends with me. Obviously I said that I would love to stay friends as well, but it really did hurt.

14,"I am in a relationship with lots of issues. Towards the end it couldve been described as abusive. Him and I are currently taking a break (almost no contact) while I finish my studies abroad. I have demanded this because, while I love him, I found myself scared of him. His presence alone made me jittery and tense. I also have some issues that I need to work through alone. However there is a mutual desire and understanding to get back together once we have had some time apart. 

So now here I am, alone and doing well. I am making a lot of progress with several fields in my life that I've been wanting to work on. But one thing is still there...

I have developed an extreme fear- almost a phobia- of anything to do with open relationships, ""hookup culture"", threesomes and polygamy. This is because my partner has in the past put me under an extreme amount of pressure to open our relationship (he is hypersexual and I had some issues with sex at the time), have threesomes et cetera. I repeat, this is in the past. But now that he's gone I'm really noticing how much of an impact it has made. I go out of my way to avoid content that deals with the aforementioned topics. When I am confronted with it, I feel like it takes my breath away. I saw a trailer for a film on Netflix today that deals with open relationships and it made me feel a sense of terror that I can't describe. That was hours ago and I can't stop thinking about it. I'm shaky and my mind always wanders back to it.

I am, despite my history, very sex-positive, involved with the BDSM community, and I absolutely think that everyone should be allowed to do what they want with their sex lives. I really, really don't want this fear. I hate that I have it. I feel so stupid, and I really want to get rid of it. I am embarrassed to share this here.

I have attempted therapy but the two professionals I have seen (from my college) were not a good fit (very harsh and condescending), and I am in a very small town with no car, so I don't have any other options. I will definitely look into therapy again when I am back in my home country, but it'll be another two months until then. 

Does anyone have advice on how to work towards overcoming this, or at least how to not let this sort of content ruin my day when I stumble across it online or irl? I feel so lost. ",24Feb2018,4

I have spent the last four weeks trying to train her on our daily tasks. I have given her extremely detailed note sheets and have referenced them consistently throughout training. I have had her sit with the other employees to observe and I have sat with her personally and gone over the processes step-by-step. Time and time again she assures me she understands. She will perform the more simple tasks correctly but anything above purely basic, she has issues. 
She does not speak up and ask any questions even when prompted if she needs assistance. She has a tendency to just do whatever she feels is correct and we find the mistake later. 

When gently confronted, she swears she didn’t think she did that or just seems genuinely confused. I personally review all mistakes with her and show her how to correct them. She assures me she understands but then does the same thing the next day. 

I find myself going over the same material almost daily and she is still struggling. All note sheets I give her she just throws in a drawer or pins to the wall but I have never observed her looking at them. She does not have a bad attitude and seems to genuinely put forth effort but is still falling short. 

I try to be extremely conscious of my tone and wording used when I speak to her to make sure I do not come off as condescending. 

I have given her every available resource I can think of and it is still not working. I am beginning to doubt myself. I am reluctant to go to my boss as I feel it would reflect bad on me.

21,"   (Background, skip to next paragraph if this is unnecessary. 

I graduated highschool last year and my girlfriend is a year behind me and 17, she turns 18 in May. We live in Michigan and Michigan law states that one can move out at 17 as a runaway and there isnt really much the parents can do. I wont get into much detail but her parents are horribly abusive and told her she cant move out or go to college ever because she has to stay home and take care if their other tons of kids. She does not have a licence or car or job because of her parents, but she works hard at everything she does and will be able to get a job asap.
   
Okay, so after something her parents did she said she wants to move out, i do as well. But we're both worried that it might be hard to find an apartment that will accept us since she is 17, or if that doesnt matter.

 She is also worried that even if we wait until the begining of May to move out (when she turns 18) that her parents will be able to pull her out of school before her senior year ends. 

I just dont really know what im getting in to, i see quite a few apartments in the $450-$650 range and i have a car and two jobs and $6,500 saved for an emergency fund. And she is really smart and excells at school and getting a job should be easy for her.

30,"Sorry in advance for the long post but id appreciate anyone who can read and offer an opinion. I would like to hear some outsiders opinions and advice on something I'm stuck in at the moment. 
Me and a good friend met this group of friends a while back and were happily hanging out with them quite often. The good friend of mine has had multiple arguments with one person in particular in the group and everyone always sides with them. Now I can be quite the fence sitter and I like to please people, which I feel arnt the best qualities when in a situation like this and I believe I've kind of put myself in this situation. 
But recently my good friend had a bigger then usual fight with someone in the group which they kind of brought upon themselves but I do understand why they did. To the point they were threatening to fight each other over it. 
Now in the past I've been with these people while my friend wasn't around and they've talked quite badly about him and me being me have agreed with what they've had to say just to be agreeable and get along with them without awkwardness. Now in this argument and a couple of the last they have been throwing me under the bus and telling my friend I've agreed with them and said all this bad stuff about them which in a way I did but I feel like my words have been twisted.

Now my good friend is telling me he can't associate with these people and for us to be friends I can't be friends with them because it causes to much drama (which it definetly does). Now I'm stuck in the middle of having them all dislike me and having my good friend annoyed at me for the not backing them up in those situations where he's been talked badly about, which I understand as I value loyalty myself. 
I'm just lost as what to do and what would be the best thing to do be cut off by a good friend who I love and care about or be cut off by all these people. And I don't know if he'll forgive me for the bad talking.

Anyone have any advice or insight? It would be much appreciated. I hope this doesn't sound trivial but I'd love some outsider, unbiased advice. Thanks guys! ",24Feb2018,2

I'm 35 yo , and for the past 7 years I have kidney failure ,
I know this girl , she is not married but has 2 kids , and we used to go out as friends since I knew her 8 years ago,
After a few months we kind of lost each other, and I had my way with the kidney failure and she was with her kids, a few months ago I saw her on the street and we started to hang out again, going to movies , to eat, just for coffee and during these we started to talk about past relationships and stuff like that , I told her a few times that I like hanging out with her and she said the same, the thing is I think I'm starting to fall in love with her, it's so convenient for me to think about her that way, she knows and respects me despite of my dialysis , we go out once a week and by the time the next time comes I just miss her, miss her a lot, like something from me is missing , I guess that's the start of falling in love, the thing is , I don't know if she thinks of me this way, if it's mutual and im afraid to lose her if I tell her how I feel, what can I do?

33,"**I think I just want / need / will listen to ANY great pieces of advice any of you have with respect to in-person job interviews.**

**The role**
Mid-management at a significant non-profit org. I'm extremely well qualified for the role in most ways, though some of the content of the exact position would be somewhat new to me, but not completely unfamiliar. I vastly exceed most of what they ask for in job description, with only a few exceptions.

**About me**
I'm in my mid-30s, have a master's, over a decade of experience in this field (they asked for 8+), and almost 15 years of experience in professional work in general (I had a career switch early on).

My resume is a very solid ""A"". My cover letter is definitely very good. I've been successful getting a number of interviews for jobs I want.

I absolutely crush performance tasks, including the one for this job.

I'm pretty good in phone / video interviews, though not perfect. I made it through two so far in this gig.

I think I struggle, at least a little bit, with in-person interviews.

**The situation**

My job at my current org is most likely gonna lose funding later this year, and I have a wife and kids to support. This new job would be same pay as now, which would be great.

I applied for a similar job almost a year ago. Did not make it past two phone interviews. Neither person who interviewed me is part of the hiring cmte for this one.

A few months after that, I applied for another similar role. Got through an interview and a performance task, then came in for interview day. Interviewed with 4 people. Seemed to go okay, but not GREAT. I did not think I vibe well enough with the hiring manager, but thought I had a chance. Was told a week later I would not be moving forward.

I applied again for yet another similar position. Different hiring manager. Pretty good video interview with her. I smoked the performance task. Now I'm going in to interview in-person with her and another person for an hour, another pair for another hour, and then another pair for 30 mins. One person I interviewed with before (who I think liked me reasonably well) will be part of the second pair.

So, I think I tend to get a little overly anxious in in-person interviews. I think I talk too much, ramble on. I think I smile awkwardly and maybe make weird faces.

Otherwise, I think I do ""B+"" or better work with answers. Maybe even ""A-"" for the most part.

I've had a few other interviews for other jobs (plus last year at this org), so I have lots to draw from in terms of practice prep.

The interview is in a couple more days.

**What advice do you good people have for me?** How much more prep should I do? What kind of prep exactly? How should I come across as likable? They know that my work product is good (last time I didn't get to do a task), so I think that's a huge plus. What can I do to build off of that and not fuck it up? I'm sure the other candidates are excellent, so what can I do to set me apart? How can I show them how fucking badly I want this job without sounding desperate?",24Feb2018,1
34,"Sorry this is a very general question. I don't even know what I'm looking for. I just got rejected from my college's engineering department. It's been bringing me down all day, and I'm waiting to cry once I get back to my dorm. This is just my first year of college, and I know that there will be other opportunities for me to apply again, but I know that my chances of getting in are pretty low. I'm just an average student, with a 3.47 gpa (which is probably gonna get lower after this quarter). I know you don't know a lot about me, my grades, my extracurricular activities, or my skills...but I'm not asking for someone to tell me my chances of getting in. I'm just hoping to get inspired somehow.... Should I just stay in college (where I am extremely unhappy and basically have no friends), while knowing that there is always a chance that I'll end up a friendless, 3rd-year college student without a major? 

I've grown up believing that taking the college route is the best way to succeed in life. But is there more out there?",24Feb2018,2
35,"This is going to be a long one, but advice or encouragement in any form is appreciated. About a year ago, I needed some repairs done on my van that ended up costing about 850. I had just moved in with some extended family and had no job and no extra money, so I took out a credit card. There was a promotion where there was no interest for the first year, in what time i really should have paid it off. Shortly after, my friend and I set off to try to make a living on the road. Needless to say, that was a bust. We got a short term place, friend ended up leaving me to go back to her parents, and owing a bunch of money to our landlord, etc. She was working full time, and I'm working part time at a restaurant. We were sharing the finances and combining our income, but she up and left out of nowhere, leaving me with no money and only a part time job. Details with the friend aren't really relevant (she got tired of small town drama and went back to her parents), and I know now that I should have been prepared in case she left. So now I'm back at home with my dad, who has helped me as much as he can financially and otherwise, despite creating an abusive environment for our entire family when we were growing up. I can't make enough money at my part time job to pay off my credit card, especially with 30% interest starting next month. I owe money on old insurance policies and medical bills, etc. I get calls multiple times a day from places I owe, but I never answer them. I have absolutely no money to give them anyway, so I don't bother. I've struggled with depression my entire life, and it's gotten much worse since I moved back in with my dad. I just want to give up. My credit is ruined. I'm in a heap of debt with a job barely paying me enough to pay for gas. My boyfriend lives halfway across the country, and we had plans to get a place together this summer, but I don't have any idea how to make that happen in my current situation. My entire family is part of an incredibly conservative cult, which I only recently broke free from, which has complicated my relationship with family. I feel like I have ruined my life beyond repair. I can't afford to see my therapist as he lives an hour away. I miss my boyfriend more than anything, and it kills me having to wake up without him. The only reason I don't end it tonight is because I couldn't do that to my little brother, who idolizes me. I live every moment in crushing dread of debt and depression and loneliness. Please don't tell me what I should have done, I know all that. Any advice or encouragement would help.",24Feb2018,2

40,"A few months ago i got an amazing job. It suits my needs perfectly. I'm passionate about the work we do and i have lots to contribute and my coworkers are  wonderful and accepting, even though i'm batshit crazy. Its also a small company so we are a tight knit little group which is perfect because i suffer from debilitating social anxiety. I get excited to get up and go to work every morning, which is huge for me because ive been suicidally depressed for the past 13 years. I feel like ive won the lottery. I cant believe it, for once, something is going right for me.

... except now im developing a crush on my boss, whos married, and also his wife works with us too, and shes so cool and perfect and doesnt deserve a stupid little girl creeping on her husband. 

I dont have any friends here outside of work because im in a new town, and idk how to make friends anyway unless they talk to me first. So naturally i dont really have any exposure to any other guys these days. I'm also ugly as fuck and creepy and unlovable and never had a boyfriend so i tend to develop crushes on any male human that gives me the time of day. 

The problem is the crush is serious. My chest literally aches on days hes not around, and i feel so happy when he talks to me and when he tells me i'm doing a good job and its so fucking pathetic and creepy. I am so ashamed of myself. 

I know im also projecting a lot onto him, because literally the only thing i have in common with him is a passion for the work we do. It doesnt help that im fresh out of college and unused to having free time now that i dont have to do homework 24/7. so i dont know what to do with myself and just stay at home and get stuck in my head ruminating about work cause its literally the only thing i have going on. 

i think i need to find somewhere else to point my affection cause i dont want this to get out of hand. My job is too important to me to fuck it up over something this pathetic... but at the same time i know nobody will ever love me cause i am a disgusting, awful person. The best i could ever hope for are these pointless, unfulfilling, one-sided relationships. Idk what to do.

I cringe everytime someone calls me by my name at work and to be honest I'm starting to have an identity crisis because of it. There is a nickname I wish I could go by but it would be so awkward and embarrassing to have to suddenly tell everyone to call me by another name. I would hate the long and arduous process of informing all my coworkers and bosses of my preferred name, correcting them all the time, and then having to explain to them why I'm suddenly demanding to go by a different name after one year of working with them. For all I know, nicknames might not even be allowed! I regret not asking during my interview if nicknames are allowed.

Ever since I was little I have always wanted to follow my passions of illustration and writing. However, as I lacked confidence in my abilities and fear financial instability, I have always tried to consider other paths instead, such as law, software development and UX design. Adding to all this indecision is the fact that I have always been a good student in terms of academics, and was also brought up in a family as well as environment that values career prestige and financial stability. My internal conflict over all of this has caused me to become unfocused, undirected and unmotivated. I have a hard time making friends, navigating family relationships and having any confidence at all for dating. I realise that my career indecision isn't the whole cause of all these problems, but it really feels like a major roadblock for my recovery from depression and anxiety (which is a entirely another huge monster I am not going look at right now. I can write another essay about how hard it is to shower and get out of bed, but that probably belongs in another subreddit).

APARTMENT
PROS:
-living on campus
-more available for clubs/fun things on campus
-short-ish walk to classes
-my own personal space
-nice to go to after evening activities or night classes--no drive after
CONS:
-slightly pricey
-it is unfurnished---which means buying furniture, cookware, etc.,and getting a moving service because my family cant lift furniture anymore, on top of rent 
-heard through upperclassmen that maintenance and internet connection is bad
- parents are only willing to pay for apartment for this next year and commute in junior and senior year. Also have alluded to having to take on loans if I go through with apartment
-might be lonely/isolating living by myself

COMMUTING
PROS:
-save $$
-laundry and meals with the fam
-get to see my dog everyday
CONS:
-depending on traffic and time of day commute would be anywhere to 30min-1hr one way---longer with bad weather
-lots of sitting around and waiting on campus
-fighting people for parking spots
-long days--getting to campus early and not getting home until late at night
-worrying more about mileage and wear and tear on car

We've worked out there's probably at a minimum three mice in our kitchen, and we haven't found any evidence of droppings anywhere in the kitchen or house whatsoever.

72,"My university usually prescribes 1 or 2 books per subject. They usually cost around $150 each and sometimes even up to $250. Very small/supplementary books are still around $100, never less than $80.

Initially, I was spending $600 to $1200 per semester, usually around the $800 mark.

I then participated in the co-op buyback program where I usually get 50% back. So effectively I spent about $600 a semester since not all books are eligible to be bought back ie: I have a 13th edition, but there's a 14th edition coming out next summer etc which is still basically the exact same thing :/

Then I found this Sparknotes type website where students download the digital e-book and then sell them for about $2 or $3. So now I spend less than $20 per semester.

$2,000 a year is a lot of money. That's my annual grocery bill, a whole new wardrobe or a high end MacBook Pro.

I want to be able to support the professors that wrote it for the effort they put into it since a lot of them work for the university I attend and I know that it's specialised knowledge needing to be written at a high standard etc. But it's just so insane how much books cost. Also, the university writes some of their own textbooks for some subjects, which has just as many pages, staff input and to the same high academic standards; but they're printed in-house, not via a publisher so they cost like $15 to $30 each which I think is fairer.

79,"My parents told me before I started ninth grade that the only thing they wanted from me was to get a scholarship for college and to never do drugs or smoke. Fast forward to now in my junior year, not only have I gotten the scholarship, but it covers 75% of my tuition, and the idea of sticking a needle in my vein or smoking a cig to get high appals me. Admittedly, I did not really try in high school, but I channeled the little effort I did apply into the classes that mattered the most which is why I got this scholarship. Now, in 9th grade, I was a really good soccer player. I wasn’t doing so hot in math, but my career choice isn’t a math major, and my PSAT score was showing that I was above average at math, so I wasn’t worried. This continued until the 10th grade, where math was the only class I could not pass deapite getting hours upon hours of tutoring. Word got to my favorite aunt, who then planted the idea into my dad’s head that he should take me out of soccer. After she told him this, he became absolutely unbearable to the point where, despite my 3.7 GPA, my mom was backed against a wall, and she took me out of the club Inplayed for right before they entered a ‘golden generation’, so to speak. For context, I had about a season left until college scouts started to scout me, and scouts from my country’s national team were starting to notice me. Even being a part of the golden feneration of my club would have booked me a trip to Europe to play soccer in some big club’s academy. I used to call this aunt every Sunday while going to church because she was my favorite, but my love for her turned into pure rage in a matter of months. Even now I cannot being myself to dial her number because I start seething with rage before I get halfway through. She came to visit for a short time last month and I has the urge to knock her the fuck out in front of everyone so I had to steer clear of her. Well, about the math class, I visited my guidance counselor and he told me that having Pre-Calc in 10th grade along with all the other strenuous classes I had was simply not going to work. I got transfered into a new class and my grades almost immediately started to look up again. Essentially, my aunt, who lived on the opposite side of the East Coast from us with no fucking kids of her own wrenched the opportunity of a lifetime from my very hands for absolutely no reason, when she should not have been in the equation in the first place. Fucking bitch.





Well, without soccer, I was hollow inside. I couldn’t even watch games on TV because I would think that I could be on the big stage if it weren’t for my dumbass aunt. Then, sobs start to eacape my throat until I could not hold it in anymore. Well, I returned to an old videogame I used to play called Team Fortress 2, and now I currently have 1400 hours. I also purchased Overwatch  and that and Guild Wars 2 helped to partially fill the hole left in me by the departure of soccer by being highly competitive games that I could channel all my stress into. My competitive spirit was nearly-orgasmic anytime I booted up my laptop to try and push to Plat, or solo-queued for a PvP lobby in GW2. Well, my dad noticed my new hobby and didn’t like it one bit. One Saturday, he offers for me to go to his small business to help out and I agree because my laptop was seriously aging and my new PC parts were arriving in the mail. He teaches me how to do everything. At the same time, he introduces a new rule where there are no electronics allowed during the school year. The rule is perfectly enforced on me, working so well that a new clause was required that if I had an electronic in or near my possession, I was still eligible for punsihment even thoigh I was never seen using it. When my sister is sitting on the table watching Netflix (ranked No.3 in her school but has to work harder for a scholarship due to the opportunities at my school not being present at hers) or when my brother is literally binging Roblox or watching creepy pregnant Elsa videos on his iPad (didn’t learn times tables until this year in middle school, doesn’t want anyone checking his homework and constantly brings shit grades home, eats for pleasure, throws tantrums as a 6th grader when shit doesn’t go his way, generally a gigantic asswipe), he says absolutely fucking nothing. When I question him, his answer is “she’s doing good in school” and “I don’t want him to start making noise again”, respectively My dad starts to force me put of bed every Saturday morning to work at his job. One Saturday my former teamates had the Saturday off so they were going to go kick a ball around at the park and I said I would meet them. When my dad forces me out of bed that Saturday I say that I’m going to the park to kick a ball around with my former teamates. He goes absolutely apeshit. He starts beating me with a belt, but I still refused. He then gave up and went to work. This happened for two more Saturdays, and on the Saturday following, he opted to beat me with a fucking tree branch instead. I told him that I would call the police to try and scare him and he actually beats the shit out of me for it with the stick. 





Reddit, I am absolutely sick of this shit. I’ve done everything they’ve expected from me and more, but my dad wants to have his cake and eat it, too. I fucking despise him and all his relatives because they are fucking twats. Anytime I think of him and the twat-feat he calls a family, I remember I’m related to them and feel extremely disgusted with myself. He cannot think for himself and relies on them for parenting advice. They’ve instilled in his mind that the perfect son goes to school, comes back, eats food, showers, does homework then study for the next day, and then sleeps in that ficking order for five days a week, then works at his office all say on Saturday and goes to church on Sunday, all without saying a word. I’ve been running this schedule since 2018 started and I’ve burnt out in school, something that has never happened before. The fact that I have almost no hobbies or can go out with friends makes it so that I only have a small friend group in school, and I’ve literally been blessed by the heavens to be friends with a fairly popular kid in school, otherwise I would be 100% being bullied right now and both school and home would be hell. I’ve talked to my mom and her relatives about this and they’ve told me to stick it out until June of next year, but I simply cannot, plus the fact that I might have to spend two years in community college to keep the other 25% of my tuition affordable. I do not lnow when the final straw will be and how I will know it is, but it will be soon. My grades are dropping from above average to Cs in a matter of days but I cba to do anything anout it because even though I’m panicking inside, I still cannot be assed to so anything about it. I just want to be a normal kid with a sad who isn’t a twat amd a mother who isn’t too pussy to do anything about it. I need advice.

82,"I've been going through one of the toughest mood swings I've ever faced lately after being heartbroken, abandoned, and emotionally attacked by someone who used to be my best friend. Almost 2 months ago my best friend decided to just abandoned me for really selfish and unreasonable reasons and this really hurt me emotionally and mentally. I was in love with her and never really gave her any reason to doubt me or see me negatively, but one day she just started hating me and really started showing how much she was willing to go to make me upset and it worked. I still think about her almost everyday and it hurts me so much, especially considering that she probably just laughs at me with her friends because she just sees me as a joke. There is a ton of moments when I hate her back so much and other moments where I'm just willing to forgive her and go back to way things were before. She likes to play innocent and the victim a lot as well which doesn't help, she used to tell me that she doesn't disrespect others who aren't very good at handling their emotions, but honestly I think that inside she doesn't care at all and just wants to use everyone. She definitely used me in our relationship and played the victim afterwards. I need help coping with this and I don't know what to think of her anymore",24Feb2018,8

84,"This might be long, and disorganized, so apologies in advance.

I currently live with my mom and her boyfriend, along with my brother. We both do not like her boyfriend, because he is old fashioned and carries the baggage of his abuse from his parents, which in ends up taking out on us at times. He describes himself as having a ""type A"" personality. For me, this is no issue, but my brother has a history of social anxiety and hates him. He feels uncomfortable then, and I share that sentiment. Our mother knows we don't like him either, and she's argued with him too about this, but she started school to become a nurse for our sake and its not easy to simply drop that and leave with nothing.

I'm dating someone right now (its currently long distance) that I've known for years and its going well. I intend to move to live with her to close the distance and start my life with her. I've been talking to my mom about this for awhile, and in a few months I intend to leave.

My dad called me today, telling me that he spoke to my brother and said that he is worried about what he'll do when I leave. My mom and dad are separated. My mom right now is studying to become a nurse as well, so her focus has been primarily on school. My moms boyfriend is of no use here, as he's too stubborn (and old) to change his ways to accommodate my brother the way he should've been. I spoke to my brother, and he simply told me he doesn't know if he's going to stay with my mom and her boyfriend, or live with my dad. 

I feel like this is entirely my fault for putting him into this situation. I've expressed this to my girlfriend, and she understands if I would need to stay to watch over him, but I don't actually know what I should do. Do I go on with my life despite this? Do I stay and try to help him through all of this and make him comfortable? Ultimately, I can't make the decision for him and he's old enough to do it himself (he's 19) but I just feel guilty about all this. Sorry if there is some nonsensical stuff in here, I'm stressed and a lot of thoughts are racing through my head.",24Feb2018,2

Recently, I’ve been put in a position where I’ve moved out, on my own, and now looking into getting a car. I’m stuck between getting the 2017 Honda Accord LX (base model) for $20k or Sport.for $24k; a big $4k difference. The reason I want the Sport upgrade is biggest is the black leather interior, and some exterior cosmetic as addition, but mainly the interior is black and leather. The LX, on the other hand, has a beige interior which I’m not a fan of but $4k cheaper. Now the Sport has additional features like dual exhaust, spoiler, 19” wheels (from 16”), LED Daylights and Fog Lights; but my main reason is he black leather interior. Overall, the Sport feels like a more complete and satisfying purchase but with the LX being more affordable and my recent move every penny saved could mean a lot for emergencies and adding to my saving.

97,"I’ll start with a little background. Tl;dr will be at the bottom. 
I’m a firefighter/EMT in my town. There’s a very cute medic for the ambulance agency that I’ve found attractive for awhile now. This past weekend I ended up seeing her about 5 or 6 times while treating patients on 911 calls. I was the first responder, she was part of the ambulance crew. During the encounters there were a few smiles tossed between the two of us. I didn’t think anything of it. The last call of the night, I told her partner (good friend of mine) that I was interested in her and she seemed like she was being a little flirty. The next day my friend texted me her contact info. I sent her a witty text message which she replied to with a witty response. That was Sunday. We started texting back and forth non stop. I stopped by her station on Wednesday night and she was all sorts of shy and nervous. I was talking with other people while she was hiding up stairs and texting me that she was super nervous to see me. I convinced her to come sit next to me. She obliged but we were both too nervous to speak to each other. We continued to text back and forth non stop up until today. The context of the text messages varied but were increasing with openness about our feelings each day. Yesterday we were at the point where we were saying things to each other to cause butterflies. She said things such as: If we were near each other right now, I wouldn’t be able to stop myself from kissing you, she said if I didn’t take her on a date next week that she was gonna take me out on one, she started calling me babe, etc..My friend told me he saw her texting me on her phone with a goofy smile and when he asked her about it she told him she felt like we really hit it off and was excited. Yesterday (Friday) I saw her again briefly. We barely said anything to each other because we were nervous still. A couple of text messages were exchanged throughout the day but not as much as the previous few days. She said she had to go home after work and study for a test on Monday that she was nervous about. I texted her a few things throughout the night but didn’t really get any replies. I figured she was busy studying. I sent one at 8pm and 11:30pm with no answer. However, I also sent a Snapchat around 8 that she didn’t open until about midnight. That really got me thinking. Why can she open a Snapchat but not reply to a text, or even say something about not being able to talk because she’s studying or whatever. Every possible scenario has been running through my head and I feel like an idiot. 24 hours prior she was telling me she didn’t want to sleep because she loved talking to me, now she’s not even giving me the time of day. I don’t want to think negatively but my mind can’t help it based off my history with being cheated on or played. Any advice on how to approach the situation would be greatly appreciated. I suffer from depression that I am usually able to control but I’m starting to feel myself slip. 

Tl;dr: Started talking to a girl I was interested in about a week ago. Hit it off real well. Relationship seemed like it was escalating and headed in the right direction. Had a date planned for next week. Have been talking non stop since initial contact. Today she barely says anything to me.

I want to sell the old device, but I don't want to if it's illegal and/or if I still owe money on the phone. Sounds stupid, I know, but I just need some perspective.

104,"'Sup. First time posting on Reddit. Sorry if the following is vague.
I'm a student who signed up for a project-based team competition a few months ago.
I got placed on a team with Person A because s/he was the only other person who signed up for the same event and the event prohibited solo entries.
Person A was quite odd; they would say one thing on one day, and say something self-contradictory the next. They attempted to raise arguments about even the smallest aspects of the project. What I tolerated least was their passive aggressive remarks on the project and me as a person. I would have quit the competition, but the deadline for cancelling events already passed.
Whenever I called him/her out on his/her behavior, s/he would avoid working on the project for weeks or threaten to quit, while my parents and my friends would label me as inconsiderate.
Recently, he/she's gotten his/her hands on Person B's project without my knowledge and he/she wants to enter it into the competition instead. Deadline's in less than a month and the project we've worked on legitimately is hardly complete. Person B is not participating in the competition and has given us permission to use it.
Ideally, I want back out and find more trustworthy partners to work with, but it seems unlikely at this point judging from the deadlines. Parents refuse to listen because they think highly of Person A.
I can try finishing the project solo and give Person A some credit, but I don't think I can finish on time because of other things in life I have to worry about. Alternatively, I can accept Person B's project, but it goes strongly against my values.
What should I do? Any other suggestions?

110,"So my youngest sister is currently in 8th grade. She went on a field trip today to a nearby high school and was very taken; she even has an application filled out already. When I picked her up today, she couldn't stop talking about it and asked for my advice. Keep in mind that I wasn't exactly the best student in high school, so I'm probably not the right person to go to about academic-related things, but she seems to really value my opinion and hearing her say, ""I really like it but I wanted to wait for you to come home and talk about it before asking mom"" makes it really hard for me to avoid answering. 
The school that she's pining for is not your traditional, run-of-the-mill public high school. I'm not too sure on what it'd be classified as, but it's ""pathway-oriented"" and has a pathway program for culinary arts, which is currently her dream. My parents and other sister are completely against it because they don't really support her going into culinary and are also clueless when it comes to this school and how it works. They don't support her goal mainly because they think she's just settling for something that interests her somewhat and doesn't require a lot of dedication/focus on academics, which is something she struggles with. I'm also hesitant about it because, personally, I never had one set dream or goal in mind growing up and it wasn't solidified until I got to high school. I feel like going into a pathway program would seriously limit her exposure to other areas and she could miss out on potential interests that she might've otherwise pursued. It also sounds like she'd be locked in, so if she were to decide later on that culinary is not what she wants to do, it'd be difficult to get out and all the effort&amp;time spent in this program would've been wasted. 
Idk, I really want to support her and reassure her that someone in our family believes in her abilities (we have a huge extended family that, despite being very close-knit, doesn't take her seriously). But I also have all these fears and anxieties about letting her go to a school that I know nothing about to pursue something that may not be what she wants in the end. Ultimately, I think this is her decision to make, but without my parents' support she won't be able to go. Having my support would definitely turn the tide though, because they have a lot of trust and confidence in me/my decisions. But I just don't know if I'm willing to take that risk.
Does anyone have experience with pathway-oriented high schools, particularly in the LA area? Any advice is appreciated!
*Our school district isn't exactly high-achieving/distinguished, so I'm not too confident in the effectiveness of this school and if letting her attend would make a big difference. 

Edit: Thanks so much for the feedback, everyone! I've talked it over with my mom and she seems to be for it. Just gotta get my dad on board too, then we can check the school out. My sister is really excited about the entire thing, and I now truly believe that the pathway school will be much better for her both emotionally and academically. 
I'll try to keep the thread updated, planning on calling in sometime this week and maybe scheduling a tour so we can get a better understanding of what the school's all about. Hopefully all goes well!",24Feb2018,25

118,"So I have a pretty shitty living situation. Currently in my second year of college. My roommates and I haven't gotten along since day one, so I mostly keep to myself. Here's a list of some things I've had to put up with this year:

1. Racism and prejudice. 
I listened to them laugh at the NFL protests this past fall, heard them say that ""those monkeys have nothing to complain about"". Had them once tell me that it was ""gay"" to be involved in extra curriculars on campus (I'm very involved, this was probably meant to be a slight at me). 

2. Constant disruptions and laziness. 
More often than not, my rooommates will all skip class 2-3 days a week and sit around our living room in their pajamas playing video games and blasting music on their giant speaker that I can FEEL through the walls of my bedroom. I can never study or do homework in my living space. They refuse to quiet down when asked, saying that if I want to study I can go somewhere else.

3. Partying 4 nights a week.
I'm not much of a drinker/smoker. I understand the lifestyle but I just choose to not partake. Not my thing. Every Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night usually turns into binge drinking, and they usually smoke weed 6-7 nights a week. This leads to my final point:

At the start of the year, we all agreed on one rule: they would never smoke in the apartment. It's not allowed in on-campus housing, plus none of us want to deal with having the smell in our apartment. We all agreed, and they promised me it would never happen.

Fast forward to tonight, I came back after being at the library doing homework for 3 hours to them taking rips from their bong in our bathroom at 6pm. The whole place reeks and IDK how to confront them about it without freaking out.

I could go to my RA, but I would most likely get in trouble for having knowledge of them smoking/drinking multiple nights a week. I could try and move out, but at this point there's less than 3 months of school left and the move out process at my university takes at least a month and there's no guarantee I wouldn't be moving into a worse situation.

I really just don't know what to do here. I feel like anything I say to them is just going to make things worse, but the fact that they broke their promise to me is really just the icing on the shit cake. I can tolerate your political beliefs, even if they're blatantly racist. I can tolerate you being an inconsiderate piece of shit, because I can keep to myself and go out of my way to avoid being around them.

119," I met this guy 3 total dates, he fell for me hard, I rejected him on v-day after he kept pushing for me to be his gf. I told him I wouldn’t see him anymore. He went to a redhead hipster girl who had been wanting commitment awhile(not he said he didn’t feel spark with her)and made her his girl 7 hours later, made it fb official, introduced her as his new gf on Instagram, and she did the same her bf. (He didn’t know I checked this)


I came to pick up something i left at his place, he told me he’s not in a relationship, but if I change my mind let him know...
A week went by he’s very silent on instagram, no mention of gf tho she posted him, and then he logged back into his profile he hid on the site we met on(probably to look at me again)

Today he texts: miss me?

Me: I do

Him: Then what was the problem?

Me: It was going too fast

Him: I told you several times that we could slow it down

Me: I know. I didn't wanna waste your time though bc I didn't know how long it would take and you had people who were rdy

Him: It doesn't matter how long it would take! Him: I liked you dork Him: Unfortunately I also couldn't trust you to stick around and not bolt on me Him: You kept running away Him: We both really liked and were attracted to each other. It didn't have to be complicated

Him:But you wanted to have fun and I wanted something real and long-lasting

Him: I was planning future dates and you were planning your exit

Him: And that’s not fair

Him: And that hurts

Him: I'm not naive either, I knew it wouldn't work out because I liked you too much, and you knew it

Me: Sry

anyway we said a lot more _skip

Him:I was starting to develop strong feelings for you. I take it wasn't the same for you

Him:This conversation is only going to serve to hurt my feelings

Him: I'm sorry I didn't have whatever you were looking for or hoping to find

Me: Never said that

Him: You didn’t have to

skip

Him: You need to learn how to communicate before you can have a relationship with someone

Him: You didn't stick around long enough to even get to know me

Him: You made it all physical and I'm a sexual person and magnetically attracted to you so of course I wanted to do that but it didn't have to be that way 24/7

Me: You're probably right. But I am really sexual being and wanted to unleash it for a long time. You were like that too. felt a connection and an effortless comfort so I liked doing that. I was developing feelings and physical is my love language too I think

Him: Again, you’re not making any sense

Him: Everything was going great and why did you feel the need to self-sabotage your own happiness?

Him: All it would take is a simple conversation

-Skip-

Him: When can I see you?

Me: What days work for you?

Him: I’m all free

Me: Tuesday? What would you like to do?

Me: Want to go to xxxxxx and play Ms Pac-Man?

Me: Yes!!!!!!

Him: Can I get a picture of you before I go to bed

Me: * send him a sexy lingerie shot with some nipples showing.

Me: I just got out of the shower.

Me: Wet hair

Me: And pussy 😜

Him: Fuuuuuuuuck
**

**We continue to exchange sexy pics. He send me a vid of himself 

masturbating and as he rubs his penis he says “Sarah,(my name$ fuuuck. You are so fucking sexy”

His penis is very hard.

I told him I’m glad he reached out and he said “maybe 3rd times a charm lol”(I turned him down 3 times)

But he has a gf but he only with her because he couldn’t be with me. So looks like I have video proof of his infidelity, in additions I have a date with him on Tuesday.

**question** I told him in our conversation I am an honest person and I want an honest person as well, so is there anything he would like to tell me? He never even mentioned his gf once. So I go to his Instagram and it’s private. Then I go to his Facebook and his relationship status is private

Then Fb and I think she might have made private or taken down her relationship status , but I’m not sure if it was ever public. Then I go to her Instagram,and it still has some posts up from last weekend where she calls him “bae” , but if they were friends, wouldn’t she still keep those up if they broke off?

Tldr; guy wanted to first, I rejected him too many times, he went to his back up, he still wants me, we have a heart to heart, he says he’s free every night for me, he gets really, i flirt with him and get some naughty pics and video evidence he’s cheating, but I’m confused if they’re still together and how am I going to get them to break up. We agreed to date again and I said let’s go slow and he said I agree

The thing is, I'm really shy about my body. I usually wear really shirts a size too big and things like that to hide my body. Today, I was at the beach with my family and my sister asked to take a picture of me and I agreed so as to not seem awkward. She took it and told me that I should post it, and my parents agreed and said I looked nice. I agreed to because of their encouragement, but a few hours later I got comments from girls from my uni and old high school commenting on my abs and making flirty comments. I got really shy and uncomfortable with that (I know, weird) and decided to delete the pic. My sis texted me asking why I deleted the pic, but I don't know what to say to her.

127,"Hello. I’m white (vaguely mixed with some other things, but that’s irrelevant here) and I’m looking for gentle advice on how to right a wrong I’ve done as far as using a fake name on the internet. I have used my fake last name for years and years, and I love it, but I chose it solely because it is a beautiful Asian name, not because I have any historical significance with it. I realized it was indeed a problem when someone off the internet identified me as a person from this heritage when I am not. No one has “called me out” or said anything else about it. Let me be clear, I love this name. It has become a part of me, right or wrong, carrying me into my 30s, and I am frankly unwilling to go back to my “real name” online citing privacy concerns (but willing to change it to something different online!), so I’m wondering what I should do to shift this in a more positive direction. Just to be clear, this is not my legal name, I do not use it on legal documents— it’s a problem because I use it online in place of my real name (on Facebook) and it’s taken on a life of its own.

133,"  So, last night one of my best friends and I hooked up. We had been planning this for a while so no issues getting started. Best part about it was it wasn’t awkward and it still wasn’t after, (which is a huge sigh of relief because I was lowkey psyching myself out the whole time). 
  However, I’m having trouble sleeping because of two intertwined issues. After having an intimate event with her I feel even closer to her than I have before and I can’t help feel like I should ask her to be my girlfriend. The other intertwined issue is the fact that being the anxiety filled piece of shit I am, I know deep down that asking to date could potentially ruin our near perfect friendship and could very easily make things awkward between us. 
  The only reason we chose to hookup was because it constitutes no strings attached and no emotions so there isn’t any dependency or loose ends. Asking her out essentially creates attached strings and I already know that would make things complicated between us. I just can’t shake the feeling that since her and I connect so much on the emotional level and now, physical level- I just can’t help think that we’d be a perfect couple. Any advice?",24Feb2018,1

136,"Three years ago, my mother and sister decided to buy a dog. They did, even though I was strongly against it. The problem wasn't that I disliked dogs but I was very aware that none of us were up for the responsibility.

At that time, I was in high school. Now, I'm in my second year of university and my performance is very decent. I am constantly overworked and under pressure and stress from university work and also trying to maintain my physical condition by going to the gym three times a week.

My day is as follows: wake up at 6 AM, take the 7:15 bus, arrive at university at 9, finish at 4 PM, take the bus at 4:30 PM, arrive 7 PM (if traffic is decent), sleep at 11-12. Rinse and repeat 6 days a week, with all the details in the middle for maintaining a GPA higher than 3.

Now, comes the dog with all its responsibilities that I'm clearly not able to provide for. My mother is responsible for all the feeding and cleaning. My younger sister occasionally walks the dog and plays with her. Being fully objective, the dog is borderline neglected. And now they want to breed it.

We live in a small apartment, barely fitting a big dog and I can only wonder how the fuck are we going to fit 8 to 12 puppies? Thats not all, there comes the process of breeding which no one knows about and caring for creatures that are more fragile than glass for EIGHT FUCKING WEEKS.

We live in a third world country in a shitty suburban area with plenty of stray dogs and they drive me mad with their barking and screaming throughout the night to the point where I can't sleep and somehow I have to deal with eight puppies that do nothing but cry! ALL WHILE MAINTAINING MY MENTAL SANITY AND MANAGING THE EXTRA ADDED STRESS AND BE EXPECTED TO GET EXCELLENT GRADES!

This is a BAD decision. The breeding can go wrong, the litter can die, even our own dog might be a causality here. And what are we supposed to do with eight fucking puppies? How are we going to live it?

This is extremely stressing me out. I talked to them about the consequences to no real effect. My eyes are tearing at this point from imagining the possible failures including the emotional damage done to them which will reflect back at me. I cannot afford this. I signed up for a research competition that if I'm qualified for it can go global. I'm doing extra work at university to improve my career possibilities. Every single fucking day I'm doing something extra with no recognition and now they do this? Ignore all my effort and all my future plans and neglect my emotional well being because they want to breed a dog? Fuck me. The dog isn't even good enough to be bred! She is overweight, bad temperament and never been around other dogs before! This is fucking disgusting and extremely selfish! I kept telling them you need to work with the dog before fucking forcing it into having 8 others!

THEY CAN BARELY HANDLE ONE DOG AND WANT TO LIVE FOR 8 WEEKS WITH 8 MORE! 

I don't know what to do. I already wasted 3 hours panicking over this than studying and I feel like I'm ready to snap at them any second. This breeding can't happen. I feel like everyone is at risk, and while it is overly selfish, but I am at risk. I will be devastated if I suffer academically because of this.

If you managed to read all of this, I greatly appreciate you.

What do I do now? Should I just shove a shoe in my mouth and go with it? Should I snap at them so that maybe they can get a feel for the impact their terrible decision has? Should I bash my head at a wall and watch my life get ruined?

141,"  Do you ever start to feel like you’re cursed? Sometimes it feels like the wheel of fortune is a rigged game that will only make you think you can win. Let’s talk relationships for a while,

   There was a time in my life that I believed in perseverance. The first “love” of my life was someone I had chemistry with we went to same schools, went to the same parties, had the same friends. It was in a way full of sunshine felt like home. First time I asked her out was for the school dance so I concocted a plan even went as for to let my teacher in on it. I convinced the school to basically let me decorate a classroom so by the time she walks in to her class I’m there waiting with a bouquet of flowers with the cliche will you be mine? She smiled, I smiled , crowd gathered and wanted to see a kiss which was a lil weird but at the time it didn’t matter. It was perfect I remember my friend shouting finally he did it! It was cute.
  
Little did I know that it was all fake, I can argue that it’s because we were young but after two weeks she already finds somebody else and just probably never even wanted me in the first place. Honestly which is fine but I’ve known this girl for years she was close to me. In the end I was just tossed aside like I was just played with.

 I’m still not done here for there is a second time at this point I’m not even kidding myself. At this point I was an aspiring pessimist. As any  good self loathing person I went on to Facebook to “hit up” those I sorta kinda knew. This girl I got reattached with probably had the biggest influence in my life. We were both “toxic”, the relationship was dysfunctional and self destructive. Yet I loved her i genuinely sincerely cared about her. Probably because we shared so many hobbies but it was mainly because she reminded me of myself, yet it’s almost like she was the true “left part of my brain” the one that lacks remorse. As much as I respected her there comes a point when you start to think am I really happy. She was abusive and encouraged my destructive thoughts. The icing on the cake must’ve been when we finally got her an opportunity to work and make money something she’s been working towards, she ends up not going to the interview because she has anxiety. I loved her I wanted to support her Didn’t take long for her to say to me I’m just her obsession, doesn’t really love me.
Glad that ended.
The cake is a lie and so is love.

   This one is a bit more straightforward I met her at my workplace as a new hire we were having orientation. I was conveniently sitting next to one of the cutest girls I’ve ever met in my life. She appeared lost so she engages in a remote conversation with me. In all honesty I’ve never been more uninterested in a human being but she talked to me even asked for my number and I said screw it let’s go out. Surprisingly it lasted much longer than it should have, it was one of those relationships where you just don’t even care and get back together. The last straw was when we went to downtown to have a good time, barely drank and she hits a bouncer we get kicked out. She starts crying and when I try to comfort her she hits me. Says she was never into me, just go away you’re not who I want to see. I mean my feeling was mutual but it stung. Like a sore reminder that I’m actually sad.

  Just till recently I’m just not even asking for any sort of relationship with anybody. In a way I’m purposefully just trying to keep to myself. I’ve moved to a different state keeping an objective mind but like any way of life sometimes it gets clogged up with mess. I met her at work  this one was a free spirit. She’s the first person that tries to make friends with me. One day she just pulls me to the side and kisses me. Then right after says “haha it was just a joke not in a million years.  Please it’s never going to happen”. It’s almost like she had some resentment and had to take it out on me. I’m honestly just tired of feeling the same thing over and over. 

  All my experiences were the same!! Now It’s not the I have a desperate sense of entitlement. Quite the opposite those girls had every right to reject and say no to me but they didn’t they said yes played with me for a while then just threw me aside like a piece of shit. My sense of despair comes from the trust I’ve lost to even consider the benefit of the doubt. Who’s to say that in my case no one will ever learn to love me? On top of that who’s to say they won’t just treat me the same? Is there anyone out there that accepts the possibility of being alone forever and makes absolute peace with it?

146,"I’m sorry if this is not a very well developed post. I am sleep deprived, and upset.

My mom has been an alcoholic since before I was born. Not to make excuses for her- and instead to express an understanding and empathy for her- but she had a rough childhood. Abusive, neglected. She does not treat her 3 children nearly as bad. I am the oldest out of the three- I am 25, my sister is 19, and my little brother will be 17. My parents are not separated, but their relationship has not been one to look up to for a very long time. 

I grew up standing in the hallway, listening to my mom either tell the same stories over and over again for hours, or listening to her badmouthing my father. Her stories would range from her experiences in other states, or riding motorbikes, to complaining about all the times my father would take pictures of topless women on the coast right in front of her. She would complain that his brothers (my uncles) would speak badly about her breasts, or butt, saying neither would be good enough to satisfy him. She would say he was a loveless man, that he “kept her in a pumpkin shell and kept her very well”. I would stand still for hours as she would tell me over and over, and if she misinterpreted a facial expression, or if I responded wrong (as young as 9 years old, if I am remembering correctly), her stories would end and her anger would replace them. She would slap me across the face, then proceed to rage for the rest of the night. I couldn’t sleep for fear of falling asleep and her coming into my room and slapping me in my sleep. She would throw all the VHS tapes off the shelf. I took what I had to so she wouldn’t bother my little brother or sister. My dad would come home, and sit in his chair, and try to ignore her once she turned her anger to him. Eventually he would snap, after she would hit him in the face, or she was just screaming in his face for too long. He would grab her and they would throw each other around, but he never punched or actively hit her. He would just shove her out of the way or pin her down if she was hitting him, or lift her up and away to put her into a different room or sometimes even kicking her out completely.

As I got older, of course, I began to fight back. My mom would say I was fat- I reminded her of my Dad’s sister (who is a horrible person- and very much not conventionally attractive), she would say I was stupid, and that taking advanced courses would be too difficult for me. Now when she hit me I’d fight back, sometimes getting into very bad tussles. If my dad was home, he wouldn’t intervene until I had her pinned against a wall, or we were on the ground. My mom, while I was a junior or senior in high school, was now drinking a whole bottle of McCormick’s vodka a day. She almost died. After some time in the hospital recovering, when she came home, it seemed to get better. 

My entire life has not been every day in and out like this. This was sometimes weekly, sometimes monthly. Sometimes months would go by with nothing happening. But after she was in the hospital it changed my perspective. Something my mom always says is that she believes “I resent her.” I did at the time. I don’t anymore. I love my mother, regardless of how she has hurt me. I understand her own life is a hard one to live. Being in a loveless marriage, having mental issues but refusing to get help, and instead treating it with scriptures from the Bible, and remembering her horrible childhood. 

I moved out a year or two after a pretty bad fight where she threw a heavy glass at me, and it barely missed my head. It broke my window and caused a very rough reaction from myself, breaking out into a brawl in front of my little sister. 

Since moving out, my relationship with her has been better. She will text me at 4 am and say she misses me and loves me. Every time I see her I hug her and tell her I love her. But something changed. Her grandmother, my great grandmother, just died. My mom did not take this hard but she is the caretaker for her mother (my grandma) and my grandma is mentally ill as well. Both from old age and what I can only assume is genetic mental illness since every woman on my mom’s side of the family is batsh*t insane. Recently I’ve noticed when I go over she is saying things like- “you’re living in sin, not being married to your boyfriend”, or just small things. I was recently diagnosed with Chron’s, which scared me to death because my best friend has Ulcerative Colitis, and to my understanding it gets worse with time. When I shared this with her, she informed me it was a punishment from god for living in sin. I brushed it off at the time but it really hurt. I had reached out to her for comfort and she had insulted me. She insulted the state of the rental home we were in because the trim wasn’t painted. Just small things.

A few days ago I woke up to a text from her stating “I am pissed off at you I don't think that I can trust you and I want to thank you for taking (Sister’s name) burglar bar key off the wall so when a fire comes she's stuck I am pissed off”, then another saying “I'm going to find a way to change all the locks and I'm not even going to give the kids a key thank you for the crap you caused”. My sister had given me her spare key in front of my mother so I could get out of the house while visiting without waiting for someone to find their key. She didn’t say anything the day of. It didn’t sound like a big deal, but it hurt my feelings because she was saying she didn’t trust me. I’ve never given her a reason to think otherwise. Why would I steal from or hurt my family? I replied, in short, telling her I would return the key and I no longer wish to speak to her.

I texted my sister, told her mom was drunk, and she said she wasn’t. I fell asleep, and woke up to frantic calls from my sister. She confirmed she was drunk after all. My mom had thought my grandmother locked her out and punched through glass on the door to open it. The door had just been stuck. A few other things happened, and my mom was almost arrested. Again. My sister proceeded to inform me that my mother has been badmouthing me to her for the past year, just going on how she hopes my sister doesn’t turn out like me, how I resent her, how I’m a horrible daughter. Even after all my extra effort.

I don’t know how to proceed with my relationship with my family. My mom doesn’t work and she is always home- so if I cut her out I will probably not see my dad as often, and will have to sneak around to see my little brother and sister. At this point I do not want her in my life, at least for now. My feelings are hurt and I feel so down about her opinion of me. I am planning on seeing a counselor to help with the stress and my own issues with anxiety and depression that have worsened with the recent events. I don’t even know if it’s healthy cutting her off. She hasn’t texted me back. But it will be a while before I can see a therapist, so I’m really just looking for advice. I only see two options. 

I can either focus on my relationship and my home, which is WONDERFUL. My boyfriend is great. I can focus on my career, which I am currently trying to advance. Or I can put stress on my career and relationship by focusing more on my family, and trying to help my dad, sister, and brother, cope with my mother, who is on the path to heavy alcoholism AGAIN. I feel as though without me there, I am unable to protect my siblings from her wrath, and I am failing them. My dad is a pushover. I love him dearly but he refuses to do anything. I want my mom to get better. But I have no idea what to do anymore. It’s affecting my job, and my father’s job. And he can’t afford to lose his job again. I’m just feeling very hopeless and defeated right now. Thinking about cutting her out of my life absolutely breaks my heart. I still get homesick and miss her all the time. I am torn to pieces right now.

TLDR- my alcoholic mother told me she couldn’t trust me, and it was my breaking point after 25 years of verbal and minor physical abuse. Now I don’t know if cutting her off is the healthiest option for myself.

149,"So, I'm a pretty average looking guy. Nothing special about me really. I'm 21 years old and have never even held a girl's hand. Never kissed a girl. Never had a girlfriend. Never even had an intimate or romantic moment with a girl. 

However, recently, a girl that I have had a crush on for YEARS asked me to be her date to a wedding. This girl is, in my opinion, the most attractive human being on planet earth. She is someone who is very obviously pursued a lot by guys who are a lot more attractive than me. 

I'm not sure exactly why she asked me. Her friend told me she thinks I'm hot and that's kind of amazing to me. It's still so shocking to me that it's actually going to happen. However, I have no idea how its going to go down or how to handle it. I'm not sure whether to do something with her beforehand or if we should just show up to the wedding together. And even when we are at the wedding, what exactly am I supposed to do with her the whole time? 

I feel like a middle school football player who has now been thrown into a starting position in the Super Bowl. Someone please give me some tips here on how to handle this. ",24Feb2018,57

152,"Okay so I'm turning 16 in 2 weeks and I need some advice on what I should do? 
My step father who has been in my life for 10 years is just NOW trying to actually be a parent? He's always ignored me and if there was a problem just had my mom handle it. My mom has always been free to parent me as she saw fit. But appearantly, she's been doing it wrong this whole time and now he wants to step in. 
My mother and I are very liberal while my step father is very conservative and old fashioned in his thinking, he's also very hypocritical, saying I shouldn't be on the internet so much because of all the vulgarity online, meanwhile he's constantly on his phone (my mother and him get into fights over how much he's on his phone) and is cursing multiple times in every sentence he says. 
My mother has always taken a very guiding approach to parenting and everyone in our family thinks I'm very respectful and well mannered. I don't drink or smoke or do any drugs, I've never snuck out or been in with the wrong crowds. But my step father seems to think that I'm VERY disrespectful and completely out of control and is NOW taking a very VERY controlling approach to parenting which I'm having a hard time handling. I've always been given a voice and been trusted to make my own decisions and to take care of myself, while now I'm having that taken away, right when I should have it the most, as in a couple short years, I will be an adult and be forced to do these things. 

So I have 2 options at the moment. 

Either stay here and go to a school with less than 70 kids in it, when all I want is to blend into the crowd. 
Or I can go live with my biological father and go to a larger school and get a part time job and continue to be largely self governing.

155,"I seriously can't believe I'm doing this, asking for advice from people online. So I've fallen for an Intern at my job. She's 1 year older than me. At first I thought it was a simple crush, but soon I couldn't stop thinking about her. She was in the same department as me, but 1 week after I transferred to the night shift (where she originally worked), they moved her out to a snack bar. I barely know her, I thought she was very pretty when I first met her, but that was it, I didn't care at all. Soon I found out that she was actually very friendly. That's when I started feeling that way. So on Valentines, I gave her some chocolate, didn't want to give flowers since it would seem too serious and it might creep her out. She accepted it. A few nights later, she came to eat at the buffet where I worked. I didn't notice her until my Friend pointed her out. She tied her hair and wore a hat. It was as if she was hiding from me since in my time working there, she was the first customer to keep her hat on the whole time. My Co-Worker came up to her and talked to her about me. I asked my Co-Worker what she said and she was said that she said ""Then why didn't he just ask for my number?"" I don't know if that's true though since I have a weird feeling that she's just trying to push me to try harder. Then, my other Co-Worker came up to her as well and said ""Heyyy, did you know someone likes you here."" The girl I liked replied with ""I know, *** (The Co-Worker who spoke to her before) told me"" while hiding her face with her hat in my direction and blushing at the same time. I didn't know what to think or feel about that since through my eyes, it seemed as though she was trying to avoid me. A few days later, my Co-Workers wanted to go drinking since it was my birthday. They told me to invite her so I did. Sadly, she said she had plans to go eat out with her fellow Interns. While we were talking, I also asked her how the Chocolates were, but she said she has yet to open it since she was busy. On my birthday, we were drinking, I got so drunk to the point I started talking to one of the Interns about her. Just after when I knocked out from the alcohol, he said ""Oh her? She's texting this guy."" After hearing that, one of my girl Co-Workers said ""WHAT?!?!"" and called him to the party. Turns out, they argued. It wasn't actually the girl I liked who approached him, it was him who approached her. The next day, my Co-Workers told me about him. Some of them called him a fuck boy. This made me scared as hell. Just a few days ago, I've had suspicions that they were out together, but my Co-Worker thinks I'm over thinking things. My other Co-Worker is saying that she's passing by us a lot in hopes that I'd talk to her, but I find that ridiculous. It's been about probably at least 8 days since we've had a proper conversation. I still don't have her number. I don't know what to do. All I know is, she makes it hard to breathe, I can't eat sometimes, I can't sleep sometimes, I can't focus sometimes, and I couldn't even watch Black Panther with my Bro properly cause she was on my mind for almost the whole movie. She's all I think about on my days off too.

To sum it all up, I gave her chocolates, she hasn't opened them, she showed potential signs of interest (Asking why I didn't get her number, blushing, but this is all information from my Co-Workers, I don't know if it's true), a fuck boy, who probably emotionally hurt one of my Co-Workers, is texting her, I have suspicions that they hanged out (my Co-Worker thinks I'm over thinking) and I haven't talked to her in a while. Also I still don't have her number and she's going home(she's a different ethnicity from me, she's not from my country) in the summer.

Please give me advice on what I should and should not do, I've decided that I do NOT want to give her up. I don't care if she has to leave and I have to leave for college, separating us for a long time. I don't care if I have to wait for her for years because of college and the expenses of visiting her in her home. Please don't say ""Move on, there's plenty of fish in the sea"" because I truly do not believe that. I believe that no one in the world is replaceable.

158,"I've always hated myself. My parents were typical meth head hillbillies and were too fucked up to give a shit and I developed no sense of self worth. I went through school with shit grades and no friends until the end of high school where I branched out for the first time and fucked it up as bad as possible.  
  
I had just started hanging out with a few kids maybe 6 months earlier, we pretty much bonded over drugs exclusively. I developed a really painful crush on a girl (I say painful because it was my first real crush and I think it triggered a lot of mental health issues that turned me obsessive, I felt like if I could make a relationship work it would validate me and undo the years of being ostracized). I told my friends about it and was trying to figure out how to approach her, but they wound up telling alot of people and a boy she was involved with (i didnt know at the time, I think they kept it private) went on a rampage telling everyone about my pathetic attempt and how he was hooking up with this girl that I liked.  
  
I became the laughing stock of my town (which is super small in the middle of no where so there was no escape from it) people I previously had good relationships with before began mocking me for being friendless/a virgin. I felt so worthless, I had no parents to talk too, no friends who would address the matter without putting me down.  
  
I thought I was over it, the intense self hatred motivated me through college and my job, I finally had something to be proud of.  But my relationships are still toxic and I still hate myself. Early on in college I was obsessed with meeting girls. I was able to meet some but I always wound up blowing it. I had no social skills, no empathy, and no strategy beyond asking very traditionally for dates. When they said they'd rather be friends I would accept it but still be a toxic prick who said mean things to put them down, I was so insecure and would seethe with anger whenever we spoke. It leaked out as rude comments until it pushed them away.  
  
Eventually I just stopped trying all together, school  and work were easier, chasing money was so simple compared to trying to build relationships or friendships. I just graduated and have a great job on the west coast making lots of money but I'm as miserable as ever. Im ruthlessly bitter and spiteful, Its great for my job but every night I go home to nothing and no one. Im happy at work so I work 7 days a week, but I'm going to get old eventually and I can feel years of compressed loneliness building up.
  
I think I've matured a bit, at least enough to feel shame over the things I did to people and the lack of respect I had for women. But its not helping, now I not only feel anger but intense humiliation and I have bouts of cringing at my former self where I have to hit myself on the head to make the memory go away. I dont know what to do, I feel like I get angrier by the minute and Im so absolutely alone, I dont want to be this way and I dont want to hurt everyone I talk too. How do I change?",24Feb2018,6

164,"About 4 years ago my life took a heavy turn, I graduated from University, my gf broke up with me, my close friends and family members stopped talking to me, and I left my church. All happened within a couple of months. Since then I've been meaning to go back to school for my masters and change jobs. I haven't done either. I got all confused by that time 4 years ago and have barely been able to get back into things with my life. I never had a relationship since, just flings. I'm going to be turning 32 this year and I'm starting to feel so late with everything. The only progressive thing I was able to do last year was to buy a house for myself, which was a pretty huge accomplishment. However, I really don't have a lot of friends so I skipped out on a housewarming since barely anyone would show up, and I would've felt embarrassed to confront how few ppl I could call friends in my life. My weekends feel extra lonely since I barely know anyone, and I feel like I""m too old to join different clubs for activities. I tried joining a dance class for some time and it was honestly so embarrassing being with such young ppl and so behind in the class. I haven't been able to find a church since either, or at least I was never consistent because I never visited one where I felt I belonged. So now I barely feel a sense of attachment or belonging anywhere. Whatever I do with myself has fewer and fewer consequences to anything. It feels so sad to me because I used to be a youth leader, student, boyfriend, and knew many ppl... but now I lost just about all of that. I used to travel all the time, now I barely travel. I used to be so nice and busy. I just wanna get my life back, I wanna feel alive again. I'd almost be hesitant to get into a relationship now even if I had the chance because I feel like there's barely anything I could contribute to it. I used to invest so much in myself, mentally and spiritually. But that hit I took 4 years ago really knocked me off my course and I been fighting to get back on. I never thought my life would end up like this at 31 years of age while all my friends are getting married, moving on, getting degrees, the girl/guy of their dreams... and I'm here playing video games on the weekend.

167,"So, I recently started my 'dream' job about 4 months ago. I say 'dream' because it's literally everything I want in a job; great pay, my field of experience, really friendly and accommodating people, a supervisor I hang out with on weekends, a manager that speaks four languages and has cool war stories, and a boss with an impressive business acumen a great level of vision.

I'm making way more money than I could have imagined at my age (22) and this company is willing to pay for what will essentially amount to a university degree in exactly what I want to learn. It's really cool. My future for at least the next 2-5 years is set.

The problem is that I don't know what to do now. I spend less than 20% of my pay every week, mostly on fuel, food, and the occasional steam sale. Last week I bought a fake plant for my desk at work. That decision took me three weeks to decide on. I have a seriously decent savings account and I just spoke to a financial advisory for investment tips; chances are I'll have a stock portfolio before I turn 23.

I don't really know if I want that, thought. To be honest, I'm just kind of doing what I know I'm supposed to; not buying silly things or making large purchases, taking care of my car and body to reduce sudden costs, getting insurance, investing, etc etc.

Beyond this sort of ""You should think of the future"" stuff, I literally do not plan beyond the next day. Right now, my entire plan for the future consists of 'Monday - be at work by 9:30'. That's it. I don't know what time I want to leave on Monday afternoon, I don't know when I'm going to bed today or when I'll wake up, I don't know when or what I'll eat next, I don't know what game or subreddit to entertain myself with.

It's a pretty great life and my future is very bright, but it kind of sucks. Before I had this job, my life was much the same: look for a job, don't break my car because I'm sick of fixing cars, maybe have a sandwich tomorrow. That was my life for about three years. Even though I have a 'future' now, I still feel the same.

Anyone have some advice? I'm pretty sure that I'm perpetually lazy and just 'going through the motions', but I feel like this kind of monotony with life shouldn't hit until I'm 40 and had the same job for 20 years, not 22 and 4 months.",24Feb2018,3

171,"Update from this post https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7zpkpi/roommate_hasnt_washed_her_dishes_in_3_months/


So I made a long group message to both roommates, essentially calling A out even though I didn’t throw out names, saying that it’s really not good to be breathing in all this mold and the bin of dishes needs to be thrown away. she comes back with 

“1) dishwasher was looked at again this morning, it’s fine now, i’ve ordered cleaner from amazon before i use it to clean any dishes 2) part of the reason i got sick for a few weeks I’m pretty sure was from trying to clean the mold off by hand, which is why i havent continued doing it by hand 3) i’d set the dishwasher to wash the dishes in december before i had to leave in a hurry and it was a shock to me to get back weeks later and find it broken 4) i have a couple glasses in my room, sorry about that, since they’re not clean and i’m getting over the flu i didn’t want to leave them in the kitchen while we had no working dishwasher” 

This is the like the third time she’s played the sick card, I don’t understand how she’s supposedly sick for weeks on end and apparently isn’t able to function. If this is the case- you would think she would go to the hospital at some point. (This is essentially why she dropped out of school- she failed most of her classes for taking too many sick days)  
I responded just saying I don’t think it’s a good idea to put them through the dishwasher because the mold is so caked on at this point it’s not simply going to come off with hot water splashing on it, not to mention just contaminating the dishwasher with tons of mold. She then comes back with “well I can’t afford a new dish set” mind you, she has been buying packs of disposable plates and plastic ware, and she could easily use that money to buy a plate or two and some loose silverware just for her. 

At least she moved the bin of dishes, they are now in her room and not just sitting in the kitchen. I just fear that she’s going to let them sit even longer so she can avoid doing them. Our lease is up in May and I can’t wait to get out of here. ",24Feb2018,8
172,"My dads parents and two sisters got murdered before I was born. The case was never solved and everyone in my family avoids talking about it. Lately, I’ve been thinking about it a lot and getting a bit paranoid. I listen to true crime podcasts all day at work and started watching all kinds of crime series. I think subconsciously I’m trying to put some kind of story together about what might have happened to my grandparents? Am I getting a bit too carried away? Obsessive? Is this a case of inherited emotional trauma?
My dad has never spoken to me and my siblings about it. According to people who knew him before it happened, he was torn up by it and is a completely different person now.

173,"First of all I'd like to state that I do have enough money in my account to afford what I tried to buy, and my card has not yet expired. So basically I brought I few gems (like ingame currency) for the android game unison league. I recieved the gems that I paid for and after some debate decided to make another purchase, which was about £55 for 115 gems or something, however when I pressed the button to pay (I'm using google play) I got an error that refused to allow the purchase. As I stated above I did have enough to afford the payment. I tried to buy it about 10 times and eventually gave up. However I did go onto another game and buy something. This was about £1 and that transaction was allowed. About 20 minutes earlier than writing this I tried to buy something for a computer game, again more currency. I think this costed about £35, however when I pressed submit it said my bank refused the transaction. I checked my emails and I do have an order receipt for the gems I brought on the first game before I got an error, however when I checked my pending transactions everything seemed fine. So basically I'm wondering if you guy's had any idea on why my transactions would be rejected. I have considered that it might be because I tried so many times to purchase that gem pack that they might think someones trying to steal from me. Or it might be that the only money I have left in my account came from a check + plus a little left over, but that wouldn't make sense as £10 of what It'd used to pay was also a check. It doesn't say anything about this on my online banking account nor have I received an email. Any advice is greatly appreciated because I don't want my parents to complain about the rubbish I spend my money on. I can try a purchase again at a later point but idk.

Another concern of mine is if the failed gem purchase attempts suddenly get accepted, considering each one was like £50 and I tried loads that'd definitely be more money than I have, which of course I don't want to lose.
Thanks.

175,"My wife, who suffers from major depression and anxiety, has no respect for our financial situation. She will not look at the checkbook or help me keep track of it in any way, and she spends us into the negative every paycheck I make. She doesn’t work because of her anxiety, but refuses to go on disability because she’s afraid of losing an inheritance from her parents. When I try and talk to her about any of it one of two things happens. On a good day she says she’ll make some type of effort. On a bad day she goes into an anxiety attack and shuts herself in her room. She is under the care of a doctor who gives her meds and they do help, but not enough. Part of me wants to divorce her but she doesn’t have a good place to go and I’d probably wind up having to give her half my paycheck by the time the courts are done with me. Part of me still loves her, though and no matter how many times I talk to her about it, no matter how many times I tell her she is being a bad influence on our children, nothing gets any better. I think about taking away her account access and maybe just give her cash, but I’m worried how she will react. At her worst she threatens to leave and take the kids away from me, and at her best I get some noncommittal promise to do better that will be forgotten two days later.

It was only after I went on dates with other guys that I realized that he was interested in more than a hookup (he never made a move but he came to have convos with me many times) **and** he was better than the other guys.

He said we had a connection, and at the time I didn't want to get attached because I thought I'd be leaving in 2 months (now I'm leaving in 8 months). He faded away and is dating someone else (who looks a lot like me, actually).

I didn't realize he was great until I started dating again. The other guys have been less attractive, less intelligent, and more intent on hookups. I feel like I made a mistake with him, but at the time I felt like I was still young and could meet someone even better.

      The thing is, I really don’t like my old dentist because there is a really long wait time to get an appointment, there’s also over an hour wait time when I get there, and he is neither communicative nor does he do good work in my opinion.
     So I need to find a new dentist, preferably someone who is under my HMO plan, which limits my choices significantly, although I do have the money to pay out of pocket, I wouldn’t want to waste $5,000 when I could get the work done for a few hundred dollars.

A couple of months ago, probably on october/november I went to a friend's house with some buddies. There was this girl I liked (15), and I realized she was making moves on me. 
I asked her for a hug and I'm not sure whether she sat on my lap or not but we hugged eachother for a while. She was tall, and I could feel bra/breasts in my face, so I didn't think twice and decided to 'make a move', and I tightened the hug (snuggled on her chest, because, well, I like breasts, and thought it would show her I was interested).
A couple of seconds later, she loosened the hug and I let her go. I felt like there was this 'mutual consent' implied, so I didn't think she would mind me doing this. 

Now I'm not really sure if she didn't realize what I was doing or simply wasn't bothered by it. Other times I had met her, it was like nothing had happened, and she used to ask me for hugs and whatnot.

Now, I realize that what I had done was very dumb, and inappropriate. I feel remorseful. I don't know if I should talk to her and apologize, explain things (or would this create 'bad' feelings where there were none before?) or just move on, and live with the guilt. 
Now, I feel somewhat awkward/guilty around this girl, and it doesn't really help that she's my best friend's ""bff"".

185,"Since 2016, my 47 year old sister has seemed to have been spiraling into a mental break. She has been a drug addict for over 20 years, with some years of sobriety in between. She also has an 8 year old child that is currently in the custody of other family members. My sister's paranoia is growing more and more. She has put her child and other family members children at risk. For example, it was raining very hard one day and she shows up early in the morning, grabs her child and a family members child and starts driving east. She ""had it on good authority"" that it was going to flood. It was not going to flood. Before anyone had time to react (early AM, everyone was sleeping), she was gone with the kids. We were able to get the children back safely a few hours later, but not without a tremendous amount of stress. She also believes that the FBI is out to get her and that family members are working with the FBI. There have been 2 instances that the family has involved CPS, but my sister would duck and hide from them, so we received zero help. She also beat my mother so hard that my mom had bruises all over her chest. (My mom did not tell me until weeks later). At that point, my parents kicked her out of their house. She also believes that a senator has her under surveillance and believes that her child's life has been threatened.  

So, the advice that I am seeking is how do we protect the child? As I said, the child is with family currently. But, my sister can come at any moment and take the child. With my sister's paranoia seemingly getting worse, my family is growing increasingly worried. Also, the father of the child is around, but doesn't show much of an interest in turning his life around to have the child permanently. ",24Feb2018,3

188,"This is going to be long, I’m wordy and can be hard to follow. I’m sorry. 

Okay, backstory— I’m an artsy type, I draw/paint, I’m obsessed with the fashion industry and think I might want to go in that direction for a “big kid” career but I just don’t have many outlets to experiment with that where I live. When I initially graduated HS (at 16, mind you) I applied to a ton of art schools in NYC as a Fine Arts major, because I didn’t know what I wanted to do but I knew I wanted to live in New York. I got accepted to a few, and almost moved (twice!) but never did. 


I’m a 21 year old female and have been living on my own since the day I turned 18. Great family, we just push different agendas. I’ve been in two serious relationships over the past 6ish years, so almost 4 years I dated one guy and lived with him towards the end until current guy I’ve been with 2 years. We kinda moved in together from the get-go and then moved to a different city around 3 months after we started dating and it’s kind of been a shit show. Before you judge me on that, both of them honestly were and have been like “best friends” and just kinda happened. So, everything is cool with the relationship, the city just sucks and I haven’t clicked anywhere socially, or professionally and I’m usually known to be a work-a-holic. 

Now, with the whole “not clicking” thing, I’ve just become SUPER depressed. I’m past any level of depression I dealt with in the past, because now I’m just totally numb. Nothing bothers me, and I feel no emotion towards pretty much anything and everything. I don’t really have anyone to talk to, because my family just shoves their views down my throat when I try to talk to them about anything and I’m pretty sure I’ve been labeled “the weird one” in every social circle because people have just fallen off. I’m at the point where I’m struggling to socialize when I do have opportunities to, because I’m just out of practice. My S/O is great, but he’s super emotional and gets really weighed down if I really try to talk out my feelings with him. I end up bottling and just running circles in my brain day in and out, while simultaneously feeling like I’m wasting my life away. 

Oh, and the S/O is also a DJ/producer so a lot of our time and energy goes into his music career. That industry and his career has kind of melded into my life and it’s about “his” stuff most of the time because he already knows and is good at what he wants to do with his life— So my stuff kind of get inadvertently thrown onto the back burner. 

I recently did something REALLY dumb and financed a car and he co-signed with me, so I’m trapped in a car loan with the boyfriend. I’m thinking about just surrendering the car, buying a train ticket to New York, and figuring it out on my own no matter how shitty it could be. It would be a major f-you to everyone in my life though, because my family would think I’m having a psychotic break, and I really love my boyfriend and we’ve been through a LOT together so that would hurt. I still think it might be what I need to get myself in line, though. 

So, help me. Am I being irrational? Do I just need to take more vitamins, or should I ~follow my dreams~?

After that I talked to her some more and we were doing good. After that I said to her that I liked her and that I wanted to be honest about it cause I honestly felt something for her I rarely feel for people. 

So anyways, she turned me down very politely and I understood completely. She was on her period so the day after I brought her some chocolates that she liked and a nice note saying that even as friends I wanted to be there for her. 

Anyways I thought I’d get over her, we still talk to this day and its fun. I really wish I could be honest right now but after being rejected the first time I’m afraid to try again...

205,"This may be a bit long but please bare with me. Also I think it's a bit childish but still looking for advice. 

3 years ago I started playing an MMORPG to take my mind of some messy relationships and life in general. I had a blast playing it and I met some good people throughout my time. As I progressed I joined a guild, made friends did harder bosses with the guild members and felt a sense of accomplishment and belonging. 

Fast forward 1 year and our guild becomes big with a lot of members and the original few members who started it all became what we call an ""inner circle"" (IC). As time progressed the IC became more selfish and refused to assist any new guild members that joined in progression and just kept to themselves. I am as guilty as the other for doing this but recently I've started to help new members. We also made a discord server as our guild grew bigger and started talking in voice chat a lot more. However the guild master (GM) wanted to keep within the IC so our voice channel became private and everyone only talked in there. The new members didn't even know we were on discord and they always asked if the discord was active.

Life moved on we kept playing progressing doing stronger bosses and we got a new member in the IC that the GM approved of. This person came off as a good person however as time progressed we learned what they really were like; a toxic person. They were always looking to spark some form of argument or fight between members. They even went as a far as calling a new member out in the guild and made them feel so unwelcome that they person thought they had an issue with themselves. The GM didn't really think much of this as he was like it's all ""fun and games, no one is going to take it seriously"". Also the way they talk/type is very passive aggressive. Also this person loves to use me as a benchmark within the game in terms of progressions. An example would be ""If you can do this boss in x minutes you're stronger than him"". At the end of the day I just wanted to play a game and have fun, not turn it into a full time job.

Fast forward another year. The IC is still in our hidden voice chat and no one else in the guild uses discord. There's around 10 active members including the IC, at the point the guild can be considered ""dead"". So basically our discord is our own personal voice chat. Life moves on and this individual has gotten into several arguments/disputes with other players within the game. I've tried telling my GM that maybe we should discuss with them and tell them to tone it down or just move on from this person. The GM thinks nothing of it and on the daily I have to deal with this person either bench marking me in terms of progression or them talking to me in their passive aggressive tone. Usually I ignore it but one can only ignore so much.

Fast forward to yesterday. I got into an argument with said individual and it got a bit heated. We started lashing out they said some things, I said some things. Later the GM got involved and he told me I had to fix my issues because he knew what I did. I knew exactly what he was talking about. In voice I said some things about the GM within a small group of individuals that I thought wouldn't make it out of the voice channel but it did. I knew exactly who did it, I called them out and my GM is now defending this person saying I'm in the wrong. I understand that talking shit about people behind their backs isn't that great but I'm pretty sure we've all done it. My friend recently joined our guild too and when he was in voice chat he told me the GM and this individual were talking shit about me too. 

Now, I know at the end of the day this is a game and all but I really like some of the people inside the guild but I can't handle this much drama nor do I want to. I've got enough going on in life already. I was thinking of just leaving the guild but I don't want to do it on a bad note. Should I leave? Should I stay? Again, I know this is childish but the guild does feel like ""home"" as I was there from the start. ",24Feb2018,2
210,"2018 has been a shit show for me so far, and I honestly believe its taking a harder toll on myself than I let myself feel. I have incredibly disturbing dreams (not every night, but enough), and through my research its because I'm blocking out my thoughts and emotions during the day, so my fears and feelings manifest at night when I'm dreaming.

Let me just go over what I've been dealing with (this may not seem like much to some people, but for me personally, I've never had this much thrown at me in such a small span of time).

1). I broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years. We took a small break after dating for 9 months during november 2016-march 2017, during which he went back to his ex (whom he was with before me, they broke up twice), for only 3 months. Then they broke up a third time, and he came back to me. He still had feelings, admitted what he did was a mistake, she's not the one for him, etc. 

I turned him down initially, but agreed we can be friendly. Well, after months of being friends, hanging out, him devoting so much time to me/us, we decided to give it another go. We dated for another 9 months, only for me to find out he was secretly texting his ex again over the christmas break. I ended things right away.

Honestly it made me feel like shit, used, blindsided, etc, like I wasted my time. Luckily, he's a douchebag, so it's easier to get over him.

2) Just 7 days after I broke up with my ex, I found out that my grandpa passed away after a month-long fight in the hospital. What's worse is that he was doing very well the week leading up to his passing, so when we got the news, it was a total shock and devastating. He was my last grandparent &amp; I was closest to him. It hurt so much to accept. 

3) I've been feeling very lost in general about my life path. I don't know what career I want, what masters program I want to apply to (I'm in 3rd year University, I graduate in April 2019). I feel like time is creeping up on me and I'm running out of options. 
I really have no reason to complain...I'm in a great honours program, get good grades, have close friends, a healthy family life, etc. 

I just think that, with school, life, grades, exams, and everything else, I've repressed the grieving time for both my relationship and my grandfather. I'm not as happy as I used to be, I cry so easily, I get jealous easily. 

My sister has an amazing relationship with her boyfriend (who I really like for her), and don't get me wrong, I'm so so happy for her....but it reminds me of what I don't have. And that kills for some reason.

I keep having dreams about me getting shot/dreams involving guns and strangers. Just last night, I had a disturbing dream in which 3 men broke in to my friend's place, and shot her in the stomach, then proceeded to shoot me in the stomach. In the dream, I couldn't move, scream, or fight. I lay there and let them just shoot me...and I remember feeling my stomach being all wet with blood, then I woke up.

215,"I moved into an apartment at 238 Grand Ave in London, Ont. this past december it seemed nice, Spencer and Nina (the landlords) seemed friendly, the neighbor in the upstairs apartment, Bobby, seemed like a nice old lady. Man I was wrong. I think it started when my sister came over and we left her dog here while we went for dinner, I got a txt that it was barking so we left immediately and went home. When I apologized to Bobby the next morning she told me she didn't sleep for 3 days because of the noise, meanwhile the dog wasn't even in the city for a full day yet. I thought it was weird but did't really give it a second thought. When the landlord came to get rent on the first he demanded cash and I had to ask multiple times for a receipt he finally sent me a txt saying he got the money but didn't seem happy about it. He also had a list of complaints from the neighbor upstairs including a dog barking every night, a boyfriend (I haven't had a boy over yet) being rude and loud- she said she believed he lived here, not cleaning up after 'my dog', blocking her car - when there was enough room for 3 cars while we only have 2, and more. This escalated when she blamed me for the snow plow blocking (all) the driveways and she said that its my friend and he blocked her car in on purpose. The landlord fully supports her for every complaint even though I can prove majority are impossible, but because of this she is encouraged to complain more. I've had multiple noise complaints when I'm not even home and can prove it, I have bylaw and police coming for all kinds of complaints shes made up though I've never had  ticket or warning, she says I have a dog that runs off leash that I don't pick up after when I only have a cat. Last night I came home after work and had a notice that my cat was 'abandoned' when I only left this morning. I am loosing my mind I am so angry I need her to stop.

219,"I've heard the phrase ""don't care about what others think of you"" but I'm having trouble understanding why one should do that. I love people. And because I love and care about other people, isn't it natural to wish that they love and care about you as well? Shouldn't relationships be mutual? The whole ""don't care about what others think"" is confusing to me because if a lot of people don't like you, then that sounds like the problem is not with other people but something that lies within. For instance, if some dude was a total asshole to everyone and didn't care what others thought of his actions, maybe he ought to start caring what others think of him in order to become a better person?

224,"So this woman is my first girlfriend. I really like, I think she's great when she is around. My problem is she's extremely distant. I don't see her nearly as much as I would like to. I see her about every other week, to me that shows she's not really into me. After awhile and doing my part to try to set up more arrangements, I came to the conclusion that I'm wasting my time with her. I really really like her, but it feels like she wants nothing to do with me. I talked to her about it, I asked if she even wanted to be in a relationship with me, then she swore to me she did and said not seeing me that often is just as rough on her as it is for me. She is a regular at canceling plans. She'll agree to something then cancel after. When I first met her it wasn't like this. I used to see her no less than twice a week, I don't even see her once a week now. Her schedule is fuller than it was before, but I'm having a hard time believing she doesn't have anymore time than a couple afternoons every month, especially when I talk to her and hear about how many hours of anime she watches. After awhile I got ready to part ways, I really like her and I'm not comfortable with losing her at all, but something in my heart just tells me there's some girl out there in the world somewhere that will want to be around me as much as I'll be around her. So I broke it off. A few days later I get a call I should not have answered. She is in tears when she calls and was begging for another chance, promised she wouldn't be as distant. After this I felt like an asshole, so I agreed. I saw her the next day, and I haven't seen her since and it's been 3 weeks now. It seems obvious to me that her not being distant is off the table, but at the same time I don't think I have the nerve to break up with her and stay that way. I don't know what to do, I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I don't want to be stuck in a relationship where I feel unwanted.",24Feb2018,28

However there are people who when are genuinely stuck and ask me for help, but the problem is they stress me out and it's usually a really simple issue.

230,"Okay so yesterday I had a lab with this girl. I always had my eye on her, but I never managed to talk to her. So in lab I arrived late and my seat was taken, so the only seat open was the seat next to her. So I walked in and she smiled at me and I smiled back (of course). Than we started working on the lab.

It was rather interesting, and this was when I questioned whether she was into me or not. We were standing during the whole thing, and she would stand pretty close to me. I even noticed it and I mean I liked it, it wasn't like I disliked it. I say she was my lab partner, but really in this lab we worked in a groups of 4. Regardless, it was like whenever she needed help with something or anything in that regard she would always come to me. I mean during the lab I talked to her quite a bit, and she talked back. She seemed rather quiet, but the shy kind of quiet not the disinterested in you kinda quiet.

So I had walked out with her and I talked a bit to her. I gave her a few jokes, like I said something ""So, I am going to assume you are the smartest person in the class,"" and then she laughed. I also complimented on her watch, she had a neat watch on that wasn't displayed at the time but I had noticed it earlier. So it'll show her I was paying attention to the small details and not say something simple like ""nice jacket,"" or something.

Anyway, point is, I really enjoyed talking to her and if I had to assume, she did to. However, I can never pick up on signals really good. I rarely talk to girls that I find attractive like this, and the last time I did this with another girl she seemed to have liked me but turns out she has a boyfriend. I know though that this girl is single. So from everything I have said, is she into me or was she just being nice?",24Feb2018,0
231,"If anybody is interested, this can be an open discussion/rant/vent. 

A short explanation of my own, is that I am the first child of 3. I grew up in a small southern prissy town and my mom wanted nothing more but for me to be popular/preppy. She always told me what kinds of people i should and shouldnt be friends with and since i didnt know any better, i always listened. (Small town, my mom knew popular kids parents through church and such so she knew who to lead me towards) However, none of the people my mom wanted me to be friends with wanted to be friends with me. So i spent all of my elementary and middle school years as well as 2 of my high school years believing such. So yeah, i never really made friends. I eventually got bullied out of my high school and ended up going to an arts school down town and holy shit, my eyes were opened... i realized that i have wasted most all my life trying to do something i didnt even like, but i didnt know any better. 

So now in life, i am 20 and i have never really been through a ""phase"" and i feel like its too late now. My bf, who i live with has been through so many and has made so many like friends and hell, i never knew half this stuff existed. I feel like my mentality is at age 26, but at the same time, i feel like i was never young.

The aesthetics of my nose are definitely a concern but not.exactly why I am looking to get treatment. I fight in mma and any sort of contact what so ever, even just a little jab here and there will cause my left nostril to bleed immediately every single time, which is annoying but still not my biggest concern. Most of all, I have trouble breathing through my nose which often has me resorting to mouthbresthing in every day activities even if it's not exercising. On top of all the annoying dtuff I've mentioned I have serious issues breathing when I really need to under heavy physical tasks which is a big deal to me. I'm looking at getting what I believe to be a deviated septum fixed but my question is: will this procedure fix the external structure as well such as the bend/bump in my nose or would that be a separate procedure I would also have to do to address that issue. Is there something that would be a one-time, fix-all? If not what would you recommend to take care of st least the breathing issues and would you possibly have any ballpark estimates on price?

235,"First things first, Okcupid is not popular in my country, so I log in once a week or so to check if there are any new users (usually there is just a dozen of regular ones). Few days ago I logged in and there was that girl with nearly perfect match percentage. Reading through her profile and questions was really weird because I have never seen so many things that clicked with me, and call me naive but that was the first time in my life I thought I found somebody so attractive. I am not talking about her appearance (it was fine yet not exceptional) but her personality, interests and other things that could be inferred from fairly short but well-written and informative profile description and other details.

At the time I was way too excited to think straight so I decided to message her a bit later just to avoid accidently saying something that could sound inappropriate.

I spent whole day composing the perfect first message and in the evening gathered enough courage to try my luck. I sat down, clicked on the tab with her profile opened, refreshed it, and was greeted with a message that this profile does not exist or was deleted.

I have no reason to believe that she is not a real person: her profile looked fairly normal with all the quirks and mistakes people usually do while registering on a dating site for the first time. She had a bunch of Facebook-style photos, a ton of those annoying Okcupid questions answered, and fair amount of specific personal information filled in. 

Also I am fully aware that dating site profiles are deceptive and you should not trust such things, etc. As I was saying, it it's all in details. They click. Going on a date would be a good way to tell if that first impression was correct, and if not, I could easily get over it. 

Now the first question is, how do I find her? I know her name, I could recognize her face, I know her interests. Yet she specifically mentioned that she is not too outgoing, so trying to locate her physically at relevant social gatherings probably would not yield any results. Her name is fairly popular and first thing I did was to look up all owners of that name located in my city on Facebook, to no avail. Either she has no profile (unlikely) or she registered under some random nickname what people of her (and my) type usually do. 

Second question is, should I try to find her? She invested quite a lot of time into her Okcupid profile but in the end decided to delete it. Maybe she thought it was an embarrassment (in line with her personality), maybe she already found something she was looking for. Maybe it means she does not want to be bothered, and my efforts would creep her out. Or maybe she was disappointed with unpopular website and would be glad to know that I looked for her. Yes, these are questions I am tormenting myself with.

Any advice would be useful. Optimistically thanks in advance, folks.

255,"So I should start off by saying this will be very long but I would be extremely appreciative of any advice!

So I met this girl, who I’ll call Jen, freshman year of high school (we’re juniors in college now) and have pretty much had a crush on her since I first laid eyes on her. As hard as it was I never tried to express my feelings to her and never let them get in the way of our relationship as friends, frankly because I didn’t think she was interested in me that way. After high school we went different ways. She went to school about an hour away from home while I went all the way across the country for school. 

I went about a year without seeing Jen at one point and lost touch with her. I had had a girlfriend and went through a bad break up and truthfully hadn’t thought of Jen a whole lot for around a year. I remember I saw her back in May for the first time in a year by locking eyes with her from across a big group of people (at a party) and for some reason it popped in my mind at that moment that she’s the one. It felt just like that first day of high school when I saw her for the first time. Ever since then I’ve been crushing on her but still haven’t really tried to talk to her (my anxiety doesn’t help here)

Now this is where it starts to get juicy. So my best friend (we’ll call him Tom) is dating Jen’s best friend, has been since high school. I transferred back closer to home after 2nd semester last year and now go to the same school as Tom and am 20 minutes from Jen. Toms girlfriend comes to town most Thursday’s and Jen often comes with her since they live in the same city now and these are usually the only times I really get to see her, besides some weekends. My birthday was 2 weeks ago and she had mentioned to me multiple times that she was so excited for it which I didn’t think was weird but just a little different from how she usually acts. So my birthday comes and we spent just about the whole night together while we were at the bars with our other friends. We get to the last stop of the night and everyone’s pretty goofy at this point, she started to get a lot more touchy with me than she had ever been, playing with my hair, and at one point pulling the strings of my hoodie towards her so we were face to face with each other in the bar. I hate to get all lovey dovey with this but even as tipsy as we were I felt a comfort while looking into her eyes in that moment that I’ve literally never felt in my life. In that moment everything felt right for me for the first time in years. We looked at each other for a few seconds then just smiled at each other. One thing led to another and she ended up coming home with me. We did NOT get the deed done FYI (both pretty drunk, pretty much just made out for 20 minutes before passing tf out with her in my arms. 

Most people would probably expect me to be upset about not doing the deed but I honestly didn’t care about that (cant blame me for getting absolutely hammered for my 21st lol) I was more upset that it felt as if I’d missed out on my chance to ever be anything with her. I saw her the next night and talked to her a little but not much. Went a week without seeing her again after that weekend and while things weren’t as awkward, something just feels off. I wish I could just talk to her about everything and see how she feels but I feel like it’d just be weird. Even before the night of my birthday, Toms girlfriend had started to make jokes about how Jen and I should sleep together, which isn’t exactly unlike her to say but I just found it odd how she began mention it much more lately. Even the last time we all hung out (last night), she made a joke about how Jens bed is big enough for 2 people. 

Sorry this is all so long. I just had to get this all out. The last week since the drunk birthday night has been some of the most stressful days of my life. I’ve been stressing over her literally since the day after it happened. We still haven’t said a word about that night. I don’t know what to think of all this. She is my dream girl and I’d love nothing more than to talk to her about things but I just don’t know how. Does she have feelings for me?

**Background:** 

I work at a small business that deals in an afterschool extracurricular activity as well as test prep and tutoring for grades 1st-12th. My work is staffed by the owners (a couple with two kids) who work and teach there, as well as a few other instructors. We see each other multiple times a week and travel to many different competitions together. As a result, we are a very close group of workers. In the last two years, I have been heading the 1st-6th grade classes as well as building curriculum and help coach the competitive team. Not to toot my own horn, but I'm an integral part of the business. I helped build the program from two classes a week to five classes a week and I constructed the classes for the younger group of kids as well as a specialized class for the 6th graders. I give personal attention to over 100 students and often do extra work from home by working on documents, emailing parents, and planning curriculum. It is important to note that the businesses has been growing rapidly since I have been there and they recently opened a second location that is going to start classes soon.

**Dilemma:**

I am ready to go back to school in the winter (so about 5 months). Considering the workload and the hour-long commute, I know that I won't have time to juggle both. I am really nervous about letting my bosses know that I will be leaving because A) I am really important to the operation of the business and I don't think finding a replacement will be easy (or even doable) B) my departure is very poorly timed as they are about to roll-out their second location  C) I am very close with my bosses and would like to maintain a relationship in order to use this work on my resume.

I want to know if 5 months is enough of a notice in this situation. I also want to know how I go about letting my work know in a way that allows for me to maintain a good relationship with my bosses. Lastly, I am a very non-confrontational person but my bosses can be VERY intense and I am worried that they might also try to talk me into saying so personal advice on how to deal with that would also be appreciated!

266,"I’ve realized that I try to self sabotage myself when I’m doing well. And it’s a fight that I rarely lose but I feel like all that energy I spend fighting has an opportunity cost and it’s taking a toll on me.

This is my situation, I’m doing really well for a guy in his mid twenties; got a cool job, nice salary, live with a beautiful soul I call my girlfriend, nice apartment, healthy, etc. I used to dream about having this life when I was poor, or when I had to sleep in my car because I couldn’t afford housing. 

Back then, the best of me would take over, and I would be determined, work on myself, I would be focused on my plans and have my priorities straight. Part of that focus was due to the fact that I had no choice, it was either improve myself and work or find myself on the streets. But now that I have achieved one of my big milestones, what do I do? I procrastinate, I started drinking more often, I don’t work as hard anymore, I look at porn and waste my time more often, because I feel like even if I give myself these pleasures, my status won’t change. Before, I didn’t have a choice but to do what I had to survive, but now that I have options, I choose the pleasure route if things won’t change. But that’s the problem, things don’t change, it’s been hard now to continue my growth because I can’t find that momentum. And things are getting dangerous now, I may be drinking a little bit too much for my standards, I have been chatting with girls at social gatherings and they do seem interested, I have been shamelessly playing video games when I’m supposed to be working, I’m afraid of where this is escalating.

I try to willpower myself out of these situations, but I feel like it’s a battle that I’m starting to lose, and I’m getting tired. As I write this, I’m in control, and have my rational hat on, but there are moments where sudden impulses take me by storm and I have to fight myself to stay on track, or not do something pleasantly destructive.

I hope this post doesn’t come off as humble brag or something like that, I’m genuinely worried, and I’m trying to stop myself from doing something really stupid; this has been going on for a year now. 

Has any of you been in a similar situation before? How did you get out of it?",24Feb2018,2

268,"I've written a lot about this incident so feel free to read my post history if you want to. Here's a little backstory anyhow.

**–––LONG RAMBLING STORY START–––**

I was abroad a little over six months ago. Just before flying back home I had sex with a woman, and I noticed that the condom had broken afterwards. I told her about my worries, and to my shock she made it clear that she wanted to be a parent, and that she is a lesbian. I was destroyed, and flew back home shortly afterwards.

Upon arriving back at home, I was a wreck for three months. I could not work, I barely ate, and all I could ever think about was this incident. I became needy and dependant on my friends all the time. I had to meet someone every day, because that's the only thing that could help me to escape these thoughts.

I eventually found the woman on facebook, added her, and wrote to her. Her first message was ""Hi, I might be pregnant :)"". This whilst knowing my position on this. I don't want a child and she knows it, so why the smiley face? She then changed her story, she said that she went to the doctor to check, and they said that she's not pregnant, although the *feels* that she is pregnant. She then asked me if I'm still in her country, and I told her I'm not. She then send me a picture of herself in a t-shirt, sporting a visible bump. She refused to answer any questions, and all the time she gave the impression that she's trying to mess with me (although I can't be sure).

I deleted my facebook account and waited weeks before adding her with a fake account, which looks like a generic spam account. I did this so that I could keep an eye on her, in hopes of finding out the truth. So far I haven't seen any conclusive proof either way, but much speaks for that she isn't pregnant. She hasn't liked any facebook pages related to being a mommy, or anything of that sort. I figure women might do that if they're expecting, but hey what do I know. Besides, she doesn't post there every day.

Many weeks later my thoughts spiraled out of control, and I was sent to an emergency psych ward after walking into the emergency room with tears in my eyes. I've seen a therapist eight times, and I've been prescribed antipsychotics for the past two-ish months. The therapy sessions helped a bit I guess, but the medicines have been the most effective. I've been able to work, and most of the time I feel only shitty intead of extremely shitty.

*If* she got pregnant by me she'd be about 30 weeks pregnant today, so by early May I might find out the truth. Despite the medicines and therapy sessions I feel extremely tensed up as the goalpost is getting closer and closer.

**–––LONG RAMBLING STORY END–––**

What's your advice on how I deal with the situation if I find out that she was in fact pregnant, that I am in fact a father? I'm legitimately scared of what I might do to myself, consindering how I've been feeling merely from the slight risk of it. I'm genuinely afraid that I'll take my own life. Any words of encouragement, consolidating words or facts are appreciated. ",24Feb2018,2
269,"Update: he's getting evicted. His girlfriend's other baby daddy kicked down his door, trashed the place and stole his stuff. This happened not even an hour after I posted this. One of the other apartments called the landlord and said he'd start the process ASAP.

A few months ago ""Jay"" moved into our small building of 8 apartments. Here's his bullet points:

• Loud at all times of day. Music, exercising, video games, fighting with girlfriend, etc.

• Constantly fills the hallway with weedsmoke.

• Deals weed.

• Openly smokes outside the apartment building (illegal state).

• Has a long violent record.

• Phyiscally assaults his girlfriend.

• Demands he gets the parking spot closest to the door. Sometime even taking up two spots.

• Pretty sure he's driving around with no license since he had two DUIs in the past 18 months.

• Literally not even an hour ago he threw his girlfriend and three children out the apartment while punched and kicking her car and windshield. It was bad. Children crying and screaming, throwing shit at walls, etc.

You get the point. The nieghbors beside him already moved out because the landlord wouldn't do much about the weed stuff, but I don't think he knows the guy also deals. My main problem is that if I complain or call the cops there's a very high chance he'll know it was me and that's no bueno. If we can't come up with a solution then it's move out time in the spring but I'd rather keep the place I'm at.

Thanks for any advice!

270,"So I am currently 15 years old, and I need help to find stuff to do. Up until this point, I've just spent the majority of time playing video games. However, i share a computer and room with my older brother, who also spend the majority of his time playing video games. And although I do like playing, I cant always whenever I want due to him. Whenever I'm not on the pc, i typically just sit around or watch youtube.

Quite honestly, I think im using my free time terribly by just sitting around. I can feel the unused energy inside me, and I'm starting to want to use it, but I have no clue how.

Of course, as previously stated, I'm only 15, with limits what I can do. I dont have all too good of a social life (mostly just sit in my room, play games, and study), and have no real idea of how to improve on that. I don't have any real way of transportation, so I can't do anything too far away. I also live mostly near main highways and such, so its near impossible to walk anywhere. In addition, in my state, im still too young to start working a part-time job, and I'm not given any time of allowance to make money. My parents have a general idea of who I am, and have always supported just playing video games, so its awkward to try to convince them to let my try other things.

So, factoring in my age, lack of social skills, lack of money, and lack of transportation, what are some hobbies I could pick up? Im good to pick up just about anything. (I've thought about trying to get in a better shape, but for whatever reason I just haven't, mental block I guess)",24Feb2018,2
271,"I am 16, and when I am in school I stick to my own age group. But when I get home, more specifically when I am on the Xbox, I have an 11 year old from my school who I regularly play with and talk to. 

All sounds good. But I feel like he is afraid or intimidated by me or something. I don't like to be cocky, but I think it's fine to admit I am reasonably popular. I think he is too in his year, but I am not completely sure. He knows I speak my mind and don't take shit from people. 

I am kind and respectful to everyone who gives it back, but if I see someone being a dick to anyone else I have no issue being the bully who bullies the bullys. I love to stick up for the underdog because I was very unpopular in first year and have climbed the social ladder over the years, so I like helping people up with me. 

I also have a close inner circle, I associate myself with many but everyone knows that I ""like"" very few people and it is extremely hard for me to consider people my friend. I am with most of them because I am in school for 6 hours and need someone to be with, not because I am choosing to. I am not being a dick about this, we are all aware of the extent of each others relationship which is why this kid was very appreciative when he accidentally called me a friend, he realised and apologised and I said there's no need to correct yourself, you are a friend.

Again, it all seems good. But I don't know. Something feels off. He knows I would do anything for a friend, literally anything, but he would refuse my help even if he needed it. He doesn't speak much when I show up. He can't even maintain eye contact. 

I know I might be reading into it too far and he might just be an introvert, but the last thing I would want is to be pressuring him to play online with me. I don't want him to feel like he has to be my friend or I will get pissed off at him. I don't want him to invite me to parties the second I get online just because he thinks I will do something if he doesn't. I have plenty of people I could play online with, even more so on the PC, but I chose to be with him and I want him to consider me a friend because he is genuinely fond of me, not because I intimidate him. 

I need help. I really don't want to be unintentionally pressuring him to associate with me. I have spoke to him about it but he is young, and I really don't talk to him much outside of Xbox, so he just says that everything is fine and that he likes me.

First message was in december telling me to check out something he'd posted that we had been talking about previously, and the next message was a ""how are you"" last month.

One day I walked in on them talking negatively about my unemployment situation and just generally being unsympathetic about the whole thing. I wasn't surprised as they are constantly gossiping about other people while I prefer to stay out of drama and am usually neutral. I have also poured out some personal information to them thinking that they wouldn't tell anyone when they have in fact done the opposite!


I am currently quite conflicted as they have helped me during times of need; they've picked me up and drove me to places when I didn't have a drivers license and are usually the first people to help me out when I really need it. I have tried returning the favor whenever possible, but since the last year or so I was not able to stay in contact due to depression of being out of work.


I am quite hurt and am not sure at this stage whether I should still invite them to my wedding or not. 


My question is:


A. Invite them to the wedding, let the friendship fizzle out naturally/ repair itself as time passes by 


B. Confront them about it and not invite them

So I told her I was here for her and said I was free tomorrow and could go over to help her with some of the stuff she was dealing with if that would help. She said ""That would be great, thank you, we'll talk tomorrow."" (I took that as her accepting my help) 

But... We didn't talk.  I texted her in the morning and said good morning and asked how she was doing. No answer. Then, hours later in the afternoon, I got worried that something bad had happened to her so I called her, but  it went to voicemail. So then I texted her again and asked ""Hey are you okay?"" A few minutes later she sent me ""Oh, I'm good, did x, y, z. Forgot my phone at home."" without even acknowledging the fact that we had had plans that day, or asking how I was doing. I took the hint when she didn't mention the plans, and stopped messaging her back besides ""Glad you're okay."" 

I feel really mad and hurt, and honestly she's done this to me before. Where she invites me over or something, and then I wait all day to hear from her to say ""Come on over"", only to never get it, and then the next day get a response that she forgot about me or some other weak excuse. It is really hurtful. 

I was going to send this text but I'm not sure if it's too mean/needy.

""Hey, so yesterday I was under the impression that we had talked and made plans to visit today. I was really concerned for you and waited all day for you to get in touch with me to let me know when you were ready. I would have understood if you had wanted to be alone, but I really wish you had told me that rather than just going quiet on me - that honestly makes me feel horrible and like I don't matter to you.""

289,"I (21m) have been dating this girl (21f) for 6 or 7 months now.
I've been in some shitty relationships before. My high school sweetheart cheated on me with her coworker and the next girl after her cheated on me with 5 other men and played it off like it was my fault. (in a sense she may have been right because in hindsight I didn't care about her very much but it still hurt).

Anyways I wasn't looking for a relationship with anyone when I met this girl but I fell pretty hard a few months in. She is genuinely amazing and if I will be with her for a long time if I can do anything about it.

Recently I've discovered that (possibly due to my past relationships) I am not a very trusting boyfriend. The littlest things like my gf wanting to go out with her friends for girls night sparks a territorial caveman rage inside of me that I know is completely irrational but it consumes my thoughts.

My girlfriend is a free spirit for sure and has given me zero reason not to trust her and I keep causing arguments with her over dumb shit that I usually end up apologizing for but I can tell after our last argument she is at the end of her rope with me.

If I freak out again she will leave me.

So OK. Just bite my tongue right? Think about the situation before I go assuming she is disrespecting me and talking to other men right? That's easy enough but I want to be able to be secure regardless of what she is doing without me around.

How do I learn to trust her and how do I learn to be okay with her having her own life and not be so needy all the time?

292,"I stopped working for nearly 4 months. My last job was in a night club, which was extremely disgusting workspace. But that is for another story time. Let's begin with several problems that I have with life:

* I tend to lie a lot. Sometimes, I myself belief on my own lies. I lied to people that I had relationship, got accepted to university, got a scholarship and so on... I would lie anything to get away with it. The truth is, never been in relationship, my GPA is around 2, I don't think I can apply into any universities. However I never   ever asked additional information.

* I don't work, because I am embarrassed. Coming from medium-high class family, they simply kick me out of the house after the age 17. Barely had enough sleep since I needed to work full time at night and study at day. However, when I came back to my home country, I simply don't want to apply job, due to my ethnicity. I feel like that people are going to be racist against me at my home country.

* I want to work what I want. I want to find job, what I enjoy doing. I applied several companies in three different countries that I am eligible working full-time with no restriction. I got ZERO response. Some companies I applied two or three times, and still no response. I am trying to apply for Fullstack Developer.

* I am pretty much wasting my time. In my home country, I need to have a transcript to apply for university. The school that I used to go, have deleted my records from the database. As they say they keep student records for 5 years. So i don't even know how to apply university at my home country.

I am not satisfied with my lifestyle. Every single day have no meaning whatsoever, and I made no goals whatsoever on how to improve my life. And even if I want to improve my life, I need some sort of finance to start. My mother gave me all her saving from retirement so that I can start a new life, however I feel extremely unmotivated. She reccomended me in getting a coach and try to sort your life out, because NOBODY will do it for you.

Previously I was working at restaurants but I stopped because it was draining a lot of energy and I had really unhealthy life balance. Working for 10-12 hours, a total of 220-260 hours a month. I am not too sure what to do now. But I've been leaching at my grandparents place for 3 months already. And I feel humiliated that she needs to sustain me via her retirement salary, even though she doesn't have conditions and keep asking my mother for money. ",24Feb2018,2
