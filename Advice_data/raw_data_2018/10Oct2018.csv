So over the past 2 years I've realized that I've been hopelessly addicted to video games.  Recently I just purged all of them.  I sold my Xbox and tv then I factory reset my pc.  Now I have no games at all and not sure what to do with myself.  I've literally been sitting here starring a my monitor screen doing nothing for a really long time.

6,"I recently started a new job and quickly found out it's not the best place to work. Nearly every corner of the office and the garage area where the majority of the work is done has cat piss or shit. I got talking with one of the guys there and asked if it had always been this way. He told me this is how it all went down hill:


Pregnant cat shows up around a year ago, they take it in. Now up to 8 cats with the kittens. Nothing is done about the animals and two of the kittens get pregnant. Both have kittens and it's up to 20+ at this point. Most of them leave, but continue to come back regularly because the boss feeds them. 


So now we have a few bigger issues that have cropped up. Issue number one is one set of kittens disappeared and the dude I was talking to and I are being accused of doing it. They claimed they had cameras and threatened our jobs for a week. Dude went over and found out that the cameras only go for 24 hours so they were just pressuring us to try and get a confession for shit we didn't do. They agreed to drop it after I told them it was workplace harrassment and threatened to go to HR. 


Issue two: The cats have been using the files as their personal litter box and a bigger boss found out today. I'm worried I'll lose my job anyway or be forced to clean up cat shit to save the boss' ass.",10Oct2018,1
7,"Hi! I’m working in a forever 21 and every clothe belong to a section, there are many sections (let’s say 10) and each section contains a lot of clothes. When people try the clothes and decide they won’t take them, we need to place them back. Problem is, there is so many different clothes and all employees are kinda new.

Every clothe has a barcode. I thought about writing sections on every tag, but it’d take too long imo, or create a file with all barcode numbers and sections, but since there is a lot of new clothes frequently I wouldn’t know what is new and what is gone.

I cant describe it, I just feel like I belonged there.

10,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

this is going to be strange question but it's haunting me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting married in a month and my future father in law is a character. At another family wedding he went on a rambling 15 minute speech that was embarrassing to the bride and groom and not an appropriate story to tell at a wedding. He of course has been asked to speak at our wedding because it means a lot to my fiancé.

&amp;#x200B;

I am however worried what he's going to say. The other wedding was a lot of people from a small town and so everyone knew each other. This is not the case at my wedding, for the most past we have only met each others extended families on one or two occasions due to distance. I'm so worried that my father in law to be is going to get up and tell a rude or embarrassing story about my fiancé (or me or us or whatever) in front of a bunch of people who don't know him/me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what I'm asking here is this. A good friend is the MC for the night and he's a great guy. He's funny and chatty and very charismatic. I'm looking for a way that he might politely intervene if the speech gets awkward/ goes on forever. He can't exactly play him out with music but is there a way he can gracefully ask my father in law to sit down and stop talking? Preferably something that diffuses the situation and is funny? I don't want to cause a scene or embarrass my father in law (and not having him speak is not an option). Thank you guys!",10Oct2018,1

-her kitchen was decorated in ducks when I was a child, which is just something that sticks out to me.

14,"So I literally just joined reddit to ask this and hope to get some thoughts and opinions on the situation. 

  So where I work I'm semi newish. I've been trying to learn as much about my job as possible despite possibly not having one in a few months. My co-worker and I don't really interact much. She just trained me on how to do a certain task. Shes generally nice and I don't have any problems with her. However because we don't really interact much, usually when we do it's because she noticed something was wrong with something I did. 

With that said, this leads me to what happened. Been kind of a rough week for me. Stress has just been hell with a whole bunch of personal stuff and my brain to mouth filter wasn't fully working. So she asks to swing by desk and I agreed. When she got there I simply just said ""so what's wrong?"". She paused then got visibly angry and said that what I just did was wildly inappropriate. I have no clue what I did. I don't know if my tone came off wrong or if it came off as douchey or how she took it. I apologized but it was just basically was the cherry on top of the stress this week for me. 

I told my boss what happened and explained that she didnt do anything I said something that upset her like it did and that I apologized in person. With all the stress I asked to go home for the rest of the day and he agreed. I wound up having a mental breakdown. 

For the past few weeks I just felt alone. Like I can't talk to anyone without someone being mad at me. I dread and hate going to work every day. Especially since I tried 2 times to get into where I currently work. I have nothing in common with anyone there. I try my best and I'm by no means perfect but I just don't know anymore. I feel like I'm just an absolute shit human being. What I hate even more is that me asking what's wrong wasnt even hesitant. It just instantly came out. 

Was I inappropriate? I have no clue anymore. This is the third break down I've had from this place. I just dont know or feel like myself anymore. I just feel like no matter what I do I'll just make people hate me. I sometimes lie in bed at night even think I dont deserve my girlfriend. I have no idea what yo think anymore. ",10Oct2018,1

29,"  

For years now, I have struggled with depression, anxiety, and stress. The depression tends to go in and out, anxiety is usually a constant. For weeks now, I’ve been in this funk. As one who has it knows, I just don’t have the motivation to do anything. It’s hard to think or feel about doing anything. The worst part is that I’m in school. While my instructors have been very gracious about giving me leeway, I’m very behind on my schoolwork. It’s very piling to try to catch up.

I’ve never liked to work. School is work. And the work I’m doing now SHOULD interest me, but it’s like I’ve lost interest in what I’m doing. If I do it, it stresses me. If I don’t do it, it also does, because it means I’m avoiding necessary work. And my general response to stress is to avoid the stressor, not face it head-on. All the stress I’m experiencing has made me cry at times. In addition, there’s some amount of shame/guilt I experience from not doing what is expected.

He’s an arrogant ass and now he’s telling people that I’m just a crazy bitch who lied about stuff. He really hurt my feelings and treated me like garbage, all because of this other girl who is a toxic waste of space. He equated me and her when in all actuality we aren’t alike at all besides in some mental health related ways. Maybe I did some things wrong. Maybe I was too emotional. All besides the point.

I need help to move on. We had been sleeping with each other since June, and had been friends for a little bit over a year.

He’s acting like he “knows me” and that I’m a bad person. This all happened in the span of like three weeks, and I’ve never done anything to warrant this type of treatment. 

How do I disregard this drama? Like, how do I not let this all affect me? I really suck at letting people go, especially when there’s no sense of closure, so I’m pretty defeated. I’m extremely anxious at the thought of seeing him or her because it’d just take a lot out of me.

47,"Okay so I’m 21 and in college. I had a rough week last week. I had four midterms, several projects due, had to work 18 hours, all while nursing a twisted ankle and minor bike injuries. I only got 18 hours of sleep in four days so I was fatigued. School has never been easy for me due to my dyslexia. 

Anyway last Friday, which was her birthday, I slept for the entire day just to catch up on sleep. That’s how tired I was. I slept nearly 16 hours straight. I forgot about it earlier in the week due to all that stress. 

After class one of my girlfriends best friends confronted me and told me that last Friday was her birthday and that my girlfriend cried the whole night. I was shocked Normally I don’t  forget stuff like this. But last week was so stressful that I forgot about it earlier in the week. The next day, I went to her chapter house  and talked to her about it. She was upset with me to say the least. She was mad that she reminded me several times this past month yet I could remember to go to a female friends 21st birthday party which was two weeks before hers. She was even more upset about the fact that I slept all day on her big day while she was celebrating with her family and friends. I feel guilty already. 

Anyway, does anyone have any advice on how to make it up to her?! I feel so guilty already.",10Oct2018,1

49,"I joined a discord server about a year ago for art-related stuff. Things were fine and we got along well, but things started going south once I got to college.

I'm not in a good situation, so my depression has gotten worse. I started venting to them, and to my dismay, I was told by someone to ""Stop clogging the main chat"" and ""Nobody cares about your problems."" I took offense, but went to a different channel. Not a big deal.

When I went to the appropriate channel, I still got told off by the same person (and a little bit of others) that I'm ""complaining too much"" or ""I deal with this too, get over it."" I've been venting there for months now and I've genuinely tried to take people's advice (i.e going to therapy), but it seems to be the same person that continuously berates me even when I make small comments.

The backlash gets bad to the point where I start feeling suicidal and hopeless. I was considering buying razors until I spoke to the crisis hotline today. I'm too afraid to go back in because I know it'll be the same people who I feel like are giving me the ""evil eye""

I genuinely want to be in the server because I have people there that I care about, but I just feel like I'm unwanted because of my actions and because of the constant shoving I get. I know I'm not in the right, but I just don't know if I should leave or if I'll ever find friends like that.

53,"I have been married 12 years. I was 20 and my husband 23 at the time we got married. My parents got divorced about 2 months after our wedding day. My parents have both lived far away from me my whole marriage. I see them both maybe once every year or every two years.
When my husband and I first got married, we lived in a different city than his parents, and the first year his mom would call almost daily and tell my husband dinner was ready and to come eat. Sometimes I’d go with him when she would call and sometimes he’d go without me. I thought it was odd but didn’t want to be controlling, so I didn’t say much back then. 
After the first year, a rental home they own, in the city they live, became vacant and they told us we could live there. 
It became easier for my husband to visit them even more. He also works with his dad after his normal job he does every day.
After 3 years of marriage, we had a baby and the rental house was becoming too small and it also had a rodent issue, so I wanted to move.  A house on practically the same street as his parents came up for sale and he immediately wanted it. Since I was staying at home with my baby and another on the way, I wanted him to be happy, so i agreed. 
After 8 years of living in this house, it has become too much for me.  We are surrounded by his entire family. His sister, cousins, parents, aunts and uncles. They all live on the same block as us. I can’t walk outside without seeing one of his relatives. 
He is at his parents house daily and since I have no family really close by, we have to go to their house for every holiday. We once went to a Father’s Day party for my grandpa who lives an hour away and his mom had a fit and said we shouldn’t have gone there because he isn’t even my father.
My husband lets them make decisions for us I feel like. My husband works long hours for his father. Like this whole summer (and every summer since we got married)I wouldn’t see him till 9 at night and I just found out from my husband that he doesn’t even pay him for a lot of his time.
We have 3 kids now and my husband can’t do things with our family at all from Spring till fall because he is so busy helping his father and not even getting paid much. I told him he is hurting our family by not giving us his time and isn’t even getting paid fairly and i know he won’t say anything to his parents. I know he won’t change. It’s like he is a little boy who wants to please his parents still. I just don’t know if I want to live the rest of my life this way but I know I probably don’t have a normal relationship with my parents either because we are pretty distant. I just feel resentful and I am tired of feeling this way.

So, recently my ex-boyfriend dumped his latest girlfriend (I was the girlfriend before her) and she didn’t seem to take it well. About a month ago she contacted me asking if we could meet up and I didn’t know what to make of it; I’ve never met this girl in my life. I thought about it and realized that she’s probably harmless so I met her the next day. She started telling me awful things about him and how we should tell the police that he raped me so he could finally get what he deserved.. I told her no, that that would be wrong, but she didn’t like that answer. She started getting hostile toward me so I decided to go home and cut off all communication with her. 

I went home and right as I shut the door I texted my ex’s friend since he had known this girl for a while. I asked him what I should do and he told me not to trust her. Minutes after this I get a call from an unknown number. I picked up and it was the new ex girlfriend, telling me she’s outside my house and that she needs to talk to me right now. I started to get anxious so I told her no repeatedly until she finally drove away. 

It’s been about a month and now I’m starting to hear from her again, but now this time with a different story. She’s telling me about how she was raped and how she has no one else to go to now that she’s not with our ex boyfriend.

Part of me knows that maybe eventually I’ll find someone, but I have certain relationship standards that make me feel like I’m running out of time. I always wanted to marry in my mid to late 20s, but only after having known the person for at least a year or two, and have lived with them for additional year so i can feel comfortable that I really know who they truly are. I’ve always wanted to have that part of my life with a serious relationship where it’s just us. No kids to worry about, just me and them for a few years. I feel like if it doesn’t happen by my early 30s it’ll be too late to have that and enjoy that time before I have to try for kids because by mid 30s early 40s it’s hard to have kids, and I want to still be young enough to be able to deal with my kids when they’re small.

I live with my mother currently and my father is working in a different state. I've been lying to my parents that I am doing fine in my university courses and been feeding them false results. In reality I've just been wasting my time achieving nothing and doing nothing with my life. On top of that the money I've received from the government during the time I was enrolled in a course for the purpose of supporting my education...I've spent all on the gacha via mobile games.   


Now the government wants me to pay back the money due to it being an overpayment because the amount of units I took at the time didn't meet their requirements. I have nothing to pay them back with.   


I made the same mistake of lying to my parents and faking my results before and I was caught. I've repeated the same mistake again and this time I've dug my grave even deeper and have not learnt from my past mistake what so ever.   


I've know that what I was doing and what I've done makes me a horrible person...scum of the earth even. deceiving my parents who work day in and day out for the sake of my future, gambling away money irresponsibly...  


But I can't work up the courage to tell my parents everything. I've broken their trust in the past and I've done it again. My mother would spiral into despair...very often she'd keep reminding me that education is important and that if I had any problems at all I should openly tell her...I never listened. My father...he isn't in the best of health, I was a late child so he is up there in terms of age and he's living alone...if I were to tell him everything I don't what would happen to him..

70,"So my family owns the business. I'm a thirty year old guy but I often get mistaken for someone in their early twenties. I've been told I have a baby face and I'm a shorter guy. I'm shy and quiet too. I'd imagine people size me up as weak, scared, timid, and easy to be an asshole to because I guess I looked like I'd take it.

So basically I had four repeat customers who did nearly the same thing over the span of two years. They were all males forty or over. They always came into my business with friends, family etc. They seemed like the type of guys who needed to be the loudest man in the room or the center of attention. They seemed to think they were above everyone else. There was always this tone of superiority whenever they spoke or acted. They almost always tried to push boundaries and had this huge entitlement complex. They never had a sincere exchange with us, it was always sarcasm, condescension, etc. They never came in order and paid like 99 percent of my other customers. There was always some stupid bullshit involved with their ""visits."" They'd complain excessively or try and get free stuff or try to be the class clown or be obnoxious or be a huge pain in the ass. It was always just really bad annoying behavior. They always seemed to be doing it for their own personal amusement or showing off or showboating to the people they were with. Most of these guys you could see them enjoying it. Like the school class clown or bully that is pushing your buttons and enjoying watching your discomfort. 

With all these guys after a few visits I stood up to them. I'd either tell them no or stop or something. It was never about them being a jackass but instead shooting down their complaints, demands, comments, or requests.  During subsequent visits nearly all their shit behavior was directed at me and no longer evenly spread among all employees. They'd either say obnoxious shit to me, or be a huge pain in the ass to me, or insult me. They'd almost always refer back to the time I told them ""no"" or stood up to them like it was worst day of their life and they'd never forget it. It was like I wasn't supposed to confront them or tell them no. It was like they were entitled to be jerks and the unspoken rule was we had to take it.

With every single one of them I reached my breaking point after a few ""visits"" where they directed all their shittyness at me and confronted them point blank face to face. I would literally say to them ""what is your issue with me?"" or ""why can't you come into my business and act like a normal customer?"" They never really fought back. I heard ""hey man I was just fucking around"" ""I'm just joking around"" ""I should be allowed to do what I want cause I spend money here"" or ""you can't take a joke"" etc. I never yelled or screamed but I was definitely very assertive and stood my ground. I made a point to look at them dead in the eyes and speak clearly and calmly when I confronted them. 

I didn't tell any of them they were banned from the property. They never came back. What's odd is I had family members who were with them come back into my business and I even had a few family member's apologize for the dudes behavior. ",10Oct2018,1

72,"My brother and his girlfriend have been together for three years and I’ve met her several times. Each time we’ve had great conversation and an instant connection. She’s younger than him and me (we’re both in our forties, him early me late, she’s in her late twenties). This trip (I visited him out of state) things started out normal, nothing out of the ordinary. She was going for a walk on the second night I was there. She asked my brother if he’d like to come, he said no. His mom who was also visiting (he’s my half brother) suggested I go. I said sure why not. We’ve not really spent that kind of time of time together (one-on-one for more than 20 mins at a time) previously. We got on the topic of my daughter and some drama going on with her while we walked. After I discussed my problems I asked her about hers and asked her why she and my brother were in couples counseling. She danced around the answer for a bit and named some small things that were awry, but eventually admitted he had cheated on her with his ex for three months and she caught him texting two other girls in a flirty manner. All this happened over the course of their relationship apparently. I was pretty shocked, my brother always comes off as a good guy. My ex wife cheated on me so I could relate to how she felt. Nothing inappropriate happened on the walk but I felt much closer to her. I didn’t say anything to him under her request of course, also it was none of my business really it was their relationship. I just wished them the best and to resolve their issue

His mom and him go out to Costco the next day and I choose to stay back. His girlfriend got home an hour after that left and we had a small chit chat before she went upstairs to their room. The vibe was a little awkward due to our conversation last night. An hour or so later I went out on the deck in the backyard to drink a beer and spotted her in the window. Their room on the top floor overlooks the deck and there’s no shades/shutters because my brother just bought the house. Plus the sun was going down so I could see well into her room. Well she was in just her bra and underwear. I was mortified. Because not only did I witness her like that but she looked amazing. I won’t lie, I find her attractive, she’s an attractive woman, and seeing her half nude was exciting but also made me feel guilty as fuck. When my brother and my step mom got back from Costco she finally came down stairs and we had dinner. The whole time I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I felt so guilty. We didn’t talk much that night or the day after because she was working. Following that day was a Saturday, her and my brother had off and we all went to lunch, came home, and had a couple drinks and played some board games. Things were back to “normal” between us, just very polite and how you would treat your boyfriend brother/brothers girlfriend. After games I asked her if she wanted to go on another evening walk. She said yeah, then asked my brother to come too, which he said no. We didn’t talk much at first, just small talk but eventually got into deeper conversation like before.  We did not discuss the cheating but I talked more about the situation with my daughter and she seemed to care. My brothers new house is in the mountains so we stopped to take in the view below on the way back up the the house. This is where things went wrong. I kissed her. I know it’s fucked up, but it was impulsive decision. She kissed me back after a few seconds and it got heavy, I was touching her body and told her I wanted her she was receptive. Better sense took over and we stopped and we just laughed all the way up to the house. 

It’s been two days since then and we’ve hardly spoken It’s very awkward, we barely even make eye contact. When I’m in the same room with her she just leaves. Part of me wants to apologize, part of me wants to do what I did before. It’s messed up, I’m having a hard time battle these thoughts and what happened between us. This is my brothers girlfriend and I’m playing with Fire. But knowing he cheated on her just pisses me off. She’s a great girl. This entire situation is a mess and I’m not sure how to proceed.

Without naming anything in specifics to protect my and other identities. I was helping a relative with something but they told me to go to a hardware store to get something.

Now im fairly skeptical about acupunture because its alternative medicine so I express my concerns. So she says to a chiropractitioner. I've also heard thats a form of alternative medicine, so once again im skeptical and tell her that i want to go to an ""actual"" doctor.

Fortunately, he doesnt go through with it, since he said it would hurt a lot and my injury seemed minor. Well after the session was finished, I didnt feel any different, my foot still hurt, and now im concerned. Obviouslt now im convinced that accupuncture doesnt fo anything, so. Where do I go to get my foot checked out? How much will it cost? I live in the US and Ive American health care is expensive, but i have no idea about how much it is. If I dont go to a doctor will it heal on its own?  Hopefully i wake up tomorrow and its healed,  but i doubt it and im concerned, since ill be having to run a few miles soon and my teacher will be pissed if i cant.",10Oct2018,1
77,"Me and my friends are going out and getting a hotel in the coming weeks, and we have a friend who we’ve invited but is now being completely irritating, causing us to be at our wits end with them, and we’re regretting inviting them. We would like to stay friends with this person because they are a decent human, just very high maintenance, and we would rather they didn’t come to the outing since we know they’d make it full of unnecessary drama and try and control the whole thing, when we just want a nice, chill night out. 

So what’s the politest way of telling a friend they’re uninvited? We don’t want to hurt their feelings or make them feel excluded, but we all know we’d have a much better time without there.

79,"Hi, advisors -  


Just yesterday, I was dismissed for my job. It was not for cause, as far as I've been told. They gave me severance and are willing to give me good recommendations. I worked in a very specific field (live event ticketing) and am unsure about how to pick apart the experience I've gained and stretch it to fit a more broadly applicable way to market myself to prospective employers. I could really use some pointers about the following:

* Staying positive. A huge and asymmetric clump of stress accompanied this job, and I'm honestly relieved to be free of it, though I'd never have quit. Obviously, proximity to stability trumps absence thereof. I'll be freaking out before too long.
* Resume building. I've had lots of jobs over the last 20 years (I'm 33), and I realize that the stuff I was doing when I was 14 doesn't translate to what I might be doing in 2019 (I sincerely hope).
* Money. I've been given a reasonable severance, but my cost of living is fairly high (for my city), my insurance runs out at the end of October and I figure that I've got about three months' worth of money at my immediate disposal. I've got $14,000 in my 401k that I really don't want to touch until I know whether I'll be able to roll it over at my next job, but it's there in case I need to.
* Miscellaneous. How do you date while unemployed? I'm single, and while I believe I've got a pretty good explanation for my current situation, I'm worried that my already overactive reticence will kick into an even higher gear and concomitantly erode my general confidence. How do I adapt my grocery shopping? How do I feed my functional alcoholism (I'm a Wisconsinite)?

Since then, we have both become single and have been for some time. He is moving a few states away in a little over two weeks, and I’ve known this since we started hanging out. 
Now, we’ve been hanging out/going on dates for a little over a month now. For the first two weeks, we were basically spending time everyday with each other. He invited me to a family wedding, which I attended and had a great time with him and his family. I’ve slept over at his place multiple times after drinking a little too much, and he’s never tried taking advantage of me. We’ve both expressed to each other that we really like the other person, and there are obviously feelings there. 
Now I’ve semi had a talk with him, while we were both drunk, about what this is. He expressed that he didn’t want to make empty promises to me because of the move and that it sucks that he does have to leave. He said he wants me to come visit him after he moves.

90,"This is gonna get kind of long, man. So, I met my now girlfriend about three years ago. She lives in Utah, and I in Texas, and fast forward to August, she flies down too officially meet me and we end up dating. Problem is, according to my girlfriend, she's in a toxic home, and nothing is ever okay for her. She has new issues every day about how bad things are, and I finally told her, ""Look, I can't handle this, it's not healthy for either of us. You need to find a healthier way of venting your problems to someone that can actually help you."" and since then it's been a lot better! She's always vented to me, but after three years, it was too much. She constantly tells me how no one in her family loves her, etc, and I've actually heard her brother yell at her, tell her no one loves her, get physical with her, etc while we were on Discord. I fully believe that he truly is an asshole of the highest order, and I actually genuinely despise him for the things I've heard him say to her.

Problem is, I don't think her problems are ""as bad"" as she says. For the last week and a half she's been claiming that she's bedridden and has trouble moving and sitting up, but she (once again) can't do anything and no one will help her. They're constant, and extreme, and she says no one will help, at all, ever. I think that they hold some truth, definitely, but maybe not the full truth. I think she may be a teenage girl with crippling anxiety, self esteem issues, and unresolved trauma, who thinks that the world is dark and bitter and everyone must be like that, so there's no reason to try and fix it. I want to believe her and the things she says, but her mother often says that they're not that bad/etc, and is rather convincing of it. Who am I supposed to believe? My best friend of three years, or the woman who's being accused of neglect and abuse? My girlfriend has gone through a lot of problems in the past, a lot of which we share (abuse, for example), and I absolutely believe those because there's ""proof"" for lack of a better word.

I'm not trying to say that you have to have proof for what you say to be true, but rather it doesn't hurt to have something that says ""oh, this happened"" when you're basing your entire identity around something, ya know? I really do want to believe her in the things she says, and I want to believe her when she says that her life truly is awful, and terrible, and just plain bad, but how on Earth am I supposed to when there's a full grown adult right behind her that gives me realistic, convincing quotes, proof, and/or different accounts on how, yes, that was technically said, but not quite...

An good example is, my girlfriend is absolutely firm on the fact that she definitely does have Celiac Disease. She swears up and down, and when she visited we made all sorts of adjustments for it, but according to my mother and aunt (who also has Celiacs), she couldn't answer a lot of basic questions for it (I didn't hear or see this, so I'm taking it with a grain of salt), and then when they asked her mother, her mother said that she was diagnosed with a gluten allergy, and told that if her diet wasn't maintained, it would develop into Celiacs. Her mother claims that when she was told this, my girlfriend suddenly started claiming that she has Celiacs.

The issue is that this is also refuted by my girlfriend. According to her her, her diet never was maintained, and now she has Celiacs. That's always the issue. Anything her mother says, my girlfriend has already made a rebuttal for weeks, if not months in advance.

I have no idea who to believe at this point, and it's scary. I'm sorry this turned into a long-winded rant.",10Oct2018,1
91,"Throwaway here

I've always lurked here, never thought I would be the one making a post but here I am, I'm asking you guys for whatever advice/guidance/common sense you have for me.

This is a long post (and I'm sorry for that) but I really want to thank you if you read through the entire thing, that honestly means so much to me.

So the trouble all started when I was 15, two years ago. I moved to a new high school, and I had trouble making friends. For the first time in myself, I found myself extremely lost and depressed, extremely unsure about what to do. My parents are a bit close-minded/narcissistic, and blamed me for my drastic drop in grades.

I honestly didn't know what was happening. I became obsessive over little things, annoyed people, became extremely depressed/suicidal, and did not understand the least bit why. Academics were always very easy for me but for the first time ever, I neglected them and cared very little.

Fast forward one year, things leveled off, and it was my senior year of high school. I honestly just wanted to leave the place. I wanted to spend my last year quietly and just go off somewhere far away for college, far away from my family and just start over. I still did not know what was going on/what was wrong with me.

Little did I know how wrong I was to be during that last year of HS. I began having these energetic episodes where I would do the weirdest/most ridiculous things, confessed my deepest feelings to people that were frankly strangers, and just did things I thought I would never do. I felt like I was suppressing all of this energy for a while, and now I just let it run loose.

Needless to say, that year was the most painful year I have honestly ever endured. And I still wasn't sure what was going on. When it came time to apply to colleges, this weird new energetic me became insanely arrogant, and I applied to schools that I realistically had little chance of being accepted, given how much I neglected academics the past year.

My last semester was hell. So much weird unnecessary drama, so much pain, and so so many rejections (from both people and colleges). I felt hurt. And yet I still did not understand what was going on.

I did get into some schools but I was too arrogant to go. I was angry at the world because I knew I could do better, but I felt some weird force was taking control, as if I was a spectator to my own life.

Later that summer I was diagnosed with both bipolar disorder II and borderline personality disorder. It made a lot of sense and I spent countless hours just thinking about the past, from that depressive episode when I was 15 till now. My parents were, as usual, not helpful, not really believing in mental illness (as much as denying they had it—both of my disorders have a strong genetic component). I felt angry, hurt, lost, and extremely bitter.

Before senior year ended, during one of my energetic periods (in bipolar terms, called a hypomanic episode), I devised a ridiculous scheme to take as many college classes as possible and transfer to one of the colleges that denied me by the spring of 2019. I knew academics came very easy to me, the challenge was getting myself to concentrate, and I figured that if I diverted the ridiculous energy I had to my academics, I would succeed. 

It worked. Taking 16 credits in a summer semester, I got straight A's. This gave me so much confidence and helped me realize that perhaps I can still control my life. But it wasn't enough.

One of the things that I kept repeating to myself as my senior year ended was that I needed to get away from everyone. I needed to disappear for a while, and that's exactly what I did. But now it has beginning to take it's toll. All of my friends/people from HS have already left for their universities, while I stayed, finishing out my ""taking as many college courses"" scheme. I'm very sure it'll work and I'll be at my university in the spring, and I'll leave my family life here and relocate there, but the sheer toll it has taken...

I don't think I've changed as much as I have in the last 4 months. I feel incredibly alone and I just don't know what to do. I didn't ask to have bipolar, borderline, or to have a toxic family life. The alleged ""medication"" for my bipolar often makes things worse, and I've resorted to creating spreadsheets of my mood swings, trying to find some pattern to the triggers so I can control myself better. Same with my borderline.

I miss being around people, around friends. During my last year of HS, there was a girl I was obsessed with. I didn't know what I liked about her, and I did some embarrassing things confessing how I felt to her. Our entire relationship was extremely toxic, and it involved her getting a boyfriend halfway through the year, while simultaneously feeling bad about how I felt and somehow ""trying to make it up for me."" Needless to say, the entire experience was torture.

I realized much later why I liked her. It was because I thought she had what I had, which was my borderline personality disorder, even though I didn't know I have it. I would always describe as that ""thing"" and she was the only person who acted like that. Often times, my horrible borderline brain would continue to obsess over stuff that happened long ago, as if trying to intentionally trying to torture myself.

And here's the part I'm asking advice on. The thing is, I love academics. I love learning stuff, reading, and math, especially math. I find it very pleasant and enjoyable, and a nice way to keep me busy. My dream has always been to become a mathematician. 

One way to escape all of this pain is to simply focus 100% on academics and go full in to my dream of becoming a mathematician. The only problem is, I feel like I'm letting my disorders win. I know I have toxic relationships/emotional states, and by isolating myself/encolsing myself with just more and more academics, I feel like I'm giving up.

This is my last two months before I head off to my university in the spring and start over. As the end of the year nears, I just feel so empty and broken and bitter.

Any advice on what to do? I really would appreciate any input at all

Thank you so so much for reading if you've made it this far.",10Oct2018,1

97,"Hi all, I am in desperate need of advice.

So 2 summers ago (Australia) I worked at a warehouse with my sister and brother in law over the summer and absolutely loved it. It was great pay for hard but also easy work.

I currently have a job in retail which I love hate. It’s so frustrating and I’m not even sure if I like it, but I guess out of all the retail jobs I’ve had, it’s one of my favourite. But I get yelled at all the time by customers since I’m a supervisor so I’m quite often in charge and my boss can be a total pain in the ass.

I’ve just been offered a job at the warehouse again but it’s only for 2 booths (that’s full time hours on casual rate. No hours confirmed but I’ve been told they will try to keep me on every week day). My job now is part time and permanent.

I really want to accept the job which is in a new location so my partner and I can start a new life there, where I grew up, but if I quit my job now, right before Christmas, I’d be screwing them over and probably never be able to come back.

My old boss said I can come back to that store but I’m not sure if that would be casual or part time.

I really hate where I live now. I’m with my parents and I literally have no friends other than my partner, they’ve all moved to the city (where my new job would be). I just really don’t know what to do.

Tldr; not sure if I should stay at my current permanent job or accept a new temporary one (which is offering more money)",10Oct2018,1

With me graduating a semester early, there won’t exactly be teaching job offers for me to take immediately after graduating. With that being said, I only have 2 options. I can either go straight into graduate school, or I can go home and live there until I get a stable job. The issue with both of these is that if I go to grad school, I’m going to be likely be completely and totally alone. With me having anxiety, the idea of making such a big move like that and having virtually no one around me is absolutely terrifying. On the other hand, though, being at home is also bad for my mental health.

108,"This is going to be a little nuts. So bare with me. I have 3 step sisters, the eldest has had it rough, but has also made some bad life choices. Long story short my husband and I took in my now 15 year old niece because she was missing a lot of school and acting out. (Partying at 15, missed 50 days of school in one year) We had an extra room, there was a good school by our place and thought we could offer some time and guidance until my sister could get her life sorted.

Fast forward a year and a half into our life with my niece, and she’s doing much better, but it’s been at a major cost. She’s needed intensive academic intervention. (3-5 hours of weekly tutoring) to help catch her up as we discovered she’s basically 3-4 grade levels behind in her understanding of Math, English, Science...etc.... huge ongoing expense. But it’s either we do this, or she has zero hope of graduating or even being a functioning adult. (Family is no help, they gave me $200 the first month and then disappeared) 

We also at the time had an extra room for her because we lived in the basement suite at my inlaws with a controlled rent situation. But they have since sold the house and we needed to find a place to accommodate us, her and our son. Which basically doubled our rent.  This situation was also supposed to be temporary but it seems after almost 2 years, we will have her until she’s an adult. And probably even longer cause we live in an area where the cost of living is insane. 

So we should move to somewhere it isnt crazy right? Would love to! But, my husband’s business has 30 year old roots in this city (his dad started it) We need the dense population to do what we do essentially, and my sister would never let me leave with her daughter. 

We are becoming slowly more behind in bills, and I’ve had to put my foot down and make major cut backs in our lifestyle before we drown ourselves. My husband works and does nothing for himself because we can’t afford it. I’m having to quit my recreational “self care” activities that give me joy. 

And I’m becoming an walking anxiety zombie with almost no patience and no joy. My husband is def depressed. 

We have this credit card that saves money for vacations, but at this point I can’t take my son away somewhere without taking my niece as well. And the worst part is she has a younger brother who doesn’t live with us, we couldn’t afford to take him either..... so he would be left out. 

Do I just ride out the next few years to get this kid graduated and on her feet, so we can resume our life?

120,"A month and a half ago, I broke up with a long term boyfriend of a year and a half. He was more so a rebound from a prior relationship. I knew he wasn’t what I wanted and I felt super drained by the relationship and like he was dead weight. He wasn’t going anywhere in his life. I felt so embarrassed by the fact I was dating him and never brought him around. I finally came to terms that this would never work out about six months prior to actually breaking up with him, because friends convinced me to try to get it to work out. 

After breaking up with him, I became very close friends to our mutual friends. We had been friends prior but never so close. He consoled the both of us separately through the breakup, although, I was completely over it by the day after I broke up with him simply because I had been ready to do it for months now. But naturally things started to progress between the two of us since we got so close and we began to date. 

We haven’t made any information about our relationship public besides to people very close to us. But we don’t know how to ACTUALLY make things public without causing an entire uproar since all three of us work together and are in the same friend group. We were all super close friends and that makes things difficult.

I know people get busy and have other things going on as well. I don't expect a response right away, but I feel like since we always have our cell phones on us, they're eventually going to see the text. This particular friend, in the past, used to respond to most of my texts, but now it seems that something has changed. This has happened more than once. 

Every time when someone ignores my texts I feel like they're is something wrong with me, even though it could not be the case or it could. It makes me feel like I did something wrong, maybe I did or said something that I didn't realize I did. It harms my self-esteem.

I've been contemplating on whether or not I should confront them or not or just start to ignore them, but I feel that if I weren't to confront them about it then it just shows that I don't really value how I feel, basically having little self-respect for myself.

128,"To start, I'm usually a pretty monogamous guy, so when the girl I've been seeing for the past... fourish months and I started being intimate with another. 

When we started 'seeing' each other she mentioned she has a rule that if either of us caught feelings, we'd have to end it, to which I agreed. Jump-cut three months later, it's very much feels like a budding relationship to me; hanging out, going out and doing things together, holding each other in public, cuddling during movies/shows and snuggling together before and after sex. Talking virtually everyday. 

So, a couple weeks back; after an evening date, we're back at my place, and we finished a wicked night together and we're snuggled up. I dropped the bomb, ""I think I'm falling for you."" And she agreed, and had been feeling it for sometime. 

JUMP TO NOW, the last time we were intimate together, I nearly slipped the L word, and I've been thinking about it a lot lately, pretty much every time I see her. 

Her relationship with her boyfriend; dude is an obnoxious jerk. She's told me all the things he does that annoys her, he's a terrible lover, and when they took a trip, he told her she needs to smile more around his family and work friends, sending her into a feminist/human fuelled rage. They live together, and he knows of me; but not the extent of our... correspondence, or how deep we are. 

She's resolved to leave him, planning to move out near the end of December. 

So, the ask; 
Should I wait to drop the L word, until she is out of this dysfunctional relationship, or let her figure her shit out first, and see where I fit in?

And what should I do in the event that it accidentally slips out?

I've prepared myself for the worst case scenario, where she decides I'm not in the picture. But she often tells me I'm not like anyone she's ever been with. Thanks!

129,"I’m sorry this is long. So of course this makes me sound lame and desperate but I really only have 1 friend who lives in the town where I go to college. I have friends but none that I hang out with outside of class or work. So it’s just her and I.

Backstory: we’ve been friends for about 8-9 years (since JR high) and we have some other really close friends who went to other universities. When we’re all together, it’s great and we are the perfect balance. For a while, when it was just her and I, we really got along well. We have a lot of similar interests and values and desired similar lives when we got to school. So we did basically everything together outside of class.

I am an introvert and I struggle with some social anxiety that makes it really hard for me to initiate conversations and/or be the one to suggest or pursue activities. So I followed her. She would get me into activities or things and I would then be all in with her. However, I slowly realized nothing was my own and I’ve been trying to branch out. I still haven’t found any friend groups though.

My friend has clinical depression. This has affected our relationship as I often find ways to care for her and help her when she is down. This has become our only way to communicate. As I have thought about it more, everyone else in her life has always come before me in everything, but when she is bored and needs someone to hang out with or when she is in need of a ride somewhere, she calls me. I mean even today, she texted me and said, “Hey do you want to hang out this Friday? My apartment is lonely.” I wish I could think she genuinely wants to be around me but instead I think her boyfriend is working and she doesn’t want to be alone. Every conversation is about her. When I share anything, she sits on her phone texting. Ugh the texting. Her and her boyfriend text CONSTANTLY which normally I wouldn’t care about except she completely checks out of the situation when she texts him and misses everything I say. I just am so tired.

Wow this is a lot and I’ve barely scratched the surface. But I don’t know what to do from here. It’s my last semester on campus before moving away for a semester abroad and then graduation. I don’t know how to make friends and I really care for her. I just don’t know what to do and if this is actually toxic.

TLDR: I only have one friend but she takes all of my energy and emotional support and I believe the friendship is toxic. What do I do?",10Oct2018,1

142,"I've moved to a big city to study and I've been living in a relatively old building over the past 2 months or so. The building's really old, it's my first time living in something as such. It's close to my university so I figured it would be worth it even if it meant sacrificing some comfort.

About a couple weeks ago, our neighbours downstairs advised us of a water leakage, probably coming from our end. We got in contact with the building owner and managed to get a plumber to come and fix it.

The access to the shower pipes is some sort of hatch/door in the wall in my room.

Days go by and the plumber finally comes to fix it. I was there when he came, and I helped him out with the testing after every try he gave to patching the leak with his welding torch. After about an hour of tries and tries, he couldn’t fix it. He said he didn’t have the right tool, and he’d come back eventually to fix it with it.

He eventually came back, and he fixed it. Afterwards, I had my window wide opened because the last time he came, it smelled really bad because of all the welding he’d done.

This is when I started the notice a smell coming from the wall with the hatch. This awful burn type of smell, nothing like I’ve ever smelled before. It’s not disgust that comes to mind when I smell it, it’s just an incredible discomfort and almost feels like it irritates my trachea and lungs.

Day go by and I keep telling myself that by airing it out, it’ll go away. “Just air it out all day long and sleep without the smell at night”.

I just realized tonight how scary it actually is. I’m sleeping on the couch tonight. I’m not sure if I’m paranoid, but I don’t want to mess with this.

This is the scary part: I’ve been avoiding my room a lot and a lot, not even spending a minute there unless it’s to sleep or change clothes. The smell had driven me out, I’ll study elsewhere all day long and only come to the apartment to make food, wash the dishes, do laundry and sleep. I crave the outside air, I literally crave going outside every morning.

What really struck me is that for the past weeks, I’ve been having trouble sleeping, many cases of nausea that I could never understand (I just blamed it on myself eating something bad), headaches and constant breathing problems (that I attributed to bad airflow in the room, allergies and myself being sensitive to dust). I've been using sinus rinse every night before sleep, thinking I'm breathing bad because there's dust in my airways. Over the past weeks, I’ve been having a variety of cold-liked sicknesses that I just attributed to bad luck and autumn coming along (I live in a northern country).

Last night I had terrible sleep and I think I might have had some sort of paranoia, delirium and hallucination episode. Honestly scared the hell out of me, and I don’t know if I was dreaming or I actually experienced this, but it really put a toll on my mental health. Just when I'm writing this I feel like I've had some amnesia.

Tonight, I decided to sleep on the couch, and tomorrow I’ll try to do as much as I can to push some sort of investigation on the matter of the smell.

I’m stressed out because I’ve got my first mid-term this week, I’ve got a shitload of work to do for school (this program is very time consuming), my parents live far away, and I just feel powerless to that fucking smell. It’s really driving me crazy. On top of that, we’ve discovered a mouse in our kitchen 2 days ago and we’ve been working on solving this issue with the building janitor.

I feel like it might be some sort of toxic gas leak, or microorganisms I shouldn’t be breathing. I can’t help but to think that the symptoms I’ve described are related to the smell in some way.

I do I approach this issue? I feel deeply fucked right now. All I feel like saying is what the fuck.

I flirted largely to no avail until the last day when I found out he had a longtime bf back home. I was really bummed but all the participants went out to drink at the bars and I went too and ended up drinking quite a bit. 

Things get a little patchy from there but I remember going back to the hotel, him inviting me to his room so I wouldn’t have to go down to mine and saying he had had trouble sleeping alone. I said I didn’t want to intrude, we got there and he said it was fine and told me to take off my jeans and get comfortable. He stripped to his underwear. I don’t know really know what happened because next thing I knew we were making out. Then he told me to get a condom but I didn’t have so I went downstairs to get them. I remember there was people there in the lobby talking to me but I don’t remember who. Its patchy again but I know that we had more then one kind of sex. I hadn’t gone that far with a guy before. I woke up in the morning to his phone ringing and the photo was of his bf and I felt like trash. Went to my room and we didn’t talk before we went on our separate flights home. 

It’s been a couple weeks. He texted me a few days after we went home asking if I remembered everything, if I had been a Virgin and if I could help him get what happened. I told him I didn’t remember a lot and it gave me a headache to think about so Is rather not. He said him too, and I didn’t answer back after that. That was true at the time but since then it’s come back to me more in detail, though still patchy. I think it’s better to not talk to him again and forget about it.

I love being independent. I can do what I want when I want. People tend to be surprised when I don't want a relationship. This can mean friendships or romantic relationships. I just don't want any. I don't want friends because I've never met anyone my age (17) who likes doing what I like. I don't want a relationship because from past experience boys tend to be more of a distraction. But there's this one boy who really likes me and sees a future. He is objectively perfect and everything I'd want in a partner. But I feel so wrong for not wanting to be with him. I mean I want to be with him, but I know myself and I'm scared he won't like me for the real me. If I blow him off I'll spend the rest of my life thinking about what could have happened or how good it could have been. If I don't and mess things up, I'll just end up being disappointed in myself for knowing I was right and should've just listened to myself in the first place. ",10Oct2018,1

150,"I'm a full-time college student who has two part time jobs. One of my jobs I really like, my coworkers are really cool and my manager is really understanding that my schedule is really hectic. I've worked there for about 4 months.
Only downside to this job is the hours are garbage. The work place is set around if we are making the sales goal or not, so I can't really blame anyone. 

In my poor college student mindset, I decided to apply to another place that's just opening up in the same mall. It seemed like a reallly cool place to work, and the store manager was really nice and outgoing. I was really excited to start working here and when I got the callback I accepted immediately. 

Fast forward to my first shift, 2am-7am, keep in mind I have school starting at 8am. I was fine with it at first, because I thought it was a one time only thing. Turns out, they only want me to work these insane hours. They don't listen to me when I say I'm on a really tight schedule between my other job and school. I've told the managers many times that I go to school on X days for X amount of hours. They will not listen for the life of me!! Today the schedule was put out and I noticed that one of my shifts was during the time I would be at school and I politely let my manager know that I wouldn't be able to make it because I was going to be in class. Her response was that I needed to let them know a week in advance that I wouldn't be able to make my shift even though I clearly had stated my availability multiple times. I'm not missing class for a part time job school is more of a priority to me and the store manager clearly doesn't understand that.

 I've honestly lost all passion for this new job and it's only been two weeks the store opens this weekend and I really don't want to go for another shift. My coworkers are all high school kids and there are only a few of us who are older than 18. Two people have quit already which has put a lot more stress on me since there are less adults available.

Tomorrow will Mark the 10th day in a row that I've had to go to either one of my jobs and I'm so stressed because of it. I want to give this place the middle finger and never go back because of how horrible the experience has been in such a short amount of time. 

I don't know if I should just ask for my last day to be this Friday (thats when the schedule is put out) or if I should give a formal two weeks notice. I know if I do this I have to do it in person  and I'm not good with any sort of confrontation . I could also stick it out for a little bit longer but I can tell even this early that I'm not going to stay at this job for longer than 6 months.",10Oct2018,1

154,"Not sure of stole is necessarily the right word but here is what happened:

I am in a Political Science class right now and tomorrow we are suppose to be having a mock confirmation hearing. For each senate there are two students who are basically suppose to pretend and be that senate, but we are all grades individually.

The overall grade consists of three parts 
1) submitting hearing questions prior to the mock
2) performance during the mock
3) a reflection essay

The hearing questions were due tonight, the past two classes we have been preparing them and the other student who is also the same senate as me hasn't shown up at all for the prep days! All of the D senates made a google docs so we could make sure our questions didn't overlap, and so that people could work together with their partner on the questions. 

The questions were due earlier today and I typed all the questions, but the guy who is also my senate copied my questions and submitted them for the first part of his grade. The professor stated that it was ok if you had the same questions as the student who had your senate. The issue is I was the only one that put in work and this upsets me because I spent over two hours on it and he just gets on at the last second and copies and pastes my questions from the google doc and submits it.

Now I am afraid he will ask my questions during the mock confirmation hearing tomorrow and I won't have questions to ask. A part of me is thinking I can just try and talk before he does and have all my questions asked that way he won't have any, and possibly let it go and not tell the professor. However, a part of me is upset that a part of his grade will be from the work that I did by myself.

Should I tell the professor?

My little sis is too young to understand the situation and thought I was mean to them coz sometimes I couldn’t take it and will have arguments with mom.

158,"     Just for a bit of background I’ve had some rough times with previous relationship (being cheated on &amp; such) and have definitely had some anxiety about small things in relationships from than on, but for some reason this one has been going much much smoother than all my others even with previously 6 hour distance but now only 4 hour distance between us thanks her going back into her last year of collage after the summer.

     But here’s where I need some advice. We’ve been together for nearly 8 months now &amp; haven’t had a single argument but now that she is working as an RA position at her collage (basically watching over the residence) and I just recently got myself another job after being jobless for about a month and a half, we nearly have no time to see each other outside of nightly FaceTimes and occasionally playing video games online but to add on I had to cancel a date we had to go to an amusement park this weekend due to my boss scheduling me for that exact weekend.
     I’ve just recently felt a bit of tension for the past day or so and I’m assuming it’s due to having to cancel our date. (But it truly could just be me over analyzing things)

     But so sum it up does anyone here have some sort of advice on making a long distance relationship work a bit smoother when both of us are working full time jobs that give us maybe 2-3 nights together per 3 or so weeks?
     Thanks in advance for any advice. (First time posting here, I hope I did this properly)",10Oct2018,1
161,"It's been only a month since I've started my third year in high school and this very month that just passed has to be one of the worst months ever for me. It's not about grades, it's not about misfortune, I haven't cracked my phone. my house didn't go on fire, it's about how I feel.

I've only loved to enjoy anything I do and have it take a place in my heart. I've created so many feelings in middle school, many memories that I have pleasure remembering of, a lot of ""sets"" of feelings that are either bad or worse. To making fun in class, going outside and doing dumb shit, to having my first bad grade, starting to fall asleep as school, me discussing games with my friends, anime etc. Every day it's been a wonderful learning experience, that I am proud I've been through.

Even in primary school I've had hard times, but I still love to remember some friends I made that probably I don't remember or they don't remember me. Everything I did had a meaning in common with me, because I was younger, I didn't know anything so it was fun learning.

High school has been completely different. I started off badly in the first year; it was my fault (partially), I adapted and finally got back on my feet. This itself was a learning experience that I'm proud I've made it through. The second year has only just been me living with the me I've built a year before.

But now the third year, even tho nothing has happened to me, feels the worse. Every day is the exact same, I do nothing that I enjoy anymore. I don't enjoy playing games as much, I don't have any real passion or hobby, I am anti talented. I don't have things that motivate me to feel well, IDK a girl friend, a dream, a thought anything. There is nobody to entertain me. I thought at first this was because of me being a terrible person, and I thought that after adjusting myself a little things would change. It didn't. Nobody entertains my soul.
Teachers are terrible, a day at school is just a day of zoning out and waiting for time to pass. People laugh, have no worries, while I'm wondering why are they not complaining. I went from being a charismatic person to being a closed one. I love to be joyful and entertaining but people here make me feel bad for doing it. These past 2 years I've been forcing myself into thinking I'm having fun. But after all this time I realized it was nothing. I just come to school, I can predict what my classmates can say, what they are gonna say, how they are going to react. I can predict what teachers are gonna feel/say, it's all an utopian world and me just trying to live my life.

Today i've just woken up from a stupid dream where I was remembering a few of my memories in primary school. The feelings from the dream felt too genuine to me. I started feeling regret, reminding myself how it can feels to be genuine and how I am right now, trapped into nothing, thinking the day tomorrow will be better but instead it will be the same.

I've fallen down mentally; I cannot take the same shit anymore. I wanna make a change, or move to change something, IDK what, just to feel better in classes, after classes, feel better with my ""friends"", heck I'm starting to think I don't have any real friends. Friends I talk to? yea, friends that help me, sure. Friends that can feel me or friends that make me continue my life happily? No. I've tried understanding them, thinking I could get closer to the true meaning of friend ship, I was fucking wrong. I hated them from the beginning. Me adapting to them was a lie for myself. I don't even care about anything, right now I'm probably late for school. I don't care. I'm not the perfect student anyway, I've always tried to pretend I was. It's my time to be fucking terrible at that. This morning I've been sitting with my elbows on my thighs, thinking what the fuck have I become. From a person that always smiled to one that wants to kill persons that I dislike. I never cry yet this morning I've been on the verge to, because of that dream and the feeling of regret.

I have nobody I could share this with, and I need to share it because that's how humans work. It's been 2 years, every day has passed like it was nothing, barely any memories worth remembering, it's been an unfun place, and my future is looking even worse than this, university, exams, I aim to go to computer science, which is fucking hard, I have nothing GOOD to think about. I need to stay intact with school, my parents will crack if I just take it to thrash. my recent past is shit, my future is shit, my present is shit. Something needs to be good. Please tell me what to do,",10Oct2018,1

165,"so there is this guy, one of my flatmates. on which i (m 24) had a crush on for some weeks and as i realized last week that i might never have a real chance on him (heterosexual), i started to be kinda sad. so 3 days ago he asked me if my sadness had anything to do with him, like if i am serious when i sometimes flirt with him because he is unsure how to react to it, because if a girl would do that to him he would respond differently.

as i was kind of surprised by the question i first said no, but later explained that i am sometimes seriously flirting with him. he then said so it’s alright that the situation is kind of awkward. i told him that i could stop with it, cause i do not want him to feel awkward, but he said i shouldn’t. the atmosphere was kinda intense, we stood really close to eachother. unfortunately our talk got interrupted and we didn’t talk about it anymore. 

so yesterday i planned that when i am coming home i try to start the conversation again to make it clear again that i definitely do not want it to be awkward for him, but i couldn’t do it. i was too nervous and afraid of his reaction.

i am totally perplexed on what to do, because i definitely do not want things to be difficult for him because of me. but i also would like to be clear about our feelings for each other, because i feel like there is “something” between us. 
the hardest thing is that i definitely do not want to harm our friendship, but instead of like “forgetting the whole thing” there must be other options? thankful for any tips",10Oct2018,1

She was a fair thin tall athletic girl ( she used to play football and etc basically sports)(Also won many medals)

And i gave her all the emotional support she needed after her breakups gave her chocolates wrote her notes for her

I always used to lighten up when she used to breakup but then she would always start dating another guy

She always dated 6ft + athletic guys who were rich and popular 

She never considered me 

All these 7 years

while i was alone 

I once shared my feelings to her how she meant the world to me and how i would do anything and everything for her

She slapped me went to her freinds and screamed ""You deserved it"" 

And then once when she was with her tall bf and popular friends and i was sitting alone in the last bench she called me

i came to her circle everyone was looking at me and they all had a very funny expression on their face 

and then she just started verbally abusing calling me name and everything 

I was just standing there mute looking at the love of my life my everything doing this to me 

And then after she was finished she said ""don't take it personally "" my name "" it was just a dare""

i was just standing there i wanted to cry i wanted to run away again somewhere where i am wanted somewhere where i can belong when she looked at me stopped laughing and said "" (insert my name) Fuck off"" after hearing this i froze i just couldn't understand anything it felt as if i was in a nightmare and then she repeated herself very slowly with more emphasis "" (insert my name) Fuck Off""

They all started laughing hysterically and her boyfriend patted me and made a smooch sound and said now go...i was just standing there and then  a guy asked me

""( insert my name) What's the capital of thailand ?""

And then he kicked my balls and then screamed ""BANGKOK""

They all burst out laughing everyone was laughing

I dropped down

And broke down started crying heavily snot was coming out of my nose my balls hurt so bad my heart was racing so fast

and then they all just got up wiping off tears from their eyes off of hysteric laughter and left me there.....

My heart would pump very fast whenever my dad screamed at me hit me 

Or when he screamed at my mother and hit her he broke her nose threw stones at her punched her eye black grabbed her by her hair and rammed her head on the wall knocking her unconscious i could go on for my entire life about my father's abuse on my mom sisters brother and me

He never earned a penny in his life lives on my moms earnings we all do we are rich btw my mom is a very hardworking business woman

anyhow i don't know what to do

In a month or two i'll be going abroad for my higher education 

Don't know what to do now

All my school life i was mute

I never talked to anyone

I was bullied because im a weak pathetic scum genetic trash low tier short moon faced beta male  

My bullies broke bottles and threw me in the bottle shards

I told my father 

he came after school

And confronted the bullies

Finally i thought no more my father will save me!

My bullies told him what they did

He looked at me

And BAM he slapped me almost knocking me out unconscious i started shaking and crying

My bullies were laughing my teachers were just looking all my peers were laughing i ran away like the weak pussy boy that i am

i remember hugging my pillow and crying my eyes out

My father also after coming home removed all my clothes and started swinging me my penis was on display my sisters and my brother saw it and they just left 

My dad then took me to a farm i was crying the whole time he started tying me with a rope and threatened me that he would make me drink cow piss

He didn't do it tho he just made me piss in a cup and threatened me he would make me swallow it i was crying a lot and then we went a home.

I'm just went on a tangent with my father son experiences anyhow coming back to the point

I am a very rational person

I believe in feminism equality for LGBT community and am politically progressive

I am an atheist and don't believe in any meaning or purpose to life but definitely believe in love and affection

But my question is am i a subhuman genetic trash did i do something wrong for me to have lived this life?

Is it always going to stay this way  

Also if there is a solution for this i'm interested i went through incel forums and they highly promote committing suicide i understand their logic as if i cease to exist i will be gone and therefore will not experience cruelty but i would love to experience the good things in life

I am 19 yo atm and yeah college starts in a month or so

currently im searching for solutions answers advice anything

i lurked the Nofap red pill incel mgtow etc etc but tbh i stopped believing in these things

Maybe there is something that the people here have right...but on the most part these sub reddits 

I want to improve my life

i wake up play fortnite 

lurk incel forums where i am reminded that a male who is taller to me who has broader shoulders to me who's jaw is more chiselled then mine deserves a better life than me due to his genetic superiority 

This makes me feel like a subhuman and then i masturbate to bully fucks sis mom gf beta male humiliation sissy hypno etc etc

this is my daily cycle atm

don't know how what to change moving forward in my life

And also will a women ever accept me for who i am or should i raise another man's child so my own child does not have to suffer because of my inferior genetics

Also are my genetics inferior or have i been misinformed

I'm confused guys

But i'm a very clean person

I miss him a lot, it’s been almost 2month, he was the closest person to me, more than my own biological family.
I dont know what to do.",10Oct2018,1
184,"Last summer I had about a 3 month situationship/relationship with a guy we will call John. 

We met on Tinder. We live in a military town and he is currently serving in the Air Force. We went out a few times and instantly clicked. After hitting things off so well, we spent every single night together and all of the free time we could while working through his work schedule and my summer classes. He never formally asked me to be his girlfriend but we were totally pretty much dating.
 
A few weeks into us seeing each other, his “ex girlfriend” that lives several states away requested to follow me on Instagram a couple of times. I would send him screenshots of her request and he would call her crazy and tell me to deny it. I denied it at least twice and both times she would send another request. He ended up telling me to block her, so I did. I always thought something was a little off though, especially considering that all of the pictures of them were still on his Instagram with lovey dovey captions. 

Everything was great about our “relationship”. We both enjoyed the same things. We never argued. We got along great and had tons of fun together. 

Often we would go to his friends’ houses and drink/party on the weekends. He allowed something horrible to happen to me one night though, which was a major turning point for both of us. 

He invited me to a party of all guys (about 7-10 guys). I felt comfortable around him and a few of the other people and trusted they wouldn’t let anything tragic happen to me if I got drunk. So I did. I woke up in the morning on a sectional couch. I was on one side and John was on the other. I fell asleep in all my clothes and woke up to two guys (I didn’t know) kissing my neck and unbuttoning my pants. RIGHT across from John. 
The situation was extremely uncomfortable and when I realized what was going on, I just quietly got up and went into a different room. John appeared to be asleep. I didn’t know or not if he had seen what was going on. I hoped he hadn’t just to avoid the drama. Later I found out that he did. He was actually mad at ME and his excuse was that “he thought I was enjoying it”. I expressed my frustration, wondering how I could “enjoy” something while I was asleep and RIGHT in front of him. We both had weird feelings towards each other after that. 

He ended up texting me a few weeks later, out of the blue, after still hanging out with each other 24/7 (despite the incident), saying he had an STI. 
I didn’t have the STI luckily, but I know for a fact he was telling the truth about it. A few weeks passed. We still saw each other everyday and everything seemed fine. 
One day, he randomly texted me saying we should break things off because he felt as if “I wanted something from him that he couldn’t give me” (whatever that means?)... I understood I guess, and knew he would be getting deployed soon anyways. I just let it go and we agreed to part separate ways. It still shocked me and hurt my feelings pretty badly. He was the first person I cared to “date” in a really long time. 

A few weeks pass and he drunk snapchats me 2 nights in a row to come over and hookup/sleep with him. I declined the offers since I already had plans and was out of town. Then he deleted me. I really didn’t care to see him anyways.  

John gets deployed for about 8 months. We don’t talk. We remained following each other on Instagram. 

About halfway into his deployment he starts posting pictures of the “ex” girlfriend saying things like “happy 2 years to the best girlfriend I could ever ask for”....... and “I love and miss you/can’t wait to come back home to you”...... 

After unblocking the girl, I looked at her page and she definitely had several pictures with the same types of captions. Weird. I felt really bad for her. I genuinely had no idea that in her head they were probably “together” this whole time. 

All of that happens and then brings us to this past week.

First I will say, I’m in a REAL and happy relationship that definitely isn’t worth ruining over him. He added me on Snapchat which caught me completely by surprise. I accepted the request just to see what would happen. He immediately sent me a Snapchat of himself with the filter from the town we live in = his deployment must have just ended and he is back in town. Knowing him and the history...... this was definitely an advance for him to try and hookup or at LEAST hangout. I opened it and didn’t reply. Then he deleted me since I had nothing left to offer him I guess. 

I have been cheated on in the past and feel really bad for the girl he’s leading on back home. My only concern is that if I try to tell her, what if she doesn’t believe me? What will it accomplish? I have no hard evidence from any of this anymore. Plus, the only means of communication I would have with her would be through Instagram. I still have hard feelings towards John for the night he watched me be sexually harassed by his friends and for fabricating this entire situation to ME and THE GIRL. She deserves way better and deserves to know the truth. I just am not a person that goes out of my way to do things like this, be messy, or create drama. 
What should I do?",10Oct2018,1
185,"(this is a long one, sorry bout that)

It all beggins three years ago. I came to college, very shy and low on social skills, from being bullied almost the whole school years until highschool. I didn't know how to make friends. 
College life in my country has a tradition of freshman integration, that makes you feel at home, and help create friendships so strong they are almost like family. 
I moved in to the new city, and started living in a college residence, along with over 200 other students. In that residence the same traditions followed, and i made friends that i loved so much that i would give the world for them. I was finally breaking out of my shell and litterally learned how to talk to people.
Thats when he came into the story.
A guy, that i really liked and started dating on freshman year, and continued on until third year of college. He was funny, handsome, liked the same things as me, and helped me get out of my shell. I make friends with his friends that soon became my friends too, friends i really really loved like family. 
First year of college: life is perfect, my friends, me and my boyfriend are all a big family.
Second year of college: my relacionship takes the first steps into the darker side. With agressive reactions from him to little things i said or did (he did not hit me, was just extremelly rude) and the arguments were daily things. By the end of second year, we took a time off, it was not supposed to be permant, but my brain processed it as such, and i started going through all breakup pain and sadness like it actually happened. 
During this time, i got next to 0 atention from my friends and boyfriend, and i would cry myself to sleep and be depressed every day. I started drinking like crazy, even got ingured one night when i was too drunk. Even though it was for bad reasons (such as binge drinking) i got closer to some of my friends, and i started to get back on my feet. 
After about 2 months I was ready to eather put a stop this paused relationship, or get back together. It was emotional torture to stay in that limbo of breakup feellings that should not be there, because we had not broken up yet.
I confronted him with this, and we got back together. But things were different. I was much less tolerant to any bad things he did, and was detached emotionally from him.
So, about 2 weeks after we stopped the pause, i broke up with him. 
Hell broke loose for him. He slept in other people's rooms, to not sleep alone, got all the help he wanted from our friends (basically went through the same i did but he had people helping him all the time) and kept trying to get back together. But i was past him, i had done the breakup thing already, and i was ready to move on. And i did with another guy, just as a sex partner.
Fast forward a few months, after many presuasion from him (we were still friends, and still lived in the same place), we got back together.
Right after that, he cheated on me.
Third year of College: he cheated on me 2 more times. in the beggining of the year he broke up with me because i couldn't have sex with him, just never had the need anymore. I was tired and always depressed, and even though it was something with my medication. I only realised the shit show of a relationship i was in after it ended, i was blinded by my feelings. 
During the rest of the year, i was with another guy for a few months, just as a sex partner. I realised something else: Everytime my ex was in the same place as me, the entire conversation just went to his side, and i was left out. I could only talk to my friends when he wasn't nearby. Im still shy, even though i like to talk with people, i can't do it with ease. He can. And he does so everytime he is anywhere with friends, my friends too, and i just sit quiet because from the moment he walks into a room, the conversation is about him.
At this point i still live with him in the student residence, and he takes the same course as me, so i see him everyday. 
End of the year comes, i end up hooking up with a guy that happens the be one of his closest friends. He didn't like that. He told me not to talk to him ever again, that i was dead to him, that i was a whore, and that i lost all of my friends because of that. 
At that point i couldn't care less about him, i just wanted to live my life as normal. Im happy with this new person, and it has a prospect of being something more serious and healthy than what i used to have, but, its at the moment long distance dating, so we are almost never together.

Fourth year of college: this is when the problem arises, and i dont know what to do next. 
Everyone is back, him included, and all of my friends (that are also his friends). I keep seeing him everyday (and he has even started dating someone else, and i see them together everyday) and i cant talk to my friends from the residence as much as i did, and now my presence even feels forced onto them... I feel left out everyday by the people i consider my family. Needless to say im very brokenhearted. Only a handfull of people still talk to me like its nothing. The only things keeping me in this place are the student organisations im in and that handfull of friends. 
One of those friends is leaving the residence to live in a house, because of very similar reasons. But living in houses is a bit more expensive.

Here is my ultimate question (i have been thinking about this for over a year now): Should i leave, and go live with her, away from all of this mess, and end up paying more money every month for rent? or should i stay and keep trying to live with my friends here, even though they preety much ignore me if my ex is present. And also keep living in the same place as my ex? 

I feel like i will let him win if i leave, but its also draining my sanity to stay... 

Please leave your opinion, i would like some outside viewers to give their opinion.

Sorry for the long post, im kinda desperate.",10Oct2018,1

189,"I used to be very positive when I was a child, but that was quickly taken away from me when my mom would always turn it into something negative. She hates optimism. (Not exaggerating. She said so herself.)

Mom: the sun gives you cancer.

Me: I got an A!
Mom: most people probably got an A

Me: the food was good.
Mom: you don't have taste buds. (That is true, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy food.)


Basically, when I try to be positive, my mom turns it in something negative.

If I talk to her over text she does reply, but it doesn't seem to be genuine anymore. She tells me that's she's very shy and introvert and doesn't meet up easily with strangers, which is totally fine.

198,"Hi there Reddit! I’m a first-year teacher in my early/mid twenties. I teach a few grades, but I’m also oversee some of the senior leadership for the school. One of our most involved students is an almost-18-year-old who is funny, intelligent, and, admittedly, very handsome.

So here’s the thing: is it wrong to even mentally admit that he’s handsome? I’m not attracted to him, Ive just occasionally thought to myself: that boy is good looking! I do believe there’s a difference between acknowledging a person is good looking and actually being attracted to them. For instance, I’m straight, but I’ve seen women and thought, wow she’s gorgeous. 

I’m not that much older than the seniors, but I’d never, NEVER consider or imagine entering into any kind of relationship with someone this much younger let alone a student (I wouldn’t even want to be their friends until they’re older).

200,"Hey guys, first time poster here so be gentle.                                                                                          

My college year has already begun and i'm coming up with new problems and doubts every second.                                                                                                                                                     

My father and grandfather were electricians and engineers their entire life and they have been trying to get me into the business ever since I was born. This unfortunately only led me to hate their profession even further. I've developed an artistic side throughout the last few years and eventually decided that I always wanted to become a concept artist/illustrator in a game development studio. This is where the problems begin to arise.                                                      

I live in an Eastern European country, meaning my choice of college was fairly limited. Every state college here is completely free, but there are private colleges which cost 2000$ a year (it seems like a laughable amount, but most people here barely earn 200-300$ a month). The only college I could choose from was the state-funded Art University (which was completely focused on traditional art, something I have no interest in, only digital), the state-funded Graphical Design college, which is located in the capital - more than 600km away, where I didn't know anyone; or the private Graphic Design college located barely 30 mins away from my home town.                                                                                                                                                             

Though my parents wanted me to enroll in a state-funded college, I managed to fight through in the last couple of years and they decided to fund my private Graphic Design choice. This decision was mostly due to the fact that my father works (and lives) in Germany so the money isn't much of a problem.                                                                                                                         

The college year began 10 days ago and suspicions and doubts are beginning to arise.                     
First and foremost is the college itself. As I mentioned - I want to become a concept artist / illustrator. Even though graphic design might seem similar, the only class that has any connection is the ""Art"" class, in which they make us draw traditionally (using charcoal at that; i've drawn with graphite for years before getting a tablet, but never charcoal... i hate it). So not only are all my classes barely (or not at all) connected to my desired profession, the only one that IS, forces me to go back to a more... primitive? way of drawing that I believe I've mastered long ago. (mastered might be a strong word)                                                                                        

Then comes the second problem - most people in this country will warn about these ""private"" colleges. Even though their diploma is recognized in most high-profile companies and other countries, their way of teaching is... problematic. They don't care about you learning something, they just want you to pay and continue taking classes so you pay more. In the 10 days of being there I've learned absolutely nothing, I've seen professors directly copy lines from wikipedia for their presentations, I've taken classes where they just played a youtube tutorial, etc. It's incredibly concerning, specially since i'm paying a lot of money for it and their showing me things I could have googled in a few minutes (most of which I already learned on my won by googling). As a reference, my roommate has enrolled in the best state-funded college in the entire country (Medicine) and he has had to study every single day - despite it only being the first week. He's learned SO MUCH in the past week, while i've just fucked around. (I do realize that i'm complaining about not having to study, but when you're paying for the sole reason that you need to learn something, I feel like its reasonable)                                

I do realize that its only the first 10 days, so I'm not doing anything except for writing this post. But I can't help but think that i've made a huge mistake and am burning away my parent's money while wasting another 4 years of my life.                                                                                   

This whole situation has made me rethink the entire electrician / engineer thing. I've never hated the profession as much as I hated my dad trying to force me into it. He is sort-of a high ranking manager in his company and has been offering me to teach me about the job and eventually to make me his employee, but i've always refused. Now i'm thinking about leaving this private college, going to Germany to work with/for my dad, repay my parents the thousands of $ they've already invested in me, all while continuing to practice concept art and illustration on my own. Worst case scenario I'll work for my dad, or even progress further in his company, earning a wage most people in my home country can only dream of. Best case scenario I work for my dad for a couple of years until I get good enough to land a job as a Concept artist. However, i'm afraid of telling my parents that all those years of begging might have been for nothing, as art school isn't what I thought, while i'm also concerned if it would even be the right choice.

So backstory is..I’ve been in a relationship with the same girl for nearly 10 years, we were high school sweethearts and have basically grown into adults together.

We live together currently and have for years now as both our home lives growing up were pretty shite. We don’t own the house and have no kids, we’re also not married.

My girlfriend is by all means an amazing human and I know she cares for me deeply but for some reason I just don’t feel the same as I did.

All the little quirks and nuances to her personality that I used to find cute now just irritate me, and I know I’m starting to drive a wedge between us but just don’t seem to have the drive nor desire to stop it.

Is this what falling out of love feels like?

Should I get my shit together and try and work through this or is there no coming back once this shit starts seeping in?

I’ve had people steal pictures from my social media accounts and make fake, or fan pages, I’ve had numerous anonymous accounts message me daily, I recently found out that a lot of boys from my school, and other high schools in the district had this group chat that was just full of pictures of me. They would either send photos of me at school, pictures from my social media, screenshots of my Snapchat stories, etc.  this girl who sat next to me in my Spanish class had numerous pictures of me on her iPad. I’m not flirty or overly nice, nor do i dress provocatively in a way that would draw extra attention (honestly 90% of the time I’m in my sweats). I mostly just do my own thing. The pictures people have of me are either ones they take of me in school, or selfies from my social media (which I have set to private) of myself or with my friends. I don’t even post that often. I don’t really understand why people act this way with me. I used to brush it off, but recently it’s been getting on my nerves. ",10Oct2018,1

211,"My and my friends are currently on a 26 day trip to thailand to explore as well as my friends marriage.

Long story short; Ive known 2 of these 3 friends for almost my whole life ever since elementary school at the age of 10. We're around the age of 25. Let's call them Bob &amp; Ray. The 3rd friend I've known her at a later time, around the age of 22. Let's call her Diana.

It's day 5 of our trip and already I'm starting to get irritated of the remarks given to me.
They say you truly don't know someone until you live with them or see them daily. Before this trip, we would only occassionally see each other during our studies or to burn steam whenever we were tired of studying and go out a little.

Here's the issue, I honestly understand I sometimes give out stupid remarks or even answer a question in a completely stupid matter. But as a friend, shouldn't you be understanding that although you enjoy their company, do you really need to give out remarks in the persons face while they are nearby and talk on their backs. It honestly makes me feel alienated from the group.

I've never looked into this or seek professional help, but I feel like I have social anxiety. An example, my friends relative took all our canadian money and exchanged it to thai baht. They decided to split our money at the bank. We had different amounts (300,400,500). I was given the stack of cash and to split it. I got nervous and slowly and was shaking a lot while counting the cash to split between us. They were laughing and telling me to slow down. Now that's ok but the worst is after everything is done, while I was at the front of the group, my friends in the back whisper ""what a nervous wreck jesus"".

Another example is when we reach the shopping mall Robinson's; Bob was asking what sizes should I pick,

""Small?""
""What?!""
""Medium?""
""I'm asking for asian sizes, we need to pick larger sizes since they are different than Canadians.""
""Forget it, Ray, I should get large right?"".

I then leave to look for other clothes, both Ray and Bob say;
""Jesus you don't even know clothing size.""

After that I got seriously mad, I just went shopping alone.

Half an hour later they find me and all with a stern face. It's a mix of what are you doing idiot leaving the group in a foreign country and at the same time they look pissed.

""So..are you buying those pants?""
""I'm just looking around.""
""Since you're not buying much, we're leaving.""

Another example is Diana often does this. She passive aggressively points out things in a matter that seems like she wants to help me but then always clicks her tongue. If i'm struggling to open something as simple as a bag of chips for the group that takes more than 5 seconds, she flips as she runs out of patience and asks,

""Do you need help opening that bag? It looks like your struggling."" And then proceeds to click her tongue.

Honestly Diana is the worst, she's the biggest hypocrit in the group always complaining about others but then always doing the same thing she is criticizing others about. She's always complaining about others talking on her back but yet does the same about others, almost as if it makes her feel good bringing others down.

One time before I went to shower, our bedroom is close to the shower room, so I heard Diana say;

""GOD, ""OP"" is so slow!""
Bob &amp; Ray : ""I know, sometimes I wonder if he has a mental problem.""

The more the days go by, the more I feel I left out.
The one trip during my whole summer that I was lookong forward to now seems so dire and dull. I am still lookong forward to the beautiful scenery, but the mood for me seems so dead.

A friend of mine told me since I have no cancellation trip and I'm somewhat stuck, he told me to go ahead, enjoy the trip. Don't let the negative indirect bullying effect me and enjoy as much as I can.

I don't know what to do other than not say anymore words and limit my actions to reduce the criticism. Although I do recognize my actions being very stupid for someone the age of 25. But do you have to do this to someone you call a friend? Especially someone you known for almost half your life? Diana used to be nice friend, but now I feel she's a huge egotistical person who's super self centered around her own self.

Am I being too sensitive to this? Or am I justified? My stupidity is honestly through the roof, but this is how I am. I am being restrained to speak affraid of the opinion of others.",10Oct2018,1
212,"  

Had two nephews stay over at the weekend, one 24, one 17. 

The wife had £240 in an envelope in her dresser in the room they stayed in. Looks like it has disappeared. The wife hasn’t laid eyes on the money in just under a month but she’s 99% it was in there. We found the envelope stuffed down the back of the dresser whilst looking for it.

Phoned the 24 year old, I’m pretty sure it’s not him (even though I can’t be 100%). He didn’t falter or quiver in his response, if he did then he’s the best liar in the world. Says that the younger one has stole from his house, said that his misses won’t have him around anymore. The 17 year old hasn’t got a job and is in to his weed. I’m not against it or saying it drives you to petty theft, just saying. 

I don’t know how to play this at all. The wife isn’t 100% sure about the money but she is nearly, if anything she’s trying to look at where she could have spent it but has not been able to come up with anything in over a day. This was money given to her by her Mum for a deposit that she needed to pay on a 70th birthday party (her mothers). She said she wouldn’t have spent it or at least known that she had. It’s also finding the envelope down the back of the dresser. Nobody else has been round the house or in that room other than them.

Do I confront him? If she isn’t 100% and he didn’t then it could destroy the kid. If I do confront him should I give him enough rope to hang himself, as in “There’s a camera in the room and we’ve got the video” and see how he responds? Should I go through his mother as she should know if he’s lying, but if he says he didn’t then we’ll never know but we’ll always think he did?

Basically, should I go in for the kill of play it easy?",10Oct2018,1

214,"TLDR; I have my ex-husband's wedding certificate, and he's blocked me on Facebook so I can't tell him. What should I do with it?

So my ex and I divorced after a long marriage, and the parting was amicable. He's with someone else now, as am I, and while we have progressively talked less and less (as one would expect), he inexplicably unfriended me and blocked me on Facebook. I'm like, okay... whatever he feels he needs to do. We had been friends (though unfollowed) ever since our divorce a couple of years ago, so this unfriending and blocking seemed to come out of nowhere. He is getting married in a week or two, so I wondered if maybe his fiance told him he had to. I had him on restricted, so it isn't like he has been seeing any of my posts. 

Anyway... was doing some fall cleaning, and realized I have his birth certificate. It isn't an original. Since he unfriended and blocked me, I can only presume he doesn't want to hear from me at all (and now I can't access him on messenger, I don't think) and his soon-to-be wife is apparently quite emotionally fragile, as he once told me she's extremely insecure about people he even dated only once or twice before he met her. I can't imagine receiving mail from me at their house would be welcome.

I'm tempted to just shred it and let him sort it out if he ever needs another one. Unless he's waiting until the last minute to get his marriage license, he must have already gotten a new copy anyway. However if he IS waiting until the last minute, he's probably thinking he has his copy, but I do. What would you do, Reddit?",10Oct2018,1
215,"So me and my mom just discovered today that there are almost 200 photos of this one weirdly photogenic American family (we live in New Zealand) on my moms camera roll, and they were dated back to mid 2016 yet the photos are of extreme high quality, much like that of an iPhone X so the photos being from 2016 threw me off a bit, it’s a couple years difference yes, but iPhone cameras have definitely increased in quality since then. There was a date and location on each of the photos. 
I had a thought that maybe they were display images already on the phone to advertise the camera quality of the phone but then I had a look at the ""people"" album and their faces were tagged with names! Also, after googling default/display iPhone photos I couldn’t seem to find similar ones anywhere. I even tried reverse image searching. The photos must have appeared recently since my mom has had her current phone for almost a year now and hasn’t seen these until today.

Sounds great on paper, in reality, it’s pretty stressful for me. I have the desire to contribute monetarily and make something of myself while going to college. I have had a few job interviews, and I may be having a job come in.

A few days ago I didn't do as my dad told me to, which resulted in him going outright batshit crazy, some things happened, he dragged me across the pavement, pushed me, and took all my tech gadgets away. Yesterday, my mom came in my room and said someone sent her screenshots of my conversations on an app. Now, I have no idea how she got these, who sent them, but she did not go through my phone or laptop (even creepier..?). Based on the out of context screenshots she firmly believes that im sending NUDES? to older men? I honestly have no idea where this is coming from. She has 2 selfies of me, one where i have some cleavage, but no out right nudity (im 17), and she says im conversing with an older man. That part is true, a 22 year old messaged me, but if you even look at the chat, i reject all his flirtatious messages and barely even converse with him because i'm not going to engage in something illegal. She also has screenshots of me using bad language and im assuming i made sexual jokes too. She's indian, and although liberal , i'm a slut in her eyes now. She firmly wants to take me back to India. 

My dad on the other hand does notknow about all this that my mom has said, so she's keeping me on an extremely tight leash with the blackmail.

230,"I work in a cold storage facility in Pennsylvania and was helping at the plant next door because they needed the extra hands and so that I could get my 40 hours (our plant hasn't been as busy). They primarily pick by hand and so we replenish the bays on ground level with pallets stored in the racks above. It was near the end of my shift that I had to replenish one of the bays. There was a pallet in it that was already kind of messed up and broke apart when I tried to push the new one back into the roller rack. The new pallet fell back as a result. I wasn't able to get the pallet back into the bay, so I left it in the aisle until I could tell someone in Inventory about it. We haven't been getting overtime, so I wasn't sure if they would want me to stay and fix it seeing as it was time for me to clock out for the day. I told Inventory about it and explained what happened. He took a look at it and I asked if he wanted me to fix it. He said ""Nah... I just don't know who I'm going to get to fix it."" So, I left and went home. Yesterday, I received an audit by the very same person who told me I didn't need to take care of it. When I explained the situation to my supervisor, he emailed the Inventory guy who proceeded to lie and say that he asked if I was going to fix it and I said no. I told him that wasn't the case and my supervisor said that he can't go against what the Inventory guy said. So far, I've refused to accept or sign the ""severe"" audit and my supervisor said he would get back to me about it. They could check into this more as they have cameras there and can see me talking to the person in question about the pallets, but my supervisor seems more intent on taking his word over mine and told me that there's a new policy stating that if we refuse to sign write-ups we get disciplinary points. It makes no sense why I would just leave something like that and refuse to fix it when I know they'll come after me for it. It seems like my company is pulling more and more of this shit and I think they may be trying to fire people (I've been there for over 2 years and am making more money than many of the people working there) in order to drop their spending.

Long story short , I dumped the bad apple, we started feeling something for each other, we’ve now been dating for about a year and a half.

A year ago in August is when *Jane* decided she was going to randomly text Larry a bunch of nonsense. We told her to kick rocks and called it a night. As we were sleeping, she proceeded to text and call him (he has no facebook) and she friend requested me on facebook. How she found out my name is a mystery; the internet is one hell of a thing. I messaged her, we threw insults at each other, *Jane* also tried to convince me he was abusive, yada yada yada. After she realized I wasn’t faltering on thinking she was nuts, it stopped. I thought at the time it was over.

But it really hasn’t stopped. It’s not over. She tries and finds ways to contact us every couple of months. I have had to block *Jane* on ALL of my social media accounts because she found them all. *Larry* had to block her EMAIL because when she realized he blocked her number, she started emailing him. Why *Jane* still has his number and email after THREE PLUS years of being broken up is beyond me. Now, she has created a fake email under MY NAME to continue her harassment of *Larry* and I.

The little I have said isn’t even half of the bullshit *Jane* has said and done. She has threatened me with physical violence (she had charges pressed against her for assault and battery already). Now, she apparently has moved closer to where *Larry* lives and I frequent (a friend of mine went on her page to see what her deal was and informed me of that). She is harassing us any way possible. I know from *Larry* and our mutual friends that she has been known to be a drug user and alcoholic, I’m not sure if that has any sway on her random contact with us. I have no idea, I really don’t know her at all.

I could understand her behavior to A DEGREE if *Larry* had cheated on her with me or something like that. But I haven’t even met this girl, I didn’t even know *Larry* when they dated.  *Jane* found everything via the internet, what’s next? She finds my address and shows up at my house??

239,"I’m currently a freshman in college and got an internship doing work that I thought would be political research and legislative work, but has turned out to be hours of never ending data input. The other interns are doing the same job, with the occasional writing of an email blast or doing phone banks. It’s very boring and I’m actually in the process of trying to switch my major, so it’s not even that relevant to what I would do.

I also feel like I’ve already got the internship and have been there for almost a quarter of how long I was supposed to work so I might as well stay. I started September 25th and I go twice a week for 4.5 hours on Tuesdays and Fridays. It won’t go any longer than November 6th.

241,"Hey reddit! This is a throw away account because privacy. So. I am an Australian Indian in my late teens now and I would say I have a bad relationship with my parents.  

Okay so, to kick it off I'll give you some BG info. I was born in Australia and have lived in Australia for my whole life. I have an older brother who was born in India and has lived here since he was 6. My family is somewhat crazy in my eyes. Both my parents are well educated as in have good degrees but are surprisingly uneducated in the sense that they don't know stuff. They are both engineers but don't know basic stuff because they didn't bother to remember it after their studying finished.  

My relationship with my brother is kind of shit. He is quite a bit older than I am and hasn't lived with my parents for the last 8-9 years. He is a doctor and my parents are really proud of him. He takes that too seriously and basically ruins my relations with him and my parents.  

I have always been somewhat of a nerdy/curious type of a kid. I graduated high school last year and I really wanted to study science and specifically physics because I was really interested in the latest quantum physics discoveries and stuff but my parents convinced me to do engineering. I listened and I don't hate it, it's good but not the best. They wanted me to  be a doctor but I can not imagine working as a doctor, I feel its a really tedious and boring job and the studying is completely insane. So because of that they were kind of disappointed.  

After getting into university I had to move, because the Uni was 500 km from home. I was very happy about this because my parents and I have never been great to begin with and I really wanted to get them off me 24/7. After moving, I started working, going to the gym and participating in sports and stuff and I am genuinely happy 90% of the time. I pay all my bills and rent. I don't have to pay for my uni yet because of HECS. The problem is that my parents want me to visit them at least once every fortnight, they buy me tickets for the train and stuff because I won't come otherwise. I really try to limit our interactions. Here is why.  

&amp;#x200B;

My parents and brother are kind of insane imo. They are very conservative. My dad never wants me to speak about anything that relates to advice, give my opinion or educate. If the 3 of them are talking about something and I give my take on it, one of them just says ""We don't care"", ""No one asked"", ""your opinion doesn't matter"" and shit like that. This has been going on for at least a few years. Last weekend I was at their place and my mum was making some milk sweet that my brother likes and its made by evaporating the water and adding sugar to whats left with some flavourings, and my dad asks my mum ""how much do you make from the 500g of milk? Like 700g?"" Now I know it cant be that because the water boiled off and the sugar added do not even get to that much and I said ""Maybe not, because blah blah"" and he goes ""You don't know shit"" and because of that, I thought I could prove something to him so I asked him to ask me a question. So he asks ""Why aren't there holes around the tree's root? Where does the mass come from?"". Because I knew this, I started explaining how photosynthesis works, how glucose is made, how cellulose is made from the glucose and how you dont need anything but CO2, and water to get those. Basic photosynthesis. He gets mad... BECAUSE I ANSWERED HIS QUESTION!  He told me that he REGRETS having a child like me, my mum said basically the same thing comparing me to my brother.  

&amp;#x200B;

I left home after that, I am back at my place but I can not seem to be happy or anything. I don't feel like eating. I am really fucking sad and depressed right now. What can I do to make myself feel better and possibly fix this? They will never be proud of me... Thank you for reading I guess. Please help if you can.

246,"My sister has a number of issues ranging from mental, health, to financial, all the way to consistently making poor decisions. Recently things have gotten to a point where I fear the worst for her, and I’m not really sure what to do.

Long story short, my sister  caught a bug or virus from her four younger children. The kid’s sickness passed as normal in 24-48 hours, but my sister has had virus like symptoms that have persisted over 3-4 weeks. She is weak, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. and has pain in the right side of her stomach. She has barely eaten, can’t move, and can’t keep anything down. 

She is without health insurance until Nov 1st, and is treated pretty terribly when she takes herself to the ER. Granted, she has made a habit of visiting the ER WAY TOO MUCH over the last few years, that they probably  aren’t allowed to take her seriously. I probably wouldn’t take her serious either either record... but I also know that this level of dehydration is very dangerous.

So I guess I’m just looking for some guidance. Guidance on the best way to take care of her now, and guidance on what could be going on with her and what sort of specialists to send her to. I have the means to help her out with some doctors visit bills, but not extensively..  we would have to select 1-2 specialists and hope they have answers.  

Has anyone gone through this with a family member? 

Some more background:
40 years old with 4 kids. She has had chronic gastro issues that have mostly gone undiagnosed. She had endoscopes and the like within a few years.  She is obese. She smokes pot to alleviate symptoms (I don’t agree with this). To clarify she has had similar issues for YEARS. It has just escalated with the recent virus to the point where she can’t even stand up or keep food down for weeks. 

I have researched the effected of extreme malnutrition (due to over nutrition and binging only fast food for 40 years). I wonder if her body is just shutting down from lack of nutrients. I have looked into diverculitis, gastroparesis, gallbladders fissures, etc.  everything seems likely and not likely at the same timeZ 

Sorry if this is rambling and disorganized. I am anxious and worried for her.

248,"Im secondary 4 (grade 10) this year and i had a crush on a girl since secondary 1 (grade 7) and yes i still do like her.

She is one of the purest girls in the world and seeing her smile is enough to brighten up my day. She is also quite popular among the discussion with boys and have rejected multiple people. You might be wondering why cant i just tell her how i feel, but do note that OP is an introvert and cant muster up any courage to even talk to her let alone make eye contact for more than a second.

I got a chance to seat with her during my lower sec years (sec 1 and 2) we spoke every single day and it was truly a blessing for me. It was quite a surprise she was able to make conversations with an introvert like me. It soon turned from normal conversations in school to texting messages till 3 in the morning. unlike most people who keep their crushes lowkey, my asshole of friends decided to spread the information and soon the whole class knew about my love for her. I was still able to speak to her normally without much awkardness, but the thought of her knowing about it would linger in my mind with every conversation we had.

 After some time we made a bet on our results and told her she could ask me anything. Obviously being curious what she would ask me i let her win the bet without taking into account our childish selfs and spreading rumours about who has a crush on who. In the end she asked the one thing i did not want her to, “who do you like?”. Trapped in a corner, i tried to drag on the conversation in hopes of dodging the question. After her countless and persistent questioning i finally managed to say “i like you”. Expecting to get rejected she finally typed, “ok”. This was worse than getting a simple “i dont like u that way” or “im not interested” what exactly does “ok” mean?? (female redditors pls translate)

moving on to the story, after that day we did not talk normally without feeling the awkwardness between us. Then secondary 3 came and we got moved to different seats. It was quite sad for me as i couldnt enjoy school life to its fullest. As the days go by, we slowly drifted apart from each other and havent talked since. Even after the open ended reaction she gave, i still long the days when we would talk with no regard to the ongoing lessons and her laughter whenever i made jokes. I genuinely wish i could spend my life with her but i dont know how to express my bottled up feelings. The times i had spent with her was honestly the best time i had and i feel like i could depend on the memory of these few years as a reason to live the rest of my life feeling satisfied. I am in desperate need of advice on how i should approach this situation. Do I confess? Do I give up? Do I search for someone else? I am honestly not able to think of ways to overcome this crush and i need you guys’ (and girls) opinion on this situation and how to tackle it

253,"The title is basically a TL;DR for the advice I'm seeking, but just to give some additional points:

* She was caught with nudes on her phone around a year ago (when she was 13), and her phone was confiscated pending a serious talk about taking nudes. 
* When we looked through it, we found that she had been sending *very* explicit messages to males (at least some of whom were adults), and, in one instance, had sent messages arranging for a sex act to take place in a public toilet (although I'm not sure whether or not she would've actually gone ahead with it).
* She has showed signs of addiction/desire to continue these activities even after being reprimanded: after we confiscated her phone and told her off thoroughly, she began to use her younger brother's (9 at the time) phone to continue her online activities, so we were forced to confiscate that as well, and even went as far as to store away all non-essential internet-accessible devices (e.g. handheld games consoles) and changing the Wi-Fi password to make sure she couldn't access the internet from any new devices (e.g. if a friend lent her a phone).
* This has prevented her from continuing her activities, but has also basically cut her off from her friends outside of schooltime (we live in a rural area a few miles from the school and her friends), and I think it's having an impact on her social life not being able to regularly participate in social media with her friends. I would like to believe that a year without this kind of interaction on top of the talks I've had with her about this kind of activity would've had an impact on her, but I am still worried that she will return to her old ways given the opportunity (which is pretty much what giving her a phone would be).

Is there any app/combination of apps that would allow her to participate in regular social media without sexting and the like? 

* I have a good idea about general filter apps to prevent viewing adult sites.
* I have seen apps that are able to detect and filter explicit images taken/saved to the phone storage (e.g. Detoured, Gallery Guardian, etc.), although I am unsure which is ""best"" for this, and am also aware that they are unable to prevent sending/receiving images through apps that do not save images to the phone storage, so anything that can also help with that (if it exists) would be greatly appreciated.
* I am struggling to find apps that are able to detect and filter text-based messages (e.g. detect when my daughter is sending/typing or receiving an explicit and prevent it from being sent/viewed). 

Finally, and I am aware that this is probably the biggest ask, I would prefer a set-up that doesn't compromise my daughter's privacy; I would prefer that this set-up prevented her from acting out online, potentially warns me if she tries to act out continually, but that doesn't give me full access to all of her messages at all times, etc. I don't want her to feel like she is under constant surveillance or as though I'm constantly prying unnecessarily, but I also want to be able to protect her from herself (and those who would encourage/exploit/harm her) if she does feel tempted to return to her old ways.

Can anyone suggest/recommend any apps/software that might help me with this? Otherwise, if anyone has any advice on the situation in general, then it would be greatly appreciated.",10Oct2018,1

255,"We are an Indian Family, not much into Social Media excluding my Mom. It all started when my elder Brother died in 2010 due to Heart attack when he was 11. My life changed since then, it took over 2 years for my Mom to stop crying everyday. And 4-5 years to burst out into tears every week. My Cousin saw Social Media as a distraction for Mom to meet new people and connect. But never knew she would so deep into social media. She's a good looking lady and there by gets lots of attention. 
I was ignored. I remembered I cried every single day because I didn't got attention. I used to hate when my Mom gave so much time to people she never knew. And left me alone. She never realized it nor she does now.
Whenever I tell her to give time she says she has completed all her duties of preparing food and stuff.And I died from inside everyday. Of not having a brother and losing sometime of my own who is still alive. My father is in abroad and even their relation is getting affected. She started getting influenced by people on Facebook and started comparing her life with them this led to more of showing off on Facebook etc. She even shows me photos and video of her so called friends on Facebook  and later shows me how other children behave and how I don't. She  started using less of her mind. She started doing things that would give her for likes and comments. Still if we go out together which is once in a blue moon, she starts asking me to click good photos for her to post in on Facebook. And she's never ready to accept the fact that she's addicted to Facebook. She gives an explanation that after loss of my brother, Facebook is the only distraction from her. 
If any argument we have. The origin always comes out as Facebook. The worst part is that she's not even willing to listen to me and understand me when it comes on facebook.

264,"My wife, who had a prior history of anxiety and sees a therapist, developed depression with the increasing demands of her job. She had gradually accepted more tasks/assignments until it got to be too much for her and she had shut down completely. She had become isolated, wasn’t eating well, and appeared to be distracted and anxious about checking her email constantly for work messages in her off hours. The depression gotten to the point where our romantic life had dwindled to nothing, and she was barely looking at or touching me. We started seeing a couples therapist and her mood is improving. She looks happier and is engaging with me more. She is also hugging me, a big step for her. I just have a couple of areas I could use advice on:

&amp;nbsp;

1. Her therapist: I am questioning the methods of her personal therapist, considering her symptoms had gotten so bad by she had seen him. I am also concerned because the marriage therapist we are using told me that he has spoken to this therapist in an effort to communicate findings and coordinate her care, but her personal therapist has declined to do so. He has decided to follow his own course and disregard what the marriage therapist has told him. On top of that, things she has said about her personal therapy sessions have me worried. Like the therapist telling her she is an introvert who should have others ask her questions instead of working on communicating her feelings openly herself. 

&amp;nbsp;

2. The romance part of our relationship. There’s been some improvement like I mentioned. It’s just been a case of progress being measured in inches vs miles (It’s been 3 months now). I’ve done little things like getting her flowers but nothing more because I didn’t want to make her feel pressured. However, I’ve debated whether or not to be more assertive with it all. On one hand I don’t want to pressure her. On the other hand, she’s admitted during therapy that the therapist told her she can be introverted and may need someone to push her, ask questions, and make the first move. I also don’t want her to get complacent and think this situation is an acceptable norm for us. I miss feeling close to her.

268,"I am marrying a wonderful woman in November.  I have completely hit the jackpot with this girl and I can't wait to finally make her my wife before she finally wises up and realizes she can do so much better! 

Anyway there is only one small issue that we have to figure out.

My wife has a child from a previous relationship.  He is almost 10 years old and has not seen his father since he was 3.   The problem is that my fiancée very much does not want to change her last name, because she wants to continue to share a name with her child.  

There are a few reasons I don't like this. Mostly because I want my wife to share my name. And because if we have a child together, how will we decide which last name we use?  Also she still has her ex husbands name and that brings out my little green eyed monster.  

I would very much love to have my stepson take my name as well. I want for him to become my son when my fiancée becomes my wife.

But there are reasons this isn't practical. One, my son-to-be has 3 older siblings with whom he shares a name.  He very much wants to keep that special connection with them, and I support that.  My fiancée has always made it a priority for him to continue a close relationship with them.  So she doesn't want them to lose that last name connection either.  Plus, we would have to go to court for approval and his biological father would likely fight us on it, even though he hasn't been around.  He still wants to ""pass on the family name"" and my stepson is the only boy heir in his family.

I asked my fiancée to hyphenate her name.  So her son would be John Smith and I would be Jack Doe and my wife would be Jane Smith-Doe.    And the children we had in the future could be Doe. She said she will consider it if it is important to me but that she would really prefer that she and her kids (her son and her former step daughters and any future kid of hers) all maintain the same name. She says it's just *important* to her. So she would prefer not to change her name at all.

But my friends have suggested that this is 2018, and who not be modern? They say that since I am joining the already existing Smith family, I simply ought to take the name Smith too. But for obvious reasons I don't really want to do that.

271,"This might be a long read but I need to blow off steam and also get other people's opinions on this.

So the other day I was dress-coded at school and the whole interaction seemed kind of off, but I really cannot tell if it was entirely my fault or not.

I go to a public school and I know the dress code. I do not wear clothes that I know are against the dress code (ie tube tops, spaghetti straps, etc.) to school for the reasons that I do not want to be dress coded, or really call administrative attention to myself; however the other day I wore a bodysuit with an open back to school and some mom jeans. I have worn bodysuits similar to this before and have had no problems, the only difference was they did not have an open back. They were thicker straps, not the thin spaghetti straps by any means. I knew for a fact that in the handbook in the section that involves student attire, there is no specific rule about open backs whether it be prohibiting or allowing them. Other than that, I was following all specified dress code guidelines that had been included in the handbook with this outfit.

I got called over by one of the administrators and she asked me if I had anything to cover up with, and I told her I did not. She asked me to come with her to her office to get a t-shirt to put over what I was wearing, as she said it was ""inappropriate,"" because my ""entire back is showing."" I went with her, but on the way asked her what, specifically, was against the dress code that I was wearing. (I understand that some may view this as disrespectful, but genuinely,  I wanted to know where in the handbook it mentioned anything about not having open backs. I was also not disrespectful when asking.) She told me ""You are not supposed to wear anything without sleeves in the first place,"" which is untrue, as 1) there is nothing in the handbook stating anything about sleeves other than that spaghetti straps are not allowed, 2) this specific administrator has worn dresses without sleeves before and 3) I and many others in the school have worn sleeveless (ie tanktops) many times before with no problem. When I told her the latter two reasons, she said ""I've never worn THAT,"" which I found a little bit inappropriate for an administrator to be saying... is this not kind of degrading/disrespectful? I said okay, and then she proceeded to emphasize that she thought it looked like a bathing suit, and I told her it was not a bathing suit,and then she said to me, ""This isn't helping you."" When we arrived at her office I asked her to point out in the handbook where it prohibited open backs specifically, and since there was nothing in the handbook specifying this, she pointed to the section where it stated that ""cutoff muscle shirts, swimwear, etc. are not appropriate"" and told me ""what you are wearing is swimwear."" I told her that it was not, and just because she believes it to look like a bathing suit does not, in reality, make it a bathing suit. I stated it as more of a question as to not come off disrespectful, but she was getting kind of annoyed at that point and continued to say she was done talking about it. I realize that it may have been wise to just give up at that point, but the fact that she had little actual substantiation to her argument kind of annoyed me and she had made a pretty snide remark earlier. I find both of these things relatively unprofessional for an administrative figure.

She then closed the handbook and told me ""Your teachers came to me and told me they thought what you are wearing is inappropriate,"" which I do not know if this is true or not. She also said, ""I think there is even a section in there that says if an authoritative figure deems it inappropriate then you have to change"" and there is, in fact, not section that states this and either way, isn't that incredibly subjective? Going back to the conversation, I asked her if we could come to a mutual agreement that it was not unreasonable for me to want to see the handbook, as she had previously stated that my questioning ""Was not helping [me]."" She said that she never told me it was unreasonable and that she had shown to me where it prohibited what I was wearing (which it really didn't,) and then told me that I should be more concerned about getting to class than arguing with her. I found this kind of ironic, because I was on my way to get to class when she stopped me and would have had to miss 15 min + anyways even if I had not questioned it, since the office is pretty far from where my class was. Upon asking her to come to a mutual understanding with me she just continued to say what she had been saying before, and it was obvious that she did not have or want to have any kind of mutual respect or comprehension with me.

I am not normally the type to be all like, ""High school sucks fuck teachers!"" I care about my education, and I do not believe that disrespecting authoritative figures is a good thing. Just, in this instance, this administrative figure seemed to be using her position of authority to kind of disrespect me, and also put in place rules that did not seem fit. It should also be noted that I believe the dress code is put in place for a reason, I just thought that what I had been wearing that day was following it. I never wanted it to seem like I was wearing that with the intention of being risque or getting in trouble, but it likely seemed like that to this administrator and whichever one of my teachers apparently told her about it...

272,"I’m going to try and keep this short.

This didn’t happen on reddit, but in a private group.

My friend appointed me admin because he trusted my judgment when it came to the rules of our group. Our group is an 18+ NSFW group. We have a few small rules, like no minors, no gore, no cp, etc. unspoken one is don’t be a dick.

I’ve banned a few people for revealing they were minors (if no one knows, it’s highly illegal to have minors in a NSFW group), I banned but later readded a guy who was talking about stuff that shouldn’t be talked about, related to death, suicide and gore. (He wouldn’t stop, so I banned him and then spoke to him about it later, he gets passionate sometimes) And I banned a guy who argued with me about the rules after he always found the chance to argue with me and disrespect me about the rules and just everything.

My friend didn’t see a problem because the last person really pisses a lot of people off, him specifically.

But a girl in the group, who, from the moment she entered the group has tried to insult me and argue with me about dumb shit, had a big problem with it. She went so far as to say that I always ban people for no reason and I’m being childish.

I really don’t think I am, but I’ve never been an admin before and I want to be fair. Anyone have any experience or can give me advice? I’m not a confrontational person but I care about people following the rules because it makes the group more pleasant.

274,"Hello, I'm new to r/Advice so I don't know how to do this but I'll just give it a shot. 

This might have something to do with how I'm felling at the moment so I thought I would share. I just broke up with my girlfriend yesterday after having such a long and great relationship. I know I'll probably get over her and we're maybe going to get back together once we get back on our feet from the past month or two of school and life in general. This is not why I'm here though, because I have plenty of people to talk to for that. This has been going on much longer than the breakup

&amp;#x200B;

It's starting to occur to that after the first month of college that I really don't like it, at all. I commute an hour 4 days a week to a very small school and I'm majoring in architecture. I thought I would really like that major but the more I get into it, the more I don't really enjoy it. I like being able to stay at home, I enjoy spending my time with my parents and friends that are still in high school. I just don't have the motivation to get up every morning and drive an hour to school every day just to do something I'm dreading every second of. Also the small school doesn't really help me go out and make new friends, I feel like I'm just alone, all by myself, and I have no one to go and talk to when I get stressed out about school.

I really want to enjoy my college experience, I don't exactly want to go out and party, but I want to be able to be surrounded by fun people to talk to. I'm very upset with myself, I committed to something that I'm not enjoying and I feel like it's too late to back out now. Should I drop out so I can think about what I want to do in life? Should I just keep chugging along and deal with feeling this way? At this point, I don't care about getting any credits to transfer. I still want to go to college so I'm better off in life.

Another factor that I have to take into account is my parents. My parents are super supportive of my decisions, and I love having that. Although, I don't want to disappoint them with wanting to drop out of architecture school. They were so excited when I said that I wanted to do architecture, they bought me all these very nice and expensive books, shirts, mugs, just little funny things that had stuff to do with architecture on it. It really pains me to think of how they feel when I tell them that I'm not interested in architecture anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

What advice do you guys have for me? I would like to know how to handle this situation. I'm just so lost on what I want to do in life and it's getting to the point where I just can't deal with it anymore. Please feel free to ask more questions or PM me. I'm getting kind of desperate at this point and I'll take any advice.

277,"(not sure if this is the best sub to post this in but worth a shot)

&amp;#x200B;

Back in March, one of those T-Mobile trailers came to my office promoting a ""one day only"" deal if you switched your personal line(s) to them that day-- apparently, they do this at different offices daily and that day was just our turn.  It wasn't really ""through"" our company but it was still exclusive to our employees.  The deal was something like $45/line unlimited plus a \~$100 rebate after the first month.  Seemed like a win-win coming from Sprint, with terrible service and higher rates for 6GBs shared, so I switched my wife and I over for a promise of $90/month total.

&amp;#x200B;

I mainly dealt with the head guy there, but there was a team of 5-6 people manning the trailer and they all were selling that same deal. After the switch, the guy mentioned that the initial month or 2 would charge the full rate of $120 while the ""business discount is processed with corporate"", and that the difference+the rebate would be credited once processing was complete. Fine with me; I was stupid enough to not get the details of this in writing, though. He seemed like a decent guy and even called me the next day to see how service setup went and to tell me about T-Mobile's exclusive ""free stuff"" app.  He said he was going to be our rep and that we could go straight to him for anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 7 months.  The discount was never applied, I never got a rebate, and for a while I still wasn't really worried because I assumed T-Mobile had just hit a snag or 2 while working with my company and that it'd be worked out eventually-- plus, the main guy responded to my first couple emails/texts asking for an update, basically just saying ""let me check into that for you"". After all, in this day in age, how could a major carrier get away with setting up a full operation and team just to blatantly bait-and-switch people?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it looks like that's exactly what they did.  Turns out, several other co-workers made the switch the same day and have had the same experience-- some stalling from the guy for a while and then for the past few months, nothing. No response from calls, texts, or emails (yes, he still works for them according to his LinkedIn).  One co-worker gave up and just cut her losses, going back to AT&amp;T.  The other went to T-Mobile corporate to try and find out what was going on.  She was told that the guy ""didn't have the authority"" to offer such a deal and that they couldn't offer it to her; they gave her a little money back but that's it.  My company's tech rep (who helped coordinate the whole thing that day) basically just told me that the guy wasn't responding to him either and that the whole thing was just ""looking like a lost cause"".

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I can just cut my losses so easily, but I'm not sure who to follow up with or how.  I doubt a customer service or retention rep will understand or have the authority to get me my money back here. But it just seems ridiculous that this was all a scam that I can't get my money back from since 1) this was a company vehicle, 2) there were 5-6 employees present, and 3) everyone was touting the same deal.  At the very least, shouldn't T-Mobile refund me and my co-workers or fire the guy+everyone involved with the scam?  Am I crazy for thinking I should be compensated? If not, is there a smart way to go about it?

&amp;#x200B;

286,"Alright, Ive prepared myself for some potentially unsavory responses from those who choose to read.

Recently, I (24F) have been getting increasingly annoyed by my bf’s (40M) preference for video games over time with me. I think this stems from bitterness I have about how he gets upset about me doing anything that excludes him, yet he plays these games for 4-5 (minimum) hours every single day while I’m in the other room watching TV bored by myself. I also have to say, for context, I love games and understand getting consumed in them—I have even competed in gaming tournaments. However, it’s really annoying to me that he’s away on business trips for a few days of every week (brings his game with him), then just comes home to game more. The only thing we do together is go to the gym first thing in the morning, which, contrary to his opinion, is NOT spending time together by any means. We have headphones on and two totally different workouts. As soon as we get home, it’s games until night time. He says that it counts as time spent together because we’re only a room away. Then at night he just wants to bang and go to bed, which is also an issue for me because I don’t feel inclined to be intimate with someone who just spent all day talking to his friends in the dark on a mic in the other room while I waited for HOURS for him to be done. Spoiler alert: he only comes out when he’s ready for bed. *I don’t want him to not play*— I just want him to cool it. 

Last night, I told him this and he essentially just said “You’re grossly exaggerating, we do more together than any couple I know, and fine then I guess I just won’t play anymore”. He made me feel like such a bitch, and acted the way I’d expect a 16y/o to act under the same circumstances. I’m really hurt by the fact that the only time he wants to hang out with me is when his friends aren’t texting him to play, but I don’t want to forbid him from playing because I’ll know he’s only begrudgingly hanging out with me when he’d rather be playing.

The thing that stuns me the most is that, we as a family, do not have any issues between us. We're wholesome, loving, and caring. My parents had nothing growing up and have gave everything to us, especially to him. This is what I fear. My parents are too lenient and sometimes don't step their foot down. Now that he has these friends, he feels it's okay to walk all over them. My mom is now in the hospital because she almost passed out and has high blood pressure. I fear she is going to have  heart attack or something from so much stress. He doesn't see the damage he is inflicting on them or everyone else around him. If it was for me, I would have smacked him upside his head. Maybe that is what he needs. 

No one in our family has ever brought drugs around him. His grades are slipping and it's barely his first year in High School. What can I do? As an older brother I want to help not just for his sake, but for my mothers. I am filled with rage for seeing my mothers tears and sadness for her health. I know we all go through a phase of experimenting, but the way he is doing it, he is going way too overboard. Everyone has tried to talk to him but he shuts them out and is being careless. What advice do you guys offer. I feel like I don't have much time because my mother is rapidly feeling the effects of it. ",10Oct2018,1

296,"American living in Germany. Renting a house on the economy. Landlords have always been nice, we pay on time, they come immediately if we call for anything (the very few times we ever called). They just keep showing up...randomly. According to other Americans living here, they are supposed to give notice prior to coming over but they never do. I am not a complete slob but there are those work weeks where everything gets put off until the weekend. They never show up on a clean day. The house is always a mess when they come over so I can only imagine what they must think. If they gave me notice I could make sure my laundry wasn't everywhere and no dishes in the sink etc. 

Now its coming to move out time. I know that they want to fill the house quickly after we leave, I get it...profit. However, they already showed up randomly with some stranger to check out the house before (which they are not supposed to do) and on a messy day...combined with me tearing the house apart to get ready for the move so trash bags, boxes, paper, piles...etc it was a mess. I don't want them coming over randomly, let alone with some stranger with my child running around the house. What do I do? Do I continue to stomach this knowing that we are moving out soon?

Last night, very late at night, I woke up in my bed with a very strange experience. I could not tell if I was in a dream, but it felt very, very real and this is the second time in the past year that this has happened and that I can remember. 

I woke up in my bed and felt like I had lost vision in both eyes completely, which is the reason why I felt it could be a dream; it was so surreal. I felt very little feeling in my arms and legs and I think I felt pins and needles. I think I laid back down on my bed as I never left it during this weird experience and kept having the same thing happen.

I'd try to open my eyes and I would see nothing. At one point, I tried to move around in bed and my vision would come back a little eventually and the pins and needles went away. I even tried to touch my floor from my bed to test it out. I tested out my speech to see if that would work, and I mumbled somethinf out loud a little (a little too loud on accident, if I should say funnily enough).

302,"This could be triggering for some people. Content of sexual abuse.

Last night I found out something I honestly never wanted to know or imagine happened. I don't know if I am overreacting or not. Here's the situation:

I come from a large family that has always been very close with minimal problems. Until last night. I (24f) was having some drinks with my brother (19m) at my place when the subject of our younger siblings came up and he started crying. I couldn't understand what was wrong until all of the sudden he blurted out that he had, in his words, molested our youngest sister when he was 9 (she is 11 now, would have been 1 at the time).

I freaked out immediately. I started breaking things in my own house and screaming at him and demanding he leave. He didn't though, he just sat there crying. I went to my room for a long time and just cried. I finally gained some composure and went out to talk to him further. 

He told me it happened only once, but she was awake and aware when it happened. He said it's been haunting him ever since and he thinks about it almost daily with guilt and regret. My first concern was if he has sexual inclinations toward children, although I understand he was a child at the time himself...but it still is a huge concern because he currently lives with our older sister who has 4 young children of her own. He swore over and over again that is not the case and he would never hurt them. None the less I understood my obligation to tell my sister and I called her first thing this morning.

This is where things get more confusing for me. My sister was extremely calm. She said it was just child curiosity and not all that uncommon among young siblings. Which I'm sure is true but it still seems like a bigger deal to me? She was upset of course but not in the way I was. She told me my own past made me react so strongly (I was molested by a sunday school teacher as a little girl) and that I need to calm down and probably go back to therapy as this is bringing up those things for me. Which I agree with but this isn't about me! Our little sister was a victim as an infant and has no idea. My mother has no idea. She insisted we don't say anything to them at all, ever. I just really don't know if I agree. She's always been the more stable between us and the one to call the shots... she says she doesn't think it's even possible our sister could or ever will remember. Could this be true? I feel like even as an infant when it happened she could have memories of this right? If not now then somewhere down the road.

I just don't know if I should tell my mother despite what my older sister thinks. My younger sister is still a child and my parents have an obligation to her to protect and help her, so they have a right to know don't they? My sister wants to just get him professional help and deal with it between the three of us. Is this the right thing to do? Will telling my parents and little sister bring up unnecessary trauma? Or should I go ahead and tell them anyway? I am so confused as I really thought my sister would be way more upset than she was... now I don't know which of us is handling this the correct way.

Thanks in advance any advice. I will admit I'm going on less than 2 hours sleep now and probably not thinking clearly so I really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and give their opinions.",10Oct2018,1

311,"This might turn out longer than I anticipated. Basically I just recently moved to a new city, and have been looking for jobs. I’m a recent college graduate, with little experience in how the job searching process goes. I found one and went through the interview process fairly quickly. The branch manager asked how many companies I’m interviewing with, and I told him this was the only one so far. The hiring recruiter has been very nice and friendly, and has been keeping me updated on the side over how I’ve been performing in the interviews (not professional I know, but it seems like she really wants me to join the company). 

After my final interview with the branch manager, as I was walking home she called me and told me I basically got the job and to expect a phone call from her with an official job offer as soon as my references come back. She also told me that I really impressed the manager, and that he told her I was the best candidate she has found him, and the best candidate he has interviewed in the last year. This all bolstered my confidence going forward. 

It took a few days for my references to come back, and I literally just got off the phone with her. This is basically how the phone all went:

Recruiter: “I wanted to be the first to extend an offer to you”

Me: “Wow, thank you so much” 

R: “is that a ‘yes thank you’, or a ‘no thank you’?”

I wasn’t expecting to have to answer right then and there, and was somewhat put on the spot. I told her I would like a few days to make my decision. She seemed put off, and maybe a little disappointed. But it was my understanding that companies usually allow you time to make your decision regarding a job offer. It didn’t seem right to just answer as soon as I officially was given the offer, even if she’d told me ahead of time. 

So my question is, should I have answered differently? Should I have accepted or rejected the offer then and there? Or is what I said okay? ",10Oct2018,1

On top of that he is saving for a house he wants to get and talks about the house plans and marriage and kids and all of that sounds nice. My family is so excited, my traditional Palestinian grandfather cried when he met my bf because he was excited to see me finally settling down. 

But Ill be honest, what makes my heart flutter.... music, hiking up a mountain trail in an unfamiliar land, learning, reading physics and history, studying the stars or walking down empty ancient preserved halls where you are breathing in history and you briefly feel like you are travelling through time. Lastly, family seeing my siblings and my mom all together laughing and yelling or even just talking to my dad and grandma on the phone for hours talking about silly theories we play in our heads. 

Every one is excited for marriage and babies and doing all of that and while that is all very nice and a nice sweet thought I feel like this isnt me.. I am on this path now and if I veer away from it I will hurt so many people I love....

1) He didn't stick up for me when his friend insulted me in front of a room filled with people. I ended up crying and he told me to get over it and ignore it. A few months later he realised his mistake and promised to stick up for me 

2) Never took me to music festivals with his other friends. Claimed it was a guy's day out but his female friends went with him. He did this around 5 times before I called him out on it and then he didn't bother inviting me 4 times after I called him out on it. A total of 9 times. I was genuinely ready to break up with him because I believed he was hiding something from me and that is why he was adamant I never went with him. It seemed suspicious. He invited me to the 10th one and I went. But I am annoyed that it had to take that long for him to realise I should go with him from time to time (not saying I should go all the time)

These are just two of the biggest fights we've had and I just feel resentment towards him when I'm not with him. When I'm with him the resentment seems to lessen or disappear. I'm aware this is very unhealthy. I hope I can find a way to forgive and forget or just let him do his thing.

There are many times where he goes out without me and I don't mind because it's usually to a club and he sometimes takes me but sometimes doesn't - that's why I didn't have a problem with it in comparison to the festival thing because that's a different environment and I felt he was hiding something from me.

We were inseparable. Lovers &amp; best friends. 6 months before we split up we had a serious car accident where we could’ve lost our lives. After that day my anxiety went through the roof. I was crippled with anxiety everywhere I went. We stopped doing things together because I was too anxious to leave the house. She started staying out most nights, all night drinking with her friends from work. I don’t think she cheated on me. She’s always been a heavy drinker. It just got worse after the accident. I lost my patience with it as my anxiety worsened. She would drink every day, sometimes starting in the afternoon. She’d wet the bed etc. Ultimately the day we broke up I was getting ready for work &amp; she started drinking gin at 2pm. I shouted down to her “are you drinking already?” She shouted back up “it’s fine babe” anyway, I came down to leave for work &amp; we had an argument about it. I went to work seriously upset because I’d had enough of her drinking. We were no longer intimate because her being drunk was a turn off. I never stopped wanting her. I just wanted her to stop. I got sent home from work &amp; I told her I thought she had a serious alcohol problem. At that moment she turned around &amp; told me she wasn’t happy anymore, that she wanted to break up. I was shocked, broken. Heartbroken. I never expected her to break up with me. After a messy break up in January we have been on/off in contact throughout the months. We have seen one another &amp; talked about everything. I’ve made it clear throughout that I wanted to work things out. Since January she has been so hot &amp; cold.

She sent me a shitty Happy Birthday GIF &amp; it ruined my day. I expected more. It upset me the whole day. Next day I asked her about a guy friend she’d been taking to Family parties (she’s a lesbian, we were a lesbian couple) I asked if he was gay &amp; she said “wtf, why does it matter if he’s gay or not” next thing I know, before I could reply, I’d been blocked.

A few hours later the conversation has shifted to, she's thinking about breaking up and just wants to do it to make it easier, we agree to try and make it work several times but she would always come back the next day saying she didn't think it would work.

Then we broke up, and about an hour or two later we decided that we would go on a break instead, we were single, but we would get back together at some point. To be fair I was pretty annoying about this as I kept trying to convince her to take me back, however about two days after the break started we were back together for all of five minutes before she decided she needed more time. As all this is happening, we're just friends but whenever she came over to my house it would be exactly like we were a couple again, kissing and hugging me and having sex ect. Over this break she basically decided that she was going to vent everything she didn't like about me, if I told her I wanted to start going to the gym or quit smoking she would tell me that she's ""not my therapist"", however she laps up this shit about one of her new guy friends depression and bipolar disorder? If talks of going to the gym ect are worthy of a therapist then what category does depression and bipolar disorder fit into? 

Yesterday, I was talking to her, and it's been about two weeks since we started the break; and she decided that she doesn't want to get back together because she feels like she would be taking a step backwards, but she's still really into me. We agree to just be friends, but I tell her if she ever wants to get back together that the doors are open. Now, after a couple hours of being friends, she starts telling me how horny she is, and how much she wants to have sex, and complimenting me on my body ect, I kind of engage her in this but not too much. Fast forward to today and she wanted to come over to my house (probably to have sex). She now complains that she is ""lonely"" whenever her new and better friends ditch her to do something else (they do this frequently), but she's always had people here for her, me especially; if she ever wanted me around I'd be over within 20 minutes of her call (clingy, I know)  so now I'm just thinking, ""I got dumped for this shit?"" this relationship lasted 10 months, and this girl has changed a lot, I want the girl I love back but don't see it happening any time soon. WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN, IF WE'RE JUST FRIENDS THEN WHY DO YOU STILL DO THE THINGS WE DID AS A COUPLE, WHY DO YOU INSIST ON APPEALING TO THESE NEW FRIENDS WHEN ALL THEY DO IS DITCH YOU.

I'm just really mad at the moment as I've kept this bottled up as any signs of being angry will just piss her off, any advice on what I should do would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: My girlfriend dumped me, then we moved onto a break, then I got dumped for good, but she still treats me as if I am her boyfriend sometimes, what do I do?

325,"Alright so here it goes. I have couple of friends in different countries because I moved around a lot. Back when social media wasn't big enough when I left the country there wouldn't be any way to contact them.

Anyway i got in touch with couple of them years  later recently. But there is something I noticed with a couple of them like some of them would never ever message me back. Like I was always the one who messaged and asked them how they were. Let me give you an example I knew a guy, we went to the same graduate school, we were done and we went back home (his town is like 12 hours drive from mine). So we got done in April 2017, I messaged him a few days later when I reached home. I would wish him on special occasions and stuff. Then I decided to test a theory, just wait and see whether he does the same and nothing for a year (no kidding). Messaged him again in April 2018 and since then I received nothing.

Like I understand that people get busy and stuff but this sounds like complete disregard. Like I have another friend of mine but he Atleast takes time out to say hi or send memes or something. Like I haven't talked to him in 2 months cause he got married and has a kid and stuff and that is cool with me. 

So what do you think? Should I just forget about the former guy? Guess we were superficial friends? ",10Oct2018,1
326,"This was so long ago and probably stupid that I still care about something that is in the past. But that's why I post here, to get an idea of what I should be doing, and by doing, how to think about it. 

I worked in retail and I got my foot in the door on an ok-ish office job. I was happy, except another guy I worked with that for some reason was being hostile towards me also joined. I think this made a very good thing into a not-so-good thing because he turned out to be very toxic and definitely spread rumours about me. 

I possibly have Aspergers or a personality disorder such as social anxiety, or possibly both that meant I'm quite socially awkward. This meant that it felt like a struggle to mix with people and I did it in the most awkward way possible which is I didn't even introduce myself to anyone and probably I made a terrible impression. But I tried from there to improve my social skills.

I don't want to ramble on too much, but I had some bad experiences whilst I worked there:

* I found myself excluded from social aspects, particularly by one person, like banter via email, even though everyone around me was included.
* For some time people were constantly making ridiculous remarks about how me being quiet meant I had some intentions of murdering my colleagues. My manager even anonymously (later I found out it was him) brought me a plastic gun as a secret santa present which I found very upsetting since it was clearly a joke intended to mock my mental health problems. I confronted him a whole year later to which he said he was sorry if he offended me.
* I suffered other bullying, such as 
   * in a team meeting one colleague announced in reply to something I said that ""that's because nobody likes you"" and everyone kind of gasped, I thought it was out of order but I was shocked and really didn't know what to say so I didn't say anything.
   * A colleague secretly took photos of me and then probably found one that didn't look flattering and posted it on Facebook.
   * My manager (a different one) made notes about a meeting where he wrote many negative points about my performance, except probably only one of those points were actually discussed and even that one he took my side in discussion.  I confronted him and he kind of watered down the notes in response and actually our working relationship seemed to improve after then as in he seemed to have my back to some extent. 

Some years after leaving, I find myself thinking about all this shit.  I imagine myself confronting the person taking photos of me in order to embarrass me or the other saying that nobody likes me and really telling them how unprofessional and immoral their behaviour is. I often imagine the grievance letter to HR I wanted to write about management bullshit but didn't. But, it's way to late to do these things, they're rather things I wish I'd done. Basically, I feel angry and I don't know how to resolve these.

One thing I read online is that actually my anger is at myself for not doing anything about it at the time and I'm projecting it at other people and I should recognise this and forgive myself.  I think before I forgive myself for not taking action is, to know what action should I have taken at the time? For example, how, in a workplace environment do you respond to someone saying that nobody likes you when actually you do feel insecure about that anyway?

329,"I know crazy, and my husband is not crazy. He rarely has an issue. Duringe even small fights, though, he doesn't fly off the handlebars, but he becomes hard to reason with. If I bring up any issue, even in an extremely polite way, he will say he is being attacked. I cannot understand how he thinks this and have told him so.

I prefer to play out an argument this way: I make point X. You respond to point X. Hopefully it gets resolved. Then we move on to point Y. He prefers to argue this way: I make point X. He mutters something that is both hard to hear and negative, then brings up the same thing he holds over my head constantly, or something I never knew he had any type of issue with. It makes it impossible to get through an issue, because I just have to defend myself.

He has one issue that he tends to go back to constantly (not like cheating or something terrible), and it makes it hard to ever bring up any issue that I have with him. 

He also likes to argue and argue with no end in sight, bringing up many issues before I can respond, and then suddenly bring up some HUGE topic for the first time and then turn away and say ""I really have to smoke,"" or walk outside.

His arguing behavior is nothing like his typical behavior, which is very respectful. I have asked him to bring up issues he has as they come up and not save them for another fight, and he agrees that he will, but he never does. I have also asked him to imagine we can read the script of our dialogue and notice what he's really saying, but that doesn't help.

I know he has real fears of disappointing people, especially me. He says things like ""What the f--- did I do wrong now?"" I don't think my way is what determines right or wrong, and I've told him this, and I don't think we have more grievances than the average couple.

332,"Well after much debate I have decided to change my major from Mechanical Engineering. I’ve been in the program for 3 years now (I’m a year behind) and I’ve finally come to the conclusion that I don’t think engineering is for me. I’ve done a lot of research in choosing my next career choice and I’ve settled on PTA. It sounds like everything I want in a career. Lots of interaction with people and tons of hands on work. Also the program is two years so I won’t be graduating any later than I would be as a mechanical engineer. 

I guess I’m making this post to get some advice. Would it be better to stick with my original plan to be an engineer even though I’m not very good at it? Or does PTA sound like a smart path to go down? I’m just really nervous that I will regret my decision or worse I won’t get into PTA school.

333,"Ok, buckle up and grab a beer, this might some time to read. Or go warp speed to the end to TL;DR.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this saturday, a girl-friend (Lets call her Nerys) invited me to a party of one of her friends. It's ok for me, i like to go party time to time, but something it's bothering me: she adviced me also take someone else; since i barely know anyone going there, only Nerys and well, her boyfriend .\_. (Nerys and i had been close friends since long time ago, i tried dating her, but failed, but we are still very close friends).

&amp;#x200B;

This shouldn't be a problem in theory; but the fact is... i barely had friends that could also like to go to that kind of party. 2 of the girl friends could like to go with me are more than 430 km away, and a 3rd one has her boyfriend and also don't like a lot this parties where she know no one. Also, i barely have male friends, one is already married and others don't like that parties (Also meaning, i have no wingman to know new girls). Also, i HATE being a bad third, and unfortunately, this had been an issue that she isn't fully aware, and it's very uncomfortable for me.  


I had considered inviting other girl i had been chatting recently (Let's call her Leeta, meet her on the gym i was once going), since we are catching up back, but she is more of hiking, so i feel better i should in any case invite her to a hike better than a crazy party, or at least the first times we go out together.

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing is: the same day, 30 Seconds to Mars will be on my city, and i like a lot this band. But to that concert i will go alone, and even the cheapest ticket will cost me like 3 times more that what i estimate i will spend going to the party. And i have already go to see them the last time they where on the city, and i also want to go other 2 concerts, that are way more expensive than they (Dreamfields and/or Deep Purple), so that's what is stopping me to make this choice either.

&amp;#x200B;

And well, the 3rd way is to stay at home to spend none, but outside of ""leveling"" on some online games, i don't feel it will be productive, mainly cause my problem is more of that i don't have a lot of friends and contacts to go out, and that's the issue i'm trying to correct for future development of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what could you advice me? Or something i should be asking maybe that i haven't considered?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I can't decide if going to a party where i could meet new people but also feel unconfortable being bad third, going to a concert that could leak more money that i want to, or staying at home and make no social progress that i'm actually needing for the future.

This year, my mother has been diagnosed with cancer, I failed college (I am currently repeating), I have lost friends and I just feel like everything is against me. I also found out that my partner of a few years cheated on me, I forgave him and we are still together.

Even though my partner cheated on me, I feel like I can depend on him. But tensions are high between us. 

I do admit that my personality has changed and I am a lot grumpier than I used to, because of circumstances but my partner doesn't seem to realise this. 

I get grumpy easily over small things and I am very emotional but I can't control this at the moment because of everything that has happened but my partner doesn't seem bothered to help me.

The latest thing, which has upset me, was that he told me he doesn't want to take me out on dates because I am too grumpy. This did really upset me because I am not intentionally grumpy, and he knows this. 

Since we have been together, he has had a fair few struggles and I have always been there for him, even when he has been aggressive. I even comforted him when I found out he cheated on me, because he was upset that I found out, even though he promised me for months nothing had happened.

But now I feel that he isn't here for me, when I need him the most.

I do have the luxury of working from home and I realize this is something many people would die for.. but I'm miserable and my productivity is garbage. 

One reason being is I completely and absolutely resent my boss. He's condescending and one of those guys that can't be wrong and everything needs to be done his way no matter how unproductive it may wind up being.

Anyway.. I'm 24 and I still live with my parents so I don't have rent to worry about, other than the health insurance the job is nothing but a paycheck and I have money saved up. 

Why I want to quit is because I want to be able to work full time on my video game. I have never had passion for a project like this and I already spend most of my day.. but a lot of my day is wasted over literally just trying to get anything done for my job. Also just the feeling of having to wake up every morning and go in the stand-up meeting just leaves me in a constant state of dread and never feel myself anymore. 

The job is honestly making me miserable and all I want to do is focus on my game. I've come so far as a programmer and I feel by the time I finish my project it'll be a better showcase of my skills than anything I'm doing now would provide.

I also can't work without medication, I take 40 mg vyvanse every day and although I know it's terrible for me, without it I lay in bed all day depressed.

358,"My GF won a trip at her job where she would be traveling to New York with 3 other co-workers and each respective significant others. She called me the day she knew they won asking me if I would be able to take that Friday off a month from now. I told her I wasn’t sure because I am fairly new at my job (6 months in) and didn’t know if I they would let me. 

Just little background of my job. I work in the medical field as an associate doctor. The main doctor has been there for 20+ years and basically acts as my boss. He is notoriously a workaholic and expects you to go above and beyond. There is another associate doctor who has been there for 5 years too. We have a very intensive schedule which is 50+ hours a week in which I mainly perform physical exams. 

Since I was asking about a month in advance, I thought we could work around it and give me that day off, but unfortunately he says he is gonna need me on Friday because we have a big event that will bring more patients  in which we might be doing more physical exams than normal. 

Now I understand all this, but the problem is that the trip is already booked and paid for and my GF is considering not going to the trip that she won because she will feel like a third wheel during the trip. She was very excited about the trip initially, that she told her friends and family but now she has to tell everyone and her co-workers that she won’t be going. 

I feel bad for her because would be missing out on a great trip and I feel it is something that could be salvaged by scheduling some patients for a later date. 

Should I be more pushy and try offer solutions? Or should I just let it go? I just want an objective perspective on the situation and see if I am being unreasonable by feeling like I shouldn’t let this opportunity pass me by and regret it. Hopefully I didn’t come up as an entitled jerk.

Thanks for the advice!

360,"Howdy,

I’ve been struggling with my job,  more specifically the hours. I’ve been at this place for around 4 months. The pay is real good, $12 an hour. I’m currently a student, so I can only realistically work Saturday and Sunday, with Friday being my main day for catching up on work, and actually relaxing a bit, should I have time. They have been working me 12-12 every Saturday, which I have no issue with. The issue is the other parts of my schedule. For the past month it has been a battle for them to schedule me correctly. Sunday’s I have church in the morning, and fellowship ends at around 11:30. Yet they are scheduling me 10 am. To the point that now HR has been messaging the management about my attendance, since I’m ~2 hours late every Sunday. Mind you I let them know every week that I’m going to be late, to the point that it’s a meme in my workplace.  This week however they finally scheduled me at noon! Which felt so good! Unfortunately I now am going to be worked on Fridays from 3-10pm. They make the schedules two weeks in advance, and I already know that it is going to be a consistent thing every week, meaning my hours are at ~24. What should I do? Should I continue to complain? Or should I just ride it out a few weeks?",10Oct2018,1

A couple years ago I went through some dramatic life changes after years of a whole lotta shit and I found myself very depressed and durring that time I found someone who I could relate to and we became very good friends, and haven't really had any problems for the past three years.

Lately I've been trying to make a conscious effort to improve my life and get myself out of this rut I've been in but my friend just plays the ""I have depression"" card as a one stop excuse to change nothing.

364,"So first off, not sure if this is personal, work related or relationship. Long time reddit lurker, but I rarely post. So bare with me.

I recently got promoted to Supervisor at my place of work and my boss, let's call her Jen. Jen decided she didn't want someone to train me, she personally wanted to do it. The training was long and grueling, but when I finished I started getting treated differently than everyone else. Not everyone likes Jen, a few hate her. But I never saw that, she is always super nice to me and constantly talks about how good I'm doing and my future at our company. Recently I started to notice a change in her demeanor. She specifically stays late to see me when I close, she texts me up until 2AM some nights talking about Greys Anatomy (we both love it). Yesterday she was asking me about my favorite type of music. 

These things can be viewed as harmless I think, I'm not sure. I'm fairly certain I can spot flirting, but I've never been in a situation like this with a superior. That being said, it doesn't make me uncomfortable, if anything I kind of want to see where this goes. How do I know for sure?

Having to choose the job I was dedicating my whole life to feels incredibly hard. I took various tests and read about the degrees and thought I was going for the right path. However I'm currently thinking on taking a different degree. I chose Civil Engineering as it had a good yearly income, demand for jobs and I liked the classes it had.

367,"Background Information: I'm working in a group with two other people for a project for school. They're both guys (I'm a guy as well). I'll be calling them Jim and Jack. We were forced to be in certain groups and couldn't pick our own group.

&amp;#x200B;

We were placed in our groups with two other people. I was in a group with ""Jim"" and ""Jack"". Jim was average and wasn't too dumb or too smart. Jack wasn't very smart and wouldn't do any work whatsoever. I'm definitely way smarter than both of them (I generally have higher level classes than them). For our project, we had three parts. The first one, we had to collaborate on a finished product. The first day, we were just getting set up. The second day, both of them are playing games on their MacBooks, while I'm the only one actually working. The third day, we finished, I did six paragraphs, Jim did two, and Jack wrote three words. There was supposed to be twelve paragraphs in total. Jim got full credit, I got full credit, and Jack got a zero.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really tell my teacher what was going on, I kind of just sugar-coated it. I said that Jack didn't write that much, but that was only after my teacher specifically asked me why it wasn't completed. For the second part, we had to write an opening statement, a closing statement, and our three arguments. We all had to do individual documents, but we were supposed to talk and work together. Both of them went straight back to playing games, even the one who got a zero. I tried to collaborate on this part but they just wouldn't. I finished mine well, Jim finished his, which was mediocre, and Jack completed two parts of his opening statement and one part of his closing statement. We didn't receive our grades yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now we're on Step 3, which is binding our argument together to create a finished product (which has to be presented). Jim decided he would do the Opening Statement, and Jack would do the closing statement. Although this is good, since I have control over most of the argument, I also have to do the most work presenting. I wasn't there during class the first day we had to do this, which was yesterday (at the time of posting). Today, I find out that they did absolutely nothing. Today was the last day to work on it in class. We have to present on Thursday, Friday, or Monday. Jim is playing games during the entire class. Jack gets in a little trouble for not having anything done. Jack finally works with me a little bit and wants to copy exactly what I said for the Closing Statement, Arguments, and most of my Opening Statement as well. He said the teacher agreed to it, and he did go up and ask him a question. I was a little skeptical, but I figured it was okay. I had already submitted and he hadn't so Jack would probably lose points if he copied exactly my words. I let him copy only the Closing Statement, and I was protective of my work, as I didn't want him to take credit for what I did. Later, the teacher started calling up all the groups to discuss the presentation, and I find out that Jack actually wasn't supposed to copy what I said and that he lied to the teacher (predictable). I then made him change the wording quite a bit, but class ended and he had changed mostly nothing. He still had one part of the Closing Statement left to finish. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly have no idea what to do. I don't want the argument to sound bad, but I also don't want Jim and Jack to take credit for all of my work. There is another class which is presenting a different view of the argument, and another group of 3 will be arguing their point of view. We have to debate against them and both classes will be watching. We will be graded on this part and we have to memorize whatever we want to say. We had no time to do that and we have already ran out of class time. I want to tell the teacher that both of them have been slacking, but Jack will probably kill me if I tell him anything. His grade in the class is already a C (which he probably deserves), and he is already starting to get mad at me because his grades for the group project aren't that good (which are his fault too). He's been in several fights before, and he could very well spring one on me, so I'm trying to be cautious of that. Either way, I don't see this ending well. Any advice is **greatly** appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** We were placed in groups of 3. My two groupmates wouldn't do any work, and are leaving me to do it all. They both just slack and play games, while I'm doing my work. My two groupmates aren't that smart, I'm significantly smarter than they are. Currently, we have done two of the three steps we need to complete, and today was the last day in class to work on step 3. We have to present on Thursday, Friday, or Monday. I haven't really told my teacher what's been happening, but rather sugar-coating it. One of my groupmates copied the part he needed to present off me, and the teacher later said he couldn't do that (he lied to me). I really want to tell the teacher what's happening, but that one groupmate who copied me has gotten in several fights, and he wouldn't be afraid to spring one on me, so I'm trying to be cautious. We still have quite a bit of work to do and I honestly have no idea what I should do.",10Oct2018,1
368,"So a few months ago my ex left me. Well he wanted to break up with me because,

1. he never felt good enough for me
2. we were long distance, thinking that we would never meet
3. he's holding me back in life
4. I can go find someone better

and we were pretty damn close, dated for around 8 months. He wanted to stay as friends but I couldn't since we were close and I really did love and care for him. I still do sadly. He ""promised"" that he would stay and that he didn't feel like he was forced to stay, but I knew that was a lie. I know I went pretty selfish, but I really couldn't stay as just friends with him. The next day he left me with a ""I'm sorry. I love you."" and deleted all his social media and blocked my number. My close friends tried to contact him but he blocked their numbers as well. I recently tried to contact him through reddit and psn but he blocked me once again. He also blocked a old friend of ours recently just for mentioning a past just a little bit. From his response he finds me and some of his old friends worthless in some way and it kinda hurts since I saved his life in a way.

369,"From the get go, if someone winces when I say something, talks angrily at me if I interrupt them doing something etc, or at least I think they're disapproving of what I say, make a ""probably shouldn't say anything, but she should shut up"" face, how do I stop getting angry instantly? I instantly think ""why don't they hide that they're angry"". But apparently it is a normal part of conversation, to at least snap a bit if you're close.

I have a sudden extreme rage come through me, and I assume a million things from every single eye movement or twitch of a muscle. About them thinking I'm weird, gross etc. And I scream a lot. And if they say ""people just do that"" I start saying a whole lot worse. Then afterwards I feel guilty which fuels my instability and it starts again.

There's a part of me that says, if I don't say something very bad then ""they've won"". Because all the rushing thoughts affect me more than a simple ""snap"" back will affect them. They usually respond with something sarcastic or a face if I just say ""don't do that"". I feel like I need revenge. And if I don't get the last word I feel an extreme kind of ""I'm that loser, and anyone can say anything to me and twist things and mess with me, that's just me"" And I can't control it.

375,"In May of this year my husband and I closed on our first home.  We bought it from my parents.  They are retired and decided it was time to downsize.  They no longer wanted the work and responsibility of owning a home.  We purchased the house from them for full market value (if it matters). 

 The problem is this:  they bought a small trailer in a retirement park just up the street from us, and now they CONSTANTLY come over.  I work from home - running 3 businesses.  Because I am home all day, they think it's ok to stop by multiple times a day.  

They have things in my garage, my large shed, in some of my closets, and basement.  Apparently when they decided to downsize, they didn't REALLY downsize.. they just left all their extra things here and decided I could just store it for them.  They are my parents and I love them very much and I've found it hard to tell them to get their stuff out.  I keep getting told that they will be getting their things soon, but soon never seems to happen.  In the meantime, they always find an excuse to stop by for this item or that item - or to put things in the basement or shed.  They come by and use my outdoor fireplace to burn their burnables whenever they want.  My dad still has all his tools in my shed and putters around in there whenever he feels like it.  They even came over this summer and planted a vegetable garden in my yard without asking like it was no big deal.

My mom constantly just walks in the house while I am working multiple times a day to bug me about basically nothing.

In short, they act like they still live here and own the place and it's to the point where I well up with rage every time I see them pull into the driveway.  Seeing my parents should elicit joy, not overwhelming anger that they won't leave me the Hell alone.

I lashed out at her today and told her ""Look I just don't want to be bothered right now. I want to be alone to work, you really need to get out and stay out because I'm at the end of my patients here.""  I saw the tears well up and she left with her voice shaking trying to act like her feelings weren't hurt, and now I feel like the world's biggest POS.

She’s the only girl working in the kitchen right now, and she’s extremely quiet and reserved. She does smile a lot though, and once you get to know her she’s pretty friendly.

She’s come to work with injuries multiple times. Once she walked in with a bleeding forehead, and apparently didn’t know it was bleeding until I asked her about it. When I asked her, she just kinda laughed it off and wouldn’t tell me. The manager asked her later, and all she said was that it didn’t happen at work. I also see small burn marks on her occasionally, but that could just be from the kitchen. 

She acts sort of nervous around people, guys in paticular. She’s the only girl in the kitchen, and she never seems comfortable around us. Other girls that worked here in the past were fine though. She also seems tired all the time. When I ask her, she says she is, and one time told me she’d only slept 2 hours a night for the past 8 days. I asked her why, she just said she had insomnia. She dodges most of my questions.

She was scheduled to leave at 8 (a ten hour shift that she didn’t complain about), but we were busy and she offered to stay until close. It was 11 pm when someone asked her what time she clocked in, and that was when I found out she’d been there for 13 hours. And then her dad called the store, and I sent her home. She’d said she let her parents know she was working late, too. Ever since then, she comes in at 10 and is scheduled until 6, but offers to stay as long as she’s needed.

380," (TLDR on bottom)  
Recently,  I got a my first job working at WM (I wanted to graduate HS first before I got into working). I thought everything was going to be  great.  Training was an amazing feeling and I was excited to be a cashier. The time comes where I finish my training and ready to shadow. I  call on Monday, person asked when I was available, and I said ""From  9-5pm"" (I had that on my application, too).  Now... I still live at home  and my parents take my siblings to school around 8am, I tried to  balance it so I have enough time to get to work  since I don't have a  car or my license yet (I'm scared of driving, still working on that) and  so it doesn't clash with trying to get the kids to school on time vs me  being on time, I live 22 minutes away from there. For 5pm, 1. I'm  trying to go to the gym and lose weight so I just feel better. My weight  causes me to get headaches often, which causes me to forget a lot,  which interferes with anything I come across. And 2. I get extremely  nervous when I see it get dark outside (It's weird, I know :/).  (This  just sounds like excuses to get off the night shift, huh?)  
After I told the manager my availability, they said in a tone that I'm not too sure it was suppose to be intimidating or not..  
""Is that all?""  
I said ""Oh..."" because I wasn't expecting that.  
They proceeded to say, ""It's just... I don't have any shifts for that time""  
I'm  not too good at things in the heat of the moment or confrontation...   so I just caved and choked on my words and let it spurt out of  
""Well do-.. Nevermind, just anytime"" which I ultimately regretted...  
First day shadowing, I was there from 3pm-11pm...  
2nd day of shadowing, 3pm-12am...  
3rd day of shadowing, 3pm-12am...  
Working  1 night shift, my anxiety shot up tremendously, I was sweating, and was  suppressing a panic/anxiety attack. I had trouble focusing, and was  quiet the whole time unless asked questions.. or the occasional asking  for the numbers of the fruit/vegetables and how to make sure I'm  efficient and fast.  
""Are you comfortable?""  
""Yes?""  
""Are you comfortable enough to be on the register?""  
(Saying no is bad.. no is bad..)  
""Ehh.."" with an unsure shake of my head.  
I  came home, I let it all out and cried, had a troubled sleep and blamed  myself for caving in. I tried to bring it up to the CSM's a couple days  later, and was given the loops. Asked them about how to change my  availability after researching shift times, got the sheet 2 days later  from one of the nice CSM's.  
I signed the sheet, gave it to personnel, built up my bravery, and asked,  
""How long does it take to get the availability thing.. changed?""  
""3 weeks""  
""Is  there any way I can get it changed sooner?"" I reluctantly added, ""I'm  getting really bad anxiety at night..."" (I mentioned before during the  interview, that I have social anxiety as that's all that I thought I  had). She told me I have to talk to the manager and the they would be  around the next day. The night rolls around and I'm a mix of frustrated,  upset with myself and hopeful for the future because I feel, since  they're really nice, they would help me.  
The next day rolls around, I  clock in, ask for the manager... they're at lunch. Since I didn't have  my login information (which I ended up realizing that I had it on the  orientation paper, but didn't know what it was) nor a locker, I asked  for those, and then the manager got off their lunch. I went in to their  office,  
""I'm here for my login- (brain fart, stumble on words) Sorry..- I mean, my numbers for the register."" Got my ID and password.  
""Oh...  and I wanted to ask you about the availability thing.. it's just- (more  stumbling) sorry, I get really bad anxiety at night, and is there a way  I can get it changed sooner?""  
""I can't guarantee you hours from  6am-6pm... (but listen) can we talk about this tomorrow? I have a lot of  work to do."" (Something around those lines of I'm busy.)  
""Okay! That's fine, thank you.""  
The  next day rolls around, I clock in, their at lunch again, and me, being  somewhat comfortable around on the register, I go up and go on one. A  couple of hours later, I see the manager come towards my aisle (there  weren't any customers) and I felt my heart race with excitement as I was  like, ""Yay she didn't forget about me!"" So I waited for them to call me  over to go to their office, something... and waited... and waited..  Well, they didn't. I felt my heart drop, I seen them scan my aisle  looking for something, a glance at me, and then left. I proceeded to see  them again 2 hours later... leaving the store...  
I get off, come home, cry and try to build up hope again...  
""Maybe  they forgot or seen that I was busy.. something.. I'll just ask again  tomorrow! I don't mind waiting the 3 weeks! I can do this! My hours look  better for next upcoming weeks too...""  
I check the Wire to see if  the request was put in at all, because it's been a couple of days, and I  heard it's suppose to take effect on the next schedule if it was put  in... I click on the availability tab on the wire under the schedule,  and there was nothing pending by me, nothing put in, nothing at all. I  decided to wait a couple more days... still nothing. I checked this  Monday... nothing. My shift was short that day. 9am-1pm. I dealt with a  very mean and rushy customer and nearly cried when I was trying to give  her the correct amount of change and there were people in line.. (I  found all of the $1, $5 bills under the $20's... I didn't want to give  her it in quarters. She told me how I was wasting everyone's time in  line, how I was wasting her time because I was sorting all the money out  from each other. I didn't want to short change her or give her too  much... or have her irritated that I gave her quarters instead of dollar  bills. (I had one person that said ""No quarters today?"" I mix up  nickels and quarters often, and I remembered that the cash register goes  from most to least, except with the 100s and 50s are sorted in the  drawer for me.) During my sorting, I was getting frustrated, confused  and just kept apologizing and rushed myself even more. She kept talking  about how there's ""no need for sorry's, no need for sorry's, you're  wasting people's time, wasting my time, look at all those people in  line, you're wasting their time"", something along those lines and I just  felt bad, because I glanced up and seen 3 people in line. I gave her  the money and she left, I was on the verge of tears already and just  held it in. The next customer in line, bless her soul, told me,  
""I don't know what she's talking about, but your doing great sweety.""  
and  I felt a lump in my throat, nearly about to cry and a crack, and said,  ""Thank you, thank you so much. Also how are you today?"" and all the  questions they taught me to ask... (Milk in a bag? Pack it heavy? Did  you want this double bagged? Eggs double bagged? Now thinking on it, I  just felt I was wasting more time for the people in line with all these  questions...)  
I came home sickly and tired, my jaw and my wisdom  tooth was hurting, I could barely eat, it hurt to talk, I obtained a  migraine, my stomach was hurting and twisting into a knot, my heart was  racing and I felt I couldn't function.. and decided then and there, I  was quitting tomorrow (which was yesterday). I didn't come into work  yesterday (they're probably mad at me..), and I tried to call them to  tell them I was quitting (no one was there to contact). Now I feel bad. I  abandoned them, my coworkers were nice, and I just left?  
I left  myself with 2 options... get some mental help/therapy/diagnosis for  anxiety and work on myself for a couple of months and return to that job  if they'll allow me to, or get another job immediately with better  hours. My dad had told me that employers don't like gaps.. and quitting  after 2-3 weeks looks bad on my part... and not to mention, if I have a  gap in between, they definitely won't like that. I don't want to end up  like my siblings, broke with children, and constantly asking my parents  for money and leeching off of them... I was proud that I got a job in  general, and it wasn't too hard... but I can't stop feeling the way I  feel. My thoughts switch from, ""You're just being a baby, you're ruining  your future already!""  
**What should I  do? Get a diagnosis and hopefully help and work on myself for a couple  of months and try to get rehired there, get a different job better  hours, or just deal with it and go back to work tomorrow, or is there  any other advice that anyone has? I'm stuck..** (I know I'm going  to get bombarded with questions from them... and that's not an option I  really want... a no call, no show is bad and I was late on accident on  Monday because I thought my shift started at 9:15am I showed up at 9 so I  bought some gum to chew the stress away, and clocked in at 9:12 and  worked longer for them.. which was probably a bad thing, I don't know  anymore.)  
I don't want to ruin my future employment now.. I was  always a hard worker in school, always on time, always on task, and  always went for the highest grade possible, and when anxiety was  present, which was with homework, sure it would stress me out to no  end.. but I still pushed through (Though, at the cost of my health.. I  always had to get my appointments rescheduled to later, or never went to  any, and getting a diagnosis was not even a question). Showing people  how I can improve and be a great student/worker and impressing them is a  good feeling... I now feel like I'm throwing my life away when it just began.   
Tldr; I got my first job a couple of weeks ago  
I got (slightly) intimidated into a night shift  
Anxiety said hi even though I thought I could tame it  
My manager doesn't seem to care, as I persisted to ask them to change my availability  
I didn't come in yesterday due to an anxiety attack

My initial after college plans fell though and was cancelled last minute. I had it on my resume, and I had to take it off due to the treatment I had from the supervisors at the end (basically ghosted after 6 weeks of meetings).

387,"Hello guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I really need help, I feel like I'm in a stupid situation right now. I started a degree in Computer Science in the Spring of 2018. Ever since that first semester, I've always felt behind. I turned in assignments but I never was caught up. Over summer I took a different version of that class but in a different language, so it was like restarting, but we still didn't reach the level I need to be at. My current Fall class is a continuation of the Spring class and I started off behind because I spent the whole first week studying to try and get into a math class.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I keep skipping classes. I do this cause I want to catch up, but of course the class moves on, and I'm still stuck. I've been to hours and hours of after class stuff with TAs and I end up getting stuck on assignments and only completing a few. I feel so shitty because I don't want to skip class but when I have work, working out, and real life stuff to do I don't feel like I have time to sit in class for almost two hours and not be working to catch up.

 Part of this stems from my procrastination, but part of it stems from the fact that I'm really trying hard to understand the concepts and really make my programs the best they can be. But sometimes I'll get stuck on something for a long time and not make as much progress as I wanted. I feel like I've come a long way, but I'm so behind, I don't know what to do. My teacher is very lenient with grading and he knows I'm in the TA's office a lot, but I feel like my attendence and few assignments completed look awful.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I withdraw from the class? Should I go to class today or try to finish the assignment due today? If anyone could give me advice, I feel super shitty right now. Thank you

395,"So this morning I wake up, and after one set of events leading to another, I exploded in a screaming rage and slammed some stuff in my house. 

My boss at my new job constantly makes new changes to my job (I work security), whether it’s a change of post at the last minute, or telling me that I have to work a mandatory overtime day on my only day off on the week. My schedule is already an inconsistent mix of 2nd and 1st shifts, with me coming in mostly afternoons, but having to work super early on Sundays which is messing up my sleep schedule. 

I’m also a personal trainer at the YMCA, which is a job I love to do more than anything but a lot of the times clients won’t show up or they’ll call out. I have this one in particular who has a history of calling out or waiting until the last minute to tell me that he’s going to be late. He didn’t return my text this morning on whether he was going to be there or not and I ended up going back to sleep, only for him to text 5 minutes beforehand that he was going to be there. I live 20 minutes away, so I had to tell him to postpone until another day. I would’ve been there if I had known for certain that he’d be there, but living that far away and only having one client that day I didn’t want to risk spending the gas. I didn’t go into my other job until 2:00 today and I didn’t want to make two trips into town for nothing. 

So between those things, and my supervisor from my security job telling me that I had to work on my only day off, I was in a bad mood and got into an argument with my mom (I still live with my parents at the moment). She started yelling at me for being mad and it just got worse from there - I screamed, slammed a small table and a plant that she had on the porch and I just stormed out.

I’ve generally had a pretty bad temper up until high school. I’m 31 now and while I’ve learned to control it for the most part, the times where I do get mad I explode - I scream and want to break any objects around me. About once a week I’ll get bad road rage and scream as loud as I can (my town has terrible traffic and messed up traffic lights). I feel like now it’s starting to be a problem, and I’m worried it’ll eventually manifest into hurting people, which is the last thing I want to do.

Does anyone else go through these rage fits? I know I have a lot of things I need to improve on personally. I still live with my parents, I’m terrible with women (almost never made it past a 1st date), and I can barely go a night alone where I don’t have at least a few drinks. My only saving graces are my friends and my gym life. I’m seriously thinking about going back to therapy once I can afford it.",10Oct2018,1
396,"A friend I have been very close with for 10 years is getting married next year. We have been friends since high-school, we went to University together, and continued to be close even after she moved to another city to live with her then boyfriend. In the past year though, we've been a little more distant - a combination of lifestyle and being a further away but still seeing each other fairly regularly. So when she got engaged and asked me to be a bridesmaid, I was looking forward to it.   


About a month after her engagement all the bridesmaids (10 of us) and the bride met up for a lunch to talk wedding details, celebrate, showers, bachelorette etc. She made us all little gifts to thank us for being her bridesmaids. During the lunch she mentioned where and when the wedding will be (in about a year). It happened to be the same weekend as my birthday and my anniversary. (My boyfriend and I have been celebrating them together and go on vacation during that time.) I've been part of a few weddings in the past and I know that most brides will plan for a bachelorette the weekend before or around there. Keeping that in mind, at the end of the lunch, as we were all getting ready to go home I mentioned to her that the weekend she had picked for her wedding will be the same weekend as my birthday (Friday) and my anniversary (Saturday) that year. I told her since it was her wedding I would obviously not plan anything that weekend but if we did get away one of the weekends before I might not be able to come to the bachelorette party. She seemed fine with it and I honestly didn't think much of it until that night when I got a bunch of messages from her, asking me if I was committed to being in her wedding party and telling me that I have to be serious about my responsibilities, as well as telling me to let her know what my plans were by the next day.   


At first I was taken aback. I didn't realize what I had said would be taken so seriously and thought there was some miscommunication. I firmly told her, that her friendship means a lot to me, that of course I wouldn't dream of missing an important day like that and that I was committed to responsibilities of a bridesmaid. Long story short she ended up messaging me the next day and telling me how uncomfortable her and her fiance felt with me being in her wedding party, because I wasn't excited enough for her and their wedding, but they still wanted me to come to the wedding. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I feel hurt, embarrassed, and uncomfortable with attending the wedding now. She sent out an email announcement that included a section for the wedding party and wrote about how everyone there were so important to her, and are exactly the right people in their lives etc. and it stung. I know she didn't mean it as a jab against me but it did feel like that. That was a couple months ago now and I did see her once. I felt awkward and like it was forced, we didn't really talk about the wedding or what happened and just caught up with each other.   


My question is: Should I suck it up and go to the wedding or decline respectfully and move on with my life? I genuinely feel like if I decline it will be a declaration of ending a friendship but I feel very uncomfortable with going. At the same time, I don't want to be the drama of her engagement by talking to her about it and potentially causing unnecessary stress for her, I understand it's a stressful time. ",10Oct2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

Except for this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I did not find out about this until today. Here's the story:

It's worth mentioning that bank accounts are set to automatically split to my mom and uncle's account when my grandfather dies and he has no real estate or land that's valuable. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Grandmother died last May, and when my mother asked why her brother was the executor on her and my father's will, she said ""Because he lives closer"".

For the last 2 years my Mom has been putting in 20-40 hours a week merging bank accounts, distributing wealth, splitting accounts, selling houses, moving my grandfather, selling all the junk in his old house, finding him a new place to live etc. She's basically been doing 99% of the work. The executor for my grandfather's will is basically going to have to do 1 hour of work because my Mom prepared everything so well. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, she was not the executor of my grandfather's will.  My Mom viewed this as disrespectful to her even though every legal website I've visited has said that it's perfectly fine to have one executor to avoid conflict. She then went to my grandfather, who gave her permission to make herself co-executor. He changed her status to co-executor. During all this (and my mom admits this was a mistake) she did not tell my uncle that she was going to change her status to co-executor. She said ""I knew he was going to be mad but I thought it was just going to blow over because the executor doesn't really do anything, and this is more of a respect thing.""However, she also made it to as opposed to both co-executors having to unanimously agree on what to do, both can do anything they choose without the other needing to agree. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is where shit hits the fan.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is visiting my grandmother to help him move at around June, and this big storm blows over and my Mom has to stop at my uncle's who lives on the way to our grandparents because she can't get home. She said that she immediately noticed he was being more distant. However, as she was going to leave, and thanking her brother. He approached her, and said that my Mom had  betrayed him, and that he doesn't want us coming this Christmas, and that we will see each other again at my grandfather's funeral. My Mom, confused, immediately breaks into tears. She asks why, Uncle says it's the co-executor situation. My mom says that the only purpose of the executor is to just press the ""go"" button on all the things she's already set up. My Uncle says ""It's time to break this charade, this is the straw that broke the Camel's back"". My mom breaks into more tears and asks to see her sister-in-law, who she dearly loves. They have about two minutes of hugging and then my Mom's sister-in-law says that my mom betrayed her brother and that she needs to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is apologizing over and over and over and over again to her brother, who she also loves. Did I forget that they also have children the same age as my sister and I? I love their entire family, and Christmas is going to be fucking brutal without them, because I won't be able to stop thinking about where I would have been the year before. Okay, anyways, my brother continues to emphasize the betrayal, and that this was all a charade and it needs to stop. My Mom is crying all the way home, and she continues to cry for about the next month, every day. I was extremely close to my cousins, and this entire announcement and isolation came out of absolutely fucking nowhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom called her brother about once a week for 3 weeks and sent emails too, all apologizing, and all asking for more of an explanation, and what she can do to make things right.

&amp;#x200B;

After the third week she got an e-mail from her sister in law, written very formally, almost like a business e-mail, asking that she does not contact them again, and that ""everything that needed to be said has been said"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my mom is even more confused and even more sad. She's become a sad depressed and borderline alcoholic mess.

&amp;#x200B;

And I didn't know why she was so sad until today.

&amp;#x200B;

I need help. Why does the co-executor mean so much to my uncle? Why is he implying that there has been some kind of long-standing ""charade""? Last Christmas, we were so close, and all so happy.

- Plowing/shoveling in the winter (which we're happy to pitch in for or do, but she gets up earlier than us, so she tends to shovel then)
- Taking the trash down on trash day (this was a new policy, we never had to move them before. Once she told us we, had zero problem doing it, or at least just moving ours. However, she insists on moving them before we can even get to it. As in, trash day is Thursday, she does it Wednesday at the crack of dawn, we would have done it Wednesday afternoon/evening.

She has been in this building for years. Much longer than we have. So she feels that she ""runs"" things. She also feels that because we're young, we're ""entitled"" and ""lazy"".

412,"Hi all,
I installed a game from Google Play and played it for around 10 minutes. I never clicked any products in the game shop to puchase for real money (in app purchases), but I have been charged $139. I can't afford to let this go, especially when I never bought anything in the first place. Like, why the hell do I want to buy game gems omg...
I reached out to Google Play and because their systems determined there was no fraudulent activity they will not refund my money. They won't take any responsibility. What can I do?",10Oct2018,1
413,"First of all, I'm sorry if this is the completely wrong sub but I don't know a better one. I already feel pretty stupid for even considering there might be something for me to worry but I still want to make sure lol

Soo, I just got this mail in broken *please insert my language* here, translation done by me, errors included and transfered to english as best as I could:

The most interesting thing that I found were videos of you masturbating.

&gt; I posted my virus on a porn website and then you installed it on your operating system.  
When you clicked ""Play"" on porn video, the trojan was downloaded on your device in this moment. After the installation, your frontcamera will take a video of you whenever you masturbare; along with that, the software will be synchronized with the selected video.

Otherwise I will send video with you're stroke to all your colleagues and friends!!!

&gt; And from now on, be more careful!  
Please only visit safe sites!  
Bye!""

I know that this is just a scam and videos of me can't exist since the first thing I did when I got my laptop was putting tape over the camera before starting it even once and don't watch porn. Normally, I'd just dismiss this mail like I dismissed the mails from my ""deceased canadian uncle who wants to make sure his $5,000,000 are in good hands"" but the mail showed my actual password and was sent by my own account (even though it landed in the spam folder) so stupid me still worries about the password lol

Also, I got the mail twice, once titled ""Your secret life"" and once ""Delete this letter after reading"". It was on the same day, once at around 1pm and once around 6pm.

Soooo, do I have to worry about this at all? Thank you very much!",10Oct2018,1
414,"We’ve been trying to move to Tacoma for about a year now. We have good friends there, like the area, and like the amount of nature around. It’s also a little more affordable than some other places we’ve looked. We’re in our first year post grad and I’ve been less financially well off than him. I’m working two jobs to try to get there, but it’s slow and steady. We were hoping to move in April. 

However, he’s been doing job interviews already that are immediate positions. I’ve told him multiple times that I won’t be ready soon, and that I don’t want him to stunt his future by waiting around for me, but he’s still jumping the gun a bit. He doesn’t have a car and only about $2,500 in savings. He was also saying that he’s interviewing for a job in Portland, where neither of us have ever been, and he just kind of expects me to be okay with moving there instead. 

I feel like he isn’t listening to my needs at all. I feel like I’ve been left out of the conversation, and that it’s become about him instead of us. We’ve been together for 5 years, and are trying to start our lives together, but the move is huge since we are from the Midwest. What do I do? How do I communicate with him in a way that helps him understand how I feel it is impractical for him to be moving so fast? It’s so frustrating and I don’t want it to ruin our relationship, but feel like it might if he doesn’t try harder to compromise with me. Am I in the wrong here?",10Oct2018,1

422,"My university has a thing called Fall break where we get Monday and Tuesday off this week. That leaves a 4-day weekend. Traditionally, the seniors usually fly to Vegas for the weekend. Me and one of my really good friends, along with a few other guys, booked our trips in July. It's going to be a very fun time. My favorite part is that we get to see the Chainsmokers on Saturday night. 

The dilemma I am having is two things: first off, I've had a lingering cold for more than a week, and secondly, I have a midterm paper I need to write. 

I've been sick since last Monday. I've been pretty damn run down, and I've missed 3/4 boxing practices because of it. I wake up really groggy with a really bad sore throat and cough throughout the day. I went to a doctor today, who prescribed it as a cold. I'm starting to get worried that I'm going to be sick over break since it hasn't gone away yet.

The other thing I am concerned about is this midterm. I am a bit behind in the class and the paper is due next Wednesday. The issue is that my schedule is this: Econ exam tomorrow at 8pm, flight to Vegas Friday at 10 am, arrive back home around 10pm on Monday. Because I am currently cramming for this Econ test, I would only have Tuesday to work on it, as it's due Wednesday at 2. 

My options are A: go to Vegas and maybe take a day off to get caught up. Or B go home rest up and study.

424,"I don't post on Reddit or usually look for outside advice on solving personal problems so apologies if this comes across as a bit disjointed.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I am a graduate student in a molecular biology course. Twice a week, we meet for a 4.5 hour lab period where we do experiments and take lecture notes. In short, the products obtained from one lab session's experiments are often used to work with in our next lab session so mistakes from one session affect future experiments. One mistake can pretty much ruin your lab grade if it's severe.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings us to my lab session yesterday. My lab partner was recovering from a surgery so I was the only member of our group present. I also have been dealing with a lot of stress lately (b/c of exams/work/interdepartmental committee obligations) and have not been getting much sleep as a result. This normally isn't a problem but excess stress + sleep deprivation sometimes triggers migraines for me, although it's usually a rare occurrence (2x a year or so). In the middle of the lab session, I felt the distinctive pre-migraine attack sensation (If you suffer from migraines, you know what I mean). The migraine hit me full force right as we transitioned to our experimental procedure. 

The procedure required a lot of arithmetic calculations, pipetting of multiple reagents of varying quantities into several different Eppendorf tubes before we place them in an incubator. In short, I am almost positive that I screwed up. My mind was in a haze and the pain was agonizing. I had to redo several calculations because I could not find where I had been writing them down. I was the last one to leave the lab today (Never happened before) and I had to cancel my afternoon obligations to lie down in my room until this morning. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel terrible about what happened in the lab. I am normally the person who anal retentively triple checks the procedures and calculations before doing anything, but yesterday I couldn't keep track of anything because of how debilitating the pain was. I was going to approach the lab instructor about mentoring me on my thesis. I want to explain that I likely made mistakes in the procedure yesterday and why this was, but I also don't want the instructor to think of me as someone who makes excuses or who relies on my lab partner to get through experiments. I need to email the instructor about an unrelated matter and I am currently thinking that I will also address this in the same email, but I wanted to get some input from an objective source before I did anything.",10Oct2018,1

The nature of my work is ongoing project work however it has no defined start and end date. Since starting, my boss has taken on a lot of work that he himself said he would complete, as time has gone on he has taken on more and more of this work with me helping out where I can. However it's become apparent now that he has taken on too much work and can not cope, as a result of this he is now asking that I take on and lead some of this work that at this point is destined to fail. 

The people directly above my boss are in my opinion unaware of what is going on as my boss is giving the look of oh all is fine nothing to worry about when in reality he is out of his depth and we will be unable to deliver on key objectives. 

I have raised these issues with my manager and he has dismissed them and told me to carry on with my work. It has been commented on by other members of the team that perhaps my boss does not listen to me and value my opinion simply seeing me as his assistant who is there to pick up work he doesn't want to do. 

Do I carry on as normal doing as much as I can on these projects that are destined to fail and be delivered late? Do I go above my boss to his manager (whom I have a good relationship with) amd raise my concerns?

No matter what I do I can seem to do anything that feels good for her. She had previously had a form of birth control removed so we hadn’t had sex in about 3 months.

This issue all came to a head after our anniversary, I had been making subtle and not-so subtle conversation on how I wanted to have sex with sexy underwear for our anniversary. (Which I had already been asking for since valentines when I got her the underwear.) I tried to make a move but apparently I said something funny and she just started laughing. 

Needless to say we didn’t have sex, and when I confronted her today about sex, she does what she always does when we talk about it, she throws up a wall. She either just tells me to leave her alone or gets mad. I have tried various different ways to try and get her to talk to me but she just says she doesn’t want to have sex. 

Please don’t think I am a pig just trying to have sex I really don’t mind have sex only occasionally and for big events and/or spontaneously. I really am trying to fix this problem in my relationship. I really do want to marry her but I also feel very scared because I can’t figure out what to do.

She bounced back quickly, even though her relationship was literally 4 years long. Mine was only a few months. 
She's still good friends with her ex, and they speak weekly. 
She moved to Chicago for a job in July and quickly made a life for herself there. I moved her in and we speak weekly. 

Problem is, she found a guy 2 mths ago. He is her Chicago-bestie's cousin. He lives in LA, and is apparently very rich (she tells me this all the time). They fly to see see eachother literally every 3 weeks. Having amazing sex. He pays for literally everything. I'd say everytime they meet, it's a $1500 expense. He's established and is some kind venture capitalist or something. She says he's a great guy and they have alot in common. 

She forgets that I'm torn after my breakup. It was very life-altering for me and I came out with no closure of any sort. I didn't even get basic-level of respect out of my relationship. I'm still trying to get a grip of things. She's been there for me, don't get me wrong. But I think she has 0 filter.

She brags about how great her relationship is, sends me pics of lingerie she is trying on, talked about his ""perfect"" penis, sent a pic of them kissing (to show me her eyeliner and contour), sends me screenshots of the cheesy texts she wakes up to (he sends them at 3am calling her ""the one"" and all kinds of cheesy things), etc. 
All of this is unsolicited. I will wake up to a pic or screenshot from her. She's always gushing.

She found pics of his exes (who look like models) and is convinced that she must be in the same league. She's been dieting on just lettuce to stay 110lbs.

450,"In a momentary lapse of judgement, I airdropped an unkind meme about someone to a few people at my school. Someone has confronted me about it over text and they're probably going to tell the principal. I didn't make the meme and wasn't the only person who sent it out. I didn't realize that it would hurt this person's feelings (people have said similar things about me and I thought it was funny) but I am definitely regretful that I did. I did not intend to hurt their feelings at all. My school is pretty strict on anti-bullying and even though the meme wouldn't usually be considered bullying (it's not really attacking the person, just making fun of their personality), this person is in student government and their family donates tons of cash to the school. So if this person wants me to be punished, I definitely will be punished. I've certainly learned my lesson. I realize that my actions were wrong and I regret them. Some of my friends no longer trust me. I never do stuff like this. I don't know what to do. I've already fucked up enough. What do you suggest I do?

TLDR: I'm probably going to get in trouble at my high school for sending out an unkind meme I didn't make. Although I thought it was funny when people said similar things about me, the subject of the meme clearly doesn't. I didn't intend to hurt them at all, and I'm sorry that I did.

452,"So, for a little back story.  My husband and I have a really good female friend, who started dating an acquaintance of ours 4 years ago.  Since then, we have been really close with them.  We traveled together, spent holidays together, and they have watched our children in the past.  The boyfriend and my husband became very close, outside of the friendship we had with them as a couple. 

The BF has been dealing with depression for a long time.  At least 3 years.  He lost his job (again) a few months ago and really spiraled.  In the last 2 months, he started acting like someone else completely.  He started lashing out at his friends for not recognizing that he was depressed and trying to help him.  My husband did reach out to him to try and talk, but it was like he didn’t even remember.  He would send my husband really mean text messages and then act like it was no big deal or blame it on his depression.  Then he would tell my husband he was a bad friend for being upset and not understanding.  This friend then sent my husband an email basically listing all the reasons he is a bad person and letting him know that he wants to end their friendship.  At this point, my husband was fine with it.  The situation had gotten really weird.  According to the girlfriend (who we are still close with) he has been getting help and medication, but he is strangely fixated on my husband being the cause of a lot of his problems.
 
Today, I told our cleaning lady to leave the front door unlocked when she left, because I was going to be home right around the time she was planning on leaving.  When I got home, I noticed a bike parked at my front gate.  I had already pulled the kids out of the car when I saw it.  I freaked out a little, thinking someone was robbing us.  I quickly tried to get the kids buckled up, when I saw him come out from our back yard.  He gave me some excuse about needing to get back something that my husband had borrowed.  I told him to call next time and I sort of just let it go.  Once I got into the house, the Adrenalin wore off an bit and I started to get really creeped out.  Then I realized that my back door was open.  I figure he was in the house when I pulled up and he panicked and tried to run out back and pretend that he wasn’t inside.  I don’t think he is violent or capable of hurting any of us, but it’s hard to tell when you are dealing with someone who has a mental illness.  Should I be more concerned? How should I handle this?  Is getting a restraining order too much?

I did call his girlfriend to let her know and she said she would talk to him about it.  She was shocked and super angry.  I also texted him to tell him that while it was good to see him, it was not okay for him to be at the house without telling me first.  ",10Oct2018,1

454,"So I live in this apartment with 2 other people who are boyfriend and girlfriend and we share a kitchen. They like to cook meals every single night and end up using a lot of dishes. They do not clean these dishes until they either need them again for the next meal or the sink is too full and there's no room for more dishes. They leave these dishes on the stove or in the sink, not rinsed or anything. When they do attempt to clean the dishes, they simply just toss them straight in the dishwasher without rinsing the extra gunk off them. Then that all sits in the dishwasher for a few days until they get a load large enough to wash. 

In the meantime, they are using the only available plates, bowls, and utensils we have in our drawers until we have none left. I have to use personal dishes just to make sure that I have something to eat with but most of the dishes they cook with are actually mine (like serving spoons, saucepans, skillets, and measuring cups/spoons). While all the dishes are sitting out for days on end, we have found a bug infestation in our kitchen. I can't cook a meal that is not dive-bombed at least 10 times by the stupid little buggers. They just hover around the sink area and have even drowned inside some of the dishes that have liquids in them. This has also led to my room having bugs since they fly around the house. I don't know what to do. They made an agreement where the boyfriend did all the maintenance work while the girlfriend cleaned but both of them aren't holding up to the agreement. I believe they have only actually cleaned a handful of times since I moved in months ago. I can't cancel my lease with them unless there is an actual risk to my health and even then, I can't bring it up because everything is in my roommates' names due to me coming in after they were already living there.

455,"Title. Please excuse my English. This is also going to be long...

Basically, my Green Toyota Camry 2002 (has 133k miles on it) is burning oil. I had a friend who is into cars take a look at it and he basically said that the engine will probably fail soon. A local mechanic pretty much said the same thing. So the engine needs to be replaced however, I would rather much sell the car or get a trade-in value for it because approx. a new engine might be $1000 plus other repairs which will add up.

(We are trying to sell the car for $7000 which seems a little unreasonable but it is w/e my mom wants)

The up-side is my mother is helping me buy a brand new car and we were looking at a 2019 Toyota Camry, Civics, or a Toyota 86. I have about $20k in cash to spend and need opinions on what car would be fun and reliable to drive for an 18 year old. I am only allowed to buy a **BRAND NEW** car, no used.

**I am looking for any reasonable car suggestions that would not make my insurance rates expensive (for reference, an 86 would make my insurance $200 a month before discounts apply although I don't know the exact discount I get).**

**Some other facts**\- I will be negotiating with the salesman on my own (**need advice on how to negotiate on new cars**).

My driving history is clean. No tickets, no nothing. My insurance (State Farm) is currently $100 a month. I am 18 years old with some insurance discounts (good student and driving courses). Unfortunately I can only drive an automatic :(

Again, I just need car suggestions and advice on how to negotiate with a salesman. Thank you!",10Oct2018,1
456,"I've been at this job for 5 months now and have f**ked up fairly regularly and they're beginning to treat me like an idiot. I've had a talking to from Mr. Boss Man about it. There are a lot of sighs in the office.

For example: I was given a list of mutual funds and told to enter them into another computer program and run a report, basically to compare one companies portfolio against ours. Share classes were not listed on the list I was given, but expense ratios were. I used to expense ratios to determine which share class was being used.

Well... Not all of the data matched up perfectly so I made some educated guesses and submitted it. Next thing you know I'm being lit up for f**king up again. Apparently I searched ""SSgA 500"" in the software to find the State Street 500 fund, and the only share class that I could find was ""N"", so I used that in the report. Apparently there WERE different share classes, but I had to search ""State Street 500"" instead of ""SSgA 500"". 

It's crap like this that happens daily and I get pretty much yelled at for it. The advisors in my office are very loud/aggressive so they put me on the spot &amp; I forget WTF I did so I cant even explain myself most of the time.

458,"About two weeks ago I made a post about the best way for me to approach this girl who sat alone at lunch in high school. Obviously, a lot of the responses were pretty similar because it wasn’t much of a difficult thing to do to begin with. But me being me always has to make the simplest things the most challenging.

The responses were pretty much: Just fucking do it or you’ll regret it. And now here we are. Or are we?

I’m not exactly sure if I lost my chance, but if anything’s for sure it’s that  I lost the easiest chance I had. So here’s what happened: Absolutely nothing. That’s right. Your boy here kept on saying I’ll do it tomorrow, and tomorrow never came. I just kept pushing it a day ahead. Until today. Today was suppose to be the day I did it. I got to lunch early, before my friends got there, and I waited for her to sit in her usual spot, which is literally like 5 feet away from where we sit. 

I’m sitting there waiting for her to come, and it is taking a bit longer than usual, but I didn’t think much of it. Soon one of my friends arrives, but he has no idea what I’m about to do. Now I am getting a bit worried that maybe she isn’t here today? But then she does come by. But this time she passes her spot, and heads over to sit with another girl. At first I was confused, but then I realized that they’re friends. I was glad that she’s no longer lonely at lunch, but also this sense of regret. Because I waited to long to do something so simple, I now have to live with the regret of a chance that I missed.

Or do I? Did I lose my chance? Is there any hope left? 

As I got up with my friends and started heading for the doors (lunch was about to end), I was walking really slow and looked back at her and we made eye contact. It was sorta awkward, but I get this weird feeling that she knows somethings up with me or something. Idk I guess I’m being delusional.

459,"Okay so I’m a senior in high school struggling from general anxiety disorder, depression, and a heap load of stress from being all of the above. I have taken French 1 in my freshman year and barely passed, I then took French 2 the following year and passed the first semester, but not the second. Just as general background information about me: I am not one to really fail academically, by no means am I saying I’m smart, I am far from it, but I have intuition and a drive to not give up. So now in my senior year (AKA my last year) I have decided to re-take French 2 and try to pass, this was a horrible decision. My French teacher at my school is horrible, and I don’t mean horrible as in I don’t like her, I mean horrible as in she (on multiple accounts) makes fun of/teases students, gives out mentally straining assignments, and is very impossible to talk to. What I’m trying to say is she is kind of the worst. Anyway she recently gave out and assignment that pushed me to the edge mentally. I promise everything that I have said is related to my question, just stick with me here. This assignment was to write an essay entirely in French, and if she even suspects you used google translate she would give an automatic fail, without redemption. It’s not the assignment alone that pushed me to the edge, it’s the assignment, robotics (a club I’m in), my family (my mom is a control freak and my dad makes me feel useless), my depression, anxiety, and I have been unable to vent my frustrations over the past year ever since my grandmother passed away, so it’s been hard, and this assignment was the icing on the cake. So (and I know I am at fault here, and I acted irresponsibly, I am at fault I know that) I used google translate for my essay, to be honest, it all kind of just happened, like I turned off mentally and just cheated. I’m not making excuses here, I’m just explaining my mindset during this time. As you might expect, my French teacher called me out, she said she was upset and wanted to talk to me. So during that period we talked. This is where I need advice because I (like a dumbass) lied to her and told her instead of using google translate, I had asked a friend/coworker (who I actually know) to go over my essay and suggest changes. At first she bought it and just told me to delete my friends suggestions and replace them with my own words. Later that night I rewrote the essay, with my own words and not google translate, turned it in, and waited till tomorrow. Today is tomorrow and my French teacher sent me a message saying: “Thank you, OP.  I'm being lenient this time because I'd like you to have a chance at passing this class.  I'm still confused, however, because I asked the other French teacher [from a different school] and said she's never had a student named ————-, like you said.” My stomach felt like it had exploded, again during the time that I had lied to her, I felt the same way I did during the time I had cheated, I just turned off. I have never done this before, and I don’t know what to do. I’m at my limit, I just need to breathe, I need to take a step back, but I can’t I’m scared not of failure but what I might do, I have had instances in the past where when I become this stressed, I do these horrible things such as thinking about killing myself, actually trying to kill myself, cut myself, etc. I don’t know what to do about my situation. I don’t want to be seen as a cheater and a liar, but I don’t want to make my situation any worse, so I’m hoping maybe someone who was/is in a similar boat could tell me how you got out. ",10Oct2018,1

I'm a programmer by trade, and during my studies one of the companies i Interned at picked me up to work for them after my graduation. I liked the company so when I graduated I started working full time for them. Back then they insisted they would lose money on me if they paid me much more than minimum wage and assured that this was normal for young/new people like me. I was actually perfectly fine with this since the company was amazing, and I loved working in my field.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of my programming background I quickly picked up our companies proprietary software and became one of the handful of people that were able to develop and most importantly implement this for our clients.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a few years now and I'm getting send solo to our clients to have meetings, implement and expand our software. Then a few weeks ago I accidentaly got send an invoice which was meant for our clients, and to my surprise our client is getting billed like 80+ bucks an hour for my services. This isn't the total cost or anything either since they are also getting billed for the software and the hours our manager ""puts in"".

Is this common practice? I understand that companies aren't charities and that they need to take some profits on each employee. but the 10 bucks i get paid to the 70+ bucks they take seems absurd to me.

I didn't realize that it would hurt this person's feelings (people have said similar things about me and I thought it was funny), and I definitely regret airdropping it. My school is pretty strict on anti-bullying and even though the meme wouldn't usually be considered bullying (it's not really attacking the person, just making fun of their personality), this person is in student government and their family donates tons of cash to the school. Also, this person is Mexican American student, and I might get accused of discrimination. If this person wants me to be punished, I definitely will be punished.

And the funny thing is that those books aren’t even remotely at the level of ap English lit, and sometimes not English at all. He once brought in a Korean book he likes which he translated himself (a bloody awful translation mind you) and forced us to read a paragraph at a time. 

Next, he is quite.......delusional. He is a unificationist, more commonly known as a moonie. The portion of class which he doesn’t spend wasting our time he wastes our time through lecturing us on unification ideology. 

When he isn’t doing either of those, he generally rambles on about himself. His topics of choice are rather inappropriate for the classroom. He tells us that he no longer feels any sexual appeal towards his wife. He told us that he once attended a funeral of a girl, and that girl’s soul “came into” him, and since that girl cheated on numerous occasions of her life, her soul pushed him into cheating on his wife. On top of that, he came in the next day and got mad at us for ignoring his “heartfelt story.”And this is just a few among a lot of different episodes

479,"\[\[Sorry for the unintended long post! A lot of this is just descriptions of the scenario at hand and this is my first time posting in this subreddit.\]\]

I started a new job last year that I really love and enjoy going to everyday. Throughout the year, I was friendly with a coworker (let's call her katie) on my team who, in her mind, thought we were true best friends. Seeing as she ate lunch with the same group I did, my middle eastern background would very occasionally come up. 

The first time she made an unsettling comment to me was about two weeks into starting this job. Upon realizing I grew up in the middle east, she said ""I'm shocked your dad actually gave you an education given where you're from."" I called her out on the spot by saying ""that's offensive,"" and the conversation swiftly took another direction.

The second time this happened, it was again in the lunch room at work. I had volunteered to be in a corporate recruiting video after the person directing it asked me to. After the filming I went to lunch and told the group what I was up to, to which Katie goes ""they only wanted you to be in it because you're brown and it makes the company look more diverse."" I immediately replied back ""I volunteered to help out with it,"" she reiterated ""no, it's because you are brown."" I told her that a comment like that is offensive and once again, the subject changed quickly.

The third time and last straw was last week, when Katie was asking me about restaurant recommendations in our area while we were standing in a common area in our department. I pointed out a particular Italian restaurant I enjoy and digressed that I had a reservation there that night to meet a friend, but the restaurant called me apologetically to let me know they accidentally double booked me with another party. I jokingly asked why it might have been that I got canceled on and not the other party, to which she responds ""they probably thought you weren't rich enough since your name is too foreign."" This time, a few of my coworkers heard the comment and one of them looked at me bewildered. This was when I snapped and immediately went to my boss to let her know what has been going on all year leading up to that incident.

My boss was bewildered and pulled in her manager for guidance, who wanted to get advice from HR on how to deal with this. Expectedly, HR wanted to be involved in the conversation with her, and the plan was to make her aware that these comments were unacceptable. If it happens again, I would have to report back to HR immediately. I believe that my managers and HR did what they could to mediate the situation and with their blessing, I also texted Katie before her meeting with HR to let her know why I've been so distant and she was extremely apologetic about everything. 

Since then, Katie has not looked me in the eye. She is obviously remorseful and a part of me feels like I overreacted by going to HR. I wonder if I had talked to her personally, if it would have solved the issue in a less dramatic way, but at the same time I have actively called her out numerous times and the fact that she completely disregarded my retaliation to her casual racism speaks even further to my anger. I've had intrusive, anxiety-induced thoughts about how all of this impacts management's perception of me in spite of my noticeably great performance at work. I guess what I'm asking is, did I overreact? Did I do the right thing? ",10Oct2018,1

I have proof of him saying these things, but I'm having second thoughts, of bringing it to a dean.

We've been friends since and she tells me I'm pretty and complains about how hard it is for her to find a girlfriend. I'm really more into men and I'm trying to make it work, I told her about how I'm coming to terms with the fact that I don't like sex and dealing with psychological issues I have. I told her how I've been going to tons of therapy, support groups and reading to get myself together enough to know what I want in a relationship and to look for it which is true although I also just don't feel that spark.

Brunette: “excuse  me”

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...yer know.’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a quick smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me doesn’t these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously)

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it like upbeat)

Me: ignored her* 

Blonde: *watching the whole thing*  “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has”

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” 

Me: *ignored again wiping the table*

Blonde: laughs and says ‘aww no leave it he’s fuming now” 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me to say ‘byyyeee’ smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

-I’m prevented from attending the school I want to go to and have been since 2013. My parents don’t want me to have student loans so they said they’ll use their benefits to help me get by without them. However they hit money issues and they’re still saying they’re going to try and make it happen.

490,"My mom is currently in her early 50's. She came to the United States about 18 years ago and has worked to maintain her 2 kids and a year, her American born kid (that would be me). According to my mom, she understand English. Maybe there's some things (really technical things) she doesn't understand, but she understands it for the most part. What makes it difficult for her is to actually respond back in English.


Then there's me. I'm 17 years old and I was born and raised in the United States. My Spanish sucks, let me just tell you that right now. And I'm going to be frank with you, my desire to learn Spanish isn't the same as somebody who's taking a bunch of Spanish courses and studying the language like it's their religion. It wasn't until I got into freshman year and took Spanish as my language focus (we need two years of a language course) that I gained at least some kind of interest to learn Spanish. This year I am taking AP Spanish, and it's not a a huge struggle for me. For the past couple of months and few years, I have gained so much more vocabulary, learned about accentuation, grammar rules, and how certain words are spelled, and I learned so much by studying myself than I did before freshman year. I don't need a Spanish - English dictionary nor do I need a translator. If I come across a word I don't know in Spanish, I can go to my Spanish dictionary app on my phone and I can read the definition in Spanish and understand what it means. 


However, that is not enough for my mom. In my perspective, what my mom wants is a professional interpreter. If I don't know how to say a word, my mom gets mad. Today my mom asked me if I could help her with a medical call. She had it on speaker so that we could both hear. They guy was talking, and there was a part that I didn't catch, so I asked him if he could repeat it, and my mom got angry because she understood the guy but I didn't. The guy was speaking in English. I just simply didn't catch what he said. After the call ended, my mum asked how the fuck I, an English speaker, didn't understand what he said but she did. She later asked me just why the fuck I haven't learned Spanish. 


I don't have the ability to tell her anything because she is an aggressive person. She is not a mother who I can tell how I truly feel without her telling me, ""¿Cómo que _____?"" ""¿Qué le pasa?"" in such an aggressive manner. I have learned Spanish. I have learned more vocabulary. I know where to put my accents. I taught myself about accentuation because my own mother never actually sat down with me at a young age to teach me accentuation. But my level of Spanish isn't enough because if I don't know how to properly translate a phrase from English to Spanish or from Spanish to English, she gets mad. She tells me constantly over and over that the reason she never properly learned English is because she spent the last 18 years working hard for her kids. 


And I'm just going to be honest, I don't want to be an interpreter cause that is basically what my mom wants. I understand she works hard to maintain me, but learning Spanish for me has just been a struggle, especially when I said before, my level of motivation isn't that much. I'm not that genuinely interested in learning the language. It simply doesn't interest me that much. However, I still have that little motivation that has allowed me to learn grammar rules, accents, orthography, etc. Today I learned what proporcionar means after reading the interpretation services paper at Walmart. 


I'm not that connected to my family that lives in Peru. I have only ever met them once, and that's it I'm an outsider in that family. I am culturally different from them. My mom and I have never been close. On top of her hoping on my ass because I don't know any Spanish, she's such a racist and aggressive person in general. I don't know how many times I heard her say today that the only thing black people can do is steal and rob. Maybe it was a couple of weeks back where she stretched her eyes back to show that Asian people can't drive because their eyes and so small. 


I've been trying to learn Spanish, but it will never be enough. I can't say jack to my mom because when I bursted out crying today after that call (cause all my emotions overwhelmed me), she was being the most aggressive I've ever seen her. I don't know what to do anymore. ",10Oct2018,1

492,"Hello! I'm 16 and have two main career paths I'm interested in. One is machine learning (and computer science in general), and the other is music production.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been making music since I was 12, and programming since I was 11. Everyday I work on something relating to both music and computer science (producing music in FL Studio and programming/studying ml), so I have no issue separating my time between them *right now*. However, I'm afraid that when I graduate (I'm a Junior right now) I'll be forced to entirely focus on one of these career paths. I would consider going for a masters in computer science (and machine learning) to be the safe route, but I honestly really enjoy making music and feel like I could do it for the rest of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid that I won't be fit enough for either of these career paths. Maybe I'm not smart enough for machine learning, maybe I'm not talented enough for music production, who knows? I have passion for both of these disciplines but I hate having to choose between them. Sometimes I convince myself that I'll even take a third option, as in getting some certifications so I can get an easy IT job and then making music alongside it, but then I won't be able to pursue machine learning and artificial intelligence as much as I'd like to. The issue with going for a masters to study machine learning is that I feel like I'll be drowning in debt by the time I graduate, and that I may not be smart enough to be able to get a job in the field. I'm very torn. Can anyone offer any advice?

At first I was attributing these feelings due to my work life (which I really hate right now but I only have to deal with it for maybe another month), but now I'm worried that this is just the type of person I'm slowly becoming. And thats whats really starting to scare me. 

Ive never really been a hateful person, maybe jealous, but now its to the point where friends, and even many of my relatives whom i used to be close with, I just don't even care to see anymore or chat with them. If im being honest I dont even want to hear about them. Its not everyone in my life, but still a sizable chunk of people. I understand thats its ok to remove some people out of your life but I think I'm taking it a little too far and I'm not sure why I feel this way. I dont *feel* depressed, but where im at in my life right now for this past year and for the next few months, I could probably say its my lowest point physically, mentally, and even successfully, if thats a thing. 

Aside from that, maybe my roommates views, who have kinda always been this way, are starting to influence my own? They're probably the only people I see or talk to regularly. I'm not sure, that one seems like a cheap excuse to play the blame game.  


Maybe I'm just getting older and wanting to spend my time more preciously, on people that I choose to spend it on? That wouldnt be such a bad optimistic way to look at it if it were reasonable.

503,"I've had the good fortune to be born and raised with two pretty chill sets of parents (they divorced while I was still young and found other partners), and only very rarely resorted to hitting/spanking as discipline when I was younger.

I ask this because earlier today I was talking to my mum over some coffee and she was telling me about our neighbors (who she'd been chatting to yesterday, welcoming them to our neighborhood), a single mother and her two boys, who are around 11 and 7, who do indeed physically discipline their kids. 

Our neighbor, who I'll refer to as Jennifer, spanks or uses a wooden spoon on her children when they've done something particularly bad. Except, according to my mum, alongside the strikes to their behind, she will also strike their testicles. Not hard enough to do any serious damage, but enough to give them a few quick shocks.

I've never heard of this from any other parents or caretakers, I personally believe it's unacceptable. I need to know if I would be doing the children good by contacting the authorities. What are the chances the kids are removed from her custody? Has anyone else been through a similar experience growing up? Is it possible that these kids could suffer long term damage or even impotency? She's a very Catholic woman, if that helps.

505,"I recently moved out of a big city and into a suburban/borderline rural place.  It's not quite the sticks or the boonies but some city slickers would think so.  The peace of mind and quiet has been absolutely amazing.  The sound of sirens, yelling and house-rumbling bass from subwoofers has been replaced by crickets, frogs and occasionally a freaking wacko outside my house saying ""neighbor, neighbor "" followed by a creepy whistle.

My first sighting of Joe was him blaring Alice In Chains, shirtless, running back and forth from his pile of firewood to a blaring bonfire, shirtless.  It was early in the evening and his house is far away that I didn't hear the music from inside my house so no big deal.   You know just some regular ol country shit.   

So a week or so passes and my girlfriend asks, ""have you met Joe?""  I explained I haven't but I saw him living it up out back.  She explains he was a bit eager to show us around the neighborhoods, the nearest fishing spots, best hiking spots, best place to take the dog, etc.  She asked Joe if she had met her boyfriend (me) and he replied ""I don't want to meet him"".  Aaaaanndd red flag number one.  So already I'm like ok this dude is a weirdo and that left a bad taste in my mouth.  

A week or so goes by and we are at the local bar having dinner and a beer.  Who is there?  You guessed it Joe.  My GF is inside getting a beer and comes out and says ""joe is in there and again he said I don't want to meet your boyfriend"".  Again I'm like what is this dudes problem.  He's creeping on my GF and is not even covert about.  He comes out two minutes later because he wants to ""bother his new neighbors"". He shakes my hand introduces himself as your crazy neighbor and sits down at the table with us.  

For the next hour, he droned on and on about stories of him getting a DUI and how his dad was in organized crime and how he was extorted by the police and on and on and on.  And I already didn't like this guy from his previous comments but I was polite and listened.  But I barely said a word in an attempt to make him uncomfortable and leave.  Yes I should of said something like ""excuse me can you give us some space"" but I didn't want to be rude.  

The fact that he never asked ""where did you move from"".  "" why did you move here"". Basically any normal get to know your neighbor questions and decided to essentially lecture us and talk at us for an hour made me want to have no association or relationship with this guy.  I mean not that I cared to tell him but at least pretend to care.  Or if you don't just leave us alone.  In that hour, someone arrived at the bar and he noted ""that guy wants to fight me"".  Also, ""everybody here knows I'm an asshole"".   I sense that this guy is a drunk and he seems a lil strung out so maybe meth or some other drug.

After a dreaded hour, I finally am like ""we need to go now"".  He insists on giving me his number and to come over anytime he's out there having a fire and BBQ with him.  I put it in my phone as ""crazy guy neighbor"" and text him so he has my number.  Mistake.  


He texts me later that night saying ""this is your girlfriends neighbor Joe.  Please Call me when you get a chance i need a favor to ask"".  This made me so angry.  What the fuck kind of title is that ""your girlfriends neighbor"".  I felt like calling him up right there and saying ""so I'm not your neighbor..  and I don't want to do you favors. I don't want to know you.  I don't want to be friends with you.  And I don't want you talking to my GF.  But alas I decided to not escalate what could be nothing and I ignored him.  

Couple days pass.  As I got home from work, my GF explained she was reading a book on the couch in the living room at 11:30 at night. I wake up early so was asleep.  Mind you it is pitch black here and dead quiet except for the crickets.  She heard Joe outside on the street about 100 ft from the house calling loudly ""neighbor neighbor.  Neighbor come out"" and then whistling.  This lasted about a minute and she felt so scared and froze up.  Hearing about this made me so angry.  I still feel rage when I see think about him doing this.  Here I wanted peace and quiet and I got fucking Robert Dinero from cape fear as a neighbor.  

My girlfriend doesn't feel safe alone in the house now and is afraid to go out back by herself.  I don't think this guy is just some harmless schmoe that we can just ignore like a small crack in the plaster of the ceiling.  This guy is a loose canon.  I suspect he's on some drugs and he's unpredictable.  

So I don't know what to do.  I was going to confront him but my GF said let's see how it plays out and if it escalates or happens again. I was going to call him and say that that was inappropriate to do.  Something tells me he doesn't understand basic logic.  I feel as if it is too soon to call the cops.  He hasn't done anything illegal.  Hopefully it will remain that way.  I'm just really angry and don't know how to approach this situation.  Any thoughts?
