0,"Yes. My ""friends"" make fun of me for not talking to them and try to study for a test (like math or science) at the same time. 

I try telling them I can't do that and I can't focus. How can I just shut them up. It's so frustrating. 

Also, they don't want to talk about the work or material being studied but just random stuff and actually talk about normal things.",14Jun2018,1

3,"I've been working a hellish job for the last year doing nights and working a lot of hours on 12-14 hour shifts. My grandmas last words to me and my brother were to 'travel while you're young' and he's been convincing me for a while to do it.

My dad gets a job in Japan- the country I always wanted to go to the most! I was planning to hand in my notice take 3 weeks off and go see japan/friend in hongkong whilst im 12 hours flight on the other side of the world. 
However my company doesnt allow more than 2 weeks.

Ive been offered a new job in a pharmacy which sounds great and the people in there seem amazing.

The only problem is I had 2 weeks holiday at the start of July and ive already booked my Japan travels which I havent told them about. 

Sorry to ask for advice but I dont really have many people in my life to ask and Im really worried.

-All three of us are in grade 10

-Me and him are a bit better than good friends but not at the best friend level

6,"I'm 22 and currently living with my parents and 26 y/o sister in between schools. I will be moving out soon with my 25 y/o gf while I attend a nearby school.

I spend 24 hours 4 days a week with my family and then on the remaining 3 days I hang out with my girlfriend. We still pop in but for the most part we hang out together/without them. She has a strict work schedule and works nights which limits our time any other day of the week.

After the 3 day hang period it always seems like my family is mad at me and my sister is not  quiet about how she feels (comments like long time no see but more aggressive in nature)

I don't know if I'm doing something wrong ? They'll make negative comments about not seeing me for 3 days even though we check in and I've even brought up that I am with them the entirety of the other 4 days. We usually even dedicate a decent chunk of 1 of the 3 days to hanging out with my family.


What should I do? Is this a problem on my part? ",14Jun2018,2
7,"I’m 17 M and almost done with my junior year of high school. In the fall, I’m going to have to start to apply for colleges and figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life, which has been really scary. 

I want to do something that helps other people, especially those less fortunate. This arises from seeing injustices in our society against minorities, etc. I wanna make good change in the world. However, I don’t know a career path/job that would best suit me? I’m not that outgoing and more introverted, but sure I could talk to people if I really needed to. ",14Jun2018,1
8,"As the title states, I am stuck in the middle of a pretty nasty divorce. That in itself is a HUGE post of it's own so I will get to the TL:DR.

When I was bearly even 18 my parents had to buy a car. They had me co-sign it because I had good credit (what?) And I got a school discount I guess. So on the registration for the car it is just me and my dad. NOT my mom.

What makes this tricky is that my mom has been paying for it with my dad. She is demanding that I sign my portion over to her but honestly, I don't know if I want to because of how vicious the whole ordeal has been. 

To make matters more complicated, they live in Washington state where there are laws on this kinda stuff.

10,"So a little background about me first, I just graduated in May with a BS in Sociology. I have been working for the past few years as a substitute teacher and as far as work experience goes it has mostly been retail/service industry type work. I plan to go back to school to get my MA in Applied Sociology but in the meantime I would like more experience in the education field.  (My long term goal is to teach undergraduate sociology) 

I applied for an Academic Dean position at a nearby school (k5-12 grade) with 0% hope that’d I’d actually score an interview. I turned out to be wrong and I have an interview for the position next week! 

However, I’ve never really gone through a serious interview so I have no idea what to expect. What are ways that I can prepare? How can I increase my chances of getting the job? Are there any academic deans on here that can offer any advice or tips for the interview? ",14Jun2018,1
11,"I have received calls nearly daily since October of last year. The calls are about purchasing a supplemental, or an extended warranty. They rattle off the make, year, and model of my car then they launch their whole spiel.
I was super nice at first, and politely asked them to take me off their call list. After 33 weeks, which is nearly 240+ days of calls.... I’m not nice anymore. I flat out say the most heinous, vile, and deeply repugnant things I can think of. So, Other than discovering I have a bottomless cesspit of an imagination, I’m so done with this. 
They never call from an out-of-state, or 800 number that may be easily identified, it’s always a local number. I’ve tried calling the numbers back in the past, but it’s always an out-of-service number. I can’t exactly not answer unknown local numbers because of my job. I absolutely must answer. 
This evening I switched it up a bit and asked the representative to get a supervisor on the line. I think I’ll continue to ask for managers, then launch my tirade. With that said, I’m curious if I’m breaking some kind of law? For instance, what if one of them took me seriously, and they think I’m actually coming to hunt them down? They’re technically initiating the harassment, but who knows, seems like a grey area. Any suggestions on figuring out where these calls are originating, so I can get them to stop, and turn them in?

12,"Soon I'll be getting Associate's Degree in General Studies. I plan on transferring to University in the Fall and to help me out financially I've been thinking about getting a second job. 

I'm torn between asking my old job to work for them a few months or finding a different second job that is more stimulating for me. 

my old job is basically factory work, it isn't the greatest thing in the world and my coworkers feel like children more than they do adults at that job.  

I currently work at a Restaurant as a cashier. I like my coworkers better at this job but I don't like being a Cashier. It doesn't make me feel like i'm 23, and I know it's not the greatest achievement ever but I feel like there's better jobs out there that suit me with  a Associate's in General Studies, one that might stimulate me in a positive way

13,"This is my first post ever lol and I don’t even know what I’m doing I’m just lost. 
I’m sorry this is long-

I signed to a modeling agency about 2 years ago and since then I’ve gotten hardly any work, but do stuff sometimes. A very famous and important agency (IMG models)  is coming to my home agency—a lot of great models have come from them. The same day they come, is the same day I start my new job, so obviously I can’t make it because my new job should be important. Also some background real fast, I just graduated with my BA in psychology and this new job uses my degree. 
My cousin and I came up with a plan that she would come into my work and say she needs me because there’s an emergency, so I’m able to get out of work and go to the agency and HOPE I get signed with IMG models. 
I told my mom about this because even though I just turned 20, I just felt like I needed to, and she yelled at me and made me feel stupid for trying to pursue what I want to do.
This new job won’t be as lenient as my old jobs, so I will not be able to request days off every time I get a modeling opportunity. 
I’m so unhappy, I don’t know why I got my degree in psychology. I did this program where I did college high school and I took a lot of psych classes so when I transferred to a university, I just kept with it because I felt like it was too late to start something new. And now I’m here, about to start this office job I don’t actually want, but am starting because it uses my degree and pays a decent amount and I need to move out. 
But all I want is to pursue modeling, but I know it’s unrealistic, it’s unreliable, and how am I supposed to pursue it when I’m working this mon-fri 9-5 job? I always said when I was younger I wouldn’t get stuck working a 9-5 job because it wasn’t what I wanted and now here I am. 
What do I do? Is it time to just give up on trying to model—my dream. I mean it’s been 2 years and I’ve hardly gotten anywhere. Is it worth it to get out of my first day of my job to hope I get signed with this agency? Should I just give up and continue with this dumb job until I retire then die? 
I always have thought I could follow my dreams and that’s always been important to me and now it doesn’t feel that way at all.
I am so stuck, stuck with this degree, stuck with this job I got, and none of it is what I want. ",14Jun2018,1
14,"I just finished my freshman year of college and didn’t really make any real friends. I mean, I did talk with people in class occasionally and I also did quite a bit of socializing at my internship with other students, but I didn’t really make any friends, just acquaintances at best I’d guess. 

Some background; I am an only child and my parents did a lot of moving when I was going through school, so I never really made any lasting friendships, and I’m pretty introverted, so I really find it hard to start social interactions with others. Basically the only reason I had a small friend group in high school was an extroverted classmate started talking with me and then introduced me to his friends. I really only have a handful of real friends that I talk to on a regular basis and can be my real self around.

I can’t express myself fully around my parents because the generation gap is pretty large and we don’t share similar interests. Plus the fact we moved a lot when I was going through school I think made me just turtle up and get shy. I basically wear a figurative mask over my real interests and personality because I really couldn’t confidently express myself as a kid.

I want make some good friends, but also, there is this girl at my internship that I have a crush on and want to ask her out, but this would be my first attempt at a relationship too, my only other experience was going on one date with my previously mentioned friend’s ex, which didn’t go well.

16,"I'm going back home for the summer after my third year of college, first at a university, the first two years i lived at home and went to a CC.

Like if i were to want to travel somewhere with friends, they want one of them to drive, not me, not with my car. So i have to sneak out or say i'm not going that far.

I get i am the least responsible of my siblings, but i'm not looking for trouble on purpose, and i haven't done anything irresponsible at home in years, in comparison i've done more stupid stuff. I probably plan on visiting my uni friends in the summer, it's about 3 hrs from home, i've never driven on my own that far and my parents don't want me to because ""i never had practice"" driving that far.

22," Ok, so basically family is sick and tired of my shit. I'm 21, unemployed, living with my mom who pays for my stuffs. I have a father but he lives in another city and never really did much (besides ""advices"") for us. I feel like I need to change my behavior and control my feelings. I'll have to bottle up everything again. My parents are conservatives, homophobes (I'm bi but never told them), sexists (that means most rules apply to me but not to my brother) and all that jazz. I don't agree with a single opinion of them but, again, I'm dependent on my mom and have to shut up. The situation is: my parents fucked me up emotionally and isolated me from the world, I kept it for myself for decades, lately I just couldn't anymore, started to show my rage. Everyone is tired of my shit now. I need food and shelter, if they kick me out I won't have anywhere to go, I have no friends at all. I'll be a starving homeless girl subjected to all sort of dangers. So, yeah, I need to behave. 
 A few hours ago, my dad was yelling at me on the phone, saying if I don't like my family or don't want them nosing my life I could just get a job and go live on my own but they wouldn't even try to help if anything goes wrong. My dad left his state and family in his early 20s and was homeless for a while. I worry the same will happen to me if I leave. Also, my dad has other children but he said he (justifiably) turned his back to them because they didn't ""appreciate"" him as a father. My mom, on the other hand, is an helicopter strict parent. She won't let me go out, she sabotaged my friendships, boyfriends (or sex) is out of the question. My mom wants to be with me 24/7, watching everything I do. The friendship thing is ""funny"" because I had only two friends and recently one of them tried to reach out to me but I ignored it cause of reasons. Now, my parents are acting like I had a shit ton of people around me and I ruined everything because I'm selfish when it was actually their fault.

 Anyway, I need to pretend everything is fine while getting my shit together. I need to bottle up my feelings and put the ""good daughter"" facade. How do I do that while I'm boiling with anger? Even better if I could just get rid of anger. And how do I get a job in this economy? I'm subscribed to r/jobs and r/resumes but still nothing. How can I make friends? How can I find a SO? How can I live by myself? How can I do the right things to build a good future for myself?",14Jun2018,1
23,"OOOooOokay gonna be as quick as upfront about this as I can without sounding too weird.

Long story short: Had some strange emotional vibes happened the past 36 hours. Not THAT superstitious and been going  through emotional support since late 2017. Never been diagnosed with a mental disorder yet possess personality disorder symptoms. Suffered from mad weird dreams on and off  since 2006. Started suffering emotionally both consciously and unconsci\-\-

(Edit: Had scitzy/obscure dreams/mental weird symptoms sinced the age of 13, so its not like I had one weird moment and decided to write this post)

You know what fuck it im just gonna get straight to the point. I'm not a religious nor majorly superstitious person but past 36 hours I been experiencing some schizoid\-related symptoms. Things such as 3 letters in the middle of the latter and former and other shit that I know doesn't make sense.   My cortisol levels are probably higher than ever before before I find myself in sheer relief when I convince myself it's June 2018.

I've also found myself excelling in tests which I am almost convinced that these tests are built to make me feel non\-retarded. I recently scored 134 on an IQ test which is considerably more than I scored from the two tests I took in the past.

I have some incredibly, almost schizophrenically intense feelings that I wanna put into action. With the exception of Wakalert and my birth control I've been completely free of medication for a few months and i'm scared my 'psychic' powers are returning. I know I'm not psychic and I know all of that is bullshit but I keep getting almost magnetically\-intense feelings to say things such as 'The three letters in the middle' and the 'I is the center, but YOU must spread the word' and all this other nonsensical bullshit and it's driving me insane. I have notions of thinking I am hiding something and I feel like I such 'spread the word' but the people I wanna spread said word to I have hurt in the past and I know they don't wanna hear from me. 

I have been tested for schizophrenia time and time again and every test comes back negative. Why am I getting these intense feelings of nonsensical drivel and how do I prevent them? I feel absolutely inclined to push these so called 'Messages' to people yet I know for a fact I would be either annoying, harassing, or just straight up be weird if I pursued said messages. 

I can't shake off that there is something incredibly wrong going on and I feel almost inclined to do whatever it takes to forward the message. But I don't know what exactly that message is. I know I am being mentally retarded and I think I am probably just convincing myself to create a scene. I just can't shake off this undeniable feeling that something isn't right

I know something isn't right yet I know these are just symptoms of schitzoidness (I know that's not a word but whatever). I am so unbelievably stuck. I feel like a messenger who's recipient refuses to listen to.  I know feeling like a prophet or whatever is a sign of schitzophrenia so why am I refused that diagnoses and why am I led to believe that I am 'normal'? It's making me feel like I should confide in psychics or witchdoctors but I don't ever, ever wanna be persuaded to contact the dead or their living relatives.

This is all happening today though, I was about to go to work chilling in our living room, when a friend(let's call her X) of my roommate(call her Y) wants to use the couch cause she feels sick. So I let her and move to the chair across the room. I'm now back on my phone browsing Reddit when another roommate(call her Z) walks in on me and asks what I'm doing, very condecendingly. I tell Z not doing anything, she looks at me and then walks off. On my way to work
I get a text from X asking if I took pictures of her, I told her no, then X's boyfriend texts me asking me "" wtf why would I do that"" I tell him I didn't but no one believes me, my life is being shattered into peices as I'm typing this in my car balling my eyes out. 

Part of the reason they don't believe me is cause I've gotten blackout drunk and done stupid shit like drinking alcohol that was there's, and I always pay shit back that I use, but that was beyond my control at that point in time because drunk me and sober me are two different people. Did a bunch of other things like apparently looking at a wall and jacking off which I don't want to believe but again, blackout.

They told me this when I went to confront the situation and am shocked no one brought it up to me until this moment.

I come from a Christian family with strong faith in God. My family or church doesn't seem to have anything against the LGBTQ+ community. I came out to my mom yesterday.

Later that night, I caught her crying in the kitchen, and I asked, ""What's wrong?"" She continued to cry, and told me she thought I was going to be normal, and marry a women, still stating she wanted me to change. I reassured her, trying to lift her spirits up.

Anyways, my one friend has horrible anxiety, anger issues, and severe insecurities. Every guy she’s dated, she has a tracker on their phone so she knows where they are and if the tracker is off, she loses her mind. Also the guys she dates are not allowed to have girls as friends. Obviously these are crazy demands and her relationships never work.

So she’s dating this guy and tells me she wants to have a baby. Of course, I tell her it’s not a good idea since they’ve only been together for 8 months and all they do is have explosive fights. Plus, she wants to be a nurse so I told her to at least finish school so she’ll be financially able to take of herself and her baby. But nope. She gets pregnant.

And they have explosive fights and moved in together. And she had an anxiety attack and tore apart her apartment.

30,"She acts so passive aggressive with me, and always seems to latch onto any wrong thing I do. I’ve always had trouble expressing myself, it’s because I’ve always been shamed for the way I feel and have felt misunderstood for all of my life. Any trouble I express (after she asks for something specific) she always replies in an annoyed and sometimes mocking voice, like she can’t believe I actually have troubles and believes that everything is all in my head. 

The thing is, I’ve taught myself to never speak to anyone about anything personal. Because all the times that I have, I never got a supportive response. It has gotten to the point where I fear expressing anything about myself because I think I will receive backlash. And this has affected many friendships and social situations. I don’t feel safe talking. Not to her or to anyone anymore. 

I just always feel like I’m doing something wrong. Whether it be from her looks or just passing comments, she’s never approving of me anymore. It really pains me because I grew up wanting to fit into this perfect picture my parents have created of me, but I can’t pretend anymore. I just feel like I’m disappointing them, always, even when I don’t do anything. I can’t pretend to be the person they want me to so badly be but I wish I was the perfect daughter they always wanted. 

It seems like I’ve always carried resentment towards them. For not paying attention, not caring enough, or not trying hard enough. I’ve been pretending to be that person they wanted me to be, but it’s so suffocating having all these conflicting feelings. I just can’t do it anymore and I feel like she hates me for it. We look like such a picture-perfect family but it feels like I’m the only person that accidentally blinked when they took the picture.

The past 4 years had been traumatic and emotional and I'm afraid I'm not very sure of anything anymore. This will be my first time ever really putting this story out there as I'm desperate for help. Buckle up, it gets cray cray...

To Preface: I had my son back in May 2013. Come November, my SO and I were having incredibly difficulty and I left him. Shortly after leaving him, I was back in my home town with my son to work on my mental health. During that time I reconnected with a very dear friend who I have known since I was 14, we'll call him Nick. Things quickly turned intimate. This entire time my SO was trying desperately for another chance. About a month later it was time for me to return to my home and back to work over 1000 miles away. During this time it had become evident that, while I loved this friend more than I think I've love anyone, we were at very different places in our lives and I thought it best to leave it at that.

Sequence of Events to date:

\-After returning home, I decided to give my ex another shot for the sake of our son. Less than a week later I find out I'm pregnant and know that it isn't his.

\-I am honest with him about this and immediately call Nick. We briefly discuss if we could make this work. Later that same night, I have another phone call with Nick where he becomes very upset that I'm uncertain about getting an abortion, eventually I agree to this.

\-The morning of the abortion I realize I can't go through with it. I respect every woman's right to choose. My choice was to continue the pregnancy with my SO reassuring me that he is with me every step regardless of paternity. A few months later we were married.

\-Nick sends me a text message after being told I didn't get the abortion calling me a coward and telling me he refuses to let me ruin his life like this. Communication with him all but stops at this point. I make the decision that I will never go after him for child support as I do believe it's unfair that men get no say in the matter, and I would never force him into her life.

\-My now husband and I continue with life and the pregnancy and planning for a new baby while raising my son. At about 8 months pregnant I get messages from Nick's new girlfriend, a woman I had never had contact with or even knew existed, calling me a slut and whore. She told me I was fucking mother of the year having sex with Nick probably while my son was crawling around his apartment (none of this is true by the way) and how disgusting I was for not even knowing who the father was and that she hoped my child was stillborn. I ignored these as I felt any contact with Nick and her would just open up unnecessary issues.

\-An astounding 2 days after my daughter is born, I receive more messages from this woman telling me how much of a slut I am, saying the most heinous things I've ever experienced. Examples ""Your bastard child will bring nothing but negativity"" ""I wish I could curb stomp you and your nasty kid"". I told my husband about the messages and advised me to just ignore them. I should also note here that while there may have been a slight question as to her paternity, I knew from the minute she was born that she belonged to Nick. Given that him and my husband are different ethnicities, it wasn't hard to figure out.

\-Nick messages me maybe a week after she was born asking simply ""is it mine?"", given the fear I had after the messages from his girlfriend and knowing how badly he didn't want her, while also being married to someone who was willing to accept her as his own, I honestly believed my reply to be in everyone's best interest and it was simply ""she will never be yours"". I am not proud of this. I denied a man from knowing he had a child in the world. I completely admit to being wrong in denying him that information.

\-Things go smoothly until I get a message from Nick when my daughter is about 9 months old. Him and his girlfriend have broken up. He's heartbroken and torn. We talk for several weeks were I openly admit that she is his daughters. He expresses interest and wants to see pictures. He wants to be in her life. I fucked up again. I felt pressure from Nick and was scared of disrupting my happy home life and of losing my child part of the time. I was a selfish bitch and ghosted him. I told myself that if he really wanted to be in her life he could go the legal route to prove so....my flimsy justification to help myself sleep at night.

\-Daughter is 11 months old. Nick and psycho ex are back together. I get more heinous messages and dead baby jokes. Apparently she went through his messages and found that he had contacted me during there split. She also has him, to which he agrees, send me a message stating that it was a mistake to contact me. As far as he's concerned his first child is yet to be born. He wants nothing to do with me or her and will never acknowledge her as his. I beg them to please stop contacting me or I will have to consider a restraining order.

\-At 16 months old, I have to deploy for seven months. My marriage has never been great. There has always been major dissatisfaction but I've pushed forward for the kids. I decide before leaving that I will divorce my husband as soon as I get back, hoping the 7 month separation would make that easier. During this time, the girlfriend messages me again. Same disgusting shit as usual. I reach out to Nick to once again remind him that the Restraining order is not a threat and something I'm absolutely willing to do. He breaks down and confides in me that she has BPD. She has put him through a living hell and he can't seem to escape. Every time he tries to leave she has a way of pulling him back in. We talk constantly for five months nearly. The entire time has been me trying to lend him strength to rid himself of this woman, admitting to my previous fuck ups, and opening the door to him knowing his child. I believe him fully committed to this. About three weeks before I am to return home and leave my husband, he ghosts me leaving me nothing but an email which basically stated: GF has been working very hard to get better. I'm giving her another chance. Daughter already has a father and I believe it's too late for me to be involved"". I was fucking devastated. I have never been so heartbroken in my entire life. I have spent the last two years of therapy trying to move past this and learn to be happy with my life as a whole, if not specifically my marriage.

\-A little over a year ago I receive more messages. The gf sends a picture of her engagement ring. She tells me her and Nick are getting married and are pregnant. This time with a child he actually wants and will love. They do indeed get married and have a baby girl 6 months ago.

\-Current date. I have stayed in contact with his family as they are very curious to know their granddaughter/niece. We even did a 23andme Ancestry test that came back with all of them as relatives, if there was any reason to doubt paternity, that wiped it away. I hear from them that he is being horrifically abused by his now wife. Both mentally/emotionally and physically as well. There is even audio evidence of her using their poor baby daughter as a weapon to say hurtful and spiteful things towards him. My heart hurts that my daughter has never met her biological father. My heart hurts even MORE that my daughter has a sister out there that she may never know. My hurt hearts for him as I will always care for and be connected to him.  Especially given that I stare into his eyes every day when I look at my daughter. A few weeks after being given this news, Nick's sister says he wants me to contact him. I reach out immediately. Over the last four months I have tried to support him in his divorce and have made baby steps (I'm still hesitant given past events) towards letting him in my daughters life. Everything seemed fine but then between yesterday and today, it all collapsed. 

Long story made semi\-long and my current predicament: He is now showing that he is wavering on whether or not he will divorce his wife. However, he still wants to be in my daughter's life. I know ultimatums are shitty but that was essentially what I gave him. If he stays married to this woman, I can not imagine any feasible way for him to be in her life in any sort of meaningful capacity. Sure, there are ways for them to still see and get to know each other without ever going near his wife. But for how long? Eventually she will want to know why she's never met her father's wife and sister's mother. There are only so many excuses you can come up with before she realizes some semblance of the truth. How badly will that devastate her that not only is there a woman out there that could feel so unjustifiably hateful towards her, but that her father can stay committed to a woman that despises his child's very existence (which she has recently reaffirmed).

I should also add that my husband is incredibly passive and has essentially left this entire decision up to me, despite me pressing him for his opinion. He has provided neither support nor push back during any of this.

Fuck me that was a lot and I am so so very sorry for the bombarding of information. I guess I should get to the question before I start rambling again:

Plain and simple, am I wrong for standing by the decision that there is no realistic way for him to be a part of her life? I truly fear this woman and what she would do should her and my daughter ever meet. I have never experienced a more abusive, hateful, and unpredictable person in my life. But would I be considered just as terrible for denying him the chance to meet and know his child? God I'm so hopelessly fucking lost. Help?",14Jun2018,0

34,"(I also posted this to/r/KindVoice but I feel like it might be better here) So I just finished my first year of college and I do not like the college that I am at right now. I am planning to transfer but the problem is I just can not decide when to. I can either transfer my second semester Sophomore year or wait until the beginning of Junior year.

This decision is all I can think about and is making my depression and anxiety worse. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. So right now I am living at home and commuting to school. I love my family and all but i have major FOMO and i feel like all of my friends are out living their lives while I am stuck at home. The main reasons why I would wait until Junior year to transfer would be that I would have time to save up money and I am waiting to get my mental health situated. I go to a doctor and therapist that I REALLY like and I am just starting to get on medication so it will be a while till I feel totally normal again. I feel like transferring in a few months will be such a big jump for me and I don't want to get to the new school and be so nervous that I just want to go back home. But at the same time I don't know if waiting an entire year will be good for me and I feel if I wait until Junior year it might be harder for me to make friends and I will be lonely when I get there. I feel like i am just wasting my life away not being able to make a decision and it is ruining my summer. I know ultimately I need to make the decision myself but I just can't seem to decide :( Any advice would be so much appreciated and thank you for reading!!",14Jun2018,0
35,"I’ve always sucked at swallowing pills. So much so that I didn’t start taking medication in pill form until 15. Before that, it either had to be liquid or I wouldn’t take it. 

Now, I’m 30 and I still struggle. I admit I have a lot of pills to take everyday (10 plus more if I happen to need Tylenol) and they’re all different sizes, but that doesn’t matter much, I struggle with my birth control pills which are tiny!

It’s easier to swallow gel pills, but currently all my pills are some level of chalkiness. 

I gag, I throw up, I’m miserable. I need to take this medication and it’s expensive when I go through extra because I’ve thrown up a pill or two. 

It was easier when I could take them with soda, but I’m reducing sugar so I only drink water. I try water with lemon to disguise some of the taste, but it’s not so much as taste as it is a mental thing and if the pill touches my throat on the way down, I gag no matter how hard I try not to.

Any advice would be fantastic! Everyday is such an anxious ordeal when it comes to pill time!",14Jun2018,1
36,"Okay, just understand I'm a very insecure person and I just found out that texting a girl on a consistant basis meant you had ""a thing"". So I've been texting this girl for well over a year now, and around December I decided to ask a mutual friend if she liked me, this girl went crazy about it. So I decide to ask her out on a date (keep in mind we are both awkward) and I end up flaking out out of pure awkwardness. Second to be date was supposed to happen sometime after Valentine's day, I asked her out again and she said ""how about sometime next week?"" So I said yeah. Every time I ask her she seems to be not enthusiastic about it. Keep in mind we are really close in text but rarely in person. Please help I keep coming to the conclusion she's just being nice and saying yes not to hurt my feelings. Btw if I didn't say I get very socially awkward when I talk to her.",14Jun2018,3
37,"So I just got a new roommate (we'll call roommate A) a couple of months ago and when he first moved in I said ""I don't want any pets here"" to which he replied ""what about a few weekends a month my dog will come over"" I said that's fine as I know this dog has a home at his parents. My parents own this townhouse and we are paying all the bills. A couple of days ago at night my roommate A's gf asked ""hey can I keep this dog here for a couple of weeks till I get my new place. Roommate A will take care of everything"" to which I replied ""Idk I'd rather not"". The next day at noon their was a dog in my roommates room. Among the obvious concerns I don't want it to shit or piss on the carpet other concerns I feel is that I'm being used and it will only get worse. I had barely half a day to think about most of which I slept. 

I've had other problems with animals in my past my ex gf brought in two cats and a dog as to which I first said ""they are not my responsibility"". Before she left me she was able to get rid of the dog but not the cats. I was stuck with the cats for half a year before I was able to get rid of them (keep in mind she left me so I was sole caretaker). 

So with all that said I told her I don't want it in here. To which she called me feminine and irrational to not let her keep her dog here. Another thing she said was roommate A and my other roommate (roommate B) don't care. The other point she made was ""my bf paid rent so it's not yours to say"" to which I  said ""Yes it is his room and his rights to be here. Not another dog and you (as she stays over alot). As I previously said ""I don't want any pets"" especially for two weeks. As the previous concerns stated the one about being used, I feel like she might think their are doors open that aren't. Like ""oo hey can I keep her here for another week"" or she ends up leaving that apartment and the dog stays there. This is my place as I will be obtaining the lease soon. I don't care about being a dick, but this is my place and I don't want any pets here. Should I feel guilty and do I have the right to kick the dog out? ",14Jun2018,1
38,"I just fucking hate them so much. I hate the ones who look down on me, I hate the ones that are nice to me, I hate the ones that are mean to me. I don't know what the fuck is my problem. I sometimes get sick to my stomach when trying to be friendly IRL but not online for some reason. If I dont fix this I'm going to be alone forever what should I do?",14Jun2018,1
39,"I’ve been cat sitting for my friend for about a year and a half now. His family is, uh, well off so he’s constantly going on last minute international trips. He doesn’t really do much of anything in terms of working a job or anything. He isn’t “all there” mentally and that’s as much information as I’ll give in terms of his situation. You get the picture, hopefully.

Every time I visit his apartment, it’s trashed. Like, really really trashed. I feel like I have a layer of guck all over me every time I leave. It’s his life and he can do what he wants, but I’m concerned about his cat. 

To give you an idea of why I’m asking advice, when I walked into his apartment today there was:
- an open pizza box on the couch with day’s old pizza. A bag with a bottle of soda was next to it, *stuck* to the couch by... something, I wouldn’t check.
- an open lid on an unflushed and used toilet
- molding leftovers crusted on the table 
- molding leftovers crusted on the floor and practically every surface 
- crumbs and weird knick knacks on every surface, many big enough for a curious cat to choke on
- molding, unwashed plates within the sink
- molding wet cat food container, open in the cat’s feeding area
- dry food bowl with molding wet food under the layer of dry food
- no water bowl
- unclean litter box, missing any signs of urine 
- no wet food at all left in the apartment, only a small amount of dry food left in the bag. 

This is very clearly not suitable living conditions for a cat and it seems like it just gets worse and worse each time I come over. He was talking about getting KITTENS a few weeks ago and laughed at my attempts to tell him that his apartment is full of choking hazards. Thankfully, he never followed through because shelters have to do a walk-through of your apartment lol

I don’t know how to handle this. I can’t call animal services or just outright rehome her before he gets back because I’d have no idea how to deal with that aftermath. And legally, I’m not sure how I’d defend myself if he were to use his money to sue me for taking his cat, if that’s possible.

What would you do in this situation? I’m making this post before talking to him because I’m hoping someone here could help give me insight on the best way to approach this.

43,"I turn 29 in two days.

When I was seventeen, I was rushed to a doctor after I had hydronephrosis discovered. My doctor looked at my mom, told her that he will bring a nurse in to ask me questions about myself that many ""teenagers would be afraid to answer truthfully"" in front of a parent. She was so scared during that time that she left thinking the nurse came in. A few minutes later, he raped me.

I left thinking it did not happen. I felt disgusting, ashamed, sad, guilty....I kept replaying it in my head and telling myself I was just being dramatic and it was part of the medical procedure.

Ten years later, I tell my parents. They were shocked. I told my husband. He was shocked. I was finally formally diagnosed with PTSD, nearly twelve years later after the event.

I called the medical board to report him--I was called a liar. Several associations he worked with have blocked me from contacting him. The university hospital he works at has ignored me or hung up on me whenever I try to contact anyone to PLEASE look into his practice as I do not know if I was the only one or if other teenagers or young children have been victimized.

I have spoken to lawyers, the police....everyone and nothing has been done or could be done. What can I do? What do I do to make this anger and sadness go away? Therapy has been too intense or ends up with me heavily medicated. I really feel like I need outsider advice.

50,"My dog is my emotional support animal and at the school I'm going to we can bring the ESAs with us to live in the dorms, I've basically gotten all the paperwork done with and I've even met with the disability services at the school to discuss the situation, I was 100% sure I was going to bring my ESA with me, however I'm not so sure anymore because he's getting old, and I don't know how happy he'd be in a small dorm for several hours in the day. I'd walk him at least 2-3 times a day, and play with him a ton, but typically he sleeps most of the day (as he is getting old and doesn't love 'fetch' or those kinds of activities) he's more of a cat than a dog, and he's quite small too. However, I'll be living in NYC and I'd need to walk him a couple blocks everyday to get to the park near my dorms and I feel like it would tire him out to do it a couple times a day. At this point I think I should leave him at home but since he IS my ESA it's giving me a lot of anxiety and making me quite depressed thinking about living away from him.

I just want him to be comfortable and not have to live in a small dorm. How should I go about telling my psychiatrist and college I think I don't want him to live with me anymore ?

56,"I was brought up very religious and have had some weird experiences myself. However in my most recent years i have started to realize more and more that religion, spirituality, and life after death may all be complete non sense. And it really fucking scares me.

I've had some super natural experiences. When I was under 10 I got trapped underwater. And as I was losing oxygen I saw a pinpoint of white light getting closer and closer. My brother soon found me and pulled me out of the water. But I never died. I have no choice but to conclude that this was from a loss of oxygen to my brain.

I have read hundreds of near death experiences. These things can all be scientifically explained. I had a dream premonition. It was intense and surreal. But I soon learned that it could be easily explained by science since our brain can create false memories.

Deep down I feel like after I die i will cease to exist. Spirits, souls, life after death, it's not real. We are just like the trees and the insects and the animals. I have one shot at life and living. There is nothing spiritual protecting me. I can die at any time. And when I do die. That's it. I am dead. 100% dead.

62,"Hi everyone, any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you in advance!

I am subleasing an apartment in the south to attend summer school. When I subleased, I was informed that the other roommates would be moving out and would also be getting people to sublease. This didn't happen, so I'm already the odd one out in this apartment. I moved in at the beginning of May and am supposed to stay until the end of July, where temperatures have been reaching the mid 90's on a consistent basis.

My roommates and I haven't been able to agree on the AC temperature, or state. They want it off completely while I am more comfortable when it is a little cooler at like 70. I have tried compromising by suggesting we leave it at 75, but they still want to turn it off, especially at night. I have tried everything I can think of, I have multiple fans going in my room, I have asked them if they would be willing to do anything else, like close the vents in their rooms, but they are unwilling to try anything or even answer me. I don't necessarily want to raise the temperature any more or agree to turn it off at night (it stays warm pretty late), since I feel like I have done a lot to compromise. I also have things that are starting to melt because of the heat. It seems like I have no say since it is a 2 against 1 situation.

There have been other issues involving their cleanliness, and I am uncomfortable addressing them because confrontations have turned hostile.

What can I do? Is there anything I can do besides suffer in the heat? How bad would it be if I moved out early (even if I paid the remainder of the rent)?",14Jun2018,1
63,"Hi everyone, this is my first post and nervous to share but I'll try to keep it short. I would love to see the opinion of anybody else who takes these. 

I have been dealing with general anxiety for several years now that seems to always mostly relate to my health and the number of things that could be wrong or that can go wrong with me. The most common recently seems to be the fear regarding my heart. My resting heart rate is usually anywhere from 74/86 and during the day it could be 90/96, at work it usually goes to around 108/111 but the highest I've recorded is 121. How much lower could it potentially go under the medication?

I had an ECG last week and a number of blood tests that all came back okay, except my heart rate at the time was 120 due to my anxiety, and as a result I believe my cortisol and blood pressure were also higher, my doctor has prescribed me with 80mg propanolol to be taken once a day to keep my heart and blood pressure low, but I have yet to take them as I am scared that it could lower my heart rate too much or induce other worrying side effects. I know it is ironic that this medication that is supposed to help my anxiety is making me moreso... I have a physical job, working fruit and vegetables in a retail store, and I wonder how that might effect my energy if at all. I have asked my doctor a load of questions but I feel the best answers can only come from the people who use them.

Anyway I would appreciate any experiences you guys can share that could help me take the last big step in finally taking these things. Sorry if this dragged on but thank you for your help.",14Jun2018,1

However, no one approaches me anywhere I go and if I strike up conversation with someone (say, at the gym) they do not continue it once my original remark has been answer and the conversation has died down.

67,"I have a quick question, and I need some advice too.

You see, I was taking a professional online test to see if I might have an eating disorder. A lot of questions were indicating obesity and the fear of gaining weight. 

My question is- can a skinny person technically still have an eating disorder regarding overeating? And if so, how do I stop myself?

I’m a little underweight for my age. I’ve always been very slim and I’m to the point where I can count my own ribs by looking at them. 


That’s very odd to me though, because I excessively overeat all the time, every day. I eat when I’m bored. I eat when I’m stressed. I eat when I’m nervous. I’m always eating unless I’m out with my friends, which is rare.

At first my family hid the snack foods around the house. It didn’t stop me though, I could easily find them and take them to my room and eat my feelings away. It’s gotten to the point where my family bought a chest and locked up all the snack foods in my basement so I couldn’t eat them. Sadly, I’d found the combo for the lock written on a piece of paper in my parents room. 

So I eat A LOT- in fact as I’m writing this I’m eating chips. 

How do I stop myself?",14Jun2018,2

My mom is being charged with vehicular manslaughter and some other stuff. The maximum sentence she could get is 6 years.

I have since moved in and as of yesterday been legally adopted by my godparents. They are amazing and lovely. I am doing as well as someone could be. 

Everyone at school found out about a month ago when an article came out with her name. Nobody blames me and everyone is nice. I stopped doing homework but my teachers still put it in as full credit which is nice.

I am very sad all the time and struggle to do anything. My mom has posted bail so she was able to attend my brother's graduation last week. She won't get to go to mine next year. It's really unfair. I want her to see my graduate but she will most likely be in jail.

This prompted me to eventually try to ask her on Snapchat what was up. To which I found out she blocked me on Snapchat AND Facebook which I never had her added on.

Do I bother trying to fix this or just forget about it and wave off the girl as a cunt who wouldn’t try to tell me the problem and fix it?

I go to school (College) M,T,W, at 10:15-12:15 and work Wednesday 2-9pm, and Thursday-Sunday I work 10am-8pm. I pay monthly expenses at $400/month for repaying my past college debt, I pay for my car insurance at $116/month, my gas (varies so no number), and I'm slowly trying to save my money for a place to live. 

Three years ago I was able to buy my own car, pay the insurance and everything that goes with it, yet my parents decided to gift me a vehicle to take with me to school. However, they told me I'm unable to take it places they don't agree with: out of state, out at late hours, out on road trips when I had time, things like that. They basically left me with a vehicle that I can only take to and from work and only to school. Outside of that they told me they would report it stolen. They installed a tracker on it to see where I am at all times.

When I was 17 I bought my first computer to use for a portion of my hobbies, and also my schooling. I was approaching my college classes and I was going to start an engineering/programming degree. Obviously if you are familiar with these things, a computer is very resourceful to use. I bought one after working at my job for about 6 months. However, my family members freaked out about it saying they didn't give me permission to buy said computer, or to spend my own money. They then took the computer and I have not seen it in almost two years (I ask about it, they respond ""in a safe place, you'll get it back when you do _____"") and they continually add onto the list of things I need to do. They then went out of their way and bought a laptop thinking that I could use that for school. (I can't. Tbh it was a complete piece of junk that can't even run simple 3d modeling programs I need for school). 

I am a gamer. I will admit that I played casual games on it when I had some little free time. They hated every aspect of video games, even stating that ""it was made by the devil, and I wish it was never invented"". I played video games with my real-life friends and coworkers, up until they took the computer.

Now, I'm trying my best to move out of the house I live in, and out from under my parents. I don't know what to do at this point. Almost ALL of my money goes towards school and those financial responsibilities listed above. I'm at a crossroads and I'm just trying to get control of  my own life. I can't use my own pc, I have very little privacy, and I can't do anything I'd like because it's not ""house rules"". Please help ",14Jun2018,1

I understand you may think this is a symptom of mental illness and I sure would not blame you. But PUTTING that aside, is this possible for someone to do?

I logged out of Icloud, factory reset my phone.. and I don't even know how one could do this sort of thing for an ipod CLASSIC. I searched for malware and spyware on my computer. Nothing is helping. What sort of advanced technique could someone do?

A year or so ago I bought an LG phone when I signed up for project fi. In a few months the phone died. In emails with Google they decided if I send back my phone. They will refund my ""original form of payment"". I told them the account was closed and to send it to my new account. The rep said that was fine. 

I sent back the phone, they received it. They said they credited back to ""original form of payment"". Once again I told them that its a closed account and I had already explained in earlier emails. They said to take it up with my bank and google reps were rude ,curt,  and the matter was closed as far as they were concerned. 

I went to my old bank and they said funds would bounce back the account is closed and they can't do anything the account is closed. The bank PNC will do nothing it's not their problem is the attitude I got talking to several reps/managers.

At the time last year after getting no where with google or my old bank I decided to let it go because it was stressing me out too much.

Then the other day I got to thinking about it out of the blue and it started bugging me. If I stole $300 from google or robbed a bank. My ass would be in jail, but they do it and its all fun and games..

I just finished freshman year of high school. I’m 15 and already have a job at a grocery store, which I got when I was 14, and since it is summer I’ve been working a lot more. 

If I’m not working I would be at home on my computer, which 75% was paid by me, with the rest being Christmas/birthday gifts. 

My parents said during the summer, 8:30 AM is the latest we can sleep and 9:30 PM is the latest we can stay up. The reasoning was that since my parents work from home, they don’t want us up late. 

When I asked what that event meant, my dad said that he can’t go to sleep until I’m asleep, so he wants me in bed by 10. 

This might just be petty or whatever but I just feel like it’s a little unfair. I go to sleep way earlier in the school year, and if I’m working I’m in bed around 9. I don’t think I should be forced to go to bed that early in the summer.

81,"Background:
My lifelong best friend, who I share an apartment with has been experiencing what has amounted to extreme depression for the past few years. He was our high school's valedictorian, and was accepted into our college's honors program. He was captain of our soccer team, and was a very handsome guy. He's since put on roughly 40-50 lbs of fat, and almost failed out of college. We are now juniors in college (Both 20 year old males). My friend has come out as gay to myself and a select few close friends of his. This is a contributor to his depression, but not the sole purpose. Everyone loves the kid, yet he always thinks people are against him and talk negatively about him. Every time we go out to parties or drinking with our friends, he ends up leaving hours before everyone else, often having extreme fits of rage, screaming and heavy crying. It reached a point where I looked for any excuse I could to avoid drinking with him. 

The incident: 
One night, after drinking with a female friend of his, he became very upset (like usual) except this time things went out of our control. He began to punch walls as hard as he could and break things in our apartment. I kept my distance and tried to continue studying (this was a weeknight and we all had class in the morning). His friend came out and said she was worried, as he had locked the door and said he was taking pills. After his door was unlocked, we found that he had consumed an extremely large amount of amitriptyline (what doctors later told us was approximately 25-30) and had drank almost half a bottle of dayquil. This was on top of the 8-10 shots of vodka he had taken. At this point we dragged him out of the apartment and took him to the emergency room, where they had to sedate him and work to keep him alive. We had saved his life. Doctors said if we waited 15 more minutes, he would have died. We found a handwritten suicide note back at the apartment. After a few days of recovery he was feeling okay, and sent to a mental institution for about a week. He was then cleared to return back to school.

Now:
He seemed more mentally stable for a while, but that slowly came to an end. He meets with a therapist on a regular basis, but doesn't take these sessions seriously, and often lies to the therapist. My friend now continues to abuse drugs and alcohol. He purchased a fake ID, and buys alcohol almost daily. He drinks to the point of being almost blackout drunk every night. He goes into work high everyday and even admitted going into work while drunk. Also, he has begun to abuse other prescription drugs. He has stolen his father's prescribed Oxycodone and takes those sometimes. While dogsitting for a family friend, he stole xanax that were prescribed to the dog, and took those pills as well. 

Overall: 
My friend has just been going downhill for the past few years. Just seeing him fills be with anxiety, as I am afraid of what he can say or do. I do not want to live with him anymore because of this, but I fear things could get even worse if I tell him about this. I've always been one of the happiest, and most positive people I know, but to be completely honest, this entire situation with him has changed that a little bit. I want him to quit abusing drugs and alcohol, and begin a journey to better mental health, but frankly, I'm just not sure that there's anything I can say or do without pissing him off, and sending him on an even steeper downward spiral. Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.",14Jun2018,4

84,"My father (59) has various stories he tells about family events. As my mother and I are cleaning out his parents (my grandparents) bedroom we are finding evidence which heavily change the stories my father tells. My grandparents are both gone and my parents are slowly renovating their home to move into. 

The stories which my father talks about are stuff which happen from age 10-18. Today we (mom and I) found papers which detail how they settled my great grandmother's estate. My dad was 10 at the time, he tells how an uncle wanted money and it was horrible to settle the estate and that it was unevenly distributed. In reality, each sibling got a share of property and money and did what they wanted with that share.

Other stories which are wrong, my dad had a cousin (other side of the family) which was a convicted drug dealer. Due to a shared piece of property, the cops were watching my grandparents house due to cousins actions. Dad tells stories of how that split the family because it pushed sibling on sibling and there was NC between the family for years. In reality, we found letters from aunt (mother of cousin) appologizing for her sons behavior and what was going on.

Summary: My dad often rants about various chapters in his childhood and teen years. Mom and I are finding evidence which slightly changes the stories a bit, and are the missing pieces of the story. Dad has no clue about these letters or documents that exist. 

Should mom and I open this can of worms and show him or should we leave him be with his memories? Almost all the people involved are dead so it would change his memories of those who are gone.",14Jun2018,2
85,"For the last year or two my mother has been showing signs of depression and slowly isolating herself. Despite being very close to family, my mother will not talk with any of our extended family (via Facetime, phone calls, or even messaging) by ignoring the messages or refusing to speak. My father simply tells them that everything is fine and makes excuses to downplay any possible problems. This all started when my parents had a falling out with their old friend group over something that they will not share with me. Because of the drama, they decided to leave the group and everything seemed to be fine. After a while, my mother stopped associating with her friends, which eventually spread to not speaking with any family. Note that most of my family lives abroad, so outside of their friends, my parents only have my older sister and I to talk to. My parents are Indian and a bit traditional in terms of beliefs, values and maintaining family image, so they would never talk to us about any serious issues, ask, let alone listen to any advice that my sister or I would propose. Though a bit troubling, everyone just kept pushing through. Recently, little over two months ago there was a drastic change in my mom. She stopped talking for days or weeks at a time and started fasting (no food or water). At first, we all thought that it was some kind of ritual or custom, but she kept bargaining that she would eat the next day or week only to extend her ‘fast’ with no clear end date. My mom would wake up, hole herself in her room and sit on the ground in complete darkness refusing to talk, eat, or even leave her room. She does not even bother to maintain her well\-being at this point. I can hear her stomach growl, but she refuses any food or beverages we offer. She complains of being tired but won't sleep until a fixed time at night and repeats the process the next day. When the hunger seems to have reached a max she would request limeade or a small bowl of porridge, only to have bouts of anger to anyone that would interact with her and regret eating or drinking anything and complain of stomach pains. If at anytime we would ask her questions she would nod her head or write something down or simply ignore us. As of recently she stopped even the barest amount of communication and is more prone to drastic mood wings until she is left alone. 

My sister and I are on the same page, begging her for months about getting help, but she refuses and my father has just started to come around to the idea, but at this point even if we do seek treatment I am concerned about my mom’s compliance. The only other option really is to fly her to India and have her be surrounded with her family, if we can manage to get her to do that. We only really have the summer to start the process of fixing this problem (because I'm leaving for college, my dad and sister have work during the days so she is by herself) and I'm not quite sure where to go from here. Or even where to start...

The manager’s weren’t happy about the fact she went over there head and nobody seemed to know about it, she had just took it upon herself to contact them and put the sign up. We usually kind of get together as a section and make decisions like that, especially when it has the potential to cause a disruption. Now to the serious stuff: She was out yesterday attending the funeral and I believe when she got in this morning she got in trouble and they made her take the signs down because the signs weren’t there and the door was open when I got there. All day she was bringing things out of her cube and putting them where people bring things to give away, like our community spot where you being things for people to take if they want them, usually it’s just a little bit of junk but today there was a lot of stuff there, all from her.

Is this something I should bring up to my manager? My coworker and I decided to wait and see how she is tomorrow before we go to management about it.

95,"So I recently finished my master’s degree and the company I was doing my internship with offered me a full time position in something related to my masters but is not it. Also, they gave me a low salary (15k below market), despite all of my negotiation efforts. I accepted it because at the time I did not have any other offers and I was getting nervous. This company that I currently work for is in the financial industry and there is not much innovation being done there, which is what I really like, but apparently you can climb the ladder fast.
Two weeks after I accepted it, I got an offer from a car manufacturer for a six figures salary, for something that is sort of like a dream job to me. I say ‘sort of’ because the job sounds really amazing but I have never actually done anything like that before so I do not know if I am going to love it or hate it, but they are obviously innovating every day and its more my thing. 
Now, you would say this is a pretty straight forward decision but here are the problems:
1) The new job is in the north of US and I live in Florida. I would have to move and leave behind many things like my group of friends and familiarity. 
2) I have been in a serious relationship for 3 years now. He cant move because his clients are here and his sons are here (they are not my children btw). Now this is where it gets tricky, I love him very much, I haven’t had this kind of connection with anyone before or a relationship like this, so I told him I would stay if he wanted to have a family with me. (Having a family is above my career in my priority’s list). To what he replied that he PROBABLY does not want anymore kids because he is 55 years old and he wont be able to retire, and what does the kid is going to think about having a dad that old etc.... Then other days he comes home saying that he has been reading about having a kid at this age and all the pros and cons etc... 
so he is obviously thinking about it but this is not the kind of thing you can ‘push’ on someone.
(Im 30 yo.... in case you are wondering) 

There are other problems in the relationship too, that are way too long to write about and im sure you are about to quit reading... congrats for making it this far btw. 

So im inclined to taking the job, the thing is that it really scares me to be alone in a city all over again (i moved here alone 10 years ago), and I am even more scared of breaking up with him and start to date again... (i had some horrible experiences).

So, fellow redditor, what are your thoughts about this? What should I do? 
Should I risk it and stay here to see if he might change his mind and wants to have kids?
Or should I go away and start a new life... even though im scared shitless about doing that?

We were all pretty comfortable around each other and one thing led to another, amariah and i kissed, but it wasnt anythign huge. nothign happened after that and the show went on. For my first scene i walk out into the audience alnost and my heart dropped. nyla was in the crowd holding flowers cheering for me. I almost broke characyer out of surprise, but continued on until intermission. I ran backstage and ranted to manny about everything and we both talked about how nylah was in the crowd for me. i went to telll amariah and before i could say anything she kissed me again and ran off. I was schocked. but i had to go back out for the next part of the production. A stage hand handed me a note from an audience member, nylah, with the same flowers that was filled with how happy she was for me and how good i was doing. i kept it in the pocket of the outfit for the rest of the show. Afterward I met nylah in the middle of the stage and we came up with ideas for a date. I was overwhelmed with joy. but that date had no hope. she had decided taht wed be better off as friends which was okay with me. but still sad. I went backstage and told manny and amariah how things happened ffrom that night and manny was happy for me, amariah looked like she was holding somethign back. 

after the date i told amariah what nylah said and she siad that better things would come, there were points where she even rooted for the relationship. but it was hopeless. things continued on and we had a dance showcase production. wella was stagehand again and amariah was a dancer. she had madeit a somewhat habit of kissing me which she never explained. And though you might h=think what im about to say is bullshit, I  am a person that tries to avoid conflict of interests or  problems in general, so i let it happen. which is pretty shitty on my oart and something i should never do,. but it happened. Wella and i grew closer because she helped me backstage with costumes and such. one day we started having a deep talk about everything and we kissed. amariah walked in and immediately walked out. we stopped, but then it was time for rehearsal to start up .  everytime i would try to taklk about it with amariah she would brush it off saying to forget about i. but  i didnt truly know what to forget. later on after hteh showcase was over, manny invited me, zach, and amaria to his borthday party. zach was always one to bring up awkward things and mak eeveryone kinda cringe, and god did he not dissapoint. What i had forgotten was that manny was friends with all of my exes. so i showed up with a look of shock as amariah stood dazed. she didnt knwo but i did, which made everyting i said feel like i was walking on eggshells. 

we all went to watch a movie. and there was only a small couch. so it was my best friend, amaria, myself, and one of my exes in that orderon tthe couch ( sorry id tis looks shit im drunk writing this at 10 somehign at nihgt '. 

long story short he stsrted to cuddle up next to me and i avided conflict and problems. she stayed after i left

nd aparently they all ta;ked abou theor relationships with me and now she knows and shes distant but i dont know why becausei cant tell if she wants to be in a relationship or anything like taht. along with the fact that nylah and i hav started talking again and im just so fuckign stuck in arut right now with how im supposed to act i guess and i just really need advice on any of this !!!! im actually so confused on ehat any of thsi means so please help me out.

98,"Let me start off by saying I’m a good kid. I’ve only been grounded once when I was 6 because I hit my sister but that’s really it. I’ve never gotten detention or suspended or anything from school, a teacher hasn’t even complained about me to my parents. I’ve never done anything to betray her trust and no matter what she doesn’t trust me. Whenever I go to a friends house there has to be an adult there. Whenever I’m home alone she has our neighbors randomly check on me. And the thing is she doesn’t do this to my younger sister who is the “bad child” she has gotten grounded too many times to count and my mom is constantly at her school because of something my sister did. She has gotten suspended multiple times to the point where expulsion was being considered. And yet my mom doesn’t do any of the things she does with me to my sister. Whenever I try to have a conversation with her about it she just brushes it off by saying “You’ll understand when your older” but it’s honestly so frustrating to the point where I just want to move miles away from all of my friends and family to live with my dad and stepmom, who actually trust me and also don’t understand her behavior. This has been causing a lot of break downs and it’s honestly destroying my mental health because I’m starting to feel like my mom is favoring my sister. I need advice on how to get my mom to stop, how to overcome this, or just understand where she’s coming from. ",14Jun2018,1
99,"Hi, so as the title says, I'm 25 and a virgin dude. This has been by choice my whole life as I have always felt that I wanted my first time to be with someone that I care about deeply or love. Well recently, I have found that person. She is incredible. We have been dating for around 2 months now and next week we are going on our first trip together. Nothing crazy, just to a one day festival and overnight stay at a pretty sweet hotel. Anyway, I know that there is a high probability of sex happening and honestly, I'm excited. I know this might sound dumb because of my age and whatnot but I am a bit nervous... okay I'm very nervous. Is there anything I should know or do in preparation? I don't want to overthink it but I also don't want to fuck it up. Thank you for any advice. 

Also, she doesn't know that I'm a virgin. How could I tell her without sounding akward? I know she won't think of me in a different way, but I'm still nervous about it.",14Jun2018,0
100,"(Sorry this is my first post)

I don’t really know how to start my situation off so I’ll just jump right into it. I have 2 really close friends who I hang out with all the time. We share the same dark humor, we drink a lot, and they know how to match my “energy” at parties. One of them I’ve known since around 3rd grade—essentially a family friend—and the other I became close with in college but we all went to the same HS. Nonetheless the keep in more contact with each other that I do with them. We are all best friends but from the outside it looks like they are closer(which they probably are).

So my senior year, we all have gotten super close but obviously I’m closer to the person I’ve been friends with since 3rd grade. One day me and 3rd grade friend went out to get drinks together and I shared with him that I’m bi and that I have been sexually assaulted a couple times in my life. He cried and shared his sympathy this was all good. I mentioned that my sexually isn’t that big of a deal to me which is why I don’t really care to share it. Btw he’s gay so we got closer blah blah blah.

So after this moment I started to notice that they would ask strange questions or say things “he’s hot, right hahah”... so but I played it off bc I just took as our “bro” talk. I assumed 3rd grade would never tell other friend about what I told him. But then I noticed they would make rape jokes and but something about their faces was off. (Idk if you’ve ever had that moment...it just seemed like they both knew something about me that I didn’t).

Fast forward a little bit... we all got into an argument about some petty bullshit at the club and we brought it back to the house. 3rd grade friend was so irritated he left but me and the other friend kept arguing. Then we got to a point when he mention that 3rd grade friend told him “everything”. However, at this point “everything” was centered around my sexuality. I was drunk at the time but I vividly remember other friend mention my sexual assault indirectly. (I’m pretty sure he said something along the lines of “is what happened to you the reason for you sexuality?”). It’s not verbatim but it rested along those lines. Eventually other friend and I came to the conclusion that you expect ppl to react the way you want them too. I went to sleep fine but I was the next day when I started to put all the pieces together.

I realized that they treated me like a fucking pawn. I felt manipulated. They threw my rape experience and sexual orientation around like it was nothing. It’s hard to explain how mad I was and somewhat still am. (I was so angry I couldn’t eat for days, I wouldn’t talk to anyone, my body felt like it was locked at every joint, etc).

Fast forward a few days. We had a talk and their justification was me and other friend needed to get closer. That I’m a private person and they wanted to know more about me. ( They are both very good sweet talkers). I accepted their half assed apology and we kept on.

However, I keep noticing that they don’t ever keep me in the loop. I keep finding out that they make fun of me behind my back. I know I sound like a little bitch but after a while it gets exhausting. They tend to come to me individually only when they are tired of each other. My plans are never good enough. They judge me on a standard that they won’t even let me judge them by. (Also when ppl get around us they can get the vibe that I’m the odd man out and that they are “playing me”). But they constantly reassure me that we are “homies for life”

I know this sounds like a fucking soap opera. They are the only friends I truly seem to have fun with. I feel like i know what I need to do but i just need an outsiders perspective. And I’m a college graduate and it’s going to be damn near impossible to make friends this close again. I

106,"Here goes a wall of text. Sorry about it, but this personal issue is something that hits close to me and so I'm unable to revise it to be shorter and simpler.

So for my entire life, I've done some embarrassing and shameful things and had shitty stuff done to me. Nothing ""crazy"" per se, but things I regret significantly in how I acted or reacted to a situation.

Like for example when I was in elementary school there was a kid that I hung out with the most and was one year younger than. I had known him more than anyone else, during a birthday party my school friends met him and he introduced himself as my best friend. When my school friends asked me if that was true I denied it.

Since it was so long ago, I don't know if this was a result of embarrassment/attempt to impress my school friends or because we had never defined our relationship like that and it took me by shock. Either way, I know that I still dwell on that comment and reaction I had. I regret and it still eats at me occasionally to this day.

The second kind is one is where a girl that sat next to me in a class in eighth grade said it was gross to sit next to me and I said something like I understand/sure, brushed it off like it was my bad or I understood that, even though I felt angry/confused/ect. I wish I reacted better and stood up for myself because what she said was so shitty.

That's just one incident, I've had other instances that I occasionally dwell on/eat me up/ect. They're not a constant occurrence or anything, but they pop up more than I feel like they should. My problem is that I don't know how to move on. I'd like to stop being so guilty/angry at myself and others about these situations, many of which happened so long ago and even though I know the reason why I acted the way I did and what I could of done/should have, I can't seem to leave them in the past where I belong. They had and still have a strong affect on my psyche.

Sorry again for the wall of text. Any chance y'all have dealt with this? Or know any advice on how I could deal with this? I'd appreciate any knowledge/advice y'all could offer. Thanks for reading or skimming this!",14Jun2018,1
107,"I’m in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend and currently beating myself up about whether or not I should just buy this damn plane ticket.

My dilemma isn’t related in anyway to my relationship at all. My dilemma is with the amount of money I’m about to be spending.

I’ve always had a weird relationship with money. Ever since I was able to make my own money, the idea of spending any amount of money on things that aren’t “necessary” to my survival (ie: bills, rent, gas, food) makes me incredibly anxious. So anxious to the point where I haven’t even bought myself any pieces of new clothes in about five or six years. I barely buy myself food because it gives me anxiety. It’s horrible.

To break it all down:
I’ve got about $1,000 total in my bank account right now.
On June 15th, $286.10 of that goes to my car payment.
I get paid on June 22nd, my check will probably be somewhere near $700.
I pay rent on June 29th, which in total will be about $580.
The plane ticket I’m looking to purchase is $249.70 and the flight isn’t until August 25th.

My mom recently confronted me about never posting about her or any pictures of us on social media. She claims that her friends joke to her about her son's profile page seeming like he doesn't have a mother. She continues to be offended that I haven't posted anything at all. 

Some background: My mom isn't a fan of my girlfriend, and never has been. She thinks that she \[my girlfriend\] is tearing me apart from her, and has always hated the fact that I am with her.

110,"The only two people I EVER hangout with are dating. I used to be really close to the both of them, I'm the one who introduced them. I still talk to them, but the guy (A) thinks I like his girlfriend (B). He doesn't know I know that, but B told me. This kind of stuff happens with us regularly. A and I get mad at each other, but we never really say anything to each other to fix it. Most of the time, I only find out A's mad at me through B. So, I guess this isn't a real friendship- I get invited over to A's house (where B basically lives) and most of the time it feels like A and I are just pretending to be friends while I'm there.

The three of us usually smoke weed together, but A's not supposed to since he's on probation (it's a long story). B says she wants him to stop, but always smokes with him. She says it's the only time he's happy. So, after this, you probably think I'm a bad kid. I'm really not... at least, not to the same degree as A. He's not as reckless as he used to be, but his past decisions still affect him since he's on probation. But, I hate feeling like I'm a ""bad kid"" and I don't really like smoking with them, since A's not supposed to. It makes me feel like we're all just really bad influences for each other, which may be true. 

So why do I smoke with them anyway? Because they're the only friends I have. Plus, B and I are still pretty close. Not as close as we used to be, but we're still pretty good friends. A and I, not so much. What I'm saying, is I can't really be friends with B and not A. I've told B this, but she still invites me over. I usually end up going.

118,"I'm 20, and have worked the same job for the past two years since I graduated high school. For the past two years, I've been on a rotating shift, and every five days I go from an 8am-4pm shift, to a 4pm-12am shift, to a 12am-8 am shift (all with required overtime), and it constantly repeats. Not only that, but every 3 weeks, our schedule shifts by a day, and so I only actually have my weekend on a real calender weekend twice a year.

Needless to say, I'm sick of it. I want to go to college (or at least take a part time class). I want to get my life back, as I have missed out on a lot of things I could have been doing with my time.

So I started applying places. Two weeks ago, I got a phone interview at an office job I applied for, that would be mon-fri 9-5, and makes almost twice what I'm making now. Today, I got a phone call that they would like me to come In for a second interview on Friday. This is all great!

Until my anxiety kicks In.... I've been doing the same thing for the past two years. I have coworkers who I absolutely LOVE to be around. What if I don't find people I can get along with at another job? Also, I don't want to burn any bridges, so if I get the job, I plan to put in a two weeks at my job. But what it they tell me I have no choice but to start training hypothetically the next day? I'd have to quit my current job with no two weeks. Then if this job doesn't work out I have noting to go back to. I have a car payment and insurance, so I can't risk that. And I don't want to make it seem like I'm difficult to work with/unreliable by saying I can't start training until after my two weeks at my current job.

But then again if I get this job, it opens up tons of new opportunities for me. I could go to college, be on a normal mon-fri job and shift, and make a lot more then I do now. So would it be worth the risk of they ask me to train the next day?

Again this is all hypothetical because I don't actually have the job yet, but I'm hoping that this will be my ticket towards my future.

120,"I'm interning at a lab. I'm a returning intern, meaning I have a bit more knowledge and experience than the newbies.

I (M) happened to click with a newbie intern (F; we both go to Jesuit colleges and we have a similar kooky sense of humor). We're working on the same experiment and it's been really nice. But I'm afraid I might have been overstepping my bounds.

I get inexplicably flirty sometimes. I don't know why, and often times I catch myself but can't stop. I have borderline personality disorder and I think that might have something to do with it. I also know that I can't pursue anything with her becauae that'd be inappropriate. 

I thought she'd been reciprocating. But I just had a moment of clarity where I realized I might have just been making her uncomfortable. 

I've been leaving at the same time as her even though I'm supposed to leave later. We chat about school and plans and mundane things on our way down, then part ways. I don't think I've been *creepy* because we crack jokes a lot and she often volunteers topics about her life. It feels amicable.

At the same time, I realize how weird it looks to the other interns for us to be leaving at the same time every day. Us leaving usually leaves only one or two interns and I'd hate them to think something was up. 

Also, I have no reason to believe she'd be interested in me seeing as I'm not particularly charismatic, only nice, and even that I think it's just my BPD making me act nice. Inexplicably, people tend to easily become fond of me, but I don't think they realize what sits inside.

Finally, even though we're technically just interns, I have more control over the direction of the projects because I've been around longer. I'm afraid my seniority might also put her in a position where she feels obligated to interact with me. 

In fact I'm pretty certain she has no desire to flirt with me and I shouldn't have been. But what do I do moving on? Would it be weird if I abruptly become distant?

122,"Hi, this is my complaint/throwaway account. 

Some back story, I've had a lot of issues with a close friend of mine. Recently she decided to get in contact with an ex of mine who verbally and emotionally abused me, took every fear I had and admitted that she just wanted to see if I would actually kill myself. She was obsessed with me and my mental disorders and put me on this pedastool that she then desperately needed to knock me down from. Of course she was friends with my other friends but they all cut her off when I did and I tried to move on. 

She didn't tell me they were talking again, she just let me find out on my own. I confronted her, there was a lot of yelling, I lost a couple of friends because they tried to turn it on me and say I was the abusive one, which really hurt. I'm still trying to keep my friendship with the two that let me stay friends with them and they claim they care/love me, and I guess I just really want that to be true. But maybe I was the abusive one, since I'm the one whose mentally ill. She claimed she just wanted to see if I'd kill myself but maybe I manipulated that in my head too? I've had a lot of issues seeing the truth in reality and stuff.

I got into a car accident today. I have a concussion, I'm bruised to hell, it was pretty serious but luckily everyone involved is okay. I really wanted a distraction when I got home, so I asked a close friend of mine if we could hang out. She said she was busy playing with my abusive ex, so even though I went through all of this she couldn't hang out.

She knows how uncomfortable it makes me that they hang out, and she claims to be my best friend, and yet she goes behind my back and hangs out with someone who literally tried to make me kill myself. She apologized and then started posting on social media how she's a manipulative pig and deserves to lose friends which made me feel really really terrible and guilty. And I don't know if I'm making the right choice by constantly pushing her into a place where she has to keep choosing between me and my ex. I've never been a person like that and I hate losing people but I just feel so unhappy whenever I talk to her now. 

I am sorry this is rambly and doesn't make sense, the car accident kind of knocked me out of sorts. I really have a concussion. Am I being overemotional like they said? Is this my fault? If so, how can I make it up to them? I really don't like losing people but I just feel so bad about everything. ",14Jun2018,1

128,"So I got an internship this summer directly related to my studies (graduating in 2 years) and I have been working for a month now. The problem is, my girlfriend of 3 years is back home 4 hours away and can’t handle being alone without me. I have 2 months to go in the internship before I go back home and my girlfriend is saying that she wants me to quit or she has to leave me (break up) because I left her alone at the house. She’s a little bit too dependent on me sometimes and is saying that she is going to have a breakdown and is depressed because I’m always gone. She has battled depression in the past but I love her despite her issues. I really do love this girl but I also understand the benefit of this internship for my future. Should I be concerned that she’s kind of forcing me to chose between her or the internship? How can I get her to stick it out and be strong until the end of the internship? I don’t want this girl to dump me because I love her to pieces but I don’t think I can quit this new job. What should I do?

129,"I love my husband's aunts and their families. They are wonderful people, but weve never communicated much outside of Christmas cards and brief chats at weddings. 

We all decided to have a reunion this summer. One aunt took a lot of time planning it, but it will be located close to the aunts and cousins (less than 3 hours for most), and far for my husband and his siblings' families (11+ hours for us all). 

Add to that that my husbands' siblings more recently decided to visit us for two days prior to the reunion, not fully understanding how far it is to drive to the reunion from our place, but the plane tickets are bought. As it is now, if we go to the reunion, we will have just 2 days with the siblings and all our kids, and then all spend 2 days in our cars going to the reunion and traveling home from there, and 2 days at the reunion.

But if we skip the reunion, we will have 2 more precious days to spend with sibling families and cousins we do have relationships with but whom we don't get to see often.

We mentioned this to my husband's dad. He became very upset and said we needed to stick to the plan--that we can't back out. He is planning to come to our house and if we don't go to the reunion, he says he will drive there alone in spite of his age, as a matter of principle. I thought his sister who planned the reunion would be understanding, but when my husband called her to see what she thought, she got angry and said she planned the whole thing for us and if we all don't go, that she should cancel the hotel (which makes sense since all the aunts' kids could stay in their houses). She said she's never going to plan another reunion (there were some other frustrations she had to deal with too). However, the only thing planned is a hotel and a photographer.

I'm so sorry this is so long. What I need to know is if I'm being unreasonable and disrespectful to my father in law for not wanting to go. Would it be terrible to cancel so we can spend that extra time with the closer relatives? Unlike my husband's siblings, my husband and I did bring our family to two prior reunions, but didn't get to spend time with the relatives because they were busy with their own families anyway. I believe this will happen again.

Ok, so before Christina Grimmie's death I was a really big fan of her. She was the singer who got shot in Orlando back in 2016. Since the two year anniversary of her death passed three days ago, I was talking to my best friend about it. See, before her death, she also knew she was, but not in the way I did, she just knew her name.

On the day of her death anniversary, I was talking to my best friend about it. She's usually very sheltering and kind about sad stuff. She was telling me how it was ok, and I felt better.

The day of her death anniversary, I saw this really really mean joke about her shooting. I told my friend about it because it pisses me off that people are so cold to joke about stuff like that, and to my fucking shock, my best friend starts laughing at the joke. Like, overly done laughing, and just being a total bitch in that moment.

I've had an account for about 6 months and one of my classmates was able to narrow down who I  was. Apparently he found out who one other person was as well. Either he has too much time or it was very obvious.

I guess I was a little too active on the site (too many clues) and due to my small class size it was easy to find out who I was. Because of this, they can see all my posts I ever made. Can't delete them unfortunately.  Nothing was really personal or anything, but I feel like those comments were made to be under anonymity but now I feel...exposed, I guess?

One girl in my class I used to like, but after she probably figured out my feelings for her, has mostly tried to ignore me.

146,"Throwaway account for privacy reasons,

So last year I met this girl (online, she's from Iran), let's call her Sarah for now. I really liked her but she told me she was bipolar and had mental issues. We've known each other for 10 months and 3 months ago we kinda tried the long distance thing.

Since then, every few nights she's had doubts and she seemed very emotional at night. She says she's extremely stressed. She does music studies in the capital and has her exams coming up. She's also composing and playing a few pieces for a theatre play. She is extremely talented, but she feels like she's not. She doesn't believe me when I tell her how good she is.

She doesn't believe me when I call her pretty, nice, or talented... But the main problem is, that recently, the stress has been taxing down on her so much that she experiences physical pain from the stress. Yesterday, she was taken to the hospital cause her heart physically hurt. I know, I know, sounds like a bullshit story, but I got photos that she was actually in the hospital.

So this morning she's back home again, but feels the same pain. I tell her to get medication or mental help to solve her issue, but she feels like she's just taxing down on people when she asks for help. I try to tell her she's not and that anyone would be glad to help her, but I feel like she doesn't believe me.

She's suffering greatly and I want her pain to stop. She's contemplating suicide almost daily and she once even hurt herself ""in front of me"". I don't know how to convince her she's wonderful and worth everything the world can give her and especially her mental and physical health is important and anyone would be glad to help her

I'm friends with a girl from my old school for ~5 years now, it's always fun together and we can see us everyday and talk about everything without getting on each others nerves.
I can go to her with everything when i want to talk about something and it's the other way round , too.
She helped me through the aftermath of my previous relationship after which i was really down with the world - two years and in the end the betrayed me :(

I have had a solid group of very close friends since elementary school and we all currently out of high school. I go to community college and I am on transfer to go to University this fall. My grades are high and I am extremely determined to get where I want to go in life. However, most of my friends do not have the same mindset as me and I can already see they are gonna end up falling away. One of them is leaving in a few weeks for a 6 month hike that he doesn't know if he will return from, the other is a grocery worker that doesn't really go anywhere in life. Some of the other friends have already kinda fell away and only 1 of them has the mindset I do, but he isn't exactly my *best* friend. 

The problem is a lot of the people that go to my community college are kinda burnouts and not the kind of people I want to be friends with, so it feels like I just need to wait till I get to uni to make a fresh start with new friends and all that but that is a year away and even then I don't know how that will go down.

Generally it feels like my social life is losing people and getting smaller and smaller because of it. The place I work is mostly made up of potheads and older people, neither of which I really have anything in common with.

152,"This is a throwaway account for reasons that will become obvious once I elaborate on my post.

For starters, I have a very feminine sense of style. I like wearing dresses, skirts, blouses, stiletto heels, and so on and so forth. I do so casually on a pretty regular basis. I've been thinking of ways to accentuate certain parts of my body that I want to emphasize - specifically, my rear end. Yet, out of everything I've tried (i.e. padding, special undergarments), only one thing worked the way I wanted it to. It was the last thing I tried, and was initially more of a goofy experiment than something I was serious about doing.

Basically, the best way for me to accentuate my buttocks, based on my experience, is to wear an adult diaper.

Just hear me out and it'll hopefully start to make sense. My idea has been to wear an adult diaper underneath control top pantyhose, which are already a staple of my dress and skirt-based outfits. When I tried this combination out for the first time, I was surprised at how well it worked: the adult diaper enhances my hips and rear, yet the control top compresses it just enough so that it still appears smooth underneath my clothes. The best part? It looks totally natural! I've even uploaded a video on Vimeo to demonstrate what I'm talking about - to view it, type in the password ""2519"":

https://vimeo.com/274783353

Notice how, at the very end, my butt is accentuated under the dress? I love that effect. So much so that I even want to try wearing it out in public. The plan is to combine the outfit in the video with [these](https://www.farfetch.com/za/shopping/women/dolce-gabbana-vintage-lattice-pointed-toe-pumps-item-12684152.aspx) heels (which I already own) and my hair in a French roll or something similar. Only problem is, I've not been able to work up the courage to just bite the bullet and go for it. I'm scared of someone finding out that I'm wearing an adult diaper, and for purely aesthetic reasons no less. Comfort isn't as big of an issue for me; while I definitely don't *love* how they feel, I can tolerate it. My concern is strictly to do with insecurity.

How can I encourage myself to wear this look? This is something I really want to do, but I'm just too scared to try it. Or should I just give up on this idea altogether?",14Jun2018,1

160,"So, there’s a lot of details and emotions that go with this situation, but I’m going to just try and keep it pretty to the point.

Background: I’m a 19 y/o that’s going into their sophomore year of college. Took summer classes, had to drop them and take a medical withdraw bc of my anxiety disorder. 

I started dating my girlfriend spring semester and around that time decided to get on-campus housing with three of my friends for next Fall. Signed the contract, got our room assigned, done. Girlfriend was going to live in an off-campus apartment with a friend; friend bailed on her last minute, my girlfriend now has no where to stay and cannot afford a one bedroom apartment on her own.

My girlfriend wants me to no longer live with my friends and to get a place with her off-campus; we have no co-signer (friends parents were going to co-sign and my parents are bankrupt) and don’t even have credit yet. She cannot stay on-campus (doesn’t feel safe - she has a reason), and does not want to get a random roommate because she is scared that they will turn out to be a partier and get her on the “wrong track” again. She is not taking classes this fall for her mental health, and if I do not get a place with her she will have to go back to her home state and said she will most likely not consider coming back to this school.

The amount of anxiety this gives me is unreal. I do not have a job, and do not drive, so I will be struggling to pay rent constantly (450 and utilities for me) and will have to walk a mile to school everyday.  The thought of doing this makes me want to cry, but the thought of my girlfriend leaving and breaking up with me as a result is even worse. I feel trapped in this situation, and bringing it up with her leaves her in a sour mood, and she says that I’m just “making excuses” to not live with her and be independent (she wanted us to get an apartment in June instead of me going home for my medical withdrawal and was mad for days when I got out of it). 

Honestly just want some objective opinions on this situation and maybe ways to cope with the anxiety that comes with this feeling of impending doom. I have been trying to forget about it but as the school year approaches I can no longer do that. I feel very bleak about this and am simply at a loss.",14Jun2018,3
162,"So I met this girl in the middle of February this year, we hit it off really well, being eager to see each other again after the first date, she also introduced me to a few of her close friends and family after meeting for about 3 times.

The Problem is due to her schedule we have only been able to meet up around once a week and a lot of those meetups were just me visiting her in the evening, then staying over and leaving around midday the next day. We have made out heavily and done petting, but wanted to wait with more until we knew each other better.

She has been completely transparent about her schedule and what shes doing and stuff, so i dont feel like the problem is her not making the time, but actually her not having it.

Around a month ago we had a conversation about how we should progress this, because she felt like she has not developed as many feelings as there should be after 3 months, but thats normal for her, as she always takes really long to build a relationship with new people.

I was fine with that and felt kinda similar especially cause we havent really seen each other a lot, so i feel like you cant expect a very deep connection after this amount of time.

On monday she texted me, saying she thinks there might not be enough from her side, we texted back and forth a bit and came to the conclusion that everything was perfect when we were with each other, but whenever her schedule got busier she kinda started thinking about if this is all going to work out, because she cant spend as much time with me as she wanted to and doesnt want to have a half assed thing especially in the beginning of a relationship.

She said she wants to continue seeing me, but she cant live with the feeling that we might be at the same point again in a few months, because i am going to school then. (not long distance, just time consuming)

In two weeks from now she is going to be done and have a ton of freetime and my ""plan"" was to wait that out and then see how things go when we see each other more frequently. However we are having a talk tomorrow on if we should continue this or not.

I know this kind of sounds like a ""just let her go"" thing, because we arent too deep into it, but it just doesnt feel right, since we have so much in common, similar hobbies, goals, attitude towards relationships, it is just all good, besides the time factor and her feeling like it wont work whenever we are seperated for a week or so. So my question is if it is normal for her to have these thoughts when we are not together (in fact i also think about it not working out from time to time, but I am a kind of ""just try it, if it works its great, if it doesnt we tried at least"" person). In my opinion what counts is how happy you are when you see each other and if you want to keep seeing each other, which we both can answer with yes.

TL;DR Girl i have been exclusively dating for 4 months is thinking about ending things due to her doubting the relationship when we dont see each other and feeling like her feelings arent strong enough after 4 months (imo this is because we havent had a lot of time to spend with each other and i feel similar, but would keep trying, cause we will have a lot of time in 2 weeks from now). The time we spend together is great and we have similar views, hobbies and humor. Looking for advice for our talk tomorrow and how to continue things in general.",14Jun2018,2
163,"I used to love music a lot but during the past 2 years I have started to enjoy it less and less. At first, I thought that I just needed something new to refresh my taste with, but after having tried various genres and artists, I have come to the conclusion that I don't enjoy anything anymore. Music used to be a huge part of my life and I'm seriously grieving this loss. I used to listen to rock and metal mainly, but I liked pretty much everything in general. Nowadays, I've been trying to get into rap, pop, soul, country and even classical music but nothing sounds good to my ears anymore. I literally went through a huge list of artists and tried lots of artists, all from different and various genres, but nothing really resonated with me.

The only joy I can still get from listening to music is when I accidentally find a new song that I like, but it's always just one song, not one artist or genre. Then I proceed to listen to that song exclusively until I grow bored of it then I never listen to it again. This lasts for 2-3 days usually, then I go back to disliking all music. Even my old favorites are kinda bland and boring now. I tend to avoid my old favorite artists and bands because I can't connect with them anymore, or at least not even close to the way I used to, and it makes me sad, so whenever I stumble across an old song from a band that I used to like, I feel the need to turn it off immediately because it's almost physically painful to listen to it. It makes me sad to think of how much I liked all this stuff and now it doesn't move me anymore.


Has anyone gone through something similar? Did you come out of it? How?

164,"I've worked at a place that specializes in one thing for almost two years now. In all honesty, this is the longest I've ever stayed at a job to begin with. I enjoyed it a lot and really love what the company has to offer. I've expressed my goals on advancement and career opportunities within the company and was met with excitement and promises of that becoming a reality. 
  I already know that someone being hired externally can be fast tracked to management in a matter of two weeks. So I expect this? No. I also know that I don't need to go through a bunch of multiple steps, I guess you could say, in order to reach my goal. Do I still do it? Yes. 
  About six months ago I actually interviewed with the area director, recruiter for the district, and took the assessment to see if I was management material and passed with flying colors. Then some HR related issues came up about management and well left us with one of the top people gone and so I guess my stuff was ignored and put away for a while. 
   Now I'm still going through the extra training process only... They have to give me feedback. I can handle negative and positive with no issue, except they watch me for five minutes and then use that as feedback. I want to make sure I'm doing my job correctly and this doesn't seem like usable feedback to be honest.
   I changed my schedule to work better for the company and it's needs itself and have one day off a week. Usually at work I'm doing my job, two other people's jobs, and most of the time having to do some of the things management should be doing themselves on a shift. 
  I have way more responsibility now, but I'm expected to finish tasks in a small amount of time that other employees get extra hands doing the same task. I hardly get a break ever now. I ended up getting hurt on the job a good few times now. Once by slipping on ice and the manager didn't report the incident until I said I seriously needed to go to a doctor and even then they messed up the paperwork where I had to do it all by myself on the phone instead. Second time I was supposed to have help from a manager picking up a very heavy item, but he answered his phone instead so when I proceeded I ended up losing my grip and this object happened to have a substance that was 350°F liquid in it so I got burned on my arm... Third instance... Messed up freezer in the work place, water on the floor makes it worse, got electricuted and MOD decided it was something else and left it at that. 
  I don't have insurance at my work only because they neglected to update my status as full time so I wasn't eligible for it and am only able to sign up once a year.... My W-2 or whatever was input incorrectly so I have been paying down a $600 fee.... I try to explain as professionally and positive as possible that I'm exhausted. I'm putting more work in than 2 of the 3 managers there. And they just expect so much that I'm stressing out. And let's not forget today's amazing instance where I was forced to run trash by myself, even though it takes two people to do it, and I got 12 hour old chicken juice mixed with flour, eggs, and runny dressing all over me because a bag decided to pop. You'd think I could go home and change asap because it's unsanitary and smells horrible, but no I have to finish out some duties before I can go and just stew in it for the next 20 mins....
  I can't tell if I should just hang it out there... Maybe I'm not being tough enough or letting it get to me... when I first started it was great, then I transferred and now it's one of the worst work experiences I've ever faced. What do I do guys? I've spent this whole time just trying to reach management... I really want it, but I just don't even know if it's actually attainable anymore... Even though I'm doing my very best I feel like I'll just be stuck doing it because no one else will....

165,"Throwaway. It’s long, but I’ll take any advice I can get please. This may sound like a stupid situation, but it is eating away at me. 

My (19M) ex and I (20F) dated for a year. 7 months in the relationship, he left for the Army. Long story short, things were perfect as can be yadda yadda love is a fairytale. After his graduation from the Army, he broke up with me. Ghosted in a way. He was on leave for 2 weeks, never saw me in person or called. Basically the talking between us deteriorated until is was silence. 2 months of silence to be exact. In those two months I took him off all social media and contact because it was tearing me apart. 

In that time he “accidentally” got back in contact with me. He mentioned how stupid he felt for the break up and how he still cares and loves me. He wanted to be back in my life, but nothing mentioned specifically - as friends or back together. He’s in another state at this point due to the military. I decide to have him back in my life because I’m obviously still in love with him and want to get past the hurt. For a couple months it’s not real conversation with him. Just casual talks about nothing here and there. And the occasional he got drunk text and sent me something that reminded me of our relationship. At first, I thought it was because he wanted to rekindle the relationship, and then I thought it was he wanted to be friends again. Over all, it deteriorated again back to barely talking. 

This was killing me. He would send me pictures of him and his new girl bestfriend who is married and it was just hurtful. I felt like he definitely didn’t want a relationship again, and then it fell into where we weren’t even friends, but strangers. I asked him straight up why he was being so confusing. I told him that I wanted to really talk things out for once and he always was “busy”. And then finally I got fed up of letting myself be hurt, so I told him I’d be willing to wait to talk things over with him, but I needed to know that I wasn’t wasting my time - whether as just friends or relationship related. No answer. 

A month goes by and I decide that I really can’t have someone in my life who can’t make up their mind. It’s been a few weeks now since I REdeleted him off everything and have tried to move on. Well he messaged me again. 

This time about how stupid he feels for hurting me and how he wishes the breakup never happened. He says he wants to talk to me again, but is it too late? When I didn’t reply because I’m trying to comprehended what this all means, he then send another message of “can you at least tell me if you’ve moved on?”. 

Overall, I don’t know wtf is going on. If someone can please give me some insight on what this sounds like or kind of could mean, I’d appreciate it. I obviously still love him, but I can’t waste my time anymore. And I seriously am trying to analyze what maybe his motives are. Btw, this all happened over the course of 7 months now.. and he is currently in another country at the moment. 

Thanks so much for any replies. 

tl;dr - military ex boyfriend sort of ghosted me after a year relationship. Reached out to rekindle. No friendship or relationship was reformed. After asking if I was wasting my time, silence. I did no contact, and again he reached out now saying he regrets the breakup and wants to talk again. He’s currently in another country and has asked me “can you at least tell me if you’ve moved on”. What does this mean? Any insight is appreciated.",14Jun2018,2
166,"A slightly lighter post than ones I’ve been seeing in here recently.

So I had a girlfriend I was completely crazy about a few years ago, when she broke up with me I just had no interest in moving on to someone else. I’ve had a couple of “flings” since then but none of them felt right.

I went to a festival with some friends last week and immediately twigged that my two good friends (already a couple) are trying to set me up with their friend. Here’s the thing, to my surprise, I’m into the idea. She’s a really nice girl, same interests, pretty, easy to get along with (spent five days camping with her as part of our group) 
We’re going to get food and head to the cinema tonight with the other couple.
My question, how can I suppress my awkwardness about this, how should I act, what’re some good signs or obvious no go’s. Basically I’ve forgotten what to do/what not to do on a first date and I actually want this one to go well.

TL:DR - single for 4 years, met girl I actually kinda like, going on a date, forgotten how to date. 
Will update if this gets much interest, any help/advice appreciated ",14Jun2018,1
167,"My partner and I have been together for 7 years and have a son together and I love them both very dearly. As far as sex went we were pretty normal i.e lots of sex at the beginning, less so with the years but still at least once a week. But this last year we have been less intimate than ever. As of today we haven’t had sex in about 2 months. Every attempt is met with no enthusiasm and I feel completely self conscious afterwards. I brought it up today and asked why it was this way and she said that we were both tired all the time and that’s why. I know this not to be the case as she is unemployed and has very little responsibilities and sleeps in late everyday. I then said that I wouldn’t stay in a sexless relationship long term and that at 25 I don’t think it should be the end of my sex life. She then got angry and said that I was ‘gaslighting’ her and than what I said was ‘rapey’ and that she 100% didn’t ever want to have sex now. I don’t know what to do, am I being unreasonable? Should I just except things the way they are?",14Jun2018,1
168,"I personally am a grade A skeptic, that’s one subject I can guarantee an A in.

Lately, at the end of thoughtful, completely unbiased and frankly perceptively varied discussions with myself I seem to be lost. Hmm, surprising.

I have always been somebody who is very consciously aware of what other people perceive me as and yet has no control over it.

And as many of you will relate, I create personas to make it easier, the student, the friend, the daughter, the specific friend to this other friend. This is all well and fine until you are in sort of a crisis of who you are and what in life will make you happy.

Then it’s the question of behind all these personas who am I? And what do I want? Live your truth and be happy is all fine but what if you don’t know what your truth is.

When you feel deeply unhappy, in moments of silence you reflect and you ask yourself, “Okay, if this is making you unhappy, what wouldn’t? What do you want me to change?” Here’s a moment you need your mind to have an answer, to be honest, to reveal something you haven’t known about yourself before, this very moment as you lie in bed and binge eat literally anything. Sadly, it never comes, instead what does come is “Oh you want me to be authentic? Okay you want me to be real? Well then I’ll have to strip off the pretense.”

And you think yes it’s getting it, it’s happening, let me get ready… So this crisis you’re having? This emotional talk we’re having right now… Is that real? Or are you pretending to be the depressed, deep thinking persona? Are you in the end not even having a real crisis? Are you pretending away to write to your nonexistent audience to be that person. And so it goes on… Unhappiness, questioning the unhappiness to move on from it, trying to be more true to yourself and stripping away every shred of personality assuming it to be a part of the pretense, and in the end questioning the question itself until you are exhausted and have reached nowhere.

So thinking is pretentious now? Why would I do that? Am I in the end so pathetic that I have to make up crises to get attention and entertainment from myself? Because if I’m not telling people about this then how is it a persona? Why would I create a persona for myself? Am I subconsciously that fucking boring that I have to do that?

And if not, if this is what I truly am, and I am feeling unhappy, shouldn’t I have a solid reason for it? I think the realization that I truly am quite mediocre and will get a mediocre education, a mediocre job, and will die a painfully far stretched mediocre death, and yet the constant denial of the very same fact and a last attempt to break out of the storyline has brought my dramatic ass here.

169,"I have very extreme fears about relationships. I have been emotionally abused multiple times and taken advantage of multiple times by men. It has always been emotional and not physical. Someone on facebook just asked me on a coffee date. I'm scared to go just because I am only now \*starting\* to heal from my past, and I have always been very clingy towards anyone I was hanging out/going out with and hinged my self worth on the relationship. It was so extreme I had a manic episode about five years ago and spent a long time in a mental hospital. I am now going to therapy and my counselor said that I have been through a huge amount of trauma (physical trauma happened as well, just through birth and other experiences) and that maybe lithium isn't necessary because it's possible I only have PTSD and it can be remedied, so I am off of that now, and have been for three months. However, I am living with my parents who are keeping an eye on me. However, the deal was that I would not date until I was completely better. Someone invited me to coffee and I said yes, but he sort of said maybe we can have coffee if he doesn't get swamped at work, and that sort of uncertainty really causes me a lot of anxiety. On top of this, I haven't met him in person. Only on facebook. I know it's just coffee but I tend to get overly invested very fast and I don't want to be in an unhealthy place, or go into something I'm not ready to go into. He has been fine so far, but he only friended me on facebook about a week ago, so I honestly don't know if he's just trying to make a good impression or not. He works 72 hours a week so that is a lot. What do you think? Is a coffee date too much? Is this safe? Should I avoid this right now? ",14Jun2018,1
170,"Hello everyone,

I just finished finals for a class, and the teacher was putting in the exam grade and some other assignments she hadn't graded until now. While putting in these grades, she also changed a previous assignment grade from an exempt assignment to a 0. This brought my grade down 10&amp;#37;, and thus a letter grade.

The reason for her doing so was that I never did it. However, I didn't complete it since I was out for a concussion. As a result of the concussion, I was unable to use computers for \~3 weeks, and thus did not do the online assignment. But when I was back in school, she never discussed the assignment with me, and I assumed it was exempt since that is what it was in the grade book.

Any help on how to approach her about making up the assignment or changing the grade would be extremely helpful. I only have a few days since finals are finishing up and grades are due soon.

Also I took ap calculus and it was kinda easy (mostly about derivatives and integrals, polar coordinates, parametric, and vectors) except for series which I’m very bad at.

180,"To be fair, the bulk of this issue stems from the fact that my mother is literally trying to hear me in her sleep; As the title suggests, the sound in our home travels upstairs and apparently my mother can hear me word for word while I go on my fortnite binges in the living room downstairs.   We have a 1000-1200 square foot condo with two bedrooms upstairs, and a living room and kitchen/dining room downstairs. The two floors are seperated by about ten stairs, and almost the whole home is carpeted. 


I am making this post because she literally just came downstairs and roughly wrestled the controller outta my hand and pulled the headset off my head. I felt like I was a preteen again..., I’m 19 now. She is literally borderline OCD and I know I’m not being too loud at all, although admittedly I have had my inconsiderate moments where I do feel remorse for being such a loud ass. I’m whispering to friends and holding in laughs while I enjoy my time actually gaming which I haven’t done this consistently for years. It’s kept me away from a lot of dumb shit I would usually partake in during her sleeping hours. 


My mother is an insanely sound sleeper. I googled soundproofing tips and whatnot but I think the sound may be traveling through the vents? I don’t know, but we keep arguing because she treats me like I’m 13 and I should be able to play video games when I want as long as I’m handling whatever I gotta handle.

Option A: My best friend and roommate of 4 years has recently gone through a rough patch with her bf and is no longer moving in with him, so I offered to find somewhere for the two of us. This is the safe option: my roommate won't have to live alone, I know we'll have a good time together, it's more likely to be long term.

Option B: I have recently been offered the third room in a flat with two other friends. This would have been my dream situation before my roommate split from her bf. If I take this option, I'm less likely to spend long periods at home alone and I'm guaranteed a good location/price, but it's less secure long-term.

183,"BACKSTORY:

So I met this girl, let's call her Claire, through a play she was doing, and I mainly joined it because I wanted to get to know her better. I really let myself loose around her, being who I really am, and she really likes me, which at the time I didn't know. I did this because all my past relationships were based on pure carnal attraction, alone, and I didn't want this to be just like another one; she's something really special. We have a certain Gen Z, nihilistic humor about us that just makes sense. 

So Summer, which is like a week ago, literally, happens, and we regularly send each other memes, and talk about random shit at like X-o'clock in the morning. And, in our play's groupchat, we always talk about seeing movies together. And she even hinted at just us going together. Also, and I know it's petty and pathetic, I faked having a date with a girl, just as a litmus test, and she reacted just the way I thought, uncomfortably. So finally, Monday, we were talking about something that had happened on set (the play), and through conversation, she brings up liking someone from the play, which had me all worried. But with the frequency that we'd been talking, I was a bit cocky that she was talking about me, which she was. 

I did a whole show and dance where I thought I was shocked, but I really wasn't. So we talked for a while, and I, impulsively, asked her out on a date on Saturday, which is now next week because the theatre I was going to take her out to was closed for maintenance, because(take my word on this), I wouldn't get a better shot. She agreed happily.

Now flash to Tuesday, and with that, I feel in a *panic.

*I come from a low-income family, and I have like 16 bucks between me and a rock and a hard place*

I rushed into it like an idiot, and now I have to pawn in a little bit of my stuff, which I have no problem with. But that's not the problem. 

ISSUE:

Since then, we haven't been on the same page, and it's as if each of us have been acting different, myself included, and that spark is sort of diminished. I still madly like her, it's just that each of us have been acting like that confession didn't happen, and now it's weird. How do I break the silence, and get serious, while still being my easygoing, laize-faire self to her, and not be too ""I want to be with you"" heartfelt romantic to her?

I work fast food and was having a bad day so on my break I went to a liquor store and bought some alcohol and mixed a little in with a smoothie. I honestly don’t do this kind of thing and it wasn’t enough to get me drunk, I only took a few sips. I was just in my parked car in the lot, I wasn’t drunk and driving or anything dangerous. Yes I know it’s my fault for making a stupid decision.

Me and my big mouth had told my work bestie I was going to go drink. She was surprised cause it was out of my character so she came out to my car to check up on me and ask if I was ok. I assured her I was just having a rough day and I was just taking a couple sips, not enough to get me drunk.

Anyways I get back from break and go to clock in and the manager stops me and says we need to talk. My best friend had snitched told her I was drinking! The manager says that I should be fired but she’ll give me another chance and says she has to send me home since I was drinking. And she says she won’t tell the general manager or else he’d fire me. But I know they’re going to be gossiping about me.

I’m not condoning my actions I know it was stupid l, but I’ve see people drink and get high on their shifts and no ones ever snitches on them. It’s not like I got caught, my friend ratted me out. She said she was just worried but I feel so betrayed that she told on me.
 
How would you feel in my situation? Why do you think my friend snitched on me? How do you think I should act at work (I know they’re all probably talking about me)? Should I apologize to the manager and tell her it won’t happen again? Or walk in like it never happened?

189,"A few days ago a friend and I were tipsy at a sleepover and we decided to prank call a few people, including (someone I thought was) a good friend. He didn't pick up so it just went to voicemail and we didn't say anything. 

To my surprise, he absolutely freaked out, beyond anything you'd expect in response to a prank call. Eventually I apologised, although I don't see how it could possibly warrant that sort of reaction \- must've just caught him at a bad time or hit a nerve.

I'm actually quite hurt, even now, by some of the things he said. I'm also still a little bitter that he hasn't come forward and acknowledged that he overreacted. So I ignored the last message he sent and we haven't spoken since.

How do I break the ice and fix things?

198,"Hi guys.. Just kind of need to vent/looking for advice and don't know where else to turn. I just graduated college a little over 1 year ago. I originally worked at a hospital in my field  (psychology) for about 5 months. I ended up quitting and going to a new job because I was commuting around an hour and 15 mins to work and the new job offered more money plus room for raises.

My new job is working in organ transplant where I'm taking offers, talking to surgeons, setting up transportation and about a million other small things. We do 12 hour rotating shifts (3 days on, then 3 days off). We can range from being extremely busy (around 100 offers a shift) to very slow (around 6 offers a shift) depending on the day so I can never really relax and let my guard down. I had to train for 5 months for this job and while I was training I actually did enjoy it. In May my training ended and I was scheduled by myself and I truly despise/dread it now. I'm constantly anxious and worried I'm going to mess something up as this is a difficult job that can end with someone not getting an organ they need. My boss just kind of threw me to the wolves and scheduled me by myself even though the night shift has 2 people on it and I could have just as easily been scheduled there.  Along with that, there's surgeons that yell at you for small things, people always pressuring you to have other's make decisions, and an atmosphere of really pointing out when you mess up and just expecting perfection. I am doing well in the job and getting praise, but that really doesn't seem to be enough for me as I'm really miserable.

It's worth noting that I'm a pretty anxious person at baseline, but I can't remember it ever being this bad. Normally on weekdays my boss is down the hall but weekends and holidays it's just me. Everyday it seems I have nausea, no appetite, shaking hands, headaches and a sore jaw/neck. I actually saw my PCP and started medication for anxiety for the 1st time in my life  and I'm still extremely anxious just being here.

I'm not really sure if I should quit or not. I've only been here for 6 months and I really don't want to let my coworkers down as they've had trouble finding people. My whole department is only like 6 people, with 3 people per team so I would really be screwing my teammates. My coworkers have also talked specifically about how upset they are when people leave because then they have to work extra shifts alone. I have my own place so I need income to pay rent and since I just graduated I don't have a lot of money to spare. I also feel like I should get a post grad job that's longer than 6 months on my resume. Right now I'm feeling really trapped. I've considered talking to my boss but I don't think there's anything that can be done since there just aren't enough people.

At this point I guess I'm looking for advice from people in similar situations and if anyone has any general knowledge for me as I'm at my wits end. Anything is super appreciated and sorry for the long post!",14Jun2018,1

Is it a GI digestion problem or chronic constipation? And perhaps I lack estrogen? like what I have for boobs is just two soggy lumpy mounds bleeding into my armpit....and lots of awful back fat....

203,"**Context:** I'm a 22 year old female, living in England with my boyfriend of two years, our puppy, and his mother and teenage sister. I have depression and social anxiety. 

  
Me and my boyfriend met at university, so we lived together as housemates for two years prior to us getting together, and another year as a couple before moving in with his mum and sister. 

We're saving to buy a house. Hopefully it will only be another couple of years before we can move out, but I honestly don't know if I can last until then. We can't move in with my family because they don't have the room and they live about 5 hours away so we would both have to change jobs. He won't rent because he would rather live rent free with his family and save up for a house. 

The reasons I don't like them are as follows:

* They keep track of how active I am on Whatsapp, and if I go online just after my boyfriend leaves for work they will accuse me of cheating on him. This has happened on multiple occasions. 
* I feel like I can't go out with my friends alone anymore because whenever my boyfriend chooses not to come with me they assume that I am out cheating on him. Again, this has happened on multiple occasions. 
* They talk about me behind my back. They talk about where I've been going, what I've been doing, what I've been eating etc and it makes me **so** uncomfortable.
* They're completely unpredictable. Sometimes I think I'm having a normal conversation with them and then they'll just turn against me and start interrogating me about things.
* His mum treats me like a child despite the fact that I cook, clean, walk the dog, do the housework, etc much more than she does. 
* His mum has accused me of neglecting the dog because we like to have his fur longer than she does, she thinks he needs a haircut but makes a massive drama of it. 
* They are both disgustingly dirty. The kitchen is completely unhygienic all the time, the toilet is always absolutely vile and dirty, etc. Every time I clean up, it will be back to how it was in under an hour, so cleaning feels like a complete waste of my time.

My depression has just been getting worse and worse. Now I hardly leave our room because I don't want to talk to them. I feel so trapped and I'm starting to feel suicidal.

I've spoken to my boyfriend about all this, and he just says ""it's only another couple of years"". He sticks up for me about the whole cheating thing, but it doesn't stop them accusing me again.

Her and her mother then continued to harass not only me but also my family and friends going as far as showing up to a few peoples jobs. Now here’s the fucked up part, even after all this and her attempting to ruin my future plans of joining the Marines and by way ruining my senior year(I was barred from prom because I was on probation and just losing many “friends” because they believed her side of the story), I still have feelings for her. I still love her and I don’t fucking know why. Now for the tricky part. As of yesterday all of my charges were dismissed, which means that the order of protection against me has been lifted. As of the minute I left the courtroom yesterday I had been getting messages on Instagram and ig and text messages(from new numbers that I’ve never seen before) and she has been calling my phone from blocked numbers. Now my question is should I respond at all. Should I just get everything off my chest referring to her and then continue to block new numbers and just fight the harassment, or should I just keep that shit to myself and just continue to ignore her and try to move on?

207,"Hello all!

I was pretty much roped into nannying my husband’s cousins for the summer since I’m an elementary educator (not a teacher but on the track to being one soon, hopefully) and got offered more money than what I was going to ask. The catch? His cousins are NOT behaved. Their ages are: 13M, 9F, and 5M. The 13 and 9 YO children are self-sufficient and pretty much do things themselves and help me when they can. The parents have me watch them all because the 13YO isn’t very good at watching them and isn’t very responsible. However, they do antagonize each other and also the youngest one when they think I’m not looking. They also push, shove, bite, and scream at each other over dumb things like what to eat for lunch or who had the remote the longest. Well, both of the older two (13M and 9F) just left to visit family in the South so I’ve been stuck with 5M for the last week. So far, he’s: kicked me in the jaw, bit me, locked me out, scratched me to the point where he drew blood, pushes me, and is just downright disrespectful, such as: “you’re not the boss of me” “you coming here makes me have a bad day” “ you are stupid” “my parents hate you” all because I ask him to clean up his messes, brush his teeth, etc. I brought it up to my husband’s uncle who pretty much told me to beat the crap out of him, which I don’t agree with. I asked the aunt after the next couple of incidents and she said to talk to him and reason with him, which resulted in me getting kicked in the jaw. I put in my notice yesterday and gave them 14 days notice out of respect. My question/advice needed is; what can I do to stop getting hurt and generally avoid confrontation? 


I hate to say this; but my husband’s family hates the kids because they’re not punished and pretty much do whatever they want, the 5YO included. He screams until he gets his way and his parents give him whatever to get him to stop screaming. I was pretty much guilted into this and my husband was the one who told me to put in my notice. I do have another job lined up but want to survive these next 2 weeks without more bruises or welts. 

The punishment I have been doing with him so far is taking away privileges (computer, tablet, phone, gaming systems, TV) and putting him in his room. I have had to call his mom a couple of times when she was at work and she asked me to hand the phone to him, which he almost threw so that’s not an option anymore. 

Any advice helps! Thanks!

208,"For context: I was commenting on some guy's anime reaction video on youtube (which of course leads to nowhere good). He was extremely angry at two of the characters to the point where he would refuse to listen to anything he had to say because he disagreed with their personal philosophies and was missing out on the show's message because of it. This normally wouldn't be a massive problem, but he carried this same ""I'm obviously right and anyone who disagrees with me is wrong and stupid"" mentality outside the show and into the comment section. I decided to comment a summary of those characters' philosophies and point out some of the reasons why they think the way they do and why they might be right. Anyway he responded in a rant (some all caps sections, a lot of exclamation marks, a few sarcastic ""wow""s, belittling me, little if any logic whatsoever, etc.) saying that these two characters were just stupid children for believing in ideologies other than his own, ignoring my reasoning and threatening to delete my comment for having a different perspective (which he eventually did). He even called my comment a rant, which it wasn't. My comment was long, but there was no anger or rudeness in it. It was calm and evidence-based.

Anyway, I'm usually an extremely calm person, but I've been fuming about this for the past day and I don't know why.

So i have a friend (or that's what i call him) who likes being bossy and push people around to just prove he has more strength (and can fight anyone) i guess and intimidate other people not to mess with him and would prove it. He is always bragging (he just brings it up) when we talk about how he can beat some of our friends (he has sort pushed them according to him) and how he used to beat other school mates in high school who wanted to mess with him. So today i jokingly told him to shut up while he was singing and he took that as an opportunity (because i have always tried to not start anything with him because it's not worth my time) to exercise his ability to prove that i am/would be no match i against him and he came to me and pushed me and we pushed around for a few seconds and after he bragged that he is really stronger than me and i just quietly ignored it (didn't challenge him) and our friends were around. 

Just to add, i am the only person who helps him every time whenever he has problems like financially and i have to put on hold other plans i might have with the money to save his ass \- i'm not complaining about helping but i am confused like how would he treat people/friends who help him like that and just wanna be a childish and unreasonable d\*\*\*.

210,"I just finished my freshman year of college and didn’t really make any real friends. I mean, I did talk with people in class occasionally and I also did quite a bit of socializing at my internship with other students, but I didn’t really make any friends, just acquaintances at best I’d guess. 

Some background; I am an only child and my parents did a lot of moving when I was going through school, so I never really made any lasting friendships, and I’m pretty introverted, so I really find it hard to start social interactions with others. Basically the only reason I had a small friend group in high school was an extroverted classmate started talking with me and then introduced me to his friends. I really only have a handful of real friends that I talk to on a regular basis and can be my real self around.

I can’t express myself fully around my parents because the generation gap is pretty large and we don’t share similar interests. Plus the fact we moved a lot when I was going through school I think made me just turtle up and get shy. I basically wear a figurative mask over my real interests and personality because I really couldn’t confidently express myself as a kid.

213,"Ok, little bit of a backstory... and by a little I mean be prepared to read.

I got married in June of last year. 2 weeks before the wedding we had a joined stag and stagette- the bridesmaids and groomsmen (and us of course) went out to a cabin for a weekend.
This is where we found out my sister was cheating on her husband with my husbands bestfriend...

I am having a hard time forgiving them because i found this selfish as we had to keep it a secret until after the wedding, and my brother in law was out emcee.

Everyone found out about a week after the wedding and they both said it was a one time thing and that’s it. My sister and her husband split up. Not just because of the affair- she is a VERY angry person. She yells all the time. You could say “hi” to her in the wrong tone and she would get just furious and make up some story about how you talked down to her because of the tone you said “hi” in.
She moved out to “find out who she is on her own” all the while her and the bestfriend have secretly been dating. Of course this pissed us all off again. 

Fast forward to now. They are still dating and her and I haven’t talked much over the last year. Nor has my husband and his “bestfriend”. We haven’t forgiven them for it all. 
This past Saturday she got mad at me at my parents because my dad calls me more then her. 
Then on Sunday it was our first anniversary (yay!) and she didn’t wish us anything- I didn’t hear a word from her until Monday which only happened because my dad got mad she didn’t say anything to us, called her and then she texted me.

We argued and then Tuesday I told her we need to take a break. I clearly haven’t forgiven her and the BF and maybe time apart would help. Her reply was “fine by me. I’ve been done with you for a while now.”
She blocked my number and cut me out of her life.

First off- I feel like I did nothing wrong?
Second- how can someone do that to their own sister?

I have talked to it with my family and we all think there is something wrong. She is a very very angry person. She still phones her ex husband to yell at him because he didn’t text her back in a quick enough amount of time. She cut me out of her life. She has gained probably 30 pounds. 

We can all tell she’s depressed and needs to talk to someone but when we try to talk to her about it she just gets furious and starts saying nasty things and says she’s fine, she’s happy.

214,"This is LONG: My husband and I have 3 boyd, 13, 15, and a 4 month old. We drive a 2001 2 door GMC Jimmy. When we all would need to go out together one of my older boys would hop in the trunk. It sucked. Thankfully my husband's grandmother let's us borrow her 4 door sedan when we all need to go out. She lives nearby and is a saint, so we use her car pretty often. I mentioned this to a friend of mine over Snapchat, and she casually mentioned wanting to sell her pathfinder, jokingly I said that if she took low monthly payments I would buy it, but she would have to drive it up to me. She lives in Florida, and I SC, so we would Skype, Snapchat Facebook call, all the time. I've known her since I was about 12, I am 30 now. She very seriously said that she would, it'd been to long since we had seen one another, I had never met her 5 yr old son Thor, and she of course hadn't met my 3 month old (at the time) Loki. Awesome. So we started making plans. She was asking $4000, and it was in such good condition, with all repair records, new battery, new alternator, new tires, she went on and in about what great condition it was in and even sent me a video of her going over the car showing me the minor dent on one door, and pointed out that one charging port didn't work, but she would get it replaced. She seemed so precise, thoroughly going over ever little detail. She was my best friend, why would she lie? So this was suppose to happen: she was to mail me the title, and then drive up, once I checked out the car and wanted it, I would register it and put it on my insurance. I would pay $166 monthly for 24 months, but my first payment she said ""don't worry about it, just pay for the registration"". I thought that was weird, but hey, $65 for something i was going to do anyways, as my first payment, great.
So I get the title in the mail, and tell her hey come on up. She asked if I'd registered it yet. No? I haven't even seen the car. She then tells me that we had agreed I would register it tag and title, put it on my insurance before she drove up, after all she can't drive a car with no registration or insurance, that's why she mailed the title. I didn't really remember that part of it, but what the heck, she's right, and my best friend so the car is going to be exactly as she said. No risk. So I did it. I registered a car in my name I'd never seen before. I added it to my insurance. All the while so excited to see my friend and get my awesome new 4 door SUV! So she then drives up a day after she was supposed to arrive, an entire day late. Anyways, I was overjoyed to see her. Everything was going great until I inspected the car. It was filthy, disgustingly filthy. The steering wheel leather had peeled off and was hanging by threads. The gas cap area, the place you pump the gas was burned, ""oh by the way, I bought a portable jumpstarter, the battery kept dying on the way up"" when I drove it, the car made crunching sounds. Sounds I'd never heard a car make. I told her I didn't want it. She said for me not to worry, she's staying a week and will get everything repaired before she leaves, all these things were issues that just came up. Brand new problems. Over the next week all she did was sleep on my couch and ignore her kid. Then suddenly she needed to get home 'an emergency' and then she was gone. The next day I went to pick my son up from school and the car lost all power in the middle of the street. Just stopped. A nice police officer and stranger pushed is out of traffic, I called her to ask what the hell?? She flipped out. How dare I accuse her of lying. There was nothing wrong with it before. Take the repair costs out of the sale price. I told her no no no, you come get this thing. I don't want it. After days of back and forth and her calling me horrible things, she then tells me if I don't make my payments She will sue me for breach of contract. I asked what contract? There is no contract! Like an idiot I made that car legally mine!!! I asked her what contract again. She blocked me on social media. Everything. My son's too. Now I have this damn car, and a lifetime of friendship thrown away. I do not know that person who came to visit. What am I suppose to do? Her crazy ass probably would try to sue me too. I've got a useless piece of junk in my driveway, in my name. I mean I guess it's good not to hear from her, she's absolutely insane. I feel so stupid, looking back I should have known. What do I do?

I want to leave, but don’t know how to do so without leaving a bad impression. It is a summer internship so realistically I only have 1 month and a week or two left but would much rather just leave instead of dealing with more headaches and distaste for this work. 


Any advice on how to do so?

This bar is regularly used by my coworkers and I as we are friends with their staff and get a discount. So here I am, with my female friend about 20+ shots into the night and we make out in front of three of my sober coworkers who’d also made their way over to this bar.
Intense making out too, not just a few kisses.

I woke up the next morning with the most horrific hangover but to be honest the pure cringe of what had happened was worse.

All three coworkers were guys, one is gay and I guess a friend, the other is an older guy who has a crush on me and the third is a young guy who himself recently drunkenly kissed me.

1. **Middle School Spanish Teacher/Education Training** 
   1. (1 yr before I resigned realizing that teachers are one of the most underpaid, resented, and hardest worked civil servants in our country. I had a lot of pressure to be a teacher from my parents, so I did it in college, but realized too late that I don't like kids. I love teaching, planning, organizing and presenting, but I don't like the kids. Adult students would be fine, as I've taught English to adults a couple times, but prefer guiding self\-guided education. I don't like having to ""perform"" in front of a class, or the constant interaction with people.
2. **Social Media Coordinator for a Small Organic Grocery Store/Cashier** 
   1. This lasted 6 months, and I realized I hated dealing with customers ""needing"" me all the time, so I moved on to tech to be with computers and small teams, which I thought better suited my personality (deep thinker rather than performer/socializer. Not that those two things are exclusive, I'm just more introverted).
3. **Web Development Bootcamp Grad** in Washington DC (3 months)
   1. My skills are still in training, but I feel very defeated, as if everyone wants me to have a ton of experience for an entry\-level junior dev job. I want to learn and contribute, but it's hard to feel like I'll ever be enough because my code can be pretty rough and it takes me a long time to figure problems out sometimes. I just feel...like seasoned developers would regret taking me on, even if I have excellent communication, diplomacy and leadership qualities that make others feel welcome to share their thoughts. Socializing is hard and tiring, but I'm pretty good at it, I think.

I have a very strong interest in nonprofits and companies that support NGO's and charities. eLearning and online education seem very interesting...but I have been rejected by two jobs I really, really wanted (and others I have just applied to for the heck of it), and feel like I'm barking up the wrong tree, or maybe I'm just not good enough for any developer job, and maybe it's not my niche. None of these jobs have interviewed me.

Does anyone know what I could do with all this? I'm 26 and feel...lost and rejected. I currently live in a studio with a roommate, and am barely making it.

 (I am also just starting to try to take meds for persistent depressive disorder, so I'm sorry if this post seems whiny or anything. I work really hard, but it's hard to keep it up when literally everything feels like really hard work...including microwaving things sometimes).

231,"Hey guys so my friend is 29 years old and in great shape. He has a very active out doors job and no prior health issues. 

Roughly eight months ago he had a severe hive/allergy attack/dont know wtf it is. 

Symptoms:
Swelling, muscle soreness, hives on whole body (no pustules), vomitting, intestinal trouble, lack of appetite, itchiness (prob from the hives), fever, muscles tightening up to where he can barely walk from pain. 

Symptoms come on suddenly and last about 3 days to a week then they are gone. This happens about 1 to two times a month, antihistamines help a little and so does advil but doesn't completely get rid of all symptoms. Basically just treats the fever and some of the hives and swelling. 

My friend has gone to multiple doctors, allergy specialist says hes not allergic to anything and that is stress related (go fly a kite buttmuncher). Family doctor said the same thing after allergy special. 

Friend has changed all soaps and eating habits and nothing is helping. Finally we thought maybe parasites could be the problem. This past weekend he started a cleanse... for a few days things looked good (small amount of hives but not breaking out majorly) just found out today he had a full on hive/allergy/wtf is this.

233,"Five years ago, I befriended somebody who I had a crush on at the time. Thankfully my days of pining for him are long over, but an interminable cycle started.

I’ll try to condense it as much as possible; this “friend” turned into Jekyll and Hyde after some time. If he wasn’t giving me random silent treatments, he was alternating between being friendly and hostile. He would angrily curse at me for unknown reasons, call me names, make fun of my appearance, and invite me out with his friends, only to ignore me or humiliate me the entire time we were out. I constantly walked on eggshells, afraid to upset him and just wanting to appease him. He never did apologize for his behavior, but would flip the switch again and put on his friendly face every once in a while. Every time this happened, I would (naively) think things might be different and decide to give him another chance. It certainly didn’t help matters that I liked him at the time, as well.

Two years ago, I finally came to terms with the fact that he simply operated that way, whether I liked it or not. I wished him no ill will, but decided that the friendship was unhealthy, and that I no longer wanted to be a part of the cycle. It took strength but I quietly faded out and ceased contact with him.

Two years later, he still attempts to contact me every couple of months through requests on various forms of social media or drunk dials. Even though I never respond, this might sound crazy but I do feel guilty about it. I get the vibe that he’s a lonely, conflicted person if he behaves that way. I feel sorry for him, and wonder if he’s matured a little. However, I know I’ll be angry with myself if I give him another shot and the same thing happens—I don’t want to be jerked around any longer. As you can see, I have very mixed feelings. Should I be more open to him, or simply block him finally for the sake of a little peace?",14Jun2018,2

It’s been 2.5 years since I started working at this agency and we recently get a new sex offender management system. As I was going through the final check of the data I had, I realized my major epic royal fuck up. 
This sex offender that I failed to add to my list has never been checked on ever since he moved into our jurisdiction 2 months before I started working there WHICH WAS 2.5 YEARS AGO.
 Level 3 sex offenders have to come in every 90 days to confirm they’re still living where they’re supposed to. As he never made it on my active sex offender list, he was never contacted or checked. Sex offenders are supposed to send in annual verification checks and the law enforcement agency would get notified if they fail to do so. We were never notified for some reason and I never realized. 
Until now. 
I am so royally fucked. I am freaking out so hard right now. I’m pretty sure I’m going to get fired over this and I’m just terrified. I know I have to tell my boss, but god how do I go about this? It’s such an epic fuck up. How do I recover from this? I’m so going to get fired.

My flight was cancelled due to bad weather (Fine, these things happen) - after waiting 3 hours we finally heard from BA... All others flying with different airlines had left the airport and gone to hotels. 

We were told we had to pay for a hotel, taxis and food and they would reimburse. 

All hotels were sold out but luckily a hotel put us in a suite for the insanely low amount BA were willing to offer. 

I phoned BA during this explaining due to the terrible service I've had to pay emergency prices for my dog sitter and she said it's worth putting wages down that I would lose. 

I also lost out on the seats I booked and paid extra for. 

So I send back the receipts and it comes to £361.94 (without wages and dog care) and after a week they come back and say here's £260 which covers the hotel and food (Not taxis'/dog/wages) - After over 2 hours worth of calls they've moved it to £309 and will refund the seats as a good gesture. 

I don't know what to do - they have the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. 

I don't want to be out of more pocket - With the dog costing £100 extra and lost wages for a day too - losing more for something BA said they'd pay for is nuts.

246,"I have dealt with near constant anxiety issues for most of my life, combined with mild PTSD stemming from childhood trauma.  This has caused me severe challenges in my education and working life, and it's definitely affected how my resume looks.  It's really tough having to basically walk around in the world having what I've realized (at long last) is a disability that can be as real as being in a wheelchair but it's invisible.  I have a job interview tomorrow.  I've never admitted to any employer I have these issues even though it's something that potentially could impact or affect my performance on a job.  Even though employers always say they will make accommodations for disabilities, the fact is I don't really know how that extends to mental handicaps.  When I get severely stressed due to deadlines for example, I tend to engage in avoidance behaviors - procrastination is basically a very mild form of what I have; my version of it is almost shutting down and being unable to function.  If my job is not that high stress this tends to be something I can manage without it affecting my performance greatly.  The mantra for job interviews is to look as invincible and amazing as possible, toot your own horn, confidence, etc. but to me it smacks of dishonesty especially in my situation.  

From my perspective, dealing with my anxiety has been a tale of courage, I'm proud of how far I've been able to come despite what I've been through.  It's very difficult to get other people to understand who I am or what I'm really capable of without knowing about that.  

My thinking on this is basically not to bring it up though, even though there are many times I want to yell, ""the only reason my GPA is that is because of this!  The reason I took a year off is because of this!  The reason I didn't take the bar exam even though I graduated from law school is this!

Anyways, my parents have a gambling addiction. When my grandma passed, they didn’t have enough money to pay for her funeral so they used the inheritance of my two cousins in Vietnam which is $4,000. She said she will give it back to them when she has more money. 

My parents from that time until now have come across A LOT of money. Probably around $200k. I have told her to give it back to my cousins, but she always say she will give it in increments, because they’re both in abusive relationships and their spouse will take it away from them (which is true). 

However, my thing is it’s not really up to her to decide what happens to that money cause it’s not hers to decide to begin with. 

I plan on saving $4,000 to repay them, but I want to say it’s from my grandma. The thing is we moved houses since then, so what should I say? I want them to know it’s an inheritance from my grandma. Should I lie and say we just found it randomly or tell them what really happened?

I’m currently on summer break. I’m 17 and about to be a senior in high school.

I’m also the oldest of four children.

My parents never taught me anything. When I wanted to learn how to do stuff, they just yelled at me because I didn’t know.

I learned to use a stove when I was 16, and this was from my 12 year old sister. My parents taught my sister how to use a stove, but not me. When I asked, they yelled at me. I’m very grateful she taught me, because now I can make myself breakfast in the mornings.

They also didn’t teach me how to ride a bike. My dad just yelled at me because I didn’t know how. However, my three younger siblings all learned how from my parents. I watched them all learn how to ride bikes and the smiles on their faces. The bonds they had with their parents.

Today, I really don’t know how to do anything. I have one year left of high school. When I get out, I’ll be hopeless. I don’t know how to order food or purchase stuff or move out. I feel like I’m stuck with a child’s mind because I still want to live my childhood. I want to live my childhood because I never had one. All I’ve known is abuse.

The environment was grueling and not positive for mental health. Long story short I put my two weeks in with a new cooking job opportunity. I made it though so I had a week in between to give me some rest. 

I went my first day &amp; it was a mess. Understaffed and stressful, same if not worst environment. I had bad vibes. Coincidentally I had an interview with a yacht club the next day. I entertained it and went. Well they offered same hours but a dollar more plus I’d be working underneath a chef. A dream opportunity but only seasonal. 

So I accepted the job with the chef and talked to the manager where I was working and explained. My luck, I get offered another dream opportunity. 

Working as a budtender at a new and up n coming provisioning center...I’ve dreamt of both scenarios and I’ve gotten both now. I truly would love the experience from the chef but that’s only if he can help find my passion.

I jumped through a bunch of hoops to get them to credit back the money charged for the home phone and then remove it from my account. They finally agreed to do so and I paid my bill.

Yesterday I received my bill for this month which is due June 30th and it was much smaller than usual. After investigating, I noticed that the home phone was removed, but the credit is still on there. This halved my bill. I am now only required to pay about 50 dollars for unlimited high speed internet.

If I pay this bill and don't bring it to anyone's attention, will I regret it later? Just wondering what consequences I may face. (I'm in Toronto, Ontario, CA. ISP is Bell) ",14Jun2018,1
262,"So I am fortunate to have a skill (not the TAKEN kind) which allows me to make good wage as often as I like. But, recently I have been offered a full-time position which pays more that I make now but requires more commitment than I have had in over 5 years. I would appreciate some advice.

Details

Currently I make $32/hr but am limited to 29 hours per week (I actually work around 24 typically) and it is a high paced high demand position. Zero benefits. However, I basically pick my schedule. Days off, time I want to work, etc.

Offer is to make $50k/year salary. Somewhat on call. However, the pace is WAY slower and demand is WAY lower. Benefits include 401k match up to 4%, Health benefits (that cost me $600/month for family), 3 weeks vacation out of the gate.

270,"Hi all, 

Not sure how to handle this situation. I am a total introvert. My wife is an extrovert. I love spending time with her and i love her more than life itself.

The biggest issue for me is the amount of time she spends with her family. We have to do family stuff 3-4 times a week. I like her family, but its exhausting. If i say no to any plans, then i am asshole who needs to grow up..

Her family is huge and every weekend without fail we have to go to some sort of dinner / gathering every Friday and Saturday and one or two during the week. When we arent with her family she is constantly on the phone to them making more plans or just idle chatter. 

The next 4 weeks are fully booked for me with family outings and parties, none i particularly want to go to.

271,"So my cousin who lives across the world is coming to visit us.. I was hoping he would never be able to come.

But at the same time, I’m terrified of him and I’ve told him that we’re cousins and he can’t hit on me.

272,"A few things for context before I start with the main story:

First of all, english is not my main language, so I apologize for an mistakes. 

All my life I've been verbally and emotionally abused by my father. This among with several other reasons led to a mental breakdown when I was 20.
I got diagnosed with major depression and an eating disorder, both of which are in control right now.
I've spend a lot of time in a psychiatric hospital and two years in therapy afterwards.

The contact to my father is nonexistent and I've since moved away to attend university a few hours travel away from my original home town.
My father doesn't know that I moved away and started uni and it's better if ot stays that way. 

I don't have therapy anymore. 

Now to the main issue:

My brother was in a terrible motorcycle accident a little over a week ago. He was heavily injured and in a comatose state for most of the week. He is now semi-lucid and wants to see me.
My plan was to travel home by train (I don't have a car) and have my mum pick me up at the train station in the town where my brother is hospitalized.

I thought that she and my father would drive separately because they have been divorced for 13 years now. Turns out this is not the case. They'll pick me up together in the town. Then he is going to drive to the hospital with us, stay the entire visiting time, which is two hours because it's an ICU station and then drive us to our hometown which is even further away (about an hour by car).
Now, as I said before, I wasn't expecting this, otherwise I wouldn't have made plans for visiting at all.

The last time I've seen my father has been when I was about 19 and even the short time we spoke made me have a panic attack so bad, I was shaking uncontrollably for over an hour.
I really don't want to see this guy, but if I want to see my brother I don't have a choice.

Now, my mum offered to lie for me and tell my brother and my father that something has come up and that I couldn't make it. I appreciate that mum is willing to do this to protect me.

I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand I want to see my brother, but that could also mean re-traumatisation for me.
Another part of me just wants to stay away to protect my mental peace. But that would also mean that my brother couldn't see me and would probably consider me an asshole for not visiting.
It would also give my father new material to spread nasty stories about me, something he has done in the past.

I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to do it.
Any suggestions and advice is welcome.",14Jun2018,1
273," I'm 19. My dad constantly demeans my mom, and she's fallen and recovered from an ED with my dad's abuse being the largest cause. Both of my parents have alcoholic tendencies, both have drug tendencies. I'm convinced my dad is a narcissist. My dad also demeans me, but to a lesser extent because I try not to talk to them too much. The screaming and name-calling is every night, and I pick my mom up most nights when she's crying.
I want to move out because I feel like a toy in their relationship, like the parent. I'm always telling them when they've gone too far (so they don't start fighting again), but then they keep going. I've given my mom all the advice in the world, and she doesn't take it and keeps trying to ""fix"" my dad. I don't want to leave her alone but their relationship won't change. They ""decide to divorce"" about once/week then act like nothing happened until they lash out at each other again. 
I only make ~1400/month. I could move out with my boyfriend of 1 year and we would split rent price, but most places cost &gt;1000$.

274,"sorry for my bad english, anyways:

so uh yea, I feel suspicious, like I just do. 
I feel like everyone knows something about me that I don't but are just putting on a show for me so I don't think about it. It's like my life is a mirage to myself.

Like sometimes I think, do I have like severe autism and I am completely unaware of it? 
Certain things make me think this way. examples: Teachers acting extremely fishy around me, So fishy that people in my class have even asked the teacher why they act weird around me. They act especially condescending around me. I was given an SNA (special needs assistant) at school but I declined and when they forced it onto me my whole friend group all helped me to get the school to fuck off with that bs (sorry for the language) bc they all agreed that ""Nothing is wrong with me""

The school tried to get me to not do an extra out of school languge for state exams even though it is not thier business. A Substitute Therapist harassed me during a session which resulted in my parents sending a letter to the state department that deals with therapists and he was barred from meeting me anymore. He forced me to keep comming back to appointments even though I stopped going to therapy a few years ago and all of a sudden I get a check up letter and I go then I'm called back even though I told them my life is great and they kept doing it until one session the Therapist just harassed me.

Things like that. All this makes me feel inadequate as a member of society and the school demotivates me in doing work bc of all this SNA bc so I try to do one language at home and they try stop me.

275,"So I am 19 years old, and I’ve been working at this Credit Union for the past 2 years. I am a full time student, and so I work part time for a majority of these two years. Every year we are entitled to a raise, however last year I didn’t get one because I “didn’t meet their expectations” please keep in mind that I am part time, and at any given day I was working at most 4 hours a day, and only for at most 3 days.

This year my anniversary is coming up again, and I am yet again entitled to a raise. Same conditions as last year except now they have given me more responsibility. I am a teller, but I am sometimes doing the job of an head teller. Although not in my job description I take loans, do cross sales and etc. 

So I just have a feeling that they won’t be giving me a raise again. And while I’m grateful for the company for working with me while I go to school, I am ready to resign and find another job. So my question is if I don’t get the raise should I resign immediately or at the end of the summer like I originally intended. 

If I leave they will be short staffed, but why should I care about a company that doesn’t care about me? 

TL; DR - I have been working at a company for the past 2 years and never got a raise. I’m due for one in the next few weeks, and if I don’t get it should I resign immediately, or at the end of the summer like I originally intended.

283,"Background: we dated for a while and it was amazing, we were happy and things were great until they weren’t. I had no idea she was feeling I was distant because she never told me. Towards the end she slowly started to feel like I wasn’t giving her enough  attention and she didn’t feel like my girlfriend, but didn’t do well to discuss that. When she finally did I said I would work on myself to be better for her and started to make the changes to my bad habit of isolation to cope with life issues. The next day I asked if she wanted to watch a movie and chill when she invited me over later that night and she accepted. That night instead of hanging out she decided to propose we take a break. I agreed because if she needs space I get it. The next day rolls around and I’m going through the motions of my schedule until I run into her and talk to her for a moment. She holds my hand and then after a while asked me why she was holding my hand. She kissed me goodbye and went on her way. I apologized for pushing and not giving her space and proceeded to give it to her for the next two days. Our break had a designated end date but she called me to come over sooner so that she could choose to break up with me. While breaking up with me she kissed me and let me kiss her and she held me close and we were intimate. It was clear we still had something there. She had a week or so earlier asked that I swallow my pride to try and handle situations. I walked away and let her break up with me. I got about 100 feet before every will in my body made me throw my things on the ground, run back, knock on her door and apologize. Telling her I don’t care about my pride and I want to be better and work on us. She said she couldn’t handle it right now and closed the door on me and I went to work immediately after. I asked her if we could talk because I just had some questions to sort out before we go our own ways to heal. She said she wasn’t ready to talk about anything at all so I let off. The next day I was in a very confused and emotional state of mind and started to have a panic attack so I contacted her trying to get help (she said if I ever needed anything she would be there and I bought it). She had somebody else answer the door and send me away, so I left her alone for a week until our friend group had a gathering. I drank and smoked to relax and make myself bite my tongue around her. I would catch her looking at me but she would never look me in the eyes for more than the moment I caught her looking. A bit of time goes by again, about 3 more days. (She said she wanted us to be friends) I invited her to go for a drive since it was a beautiful day and I wanted to relax before finals and I assured her I would leave all the drama talking out. She always loved to go driving. She declined and I said okay no problem and that was that. Later she hits me with a message threatening legal action and blocking if I continue to contact her (mind you I barely said anything other than to return her things and when I had a panic attack and looked for help and 2 sentences at the party which felt forced by her). I start to have another panic attack because I’m like “what the fuck is happening”. I go driving to clear my head and all is good until two days later. She invited me to talk out of the absolute blue to return something to me that was just trash (I even told her she could just throw it out in case she wanted to avoid contact further). So I went to get it and tried to go to my car immediately to avoid further contact like she asked and she followed me to talk for a while. We talked about tattoos I’m getting and a video game we are both excited for and then she brought up the legal threat saying she just wanted it through my head she wanted space. I told her I had a panic attack and she gave me a hug but I didn’t want her pity I just wanted her to know that threat was a bit much. There were silenced where we just smiled and looked in each other’s eyes without awkwardness. Then before leaving she held me for a long time and I could feel her heartbeat, and her arms wrapped tightly around me. We stood there for a couple minutes before I pulled away to go to work. I reiterated to her that there are questions I want to ask when she decides she is ready and that I won’t rush her, but she is trying to avoid that conversation all together. Why will she talk to me in ways she is happy with and treat me intimately and then turn around and not talk to me about what I need to talk about to either move forward as friends or even have a Vance if reigniting the flame that is very evident between the both of us?",14Jun2018,1

This keeps happening at work around the watercooler/kitchen with coworkers. I'll typically either have a very short conversation and then walk away or the odd time not notice it's my window to leave and just stand there for ten seconds and then be like ""anywaaay"" and walk out.

I especially have a habit of aborting if I get complimented. I'm receptive and I'm sure to say thank you I appreciate it, I'm not a dick, but sometimes I realise they might want to have asked me more about my shirt or something and I've already aborted.

There is a girl I like in my class, but after analyzing it, it's just a crush. I **lust** for her and maybe want to date her, but I don't see it happening, and I don't think we'd work as a couple.

It was honestly pretty scary. He's very socially awkward and has anxiety but his face didn't even look anxious, it was just this weird lifeless face. His mouth was almost in an open mouthed, toothless smile. 

The other thing is he always takes five seconds to shift from what he is currently doing to answer somebody who talks to him.

I kept saying I was innocent 3. I started crying when they said it could be my boyfriend; I did that because I love him and I know he didn’t do it. 
They thought it was my boyfriend because 1. Of how he responded 2. The look in his face/eyes.
My dad was out of his mind crazy that morning threatening to beat my boyfriend. I left home that day because I already couldn’t stand being at home.

Growing up, my parents have always been 50/50. My dad binges on the weekends with alcohol and drugs. My mom has always been cruel to me; calling me names, intentionally trying to fight with me, intentionally making me want to feel miserable. To sum it up I haven’t heard “I love you” from them since I was 10 and I am now (21F). 

I know my boyfriend didn’t steal it because the day it went missing he was not there at all. I was, along with my little brother (12) and my dad (46). There was a two hour gap when I left to go workout so it was just my brother and dad. When I arrived back home, my mom was already there. They didn’t find out till nighttime. I immediately assumed it is my dad. Maybe for more alcohol or drugs. Mind you, it doesn’t do this at home, it’s more of he leaves for a couple days then comes back home recovering.
My dad has manipulated my mom time and time and she lets him do it, she doesn’t even care at this point. It’s like she gave up with him but she’s with him for the money I’m assuming. 

Ever since I’ve left, she’s all of a sudden being nice to me? Treating me like we’ve been close. I am so confused right now because everything happened so fast. I’ve never been close with her, I’ve always distanced myself from her because I simply do not respect her nor does she respect me. She’s always attacked me. She texts me everyday since that day (she wasn’t even there and they brought it up to my boyfriend and I four days later after this money was stolen? Which threw me off), she is now trying to make plans to hangout. I don’t understand.

She keeps saying my boyfriend took it. It’s getting to my head but it’s impossible because he was not there that day! The day it happened, my boyfriend told me he’d text my mom in a way to show his innocence but he hasn’t. He encourages me to still have a relationship with my parents to this day but I don’t want to because they’ve treated me horribly for so long and they think that he has done it. He just no longer feels the need to reach out to them or my mom to tell them that he has not done it. He started not liking my parents because of how they are and how they treat me, he just not like them. Which I understand. 

I’ve been living with my boyfriend (21) since then and he has helped me a lot. I do just get flustered when my mom keeps texting me everyday because she feels the need to mention that they are the victims. 

I’ve been very sad in the inside and I’ve been doing my best in hiding it but I am breaking down.

My cousin is around the same age as me and she said “I think it was your boyfriend because someone who steals that amount of money all at once knows that they won’t be coming back to your home.”  My whole family thinks that it could be him just because of how’s he treated me in the past (all he has done is lie to me about two other girls he’s been with when him and I were broken up, I found out two years later about them). 
It’s making me paranoid. He is the one person who has done the absolute most for me.

304,"I am 29 and have had many jobs in my life. The longest I have ever been at a job was 3 years and it was a video store back when I was in my late teens.

As an adult, I have struggled a lot with mental health problems. On top of that I also have reproductive health problems and stomach issues so it seems like every time I'm doing well, something health related comes up to kind of knock me back down. 

I have a bad history with not keeping a job. It is a cycle. I start a job, do really good for a bit then something happens. Either I get sick, my depression sets in, my anxiety gets bad and other times I've had emergency issues that have required surgery. 

I recently left a job after a year and a half because the workplace was extremely toxic and I was being bullied and had zero support from management. It was causing me to have anxiety issues. 

I have found a new job and I will be starting there full time next week. 

The advice I need is I guess:

1. How do you keep motivated to get up and go every day?

2. How do you build solid work relationships?

3. How can I show my new employer that she made a good choice by choosing to hire me?

4. How can I break my cycle of calling into work when I have my bad days? 

I know these all seem like easy things to do. And right now, as I am super rational writing this, it seems almost ridiculous that I would even have these problems. But unfortunately, it just keeps happening. 

Thank you.",14Jun2018,2
306,"I hate eating with my mother and father at the dinner table. Firstly, I'm always forced to sit facing away from the television because the table is circular, so I'm always looking at my plate and awkwardly responding to my mom's questions even though I'm uncomfortable. Even if I wanted to look at the TV, the channel they usually watch doesn't interest me. That's not the actual problem though. I hate my father. There are many reasons why, but he is also an obnoxious eater and every time he takes a bite, the fork brushes up against his teeth and I can hear the sound it makes which grates on my nerves and makes me grit my teeth and want to kill someone. Every time he takes a drink of his coca cola, he makes an obnoxious sound as if he has just gone underwater for a minute and sometimes he burps loudly which grosses me out. He puts his elbows on the table and sometimes the table shudders. I know this might seem trivial to you, but you must understand, when you hate someone, everything they do is going to be a 100 times more annoying than normal. And before you ask me, ''How can you hate your father?'' There's a lot of reasons why and don't ask, and don't try to understand. I like eating with my mom, but at the dinner table I usually scarf down the food quickly without enjoying it and run back to my room because I can't stand my father. Sometimes my mom lets me eat in my room, but sometimes she thinks it's because I want to stay on the computer, which is not the case. If I try to explain to her, she won't understand. I didn't even eat dinner today because I can't even muster up an appetite. My mom thinks it's because I have my period.",14Jun2018,1
307,"Last year I spoke to this girl for months. I loved her and she told me she also loved me however we never properly got into a relationship. I asked her out after she told me she loved me and she said no due to the fact she felt she would be shit in a relationship. She told me to leave her for a bit and I did.

Recently I've tried reaching out to her again, she's in the same friends group as I am so I see her on a daily basis but now it's just incredibly awkward however recently it has been getting better between us hence me reaching out to her again. It's difficult also because she nearly never uses her phone so there's no way to contact her without going round her house directly. I'm quite friendly with her father too as we occasionally have a chat if we see eachother.

The thing is, she once said she loved me and to leave her be for a bit and I did, but I just can't get her out of my head. We flirt when we see eachother but it's incredibly difficult to interact with eachother without there being the occasional awkward silence which throws her off completely due to her having anxiety disorder. I think I still love her but I don't know what to do. How do I progress further? I really like her and I want her to like me the same way too. My friend has told me to ask her on a date which I have but it's difficult to plan it due to her not using her phone often.

I really really like her but should I just give up on her instead? ",14Jun2018,1
309,"So I have an internship opportunity with this Republican SuperPAC I have no doubt that I'd learn a lot but the only thing is, I'm a left leaning independent. 


I doubt I'll be having to picket Democratic rallies or sign off on Pro-Life forms since I'd just be an unpaid intern, but I can't help but think that in the future, I'd want to leave this off my resumé and of course I'm only taking this internship to build my resumé. 

Personally I'm more into foreign policy and I have another internship opportunity with a foreign policy NGO, however it's not a sure thing yet and I feel it'd be foolish to stake my hopes on a potential opportunity when the one  I'm currently presented with is more concrete. 

I realize I'd still learn a lot of the same skills I'd need for a Congressional job, but I wonder if affiliation alone is enough for me to hesistate.

310,"Hi everyone. So I volunteer at the boys and girls club in the Kindergarten-first grade room. I absolutely love it! I love the kids to death and I might even be getting offered a job there when the school year starts up again

Here’s my problem: I’m not sure if I should take it or if I should stop going altogether. I say this because everyday, it is a struggle for me to want to get up and go there. It’s only a 30 minute walk from my place so the walk isn’t exactly the problem. Sometimes it is but that’s just me being lazy. But most of the time it’s just the fact that I don’t want to go. So for example, I need to be there today at 12:30 and I just woke up for the day. I’m still super tired and I know for a fact that if I laid back down I would sleep for another few hours. 

I love when I’m there but I hate having to get up for it. Is this what all jobs are like? What do I do? I don’t want to stop all of a sudden and miss out on a job opportunity, because they really like me and it would make me look very bad. On the other hand, it’s just really wearing me out to be there every day for five hours without a break.

316,"Hey all,

I posted a day or two ago about picking your own engagement ring, and it’s safe to say I officially have no chill about it. Although I will say it’s mostly excitement instead of frustration. I’m just really ready to stop sitting on the secret that we have decided to do it and tell my family and friends and start planning a wedding!

So we are taking this big trip to France to celebrate my boyfriend graduating from grad school and the next chapter of our lives. And I’m really hoping he proposes in France. Sure it’s cliche, but it would be a BEAUTIFUL moment. We have a time line of before the fall because I’m moving for his career, and I don’t want to leave my job and my life without a commitment.

That being said I’m worried he won’t propose in France. I’ll still love him. I’ll still enjoy the trip, and I’ll still say yes when the time comes, but I’ll be really disappointed. Has anyone had that experience? How did you deal with it without being a pain in the ass?

I think at this point I just want to know if it’s not France so that I won’t spend the whole trip hoping for it. If it’s not then it’s fine. I just want to know.

The proposal is important to me because I’ve been sacrificing a lot for him. I’ve moved every 6 months for the last year and a half, supported him through his MBA despite the fact I was finishing law school, and now he’s taken a job on the opposite coast so I have to quit a job I really love and take another bar for him. 

I want the big moment in part because I want him to show me that he appreciates me and all the things I’m doing for us and the family we are choosing to start. And he hasn’t been very good at showing his appreciation in the last two years. (We have talked about it. He knows what I need and I’ve asked for what I want from him) He’s been getting his MBA at a top program, which is notoriously hard on relationships, and while I still love him, I am hoping for a moment that is about us and our future, not just about him. I want the beautiful moment because it will make the sacrifices easier and give me something to hold onto when it’s hard, because the CA bar will be really fucking hard.

So in sort it is about the marriage more than anything else, but the gesture would really go a long way to making me feel good while I do all these things for him. And not doing anything special would really make me feel sad given the circumstance.",14Jun2018,1

321,"I’m currently nineteen years old. Depressed, confused, miserable and frustrated. 

I got into college this year after taking two gap years due to financial and family issues. I hated every inch of it.  I dreaded going to class and I was anxiously counting the days for the semester to be over.

I made two extremely nice friends who made me get through it. Just as the semester was coming to an end, it was too much. My hair was falling off and you could see white spots on my head. I was crying out of nowhere, having mental breakdowns, I wasn’t able to focus in class as I would have anxiety attacks.

Due to this, I failed two classes. This made more miserable.

I gave myself a break and got into the gym (which I love). However, I’ve been missing my friends and I quite miss going to college. I owe about $800 to the school though, and if I want to go back this must be paid by July. (This will be hard to do, but I hope that it won’t be impossible) 

I’m currently working in a shitty place, as the job itself is not bad. The bosses, the pay and the amount of stress is a pile of shit though. However, I’ve got weekends off which is something you don’t usually get when working in a call center (which is basically the other option.)

These leads me to the following questions: Do I go back to school and continue supporting my existent business and attempt to open a new one? Or do I postpone school until January next year and support my existent business and attempt to open a new one? Meaning that I would be able  to support myself without having to invest any of my time in shitty places where it won’t be appreciated.

I must say that I do not have any support whatsoever, my parents are unemployed and even though my father has money he refuses to provide any help. I’m currently living with my mom and brother in a shitty place and with other shitty and ungrateful people (that are part of the family) that also make me miserable. The three of us are still affected by what we lived, so we are a ball made of aggression, stress and mixed emotions.

I would love to move, but I am not able to provide for a family and I refuse to postpone investing on my future just for the sake of it. I’ve already done it for two years and I don’t want to do it anymore.

Also, moving out is not ideal as I can’t afford it. That would mean bye bye to school and any other chance of growing and leaving this shitty job.

325,"We live in a well to do neighborhood. Known this neighbor and neighbor's family for over 10 years. Not super well, but our families are friendly toward eachother. Their family is college-educated, has stable income and live comfortably.  There was a period about several years ago when our family had to be out of town for months at a time to care for an ill family member. We asked this neighbor to keep an eye on the house. Everything went well, the house was looked after and nothing went missing. While we were away the neighbor messaged saying they are holding an event at their house, could they use one of our religious statues/sculpture for decoration. We agreed. When we returned we asked for the statue back. Neighbor said they like it so much they'd like to borrow it. We thought it was a little odd but we said that is fine. Our thinking was that the neighbor had been kind to us by watching over the house for several months.

A year or so later, we did a big reorganization/redecoration and figured it was time to get the sculpture back to its original location. Our polite request to the neighbor was answered initially with "" yes yes I will return it"". Over the succeeding months the answer became more of something along the lines of ""the sculpture fits so well with my home and ambiance that I cannot part with it. It has become very important to me."" We told the neighbor repeatedly that the statue is of important religious value to us. Again the neighbor agreed to return the item but never followed through.

We have always been courteous to the neighbor. We even offered to buy them a replacement statue; it was refused!

Now, the statue itself is not worth a tremendous amount --perhaps a few hundred $ at most. It is valuable to our family due to our personal connection with it over the generations.

We reached out to the local police who said they cannot help unless we formally allege a crime. Were we to do this, we do not know if/what sort of retaliation there may be. Through our interaction with this neighbor,  we believe there is a strong possibility that this neighbor may have a mental health condition of some sort.

We believe our statue remains in the neighbor's house although we have not seen it. Over the years the neighbor has purchased similar statues to decorate their property.

331,"Hi reddit, 

I work in sales for an IT company and I have a variable part of my salary according to my achievement against my targets.

This year I have started a new commission model whereby I have a team quota shared by all the members of the team instead a more contribution based individual sales quota. 
e.g in a team of 8 instead of each individual carrying a 10k sales quota, we each carry a team quota of 80k 

This team quota has 2 issues:
1) Is unachevable considering the past 3yrs data for the same account set (the trend is decreasing) - made an entire analysis proving that based on past years revenue

2) Makes me dependant on the performance of my team mates all of whom have much higher seniority ranking and hence higher base salaries. 

I have already expressed my concerns in the beginning of the fiscal year and now as it comes to an end they are confirmed by an underachievement of our team target (55% which in my company is considered disastrous)

Now I have initiated a conversation with my boss about next year’s setup and mentioned my frustration and dissatisfaction as well as the financial hit (made 15% less than previous years average).
Of course this is sales and some years are better than others, but in this case I have correctly predicted from the start this will not be realistically feasible. 

His answer was rather aggressive in saying that despite him thinking I do a great job, I need to be more of a team player and less of a cry baby. He refuses to take into account the analysis I have made or the countless warning reports I have sent throughout the year; 

I don’t have a benchmark on how the negotiation of he sales target normally happens out there but what I know is that I cannot take another year like this one.

I am speaking (without my boss knowing of course) to a few recruiters trying to headhunt me for similar jobs elsewhere and have noticed that my current salary is below market average, on top if this due to the underachievement I am not able to reach 100% of it. 

What are my options entering this negotiation what should I focus on? Should I just suck it up and hope for a better year?

333,"We've been together, with brief breaks, for about 2 years. There is so much going on that I don't feel is right, but this is my first long-term relationship so I really don't have a lot of experience here. I'm hoping someone else has been through sometime similar and can offer some good advice.


I live with him in his room at his parents' house, which honestly I hate. I'm currently unemployed, have $0 to my name, lost my car and cell phone... In short, not really in a place where I think I can take care of myself. I am literally counting the days until I return to school for the Fall 2018 Semester. 


But back to the more intimate stuff. Every day we fight, it could be little fight where he'll just tell me I'm so retarded, can't do anything right, etc. over little stuff like not being able to find what he's asking for quickly enough. It could medium like I'm the reason he never has money, because he has to buy cigarettes and weed for us. Or it could be big like he's done with me or he's just going to drop me off and never talk to me. Most of the time it is just words, but we have gotten physical with each other in the past. Specifically I was leaving with my dog after a fight and he told me I couldn't take the dog, blocked me from leaving the room, and went as far as to lay on my to hold me down and prevent me from leaving. 


Before I met this guy I had my life together for the most part. I had some debt, but I paid all my bills and I had enough savings to cover an emergency or whatever. I blew through about 3k in savings, maxed out my cards, and let everything go into collections within the first 6 mo of our relationship. He, however, doesn't save money, it's spend it until it's gone. So we normally end up with money for a few days, and then nothing until his next bi-weekly check. 


Oh, and I have herpes. I contracted that about 9 months into the relationship, most likely not from him. That was its own mindfuck. But we talked about it for a long time and he told me he would stay with me. At first I felt so disgusting I'd sleep with basketball shorts on at night. But eventually I became more comfortable with the whole thing. But I don't think he is. He never seems interested, I ALWAYS have to initiate. I've offered to use condoms to keep him safe. I've tried not initiating and waiting for him to be ready (I waited almost 3 months, he's never ready). I've tried just cuddling and kissing, anything to feel close to him. But most of the time he just says no. Sometimes he'll say yes and just look like he'd rather be anywhere else. 


But then some days are cool. We just chill, smoke a bowl, and watch TV/a movie. But then honestly I just feel like we're friends a lot of the time. 


Like I said, I'm returning to school this fall. I am getting my degree in Networking. I am planning on using part of my financial aid to get a cheap prepaid phone and service so I can start applying for work and start generating income again. But any other advice or insight?

339,"Lately I've been thinking about myself in terms of me coming into my senior year of high school vs. now that I am close to graduating. As small background, I struggled with depression last year that I did not even bother to go to a therapist about which led me to do poorly in several classes. Realizing this wasn't good, I had planned to take matters into my own hands and try to do better this year, which I have but realized that in areas that I still struggled with/am unhappy about, I've noticed a pattern. 

Once I figured out what class I would be taking and hear about said classes, I come up with thoughts like ""I wanna be that student that the teacher likes a lot"" or ""I wanna be that student that gets some of the best grades in class."" It's more the first thought than the rest, but what tends to end up happening is that somewhere, midway through the class I end up over-analyzing things and end up losing motivation. The same also occurs at my job as a lifeguard, where I went in wanting to be someone everyone liked and being one of the best guards, only to over-analyze and realize little things like ""dang my manager seems to enjoy those other employees, it's like I don't exist"" or ""geez, why am I the one getting trouble for this mistake when three other people did the same thing."" I'm starting to realize as I am typing this this maybe an ego issue, but I really want to break this mentality of expecting things because I feel as if it is the reason I end up losing motivation because things don't occur the way I expect since I am pretty sure keeping this type of mentality is going to hurt me in college. I also don't want to use depression as an excuse for anything, and feel like the issue is myself and not a mental illness.

Also, a little off topic, but I am also kind of socially awkward. I feel like I just don't know how to interact with people unless it's something like ""I need this"" or ""I have a question"" and when I do try to be friendly I don't know how to bring up a topic other than ""how's life.""

Hello,

I suppose I'm looking for people with similar situations, and hopefully a few solutions. I'm 23. I'm working a dead-end job, which I don't specifically hate but I feel very unfulfilled and very under utilized. I was blessed with a very privileged upbringing and excelled in school. Things were going swimmingly up until my first year of Uni. I should preface this with I had no mental health issues, rumblings or indications prior to this. Looking back the first red flag was the rubbish(garbage) filling up my Halls Room. I'm not joking, it got ridiculous. Eight or nine full black sacks of rubbish, in a very tightly confined room. I started drinking more. Sleeping less. Eating less. Socializing less. Very intrusive and detrimental thoughts. But the odd thing is I had no obvious stressor, I was doing quite well in my Uni classes. I had a steady relationship. I had surplus cash. I was in a great place. And then one morning, it just started. I'm now living with my parents, again. I'm in debt, living off them financially. I'm single. I'm actively damaging any relationships I have with my irritability and general cuntishness.     

I need to change. 
Specifically what I want to change:
Get out of debt and into self sufficiency, finances permitting.
Move out, finances permitting. 
Return to Uni. 
Not live in fear of another breakdown. ",14Jun2018,1
344,"Hey everyone! My name is Jamie, I'm a 17 year old girl who is studying French at A-Levels.

To be honest, I'm not doing very well. I'm behind everyone else in the class, and no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to get the pronunciations right.

So, I decided to hire a French tutor to help me. Her name is Mia, she's 28 years old, and she's VERY good at tutoring.

Anyway, the first few times she tutored me it wasn't weird. She helped a lot with the pronunciations and how to spell certain words.

But one day, while she was tutoring me, she randomly said something in French which I've never heard anyone say before. When I asked her what it meant, she ignored me and carried on tutoring as if nothing ever happened.

Curious, I decided to hop onto Google Translate after she'd left to try and find out what she said. It turns out that she said ""you're beautiful"". I didn't think anything of it at the time, and I just thought she was giving me a friendly compliment.

The next time she tutored me, she said something else randomly, and once again, she ignored me after I asked her about it. So, I went onto Google Translate again after she'd left, and this time she said ""your lips look so soft"". At this point I was wondering if she had a thing for me, but I ignored it.

The next time she tutored me, she did it again. So, once again I went onto Google Translate. This time she said ""and kissable"". I combined it with the last one to make ""your lips look so soft and kissable"".

And now, here I am, asking for advice on the whole situation. Does she actually have a thing for me? Or is it just nice compliments and nothing more?

I also have a boyfriend (we've been together for around 2 years), and I haven't told anyone about this. I do think she is an attractive woman, but I'm so confused because I've never had any sexual attraction towards a girl before.

My father-in-law is a very hard thinking German man, very very proud of his heritage. I have a young child, only 1 year old. Only child. 
FIL also has a young child of the age of 3 (31 year age gap between children) - we live in an English speaking country. 
FIL has chosen to raise his child speaking German and Japanese first, no English - his choice, in my opinion a terrible choice as the little fella can't make any friends, but it's still his choice.

I want my child to learn English first (for obvious reasons) and then when she is a little older I would like her and I to learn German together, is an experience I'm really looking forward to.

FIL insists that he will only speak German to my child and teach her German asap, but I don't want this. I've asked him not to, he started yelling at me in public. So I emailed him explaining why, but he does not care, 3 weeks later he is still yelling at my husband about it.

Long story short the guy is a total dick. Only one family member (my husband) speaks to him now, due to his bullying tactics.

I dont' want him being around bubs as he's made it pretty clear that he won't respect my wishes. But my husband insists that he still sees her weekly.

I’m perfectly fine with doing that. But then they started making me do the reception work (answering doors, taking packages, answering the phone and redirecting clients to the right people). The tea is I have mild social anxiety and I get really nervous talking to strangers on the phone — especially when they are expecting me to know exactly what to do and who to connect them to.

Up until today, I made excuses for why I never contacted them again, but I realized today that I was and still am ashamed of myself for the past 3 years. Because of this shame, I didn't want to see any of them and let them know who I had become.

360,"I must start out with an apology for being a long time lurker. (I love reading Reddit!)

I live in a nice neighborhood, in some relatively new apartments, capped by nice housing on most sides. I’ve lived here for about 7 months now and am an apartment rule follower just be be respectful of those around me.

Apparently this obnoxious cat, we’ll call him “Little Furry White Asshole” or LFWA for short, has been terrorizing the apartment complex for over a year. I had several encounters with LFWA. LFWA is ALWAYS around. During winter, it would let me pick it up, (first hint it’s domesticated and not feral) so that I could tell if it was skinny (It was solid under all that fur) and to check it it had a collar (it does not). I tried to not pay it too much attention so that it could go back home.

After 3 months, I contacted the apartment complex manager to inquire if this cat had an owner and if we could contact them. The response was a resounding no and ended up in a half hour long conversation about how LFWA has been a pain in the ass. One time it decided to take a hike up to the roof of the three story apartment and meowed for hours to be let down. It was a bit to do and involved maintenance propping a ladder in a creative way so LFWA could find its way down. 

Recently, the neighbors on the third floor of my complex and above my first floor apartment have been laying out bedding and wet can food for LFWA, enabling it to stick around. They are hardly home, so after attempts at trying to speak with them I let the apartment manager know that’s part of the reason LFWA sticks around. The manager feels they aren’t able to do anything because it’s believed that LFWA has a home in the nice homes around us. I believe this is true because LFWA got saved to look like a lion and quite frankly looks stupid. It ended up on our porch and has been sleeping in our garden and killed a bunch of lavenders I had planted from seed (garden nerd here). 

I’m annoyed and want to figure out what to do but then my bleeding heart questions its family and how they would probably miss LFWA. I have “what if” myself to oblivion. Well last Friday I came home and found a carcass of a freshly killed mole. It’s whole lower half had been munched on exposing the spine in bright crimson. LFWA looked so proud. (I understand that it’s trying to feed me in cat world). 

In addition to that days prior, LFWA threw up what looked to be like mice parts all over the front entry way. I had someone coming by to pick up something they’d purchase that I left at my front door. After the bloody mess, I contacted the apartment manager telling them that I’m a tough girl however I could not bring myself to pick up the carcass, nor could my boyfriend or the neighbor guy across the way and prayed someone else could.  Someone came over with a cardboard box and placed it over the crime scene. The problem other than being presented with a gutted mole with exposed spine was that I had to leave for a class and the person was coming to grab the box, only to have the first box they see is the on covering the death scene.... I had hoped my text to the person (who’s a stranger) would explain what box to stay away from ... sadly it didn’t not (or they misread the text).

Is it messed up to take it to the humane society? Myself and the apartment manager are super frustrated and not sure what to do and what is right. I would love any advice on how you would handle this!!

TL;DR: Little Furry White Asshole (car) lives in neighborhood, terrorizes apartment complex, leaves fresh blood kills at entry way, no one knows what to do with it, owner unknown by obviously has one, is it okay to take to humane society or is that messed up?",14Jun2018,0

I can rarely do weeknight shows, and if I do them our band needs to play first and I cannot help with load in/out. Friday and Saturday nights I'm more than happy to start whenever and will go above and beyond helping with gear. My bandmate seemed to understand.

Problem is, I have a really hard time saying no to people, and my bandmate is very high-pressure. I've been pressured into several weeknight shows, and my above terms have not been met. The last one we did was so not fun for me I am tempted to quit music. 

Yesterday my bandmate sent me another high-pressure text to play a show, though this one is on a Friday. Normally this would be ideal for me but after the last few shows I'm feeling pretty reluctant to say yes to anything, and I told her so. She apologized and said she wouldn't agree to anymore weeknight shows. I still haven't said yes or no to that upcoming Friday show. 

My question is if agreeing to this Friday show would be a bad idea. Like I said, it's actually a perfect show and I kind of want to play it, but I'm afraid I'm showing my bandmate that I can be pressured into doing anything, which up until now has unfortunately been true. ",14Jun2018,2
366,"So I have this friend, let’s call her Jane. We started working together back in November. We became pretty decent friends, mainly because she had a falling out with her entire friend group and afterwards gravitated to me after that happened. 

A little backstory with Jane - There have been three separate instances in which I had a pretty significant falling out with someone, and she remained friends with these people. Now, I’m definitely not going to tell her who she can and can’t be friends with, or force her to choose sides, but she would continuously talk about her relationships with these people to my face even after I asked her to stop because I had no desire to hear about it. In doing so, she essentially proved to me how high I rank on her totem pole of friends - that’s fine, but I made the conscious decision to keep Jane at arm’s length because I didn’t feel comfortable allowing her into my personal life knowing she remained friendly with people who were not friendly to me. 

Anyways, so back in April I left the place where we worked together (for unrelated reasons). However, one of my girlfriends that still worked there was there one night, so I stopped in to say hey. In doing so, I met Tiffany*. So Tiffany was hired after I left, but she and I really hit it off. The three of us ended up talking for over an hour (no customers in the store) and Tiffany and I exchanged phone numbers. Afterwards, Tiffany and I became practically inseparable. We have hung out every single day, I’ve become great friends with her girlfriend, they’ve both become great friends with my boyfriend, we have a really nice group dynamic and sincerely enjoy each other’s company. 

Tiffany reached out to me shortly after us becoming friends to express some concerns about Jane. She said she was unsure if Jane wanted the two of us to be friends. She said Jane had started making comments at work, such as “well you just don’t know OP like I do” or “you and OP aren’t as close and i am with OP” and when tiffany mentioned something I had told her, Jane stated “i already know that, me and OP talk all day every day we’re BEST friends” - this was an awkward development because as I’ve said, I have been keeping Jane at arm’s length and we surely don’t talk all day every day. I hadn’t even seen her in weeks when this conversation took place. 

After Tiffany and I spoke about this, I did notice Jane was acting odd when I would mention Tiffany, and then Tiffany told me that Jane had stared speaking negatively about me at work (completely out of the blue). Saying how I shouldn’t be trusted and how she wonders if I’m “fake.” This was pretty hurtful because I’ve never gone out of my way to be rude to Jane, even after everything happened with the three previously mentioned individuals.  When Tiffany and I first talked about it, we even made an effort to include her in our activities and invite her to go with us, in which she either repeatedly declined or if she did join, would make bare minimum conversation and stay on her phone all night. 

Tiffany has grown increasingly aggravated with Jane as well, because she’s constantly degrading me and Tiffany doesn’t like that Jane knows we are friends and still says the things she says. There have been two instances where Tiffany told her to stop, and yet it continues. 

Now I’m coming back to the job where Jane and Tiffany still work, and I don’t know how to handle the shift in friendships. I love Tiffany and I would not risk my friendship with her just to appease Jane, especially after Jane proved time and time again she wouldn’t do that for me. But I also don’t want to say anything to Jane about it and create more drama, even though with the way she’s been acting lately I feel like I have no choice. I’m about to be surrounded by both of them together much more frequently and I’m at my wit’s end. And advice??",14Jun2018,3

371,"Hi guys. So backstory: I moved across the country with my then-boyfriend (before he proposed) to his hometown. I knew no one here but we started bonding as a couple really closely with his old buddy from high school and his girlfriend. It was awesome cause we were at a similar place in life, had similar interests and could do couple stuff together. We can call her Tracy, and the buddy can be Peter.

Tracy and I weren’t the best of friends but I thoroughly enjoyed our time together here and sue was one of my few girlfriends out where we lived. It just worked out because the guys started getting really close and we would see each other almost every weekend or every second week. 

Fast forward to feb of this year: I get engaged. We are so excited! And my fiancé and I decide to get married in my hometown (across the country) where my family is and we share a large friend group, and plan on settling down there in a couple years. We then decide to ask Tracy and Peter to be respective bridesmaid and groomsman, as they did play a role in our life here. Obviously they are over the moon and everything is sunny and amazing! It’s going to be great because they are even planning on flying to my hometown for an extended period of time, join in on the celebrations (like bridal shower etc) and then tour around my part of the country for a bit. They will even be able to walk down the aisle together as part of the wedding party.

Well 2ish months ago they broke up. Obviously our first concern is to make sure they are ok, and be supportive friends to them. Obviously the whole wedding thing is awkward AF, but they assure us they can just go separately and still enjoy it. We nod and smile and say ok, great. But here’s the thing: Peter works a good job, we learn after they broke up that he practically supported both of them during the relationship while she didn’t have a good hold on her finances (one of the issues that lead to the breakup).  He can still support spending probably over grand total inclusive of flights, accommodations, suit rental and all that Jazz for the wedding. 

Tracy, the breakup has changed her a lot. She went from a girlfriend that completed our group of 4 to a single, ready to party, nosedive that has changed our relationship and obviously the dynamic a lot. The party side of her doesn’t bug me, but I know that she doesn’t have the $$ to make such a huge commitment with our wedding. We also have lost touch, she wants to party, meet guys from tinder and dance drunk all night with guys and copious amounts of booze and cigarettes . Me, being engaged, means I have different desires than what she has now, her past times are things I enjoyed when single but not when I’m getting married. She also just got fired from her job, she hasn’t been making good life decisions and has told me today that she is moving back in with her parents— two hours drive away from where I live. We already don’t see each other much, but now she is literally going to be gone. She doesn’t even own a car so it makes it hard to meet up. 

Honestly, I still like the girl. She was still a good friend to me but if I was asking people to be part of the wedding party today, I wouldn’t ask her. It’s a big commitment and I feel like it’s a lot of pressure on the girl, when we don’t even see each other any more. I feel like her priorities should be getting her life on track instead of being flown across the country to participate in a wedding with her ex that will cost her lots of money. I feel guilty as well feeling those things about her, and having this feeling of regret. 

I am not sure what to do, and the next steps I should take. I hope I don’t appear conceited, because I truly want her to be ok and get back on her feet but I also need someone I know I can fully rely upon for my wedding day. Do you have any suggestions or advice? Thank you

And also I made a deal with my friend that I was gonna ask her out so when he saw us together he basically made it clear to her what I was suppose to do and she said “you should just do it” but than I lost interest everything I felt for her is gone I told her I was gonna text her but i don’t feel like it anymore.

375,"I have never been allowed to get any vaccine because my parents say that they don't work. My parents reasoning is because I can become blind or disabled because of it, and to not come crawling back to her after two hours of getting one and becoming deaf.
She said the government has been shutting down these stories for years. My doctor even told her not to get them when I was born. I am injecting chemicals into my body, and actually making myself more sick, because they inject the disease into my body, making it more likely that I would get sick.
She said once I get out of the house, then I can do what I want with my body.. but the thing is, those vaccines would cause me money that I can't afford to pay by the time I can get them done. I went to my GP and tried to get them done but my mum found out because a nurse called home for an appointment to get them started and she became really angry, asking who called and I told her.. so now she monitors all of my appointments and said I can't go in without her. I really want them done. I turn 17 in 4 months.

despite all this though, I have an extremely low self esteem. I recently have been wanting to get a nose job, then lip fillers, then chin reconstruction. I must admit I, like many others my age, spend a lot of time on social media. I wonder if this media image has any part of it. 
There was this girl I used to work with at Hooters (yes I know, shut up, it was good money and I just did it for a summer season), and she had the most strikingly confident attitude. She was very very pretty, but what made everyone drool over her was simply because she carried her head held high and just walked around like she KNEW she was the one everyone was looking at. 
Then there was me; I knew I was an attractive person but not to her extent...so when I would get attention I would just feel awkward and believe it's bullshit. I think I also care a lot about what people think of me, and I wish I didn't.

Im a musician looking to rent out a cabin somewhere out in the country for a couple months to spend time developing my next album. I would love to find something small and cozy, with the essentials. The most important things are that it's somewhere near nature, more solitary, and affordable. 

It would be great if it were near a nice small town or city with friendly people, places to hike, small businesses, good coffee lol. The thing is, I dont know where to start looking. There's probably tons of spots, but where would be the most affordable? Where should I start looking where I can find a small cabin to rent for less than $1000/month? Is that too low?

I know this is kind of a weird question but I noticed this recently, or well, maybe since longer but never really gave notice about it or thought about it any deeper but most people either ignore me or speak rude to me.  


I am currently helping out at this festival and was standing with a group of friends and my mate made a pretty bad joke but all seemed to laugh about it. 5 Minutes later I made an ironic joke (which came out clear I meant it ironic) but no one laughed they just said ""yeah right and who should pay for it?"" ... Like I didn't even want an answer, it was just a friggin' joke lol.   


Now the best part comes: the same joke I made this dude told someone else about ten minutes later and the whole group laughed.

Evelyn

Rita

Ava

So I've had a few days to clear my mind before I write this. It is important to know my myself and the other people here share a group chat. The other day, our friend Ava sent a message that said goodbye, she had sent to Evelyn that she felt everyone hated her and she needed to leave. I made a message asking if anyone knew what was up because I was worried about a friend. Rita, who is Ava's older sister made a post stating that she shouldn't have to be up this late with her sister who was crying (we assume this is Ava although I've never gotten a clear answer). Evelyn later comes into the chat and writes this huge messages about how she thinks Rita is the world's biggest liar and she needs to stop playing this game to which the two get into this heated argument and somehow it turns on me (Layla). Evelyn states that she thinks I'm everyone in the group chat and that she has this proof from Izzy because we (Rita and I) have similar photo cards of a k-pop band. To which I stated that I guessed no one could have the same card. After about 3 hours of bickering, I finally got this overwhelmed child (I say, child because she's much younger than me and that's how I refer to people) to calm down to which she stated yet again that she believed Rita was playing as everyone in the chat. Carrie comes on about 2 days later and sees this overblown 200+ message chat room stating that a bunch of it is bullshit and she can't believe Evelyn would become so hateful.

Of course, now Evelyn has us all blocked but I want some advice, how do you think is an appropriate way to handle this? I've been ignoring the situation hoping fumes will calm down but they don't seem to as Ava has not returned to our chat, Rita is ignoring everyone now, and I haven't heard anything from Carrie in days. I feel like since I'm one of the oldest in this situation it's appropriate for me to find some kind of way to maybe work it out?

I don't want to bore you with details, so let's just say I became addicted to video games and isolated myself, and also failed out of university.

Up until today, I made excuses for why I never contacted them again, but I realized today that I was and still am ashamed of myself for the past 3 years. Because of this shame, I didn't want to see any of them and let them know who I had become. It also stopped me from forming any new friendships.

I hit rock bottom about 6 months ago, and since then I have been improving a lot. Put an end to my gaming addiction, got in shape, work full time and am enrolled at a new college for September. However I still carry that shame of my failures in the past and it is holding me back from moving forward. 

I'm going to a music festival with my friend who I mentioned above, and we recently found out we might be rooming with some of the old highschool crew. Initially I was scared and wanted to convince my friend that we should room separately, but now I'm uncertain.

I’ve never been ok since I was a kid, I had symptoms of OCD. Until now I’m taking pills for it. When I was 9 I’ve tried to run away multiple times, something was never right in my household. I grew up with a father that wasn’t around unless he’s coming home from drinking, and a mother that use to hit me and my older sister. My mother doesn’t hit us anymore, she just uses empty threats. I don’t know if they love me anymore, when they found out about my self harm my father left to watch tv, and my mother left to call the therapist. I was never asked why I did it, just told that I have a great life and that I’m hurting myself for no reason.

I was basically raised by my older sister, she’s was like another mom. Even though my real mother would buy me toys, etc my older sister would give me the love I desperately wanted from my parents. Since she moved out I’ve wished to be part of her family, as weird as it sounds I’ve wished to be her daughter. I don’t mind my parents at this point, they’ve been in my life for years now and I’m use to the emptiness. I’ve been criticized and mocked by my family, they’ve made my uncomfortable and scared but it’s been years and I’m use to it.

I’m used as a doll by everyone, I feel like I’m everyone’s play toy. Because I just give in too much, cause I’m scared of what would happen if I don’t. I still self harm, my therapist asked me many times if I still do but I tell her I don’t. I don’t trust any of the people that are trying to help me, and I just lie to them cause I can never get the words out of what’s happening. I feel like they would all look at me crazy, if I tell them everything and that’s the last thing I want. But I hate going to bed every night wanting to die, or runaway or just disappear. I’ve been alone for my whole life only trusting my sister, but now people want to help me.  

I feel like I’m drowning cause I’ll be judged if I tell the truth, if my parents know then they’ll tell everyone again. I’m worrying every day of my life, everything hurts. I feel like I’m just doing this for attention, but I’m not. But there’s a voice in my head that mocks me, and judges my weight and tells me to hurt myself.

396,"About two months ago, I got hired at a new job.

Within a week of working there, the head manager had already given me the ""run-down"" of how their store's location is known for drama, as well as disclosing the ""personalities"" of the rest of the management team and some staff members. I knew almost instantly that professionalism was not a concern to them.

About 3 weeks after I was hired, I received a promotion from the district manager (one step ahead of our store manager). Apparently this was unbelievable to the store manager and assistant management, as they all made condescending comments to me for two weeks. I laugh it off and continue working.

After being promoted to full-time, I realize that the store manager cannot go a single day without gossiping about another employee, instigates constantly, and it truly feels like she thinks she is playing The Sims with the store. The assistant managers ""warn"" me every week that the manager will only do bare minimum, will not give constructive criticism directly but will gossip and intentionally not schedule employees that have upset her.

The worst part, in my opinion, is the fact that she is open about texting/snapchatting a married manager from another location, tell us all that he is known for being a cheater and she wants to ""win"" by hooking up with him, and also says similar things about our district manager (also married, great guy). BUT WHO CARES?!!

Since I started working, I stand there listening when I'm spoken to, nod my head, and do my f*cking job. Why does drama have to be such a central focus of a store? I had a meeting with the district manager today about a potential SECOND promotion, and he could tell I wasn't saying something.

I hesitated to bring up my concerns because we're losing another assistant manager, so if the multiple occasions of non-professionalism and inappropriateness I've compiled got the manager fired, the store would be screwed. I did not list every incident here because I truly want advice, and don't want to ramble.

He spent the time to teach me every job from tiling, plumbing, joinery etc saving me thousands and id like to get him a gift which is meaningful or something he wouldn't buy him self but i'm at a loss what to buy him, he enjoys he motorbike, i was gonna book him a track day but you need full leathers which he doesn't own, next option he wants a new helmet but i'm not sure which one which size and i'm not 100&amp;#37; sure he knows himself, so then i thought id book isle-man tt but the ferry crossings are fully booked for next year so im stumped and advice id be grateful ",14Jun2018,1
400,"I have this friend that I’ve known since junior year of high school (so about 4 years) and it’s always felt like a really close friendship. We see each other often, we still talk a fair amount over social media, and we still have a great time whenever we meet up but I feel like something isn’t quite there anymore. As close as we still are, I kinda get the sense that he doesn’t really appreciate my company on the level that he used to. It’s hard to explain, it feels like we’re really close but at the same time it wouldn’t be that big of a deal if one day I just went awol. I don’t know, I’m probably not making it very easy to understand but what to you think if you get where I’m coming from? Should I ask him what’s up? Should I leave it alone? Should I test my theory? Am I reading too much into it, or are we just growing apart? Maybe just taking a simple break would do the trick. I don’t know, I’d love to get some outside opinions because I don’t want to end up doing or saying something I’ll regret.",14Jun2018,1
401,"My neighbor has two cars: one goes in the garage and the other in the street. But instead of by their driveway on the other side of their lot, they park their car straddling our property line. Keep in mind they could park at least two cars in the space they pass AND parking where they do means that they have to walk through the grass instead of their sidewalk. At first I rolled my eyes at the strangeness but it has continued everyday for over a year. 

What really bothers me is that drivers seat looks directly into my bedroom window when they park it there which makes me super uncomfortable on a daily basis. But now they have started mowing into my yard by about 2-5 feet to make it look like they’re not parking too much in my yard. I planted shrubs so they would stop mowing my yard but they still park in front of the shrubs. 

It’s so weird. I’ve tried to talk to them about it but they will go inside if my fiancé or I walk outside (even if they are grilling, they will immediately tell the kids to go inside and they shut the door)

There’s nothing illegal about it but I really don’t like my neighbor parking in front of my bedroom. I don’t know how to politely ask what the hell especially when they run away when we come outside. ",14Jun2018,2
402,"Hey, I work at a small company and we have a guy there that has been a problem for a while. He is constantly lying, passing off incomplete work and being a pain all while kissing the bosses ass. The boss is the CEO and calls the shots and doesn't see his BS and backs him &amp;#37;100 and gives him preferential treatment. There has been tension building lately and it finally came to a head today in a meeting with him and another coworker about how to deal with the issues and he blew up, threw a tantrum and quit. The boss chased after him and I guess told him o go home and cool off and come back but now, finally, it's a big HR issue with a bunch of us because it was very public. The boss wants him to come back and wants us to give him one more shot. He has thrown tantrums before and I don't feel like it is a safe environment to work in. 

Some side info that is in my head causing concern is he's talked about (bragged about) all of his concussions from playing football in highschool and college and with his mood swings I am worried he is mentally unstable. He was out for a week MIA and it turned out he was in the hospital from popping pills. He says he was out partying with friends and took too many. Not sure what to do with all  this information. I can go to HR and people have before but I don't think HR has as much power in small companies. HR has said that they don't like him either but the CEO intervenes and deals with it himself.

What can I do besides quit?",14Jun2018,1

405,"My boyfriend and I have been dating off, and on for a year, and a half now. When I first met him, he had been prescribed xanax for years to help treat anxiety. He was also an alcoholic, and did not mind mixing the two even though it can be fatal. I didn't know that he was on xanax specifically for quite a while, and he would make up lies as needed. Our relationship has not been the healthiest, but up until recently a lot of things had changed. He has been off of xanax for over a year now, and drinks much less. Consistently throughout our relationship, we have fallen into the same cycle every few months. Where he suddenly wakes up with a completely different attitude, is unhappy, wants to be sleeping around, and be on his own. So we break up, and then we wind up back together. I have tried being in an open relationship even though it was not what I wanted. In the past we have come to the mutual understanding that this is him pushing me away, and that there is still something that he is not addressing with his mental health. He has shared how his parents believe he is bipolar as well, and has always used this to make sense of the sudden mood swings. A few months ago, after everything had been going great for quite awhile we decided to move in together. Ever since, things have gotten worse, and his symptoms are rapidly progressing. Over the littlest things he will freak out- and I mean freak out- hitting things, screaming, pushing me, and nothing that I do calms him down. The next morning he usually feels terrible. My family, and friends think I am crazy for staying with him, especially given that my Father is bipolar, and I grew up seeing this shit all of the time. He has continuously reassured me that he wants to do something about his mental health whether it be seeing a psychiatrist alone or going to couples counseling... It was this reassurance that made me think I'd be ok to move in with him. We keep hitting one big road block. He is hesitant about doing anything about his mental health because for years he has wanted to join the peace corps. He knows that if he is diagnosed as bipolar he will be automatically denied. I thought that there was no way they could discriminate because of that, but they do. I don't understand why he is willing to sacrifice his mental health to gain experience with this organization, but here we are. Anyways, out of nowhere he has fallen back to the same cycle of wanting to be alone. The last time this happened was in December, but it was far less complicated since we were not signed onto a lease together. He is my first love, and I do not know what to do. I have tried talking him through it because this is not the first time, and I have also sought out counseling for us. He isn't going to do anything about being bipolar, and it legitimately worries me with the symptoms he has been displaying. I hate to have to fight so hard for our relationship, but I know it is his mental state given that this has happened, and he always begs to get back together. I want to be able to solve this, and not keep encountering the same problems. I care so much about him, and I am not willing to just give up on him.",14Jun2018,2
406,"Its something I'm pretty insecure about, actually. I'm carrying a lot of debt - nearly $45K - all student loans. I've been out of college for almost 3 years now and have only been able to tread water between low pay and unexpected financial burdens. I'm in a good place financially now, and am earning a pretty good salary; enough to start making real progress against those loans, but it's honestly pretty embarrassing to be sitting on THAT MUCH debt at 27 years of age

I'd hoped that, somehow, I'd be debt free before settling down with with someone and merging finances - it isn't turning out that way. Its hard not to feel like a fuck up when you owe $45K - and it seems rather obscene assume that someone would consider merging lives with someone so weighed down by debt - I mean its not even like I'm a doctor or lawyer after accruing that debt, just a normal white collar professional. I see it as my responsibility, when merging lives with my GF, to set us up for security and financial success - which is pretty absurd with this much debt.

Still, I think its probably healthier to try to understand and tackle this shame rather than delude myself into thinking I could push my SO away until I'm in a good enough state to live with.",14Jun2018,1

409,"Hey,

So a male sales director at my company got incredibly drunk and was either given or paid for a prostitute themselves and was celebrating with her in our hotel lobby during a sales event (out of hours). Ultimately the director was so out of it the next day he apparently lied and said he flew home to deal with a personal issue. The sales director is married.

I’m struggling on whether I should bring this up to my boss, because A) I left earlier in the night before the woman arrived, but 2 coworkers (who don’t feel comfortable speaking up themselves) told me the day after what happened, so I wasn’t first party to it. Then B) my boss has worked with the sales director closely in a previous company. Adding to that, so did the head of sales.

I don’t believe the company bosses know about this, and I’m struggling to be the first to mention this behaviour. Similar behaviour has happened with a previous coworker, who was fired for actually sending out photos of the act to people in the company (again, guy from the same previous company, sort of incestuous hiring here).

My coworkers don’t want to speak out about the incident because they are afraid everyone at the top is close to one another. Any ideas on what to do here would be appreciated.",14Jun2018,0
410,"Throwaway account.

Recently, my older sister has been getting herself into all kinds of trouble. I won't go into detail about it but it is causing a lot of trouble for me and my mum. Whenever we try to talk to her about it, she just gets defensive and shuts herself off from us. And now she's recently been clinically diagnosed with depression, she just uses that as an excuse for all of her actions.  She can't take any criticism at all and will ignore any suggestions we may have that contradict her own, especially when considering I'm ""the younger brother so I don't know anything"". I know if she carries on down the path she's headed, things are only going to get worse for both her and us. Is there anything I can do?",14Jun2018,2

415,"TLDR: I'm a 23 year old female and my ex is a 26 year old male. We've been together for just over two years now and it's the longest relationship for both of us. We've taken a break early on in the relationship and got back together within a week. Recently we had an argument and afterward he said he saw qualities in himself he didn't like. He also explained that he's extremely unhappy with his job, has connected with me more than anyone else he dated, feels like he's grown a lot emotionally with me, but feels like he'll end up hurting me and isn't sure it'll end well and wanted to break up. He said he might want to start dating again in the future but no promises. I'm not entirely sure what to make of this. In the past when I've gotten this talk they come back soon. I know that sometimes people just need some space to work on themselves outside of a relationship and may want to come back later. On the other hand, I seriously do not like the idea of being on again off again - though if it's for the reason I just mentioned I think I could deal. I'm not sure if I should wait... should I just write off the relationship as a failure or should I stay open to us getting back together. 

More details: Our argument started with me complaining that when we were on a phone call and I got annoyed (it was something small, I can't for the life of me even remember what it was about) he said he wanted to hang up. I told him that it hurt my feelings that he'd want to hang up instead of talk to me about it and it was a little difficult to get the message across. He's not the most empathetic guy and I know that so it wasn't too big of a deal. After I'd vented some emotions he said that I should get a new job and I said I needed a break. He thought I meant a break from the relationship, but I was just talking about work. The next day he responded (thinking I'd broken up with him) that I was right and that he's been acting in ways he didn't like about himself. Fast Forward a bit and we were pretty ok, but I brought up a trip we'd talked about going on (in hindsight I should have just assumed he wouldn't be ready for it). We then had a *the talk*. In the beginning of our relationship, we started off casually on more of a fwb deal. I thought this was fine and he even said that's what he wanted at the time, but now he says he has issues about the way our relationship started and that it kind of messed up his respect for our relationship. He then mentioned how he felt confused because he felt more comfortable and connected to me than anyone else, but some part of him wasn't sure. He said he'd noticed qualities about himself that he didn't like and didn't know if he could change. I assured him that I know the feeling as I have chronic depression. At another point he said that he didn't want to hurt me and felt like he might cheat on me at some point down the line and he'd never had that feeling in a relationship before. So yadda yadda, he thinks we should stop and that he'd still want to be friends and maybe (just maybe- not probably) try again if I wanted to in the future. I asked him if he thought that it was just that he wasn't in to me anymore, if he wanted to work on himself, or what and he said none of that sounded quite like what he felt. I am surprised he opened up this much as he's not one to easily explain his emotions usually. I'm not sure how to handle this. In the past I'd never even consider breaking up and getting back together with someone. I'd never consider remaining friends after breaking up. In my relationship before this we broke up on similar terms. He came back 3 months later explaining that he had his personal issues and realized he was taking them out on me and our relationship (i.e. he tended to gain weight during relationships, got injured and gained weight while with me so blamed the relationship) and wanted to reconnect. I hardly considered it. But this time I feel like I want to stay friends, and maybe if the cards align we could try again. The other part of me thinks that's dumb and can't escape the thought that he just doesn't want me. Should I just do what my gut is telling me and stick around?",14Jun2018,1
