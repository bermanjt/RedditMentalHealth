1,"Hey so to introduce myself I’m a teenage female living in a house with a family of five. 

The story starts a few months back when I’m heading to an appointment. I’m standing in my living room which for reference is on the second floor of my house with a row of large windows looking onto the street. 

As I’m going to pick up my bag I notice something unusual down on the street. Across is a shiny red wheelchair with a figure sitting in it. I stand there in plain view just staring because well to be honest at first I didn’t think it was a living person. There was no movement just staring at me, not even a flinch. 

At some point when my mother comes to ask me if I’m ready  my mother notices aswell. She wonders if we should do anything but decide to precede downstairs and onto our driveway which faces the street. He doesn’t make any movement to get our attention, he doesn’t move at all. 

When we come back a few hours later he’s still there. Now this starts the saga of him appearing every few days just staring into my house. However I’m not entirely sure this is exactly where it starts, just the first time we noticed.

Here we are today. My younger sister wanted me to take her to go get freezies at the store down the street and he’s there. This time he’s moving, just lifting his arms occasionally. To give a picture he watches my house from across the street on the only sidewalk which has a perfect view into my fishbowl living room and dining room. I don’t know what do to anymore, I think part of the reason I’m posting is cause I’m more comfortable if someone even a stranger knows how I feel.

To anyone wondering what my parents are doing, they notice sometimes just not as often as me and I’ve talked them down from confronting him, some weird protective instinct in me doesn’t want them anywhere near him. I seem to be the only person who feels this way or notices as often. ",13Aug2018,52

She’s going to Missouri to be with an ex. What do I say to her? I’m no Shakespeare, but I do have a way with words. Just not the ability to coherently put them together when I talk to her.

5,"So I don’t know if this is in the right place but hopefully it is...

I’ve (22) been in my current job for a number of months and I’ve recently been talking to a female coworker (25) her friends in the office have told me about her interest and it’s obvious for me to see. The problem is that I’m extremely nervous/introverted especially around her, I find it difficult to hold conversation or start any at all. I do like her as a person but I’m worried nervousness may come across as disinterest.

Does anyone have any advice as to how to start or hold conversation in my situation? Anything about nerves and shyness would also be appreciated.

8,"Alright. A little while back someone added me on Kik and started hitting me up. I SHOULD STATE I AM UNDERAGE. Eventually she sent me 3 nudes (without me asking) and then asked me to send some back. I told her I'm not into that stuff and it's too risky for me. eventually she grinded me down into sending a picture of my underwear. I told her not to put it anywhere and she agreed. yet I am flipping the absolute fuck out. I went on to Kik and changed my onscreen name away from my real name, but I'm thinking about deleting my account so she doesn't have access to the texts anymore. what should I do??

9,"School is starting again, all summer I've been panicking on not having enough money to buy my kids back to school clothes. I've been putting $5 to $10 aside every chance I get because I remember how much new school clothes are important to kids. This is a big year for both my kids, ones a senior and one is going in to middle school. Kids have been cruel in the past and I don't want my kids to go through that again. I wasn't able to save as much as I had hoped to but thankfully they have gotten a few clothing items and a new pair of shoes each. The problem (amongst many other issues I have going on) is that recently an old friend has confided in me that they have not been able to get their son any new school clothes, and he is also starting middle school. I saw him and the only pair of shoes he has are in tatters. I have just enough $ left to buy my kids new backpacks (theirs are pretty worn out) but instead, I'd like to get my friends son a new pair of shoes at least (I don't want him to be bullied and I want him to at least feel good about getting a much needed new pair of shoes). My friend never asks for help (I get it because I'm the same way) so how do I go about showing up with new shoes for him without my friend feeling embarrassed, upset or like I'm trying to ""pity"" her son and trying to force her to accept ""charity"". I dont want her getting mad and refusing to accept any help. Bottom line is she knows how bad off I am financially so I don't want her to turn down a gift for her son because of it. Any advice how I should approach this with her without her getting mad and turning me down? I'd really appreciate any ideas on this, and I thank you in advance for any and all help/suggestions :)",13Aug2018,1
10,"My BF bought something from a website about two weeks ago. A couple days after he ordered, they emailed him saying his order was flagged because it was suspicious and that he would need to send a picture of his ID to complete the order or they could just refund. He asked for a refund. They said it would be issued in 1-5 business days. It's now over a week later and he still hasn't received the refund. We contacted the website and they said that the 1-5 day timeline was based on their general understating of banks and that they did issue a refund, and he needs to contact his bank because the issue is on their end. His bank is Bank of America. 

Does this all sound normal? It seems kind of a long time to wait for a refund. ",13Aug2018,6
11,"Hi,

I'm currently enjoying a working holiday in Australia and am about to start an online course to qualify as a Personal Trainer (Certificate 3/4). I have two important questions regarding this path of education:

Will this certificate be acknowledged abroad? I am from Germany but am contemplating relocating to Australia or other parts of the world.

Does being a Personal Trainer qualify me for a sponsorship in Australia that could lead to the acquisition of a Permanent Residency ? The website of the government only lists the subcategory ""Trainer"" and unfortunately they did not respond to my email enquirers nor was I able to get through to them via phone to clarify this.

I am grateful for any kind of information you can provide, thanks in advance.",13Aug2018,2

Situation: So my back has been hurting an insane amount for the past five days. I’ve got bulging discs from getting hit by a car while walking across the street, and while usually I can ignore the chronic pain, sometimes it flairs up to an unbearable amount for a day or two (usually weather changes). This time, the pain is working hella overtime. I’ve missed two days of work for it, and seen a chiropractor to start treatment soon. In the meantime, I tried going to work today and while I made it through, I was in intense pain the entire time and I just don’t think I can do it again. 

Proposed Solution: I have some hydrocodone and ibuprofen prescribed, and was wondering if it would be a good idea, as a front end person at a library, to take these and go to work.

I don’t know how much worse this is going to get before it possibly gets better. First “real” session with chiropractor should be tomorrow after work. I can’t just use sick time forever. What if I never get fixed...? Thus, hydrocodone at work? Worst that could happen? ",13Aug2018,2

16,"I’m in a bit of a predicament. I just started a job as a software engineer after graduating. I really don’t like it so far. I never really liked my major much and did it mostly for the money but I found some things fun. I don’t think I’ll enjoy the work in the future and can see myself being miserable. In addition my coworkers are nice but they’re not the type I’d be friends with. The money is great but that’s about it. I just find myself being so incredibly bored and hating it when we’re talking about work related things and after my first day I honestly cried on the way home because I hated it. It’s a 8-5 job 1 hour from my house so I have a 6am-6pm day. It seems to be a high stress job and very demanding, with them already talking about how I will have to stay late and come in weekends for the next month due to deadlines.

I have the opportunity to go back to my old job at a golf course through high school and college for the past 7 years and work there. In a few years I am guaranteed a higher up head mechanic position which is something I really enjoy and do on my free time which would make just as much money as I do now. It will be a few years of seasonal work but i will then have a full time job I love and I love the people who work there, and it is a 6-2pm job so I have a 5:15-2:15 day as it is very close to home. It is very low stress and I have a lot of fun there, even if I’m tasked with something I don’t like that day.

My problem is even though I’m 99% sure I want to do this and my family and friends have told me I should go back to my old job and go for it rather than be stuck in an office all day, I just don’t want to look back in a few years and regret what I’ve done.  In addition I’ve recently broke up with my long time girlfriend after I found out she cheated on me for a very long time with one of her guy friends, and we were planning on getting engaged very soon and marrying, which is another reason why I wanted this higher paying job and a good career right now. And I feel like if she was still with me then I could get through this and stick with it, as I had great motivation. As this has been a huge blow to me and I’ve been very unhappy in general I just don’t want this to be what’s really the problem, but I really just don’t want to go back to my job at all and I dread it. I feel like if I want to be happy then I have to quit this job and go back to my other one. I just want to be sure that’s what I want. Sorry for the long post I just have a lot to say. ",13Aug2018,2

Something I noticed was that she was pretty comfortable being close to me and didn’t really flinch when we were close and vice versa.

If this adds different context, when I met her she was with a small group of friends so I guess that changes the tone.

35,"Ive been seeing Mark for about 5 months now, we've had a couple ups and downs but for the most part everything has gone great. 

We are both of legal drinking age, and we often drink together. When we first started dating we went on a lot of dates playing pool at the nearby bar, and I didnt think anything of it because it was a running joke between us that we both suck at pool. When we're out we never drink enough that we cant drive home. Its incredibly light, maybe a couple beers.

But Mark is a chef at a high-er end restaurant. It seems like he's really close work-friends with a couple of the bartenders, and he would occasionally talk about how if he was having a rough day at work, the bartender would slip him a drink or two or even a shot, and I always assumed it was at the end of his shift.

Recently Mark has been battling some pretty serious depression, a lot of stuff has been happening to him recently including money problems (unrelated to this situation). I feel like he's been using alcohol to numb any pain he's feeling, and when he does drink he opens up everything he's feeling. Its quite overwhelming. Im most concerned though because he's gone from a drink or two at work to getting completely DRUNK at work, on the regular, in the middle of his shifts. More often than not when he tells me hes done at work he texts me that he's off, and if he doesnt openly admit he's drunk, its still really noticeable. 

First and foremost if he doesnt change he will lose his job. Secondly I'm growing increasingly uncomfortable with how emotionally erratic and depressed he is while he's drinking. I need to talk to him about his behavior but I know it can be incredibly difficult with people dependant on alcohol.

If it ruins our relationship I'll be sad but I can get over it. Im just worried for his health, safety, and job security.

43,"My mom has had a tough life, working as a real estate agent for 30 or so years without any real success. She has tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, along with a $400,000 mortgage she only paid 1/5 off, and she has no way to retire at her age (55). She can't even afford to see a doctor because of how expensive it is. I've lived all my life with her, and as a 23 year old recent college graduate, I have been focused mainly on trying to figure out my life. 

She has done so much for me, but I never had a way to repay her or alleviate the financial hardships she has to go through. So, out of a sense of guilt, I decided years back to figure out how to be rich. And to make it easier for me to deal with the sense of obligation, I figured once I am successful I could go do the things I wanted with my life (go traveling, have time to learn to play the piano, live my life).

Fast forward to now, and I have a chemical engineering degree, with a somewhat decent paying entry-level job (living at home, paid $66k). I have my debts all paid off, and I amBut, to this day, I haven't made any real progress in terms of being an entrepreneur, except make plans (learning some programming, compiling some ideas to try out, and giving promises to my mom that I'm just looking for the right idea to start). I don't know, maybe I'm just a pathetic coward or maybe I'm just not meant to be an entrepreneur. After all, I'm quiet, introverted, and boorish. Do I really have what it takes to be successful? And what if I'm not successful? How long before I even find success or give up? 5 years? 10? 20? Hell, I'm not even that interested in most of my ideas. Would I be willing to throw away my life to just work on being rich and successful for my mom's sake? What about what I wanted to do with my life?

What DID I want to do with my life? I remember the first time I felt a sense of yearning for a different life was from a young age when I saw a picture of this lighthouse, looking out to the sea. I can't really explain it, but it left a deep impression on me to this day. I held onto the scene like it was supposed to mean something, and I made a sort of promise to myself to find out what that was.

And I might've found something to help me figure that out. Back in college, I found a possible career path in oceanography/meteorology working for the NOAA Corps. I could work as a third mate or navigator on a research vessel to see different oceans and skies, and possibly find my calling, working with the equipment on ship and understanding what the research was like. I could get aviation training after 3 years to maybe even be a hurricane hunter.

Of course that isn't to say that working at the NOAA would mean I'd be poor (I at least know the NOAA Corps gets paid on the military scale). But, I know that my mom would be disappointed in me (I already talked to her about it, and she couldn't understand and just felt angry/disappointed). And I knew that I wouldn't be able to forgive myself for abandoning her, without any form of compensation. And technically, I am eligible to work in the NOAA Corps so long as I start before I'm 42 (need to be able to serve 20 years before turning 62).

45,"I have been living abroad for several years, first as a student then as a worker. I have had visa issues several times and it’s happening again. This time, I’m not sure if it will work out and am trying to prepare for this reality. 

The purpose of this post is to see if I’m being unreasonable. Some of my friends think I’m just here running away from “real” life in the US but I feel like I’m living out my dream and being young and transitioning. Should I stay where I am (which has been a struggle), move somewhere new (where I can have better opportunities in the long run),  or move back home (where I know I will have good opportunities now).

I have a few options:

My visa could get renewed and I stay here, will need to find a new job or get promoted, but I will probably have the same issue next year, or less if it’s only an extension. I currently have three interviews set up but I’m not sure if they would qualify me for the visa. 

I love where I live, I have a good circle of friends, it’s beautiful, I’m VERY comfortable financially in a lower skill job. I have had bad relationships and depression before coming here, but having them here, plus visa panics and a poor job market make it harder to cope. I feel like it’s difficult to really start a career here since my skills don’t match the job market. I considered online classes but don’t follow through. 

I’ve thought about moving to Germany or Asia to upskill and save money. My family and friends at home thinks I should move back (duh) while my friends here are supportive of whatever I do. My more travelled friends think I’d like Germany (where I can go to college basically for free), and my closest people just want me to stay here forever. 

I personally would love to upskill in Germany, learn German, do some part time work at startups and multinationals, come out in 3 years with a BS in comp sci and MS in project management and have a really successful career. I can also learn online while teaching English in Taiwan. My mom thinks I need to grow up (I’m 25). I’m also afraid of the stress of visas again. 

I’d also be ok with going back to my hometown (near a major US city) and getting a good paying job and really starting my career. I’d miss having 5 weeks of holidays and not needing a car, affordable health insurance and easy, cheap travel. I also don’t have a ton of friends living around there anymore but I’d make new ones. 

Canada was another option. Really I just think the US is expensive with poor work/life balance and just a general disregard for their citizens. Nothing personal. Maybe I’m running away, or maybe I’ve just been spreading my wings. 

I’m trying to both have backup plans ready and also try to make a decision and get balls rolling. Because this stress is getting old.

Two months ago I totally busted both my knees (patellafemoral pain syndrome) and haven't really been able to do anything that I used to without a considerable degree of pain. That means no competition, no hiking trips, no anything that I know as my passion.

50,"Both my partner and I live in a 2br/2bath 1,025sq ft apartment. We're currently paying a total of $1092 in rent. We've been having a hard time financially making it while we fufill the leanth of this lease. So we've offered to rent out our spare bedroom to an aquaintance of hours. My partner initially wanted to charge him $500 a month but the roomy felt that that would be a bit tight on him so we decided on $400 a month insted. 1092 split amongst the three of us is $364 a month so an even $400 is the least we'd be willing to accept in payment. My partner and I seem to disagree on how it would be best to have the new roomy pay every month, I want the $400 payment upfront meanwhile my partner is suggesting offsetting some of the bills by assigning all of the electric bill and internet to the roomy and either pay the remaining balance in purchasing groceries until he's paid the full $400. I personally would rather it be paid upfront, however I'm willing to accept 2 payments of $200 each since he gets paid bi-weekly and is part time barely making more than minimum wage. I've seen far to many Judge Judy episodes to know this can turn messy real quick if not handled properly. I would rather the roomy pay us with money orders rather than cash or a personal check. However my partner is telling me that by me wanting it like this that it seems like I don't trust the guy.

53,"I just got fired from a bartending job. I started working there on nights and weekends about 3 months ago. I loved it. The people, the job, the customers, everything. I interned at a law firm 9-5 and loved going to the bar afterwards to work. 

I thought everything was going really well. I was scheduled at 4:30 today, and my boss texted me asking if I could come in at 4 instead. I said sure, no problem, thinking I needed to do some extra stocking, etc. Instead, I showed up and got fired. 

I’m going into my second year of law school this week, and a couple of weeks ago, I had talked to our GM (who does the schedule with another manager) about taking my availability down to only Sunday nights. She said that would be great because most people don’t want to work Sunday nights, and that it would be good to work one regular night to build a rapport with the Sunday regulars. (It’s also important here that this place is struggling to build a staff. They constantly over-schedule people and schedule them when they’re unavailable because they just don’t have enough people on staff.)

The scheduling manager asked me to come into her office and started explaining the availability, said that Sunday was a pretty sought after shift, and that they don’t have room in the schedule for someone working one night a week. I said that’s no problem and we can change up the availability if that’s an issue. I had only put it in the official book because the GM said she fully supported and was glad that I chose Sunday nights. 

Then she said there’s another reason, that there was a complaint that my tone has been condescending towards a coworker and for that reason, I’m not a good fit at the bar. I didn’t know what to say; I was shocked and felt somewhat blind-sided. I’d never heard anything about this and got along really well with everyone. We had a great rapport; some of us would get beers/smoke the occasional joint outside of work even. I had a group of regulars that came in every Sunday, and we’d get along great. 

I can only think of one situation where I might have come across that way. I had come in off the clock to grab a pair of sunglasses I had left the night before. It was decently busy and the bartender was in the back. Someone asked me if I could make them a drink. Since I wasn’t on the clock and not allowed to make drinks, I went to the back and told the bartender “hey, someone out front asked me for a drink.” She responded, “yeah no shit can’t you seem I’m busy?” I just said, “just trying to help you, (name)” and left. I didn’t think anything more of it after walking out the door. Other than that, I can’t think of a thing. 

The manager and I went back and forth for a bit between me asking for another opportunity to make things right and start anew and her saying it’s “just not a good fit.” I got the sense that her mind was made up, so I accepted her answer, shook her hand. She told me she already got my shift covered for me tonight, so I left. Honestly, I shed a quick tear when I left because I really did look forward to every shift there. 

I’m not sure what to do or how to feel. I texted a few of my friends and some colleagues from the law firm. I said I’m doing some introspection and need a 100% honest answer, Am I condescending? Every single person asked me why I’d ask that because they’ve never gotten the sense that my tone remotely comes across that day. 

I guess I just hate that it took 3 months for them to figure out it wasn’t a good fit, that someone or someones got the chance to make a complaint to management without it ever being brought to my attention, and that I never even got the chance to tell my side of the story. I get that they can’t just outright tell me the situation because that would reveal the complainant, but I’m just at a loss right now. ",13Aug2018,24
54,"Me and my Ex broke up a  month ago, she was emotionally abusive, rude, but I felt she did have genuine feelings for me.

But I was over here I thought, I was getting better atleast, its been an awful summer for me so it was hard and hard to get proper recovery time

This time was no expection

I was having a good night with my friends at the bar, and my ""friend"" who was the bouncer said ""Oh Yeah, I slept with your ex on news year by the way, sorry""

And my heart just dropped, that was less than a month into our relationship, and she had cheated on me. Yes, she is my ex, but it does hurt knowing I was nothing to her, that less than am onth in I was cheated on. 

I remember that night, I was away so I was texting her all throughout the night, and this meant, that I was texting her before and after she fucked this guy and I felt physically ill. 

And this friend, never told me, talked to many for many times afterwards lied to my face, knowing full well what he and she did.

I heard the news and asked her ex best friend to ask her if that was true and she responed ""lmao, yes I did"" ""I felt ashamed so I lied about thatg night"" , and I just went home got in the shower and just laughed
I laughed and laughed and it honestly scared me. I didn't know what else t odo, two people I trusted, broke it so hard. This ""friend"" was my mentor for the years I was in Sea Cadet, school, he was a really good friend. Then he does this to me, I felt a part of me being ripped out.

55,"My girlfriend broke up with me 3 months ago. It's gotten better but today I realized I'm still not completely over it. We've been talking and hanging out occasionally and after today I worry that maybe I'm being bad/wrong/spiteful/hateful.

She broke up with me and although we have been trying to be friends (where the past week or two have felt like we are just friends), today I found myself thinking ""I don't really want to be her best friend anymore because then it's like I'm still giving her everything that she had when we were together ."" I find myself wondering today if I'm just really still mad about the breakup and haven't forgiven her for what she put me through (during the relationship and with the breakup) or if I'm subconsciously wanting her to suffer.

I just don't think its fair that to her - it seems like nothing is different between us (it's as if we are still in the relationship, just take out any intimacy) whereas for me it feels like everything is different. She says that she still feels a connection to me and that I understand her in a way no one else has and that she doesn't want to lose me in her life. But for me I have recently come to realize that I don't feel that way about her anymore (I don't feel a connection and although a friendship with her would be nice - I can live without it I think). 

Deep down I just think ""I shouldn't want her in my life if she doesn't want me the way I would want her. And that I don't want to give her a relationship with me, when really it's not a relationship. I don't want her to have all the benefits of a relationship with me and then goes off and is with someone else where she gets everything else I don't give her."" Does that make me spiteful?

56,"From time to time I check apartment reviews for the complex we live in, just for fun. I came across one that is only 2 weeks old and coincidentally written around the same week we moved in last year. Our downstairs neighbor wrote some pretty terrible things accusing us of being drug addicts (I've never even had a sip of alcohol) and accusing us of opening their mail and stealing their property. How do I know it's about us? Easily.. everything they wrote matches the same complaint they put in when we moved in. Problem is that they were super inconsiderate when we moved in and Blasted music and t.v. all the time, slammed doors and stomped around and vaccummed late night. I feel like they are absolutely crazy. We have never seen one written complaint from management. 

Should we proceed with bringing out findings of the review to the main office or just act like we never saw it? I'm very uncomfortable reading what was in there. Also, not sure if I should be worried about them doing something to me or my property. I don't get it.

63,"I like to write, non fiction philosophical excerpts on realizations and lessons. Would be interested in experimenting in symbolic fiction.

Am interested in discovering or trying to answer the question of what makes life substantial and worth living. 

I enjoy inspiring others or helping them out of difficult situations. I am very often sought out among friends who need advice. I don't think I am particularly insightful but I have been told otherwise many times. 

I enjoy reading philosophy and other dark, heavy, classical, and meaningful texts. I like reading fiction as well. (Nietzsche, Camus, Sartre, Beckett, Joyce, Maugham, Millhauser,) 

I enjoy creativity and creating things. Particularly things of complexity. 

I enjoy problem solving and learning things under low pressure contexts. 

I enjoy fluidity in my work, creative freedom and the ability to jump from project to project without tight deadlines. 

I am often late on projects and commitments, but I almost always exceed the amount of effort, creativity, and contemplation that is given by those whose work was turned in on time. 

I enjoy physics, chemistry, and science in general. Learning about how the world operates and its methods. Astrophysics and quantum mechanics. Recently though I have found difficulty and frustration in the early mathematics that lead down the path of physics I originally intended to take. I have not legitimately tried to give the mathematics “all I’ve got”, but each time I even encounter the material I am so instantly repulsed. I don’t want to exert myself towards something that I find so dull, especially if it ends up not paying off in the long run. Though I also don’t want to quit prematurely and without being able to say I actually tried. I know I can do anything I seriously exert myself to do, but I can’t be bothered to be that uncomfortable for so long. 

pretty constantly I feel quite stuck. On one hand I have a strong urge to leave an impact on the world, a lasting legacy, and to help bring something new and meaningful into existence. A new idea or set of ideas that helps the world become a better place or advances our understanding of the universe. I want to be written about, analyzed, and remembered. On the other hand my philosophical tendencies force me to ask the question , “what’s the point?”. If life is meaningless and we are only here until we aren’t, it is pretty hard to justify such big ambitions. 

I am pretty okay at a lot of things, above average in some, but not exceptionally excellent at anything. I have never been recognized as the “best” at anything - though I want to be. At the same time, I have never seriously dedicated myself to any one skill in the way others have. I never knew what to pick,  I don’t know which direction to start working in. 

As stated earlier, I have advised a lot of people. They trust in my opinion and seem to legitimately follow my suggestions. I however, have never met a single person whom I trust to advise me. I’ve just never felt comfortable with someone like that, or trusted that the person genuinely understood me and what it was that I wanted. I feel I need a mentor but I don’t know where to look. I want to find somebody who can help me to eliminate a lot of the abstractness and confusion in my life at the moment. Someone who can help orient me  towards a fulfilling life path and give me motivation and assurance that I am choosing correctly. ",13Aug2018,1

66,"**A few things:** We're both males in our mid to late twenties, and have been friends for about 16 years.

**The Situation:** Recently, my best friend found who he considers the love of his life. His girlfriend makes him happy, and she really seems like a sweet and kind woman. However, I'm a little afraid of losing him as a friend. Not that I think we won't be friends anymore, but in the sense that our bond will weaken (Boy that sounds cheesy). Now, I'm extremely happy for him, and I would never *ever* try to push him to spend more time with me. That being said, some of the things he has said/done has worried me. 

1. He's said to me that, *""I want to make it so she is like what we have.""* Meaning, to know all the intimate details and to have an impeccable bond like us. This makes me feel insecure, because I feel that I worked really hard on this friendship, and she is getting a free pass through. My best friend and I had a rocky start.
2. He often talks about how we wont be talking as much, because he will be spending more time with her. I'm happy to oblige because it makes him happy, but when before we were talking daily, now it's only a few times a week. 
3. This might be my imagination, but when all three of us are in the same talking space, he seems to be more willing to tease and embarrass me. I'm not sure if this is a subconscious power play to show his new girlfriend, or if I'm just seeing things that aren't there.

74,"I met her during our Junior year of high school, we quickly became inseparable and decided to attend the same college and even room together. Everything was great in the dorms, we became closer than ever. So close that we decided to get an apartment together. I got a boyfriend and he quickly moved in with us and our relationship started to deteriorate. It got especially bad when she got a boyfriend not long after and he would come over every day. I really started to resent her because I feel I saw the real her which was immature and messy. She would rarely do dishes, would never clean counter/stove/bathroom, and worst of all she would always have sex with her boyfriend every day... LOUDLY. We pretty much stopped talking altogether and when the lease ended we went our separate ways without saying anything. 

About a year later (about 4 months ago) she texted me and said how much she missed our friendship. I contemplated whether or not I should give her another chance to be friends and ended up deciding to just go for it and see what happens. I figured that there was no way that she was as immature as she was when we were friends two years ago. 

After about a month of talking we hung out and it was nice, it felt pretty close to how it used to be when we were best friends. A few weeks later I went to her birthday party and everything seemed to be great. That was over 2 months ago now and since then she has been extremely dodgy. 

We barely ever talk. I will text her and she will take literal days to reply or not reply at all. She has ditched me on plans that we made a week before, made excuses to not call me when she was supposed to. I have sort of asked her about the dodginess and she played it off and claimed that she’s just always really busy. Yet she has time to go out to the bar every weekend, go out to eat with her boyfriend, take random trips out of state. Nothing at all feels the same as it used to. She is extremely unreliable and I really am starting to think that she is pulling this “too busy to talk/hangout/make any effort to be friends” card on purpose to maybe get back at me or try to look a certain way to me??? 

At this point I am contemplating if this girl is somebody who I want to be friends with afterall. She isn’t making any effort... so why should I? I would really appreciate any advice on this situation. ",13Aug2018,1

Tonight I saw him on Tinder and Jesus, all I want and have wanted to do is see and speak to him. I think about him everyday. When we were together I would look at him and cry with joy, something I've never done before. He was a complex person with a lot of issues and he made me so happy. I believe in him. I believe in what he can be when he works out his shit. Can someone either tell me to pussy up and do it or bitch slap some sense into me?

77,"My wife and I have been discussing who should be guardians to our son (he’s one) should we unexpectedly die.  The first option we have always considered was her sister and husband (they have a 2 and 4 year old). She is close with her sister but the husband is moderately friendly but never really puts a whole lot of effort into getting to know me and has even been a little distant with my wife the past few years; nothing extraordinarily.  We are pretty close with their 2 kids and treat them like our own.  The 4 year old absolutely adores my wife (her aunt) and myself. The issue I have is that while we treat their kids as our own, her sisters husband is not affectionate to our son and hasn’t even picked him up once.  It’s strikes me as odd - we are a pretty close knit Italian family and we all adore and love each other kids.  I’m developing an issue with choosing her sister and her husband  as guardians. It bothers me to think my son could be treated differently in any sort of way.  Sure he’s not a “bad guy” but that is a low standard for choosing the guardians for my son.

80,"There’s this guy where I work who I didn’t really think much of until we started talking more. I remember I told him little details about me, basically small talk, about me like what school I go to, what I major in, what I’m trying to become, etc. in conversation time and again he’ll say some little detail I told him like “oh didn’t you say you got out of school May 7th” or something and I’m just shook bc... how do you even remember something like that. It would happen all the time and I’m just like wow. It made me a lil uncomfortable but hey I just went with it. Then one day he kept being realllll friendly like more than usual. I said hey to him like I usually do and he walked all the way across to where I was and got really close to me and started engaging in conversation. I backed up a lil bit bc that was weird. After the convo ended he went about his business and I went about mine but then I noticed he kept staring at me. Every time I looked up he was staring and then looked away real quick. I think he noticed I noticed he was staring so he broke the ice with “hey I could teach you how to swim”. I have no idea what gave him the idea I didn’t know how to swim but I just went along.

81,"I'm a new grad who just finished school up college this spring. I did a business like program at a major state flagship school. I was a stand-out student who was really involved and showed 'leadership skills,' but I have enough self awareness to recognize that my degree didn't really mean shit. Especially because I didn't exactly learn anything too specialized or difficult - unlike one would in a STEM degree, etc. I also didn't really have a long string of internships like some of my classmates did, due to some crummy luck and other circumstances in my local region (bad economy). 

Anyways, I fell into a pretty damn awesome, unique opportunity a little bit off the beaten path. It's not a start-up, but it is a very small company &lt;50 people. Partly due to the structure of the company, and partly due to other circumstances, I have a *ton* of responsibilities for someone at this stage of my career. I feel like I am learning so, so much every single day. I am exposed to some amazing mentors and get to work under some brilliant professionals. I genuinely fit in really well with this industry and company, and can tell that my 'soft skills' are really impressing them (no, I'm not really a suck-up). I got a significant raise just last week, and my boss (director) communicated to me the longer term potential I have at the place. She said I'm working hard, doing well, and wants me to keep it up. 

But the job itself is quite tough. I have a lot on my plate, and don't always have a strong support system. My job is one with real consequences of failure - I have to handle some confidential info, and forgetting to do anything could have really bad impacts. To be honest, I'm not a very detail-oriented person, and this is probably the most important attribute to be good at this job. I legitimately believe most other new grads would be doing way worse right now though - it's just the standards that are quite high. 

I think getting through these first 1-3 years is toughest, because I unequivocally believe I'd be better at higher level, more conceptual stuff than what I'm doing now. But I have to perform to get there first. So how do I not screw up this super, super cherished opportunity? ",13Aug2018,1
82,So I’ve been wanting my permit and really been asking for it 6 months before my 16th birthday. I always asked my mom if I can get it and she always said no and it’s gotten to points where she’s gotten pissed at me for it. I figured it was one of those things where they say no but when it comes around they let you do it but that’s not the case. She said I can get my permit at 17 which is honestly pissing me off. I wanna be able to drive to school and work and she’s hindering that. So my brother talked to her and she said maybe 16 and a half but she still tells me I have to wait till I’m 17.

84,"Hello. I am in a bit of a tough situation with my personal life and I would like to hear some other opinions about my next steps. 

In my current situation, I have been separated for about 2.5 years and on our way to a full divorce. I have had a boyfriend for about 2 years and we are happy, but he is also divorced and says he never wants to get married again and doesn't like the idea of living with a woman again. Which I understand, since up until recently I felt the same. We always agreed on it and it just felt right to keep our houses separate, since we each have 3 kids. But now I'm starting to change my view a little bit. I was fresh out of a terrible marriage and not surprisingly I didn't want to go through that again. 

In no way do I want to change his mind about his decisions, I couldn't be happy with myself if I even thought about it. 

But being a single parent is tough, as many of you can probably understand. It's doable in my situation, but it's never going to be easy. I miss being married and sharing a house and splitting bills and having someone around for comfort and just having that person to check in with at the end of the day. I am not expecting someone to take care of me and my kids, I am more than capable of that, but I'd like things to be easier.  

So what my question is, do I stay in my moderately happy relationship as it is and let things take their course, or is it crazy to end things with my boyfriend because we want different things?  

It might come off sounding selfish, but I just want the chance at a happy marriage and home.

I was scared, angry, and didn’t really know how to handle this. i felt my affection for her grow after she told me this and it led me to eventually smother her with emotion to the point where she broke up with me. i was truly heartbroken, and it really hit me bad.  in the aftermath i got some really bad ideas in my (TRP, etc) and honestly still can.

i left home a few months later to pursue a career in the military at university. my last year has been great, with lots of friends, and lots of experiences that keep me excited for the years to come.

In the aftermath I also got some really toxic ideas in my head, (TRP, etc) and it’s honestly changed the way I’ve viewed relationships and girls, albeit not in too radical of a way.

So when things do get to be too much for her, and she screams (I mean really screams, the type when someone is crying and they really reach the top of their lungs) I have a seizure. A seizure. I get this rush of ""warm"" starting from my head and as it flows down quite rapidly, I find myself on the ground, shaking, unable to move or open my eyes, and the whole ordeal lasts about 30 seconds before I can get up again. 

I think it might be related to some trauma I had surrounding her screams as a younger child, (mental illness goes way back), she would scream like that and usually I would run off and hide somewhere like a closet while my parents tried to calm her down. But if that's the case, why show up now? It also seems to happen more often when she talks about killing herself while screaming, like screaming that she should die, so I think it's a stress response.

95,"hi, so i’m a 15 y/o and began my money journey in retail. i have been working at this store for 3 months now. i enjoy working with people, so i succeed in customer service and am on good terms with almost all my coworkers. i always try my best to be punctual and professional during work.

however, my supervisor, who has been working at the store for quite a few years, is THE biggest bitch i have ever met. every time i work with her, she periodically (literally every 20 minutes) pages me and asks if i’m finished with a certain task yet (even though it takes about an hour or two to finish and she never bothers anyone else). during my previous shift, one of my friends came in and began to talk to me (however, i was still doing my job and helped her find what she was looking for, and she ended up buying over $50 of merchandise) however, my supervisor ended up peeking into the aisle we were in and considered that i wasn’t working (even though i repriced an ENTIRE aisle in the 15 or so minutes my friend was in the store). so, she sends a text to all the front store managers in the store telling them i don’t work and just talk.

so my next shift, i get to work and everything and one of the FSMs approaches me and tells me to stop talking so much with friends and coworkers. i didn’t explain the fact that my friend was there as a customer and i ended up finishing all my tasks for the day. 

i forgot to mention, the supervisor i have a problem with is so LAZY. everyone in the store knows she extremely lazy and doesn’t do any work but nobody can do anything about it because she is the right hand of the store manager. she is the biggest brown nose in the store and tells everything to the manager. the manager also deals with staff through her. 

she is making me seem like a lousy, talkative worker when really i believe i am trying my best to always put the customer first and work as hard as i can (i don’t understand why they push a 15 y/o harder than the 20 and 30 y/os working there)

can fellow reddit users who have any experience with shit bosses tell me what to do in this situation? finding a new job would be difficult as i don’t have any long term experience or education, and many stores in my area don’t typically hire teenagers. 

i would like to try to ask another manager if i would be able to not work with her and have a different supervisor. 

i always feel like i get more accomplished when i have a different supervisor than her. she interrupts my work because she is too lazy to do her own and then it unmotivates me and wastes my time. 

what can i do ?

After having no luck with traditional medication, I beat the depression and anxiety with regular marijuana use. I haven’t smoked in months and I am currently content and no longer have any signs of depression or anxiety. The current problem is that I lack any real emotion, excitement, love, connection with people, etc. This has been going on since high school, but is something I have not been able to grow out of or find a cure for. It is taking a toll on my life. I don’t have any close friends and find it hard to interact in social situations. I am often too “in my head” and don’t say much. My significant other has known me for years and understands what I’ve been through and who I am, but my lack of connection, empathy, excitement, etc is taking a toll on her and I want to be a better partner, but I can never seem to make the change and start living a more positive, happy, excited life.

Any suggestions? Thank you for any help in advance.

These are the most obvious two options for me from my perspective:

1. Drop out of the degree, continue working in my current job and do the diploma next year. Figure out rest after that.

2. Leave current job, enrol full time back in my degree, do online diploma at same time, work back at old job.

I never got into drugs, I dont do people wrong so im not sure why my family does this to me, after i was forced to leave, i tried going to other family members house but no one wants anything to do with me, its been like this ever since i was a little kid (never this way with my sister, shes loved by fucking everyone) and I know this kind of turned into a little rant but i feel like ive been crying for help for a while now, just a little help, and i cant get it. truth be told im scared, im afraid this is how its gonna be until i finally decide to take myself out the game. I guess all im asking is how do i cope? I dont want to die, but i also dont want to live this way anymore.",13Aug2018,8
105,"I'm ***very*** socially isolated with no friends at all, not a single friend. It's really impacting my health.  


I don't even really get any opportunity to meet anyone new, let alone opportunity to try to make friends.   


I don't work (yes, I'm working on that!) and I volunteer but there's little opportunity to make friends when working in those roles, I tried joining a gym. I started using Meetup but my \[abusive\] ex is heavily involved with local meetups and close friends with the people in the biggest group, so I've had to stop going to that group and there's only an odd one or two other meetups. I've tried apps for finding friend but they seem not to be used very much so they've been a total bust. I've tried finding part-time courses but none available right now. I try going places like bars or coffee shops on my own and trying new things as much as possible (climbing, archery, meditation) with limited funds but I'm always on my own...it's no fun going places alone, and generally people go places with friends so don't want to talk to the loner.   


I feel stuck unable to see how to even meet people to get an opportunity to try to make friends, but even if opportunity presents itself I'm very socially awkward and I'm just not really sure how to progress from meting someone to making friends...is it even possible to make friends unless you're seeing them on a regular basis?   


Plus I'm a woman and tend prefer male friends, but while I'm single that just isn't the best thing to go looking for as I think too many guys will assume if you talk to them that you're interested in dating them (especially if I was to approach them to talk in  bar!), I'd like female friends too but I just don't know how female friendships work.   


I'm just at a total loss as to what else to try, or what I might be doing wrong.   


Surely I'm not the only one who's looking for friends, why is it so hard?!

107,"I tend to linger on details, but Ill try to keep it short.

So I am at a point where I think Im about done with everything. Im a 21 year old guy who is fed up with just about every facet of life and has lost hope for myself and humanity in general. Life has never been interesting since the child like wonder wore off, and Im now coming to a point where I cant justify more effort. 

Ive been here before. Recently sought help thinking things could be better. Im only 21, you think thered be more. Of course, as Im in the military, I decided to talk to my mother first, who blackmailed me into speaking to my supervisor about it. Because they cant afford to lose a tool, this lead to a week of being forcibly confined to a mental facility with drug addicts and other such tossaways. I had been using my FAL for a chinrest for a while, and I really miss it. A least then I had the option to go quick. A 308 is a lot faster than a knife or belt. But I dont really mind. I could just go rent a gun at a range, line up right quick and do it. Wouldnt have to be a problem for anyone but the janitor. Im rambling. 

Anyways, Im back to the same spot I was prior. I wont go back to a mental hospital. Ill cut my throat before they put their hands on me again. But I figure theres got to be more to life? Anyone have suggestions? Things that lend meaning? I always wanted to be big in future tech, but I cant bring myself to figure out how to enroll in college, so thats kind of out the window. Im not a good person by any means. Im sure if you search my post history, youll realize as much. In fact, I find myself numb to the suffering of others, and really, am a poor example of a human being by any stretch. No point in lying.

Anyhow. Where do I go? I figure Ive got about 2 weeks of battery life left. Ive got 2 years left on my contract, and I know if things dont change way before that, Ill be rotting long before. I have already heard the whole bit from all of my family, how they couldnt make it without me. As if it mattered. My father crying about how im so important, my mother staying in my house for 2 whole months. A supervisor who plays holier than thou, and the Msgt whos in charge of my office shoving his advice and such down my throat. Likely to wax on about how much of a help he is. I spent weeks in a counselors office. A big fake fucking grin to look at every day I went, to tell me how life is so easy if you dont think about it. I cant handle it. I dont know if its understanding the futility of wanting to be more than just another ant on the face of the planet, or just the monotony of having a somewhat comfortable life, but I just feel no sense of accomplishment or meaning, and antidepressants are a shit substitute, when I bother taking them.

Funny enough I tried to explain my position. My mother just did the mother thing of ""I know, youre smart, youre handsome, youll do everything you want."" and my father has apparently hit his crisis, a bit later than mine. So his advice was to ""give up on being anything important, because we are all just born to make someone else money."". And now he's turning to religion to ""be told the next day will be ok."". I dont really see an out here.

TL:DR, Im ready to punch out. Theres nothing worth keeping myself here. Im overweight, lazy, ugly, and frankly, bored. If anyone has some advice, I'll mull it over. Ill keep an eye on the thread. Ill likely have downtime to read whatever replies come in during my 12 hour shift tomorrow. Thanks.",13Aug2018,10
108,"For the past few months, I've been going to therapy twice a week for anxiety, PTSD, and depression. These issues compounded in March, after I had not seen anyone for these things in about 5 years. I lost my job because I would have debilitating panic attacks, and haven't worked since. I feel terrible about this, because my boyfriend and I moved to my home state so I could take advantage of my insurance, which I could not use in college because out of state it became ER only insurance. Here, it's really good and I've been taking full advantage of the privilege. 

We've been living with my family and bf has gotten a really solid 9-5 and has been providing for us. Recently, I've felt really guilty about this, so I applied for a job in the city we plan to move to after we save up here (months away, most likely). I had a thought that it would somehow be better for me to work there, like it would give us incentive to move, get me used to the city, and it pays really well (better than bf's job). It's also a job I really believe in. I had a very good interview and loved everything about it. However, the hours are 10-7, and the commute is an hour to an hour and a half each way, and I would no longer be in regular therapy. I spoke to my therapist about it after getting the job offer, and she said we could do out of pocket phone appointments (which is v expensive and defeats the purpose of having moved here) or monthly Saturday sessions. I feel torn. I don't think I am ready to go back to work in many ways (had a panic attack tonight over nothing, hence the need to type this out and ask for help from the ether), but I also worry that I'm just being self-defeating. 

I am asking for advise on how to make this decision. I have a week until the job starts, and will do therapy twice this week, and then not until September if I do take this job. I feel very torn, because both options have positives and n negatives. How do I choose? Should I even BE choosing things like this? 

*sorry for the length, and I hope this passes muster for a post here. I just feel very lost. ",13Aug2018,1
109,"So I am in high school and I am an active member in my school's FFA chapter. School begins in a few days. I recently got a job at a local Godfather's pizza restaurant (3rd day or so). So far, I usually work evenings However, due to a lack of communication on my FFA adviser and  my work schedule for this week being un-alterable, I'm being forced to cancel my plans to participate in an FFA event, which I had signed up for before I even got the job. Because I had to cancel, I must find a replacement for myself. That's not the problem, though.

The problem is that I just now realized how many things I could miss because of my job. I actually have been recognized in my chapter for the past 2 years for having such good attendance at FFA events; almost every single one. Because of my job now, it's possible I will miss more things this year, and not just in FFA.  
I really wanted to try and build myself a better social life this year, because I don't have a whole lot of friends, and I'd like to get friendlier with a girl or two that I like, but it seems I may have to sacrifice all of that trying to juggle school and work. I just feel so trapped and stressed  out right now. I don't want to and won't quit my job, at least not this early on, but I have no idea how I will be able to manage all of this.

111,"I went to a short story/ poetry slam and told a ghost story about me being a first responder and seeing something during a call. Everyone seemed to like it when I told it, and a couple weeks later I was stopped by a barista at the business that hosts the slams. She told me that a man saw my story and wanted to ask about doing an interview for a ghost hunting show, so she gave him my e-mail.

He told me they'd be willing to fly me to Europe (where filming is) if I wanted to tell my story to a camera. The only problem, I made up the story. 

I was a volunteer first responder for a few months (my job changed and I didn't have as much free time as I did before), but I never received any formal training. I never went on any calls and never saw a ghost. 

I don't want to lie about being a first responder, but I also have never left my country and would really like to travel.

I've been in communication with the director of the show and he's trying to setup a date for filming right now. I'm afraid that if I go through with this then I could be found out and called out as a phony. 

Should I follow through with this? I technically was a volunteer first responder, with every intention of doing more, but the rest of my story is fabricated. Would I be a bad person if I pretended to be a more active EMT to tell a ghost story and get free travel out of it?",13Aug2018,1

117,"Tl;dr at bottom. I need to vent something fierce.

Nearly 10 ago I was part on an online hobby group (we'll say drawing). A bunch of us became friends.

One of the guys (we'll call him Creep), was always very nice, and became my shoulder to cry on when a family member passed away. I only ever saw him as a friend, especially since we lived in different countries. I started suspecting that maybe he had a crush on me, and I sent an email saying how I much I liked being *just* friends, and I hoped that would never change. He replied saying he felt the same way, and I thought I was in the clear.  Hell, I thought he even might've been gay. I had considered him like a best friend.

Fast forward a few years, and he's leading a an art project, and hires all his friends including me. We all get paid a little money and it was awesome. 

Shortly after, he finally tells me out of the blue that he was in love with me. I was completely shocked. I mean, I used to talk to him about guys I was dating! Well, I tell him I only see him as a friend, and he says no problem.

But oh, there would be problems. 

He started getting obsessed. Constantly telling me to update my Facebbok and Twitter more, to go on Skype because everyone was constantly asking about me (they were not), and to talk to him on the phone more. Would tell me every so often I was the most talented artist he knew, but that if I wanted to be the best, I needed to practice everyday... and he would help guide me so I could be better. So basically the only way I could be the best was by spending time with him *everyday* online. At this point, I slowly started backing away and contacting him less, hoping the space would make things calm down. 

That did not happen. 

He sent a very expensive present at one point- I told him I wanted to send it back because I felt it was too much. He got all offended and claimed he did this stuff for all his friends because he's such a nice guy. 
Then I found out he had friended some of my friends on Facebook that he didn't even know as a way to keep tabs on everything I was doing. 

I had just finished another project for him, but enough was enough. I wrote him a letter (I thought it was nicer than just sending an email) basically saying thanks for the memories, but you've been making me uncomfortable and I don't want to be friends anymore. I even said if he wanted to scrap my work in the new project and hire someone else, that I would understand. 

Well shortly after he sent me a painfully long, passive aggressive email. Said i was being unprofessional, and that if i backed out of the project i was going to ruin the entire thing because I still had more work to do. Now the work I did was only a small part of a large project and I was confused - I was told that my part was finished. 

Not wanting to ruin the clients project, I responded back to him saying that I'd prefer to stay in the project, but had offered to leave after what I said in my letter as to not make things awkward. Creep then claims he never got any letter. WHAT? Total lie. If that was true, he wouldn't have known that I offered to leave to project in the first place.

I contacted the client directly. I told them I was moving soon, and wanted to know what other work I needed to finish. Well, they tell me they're scrapping the original project, and plan to have everything redone from scratch to go in a different direction.  I then responded back and politely quit since I was moving (which was true) and wouldn't have the time. Turns out my leaving was not going to ruin the game at ALL since it was being entirely redone anyways.

That was the last straw, and I emailed Creep saying I spoke with the client, and knew that the project had been scrapped. I told him I had already quit the project,  and the last thing I wrote was goodbye. At no point in any of our interactions did I curse or insult him.  I never talked to him again after that, which was 4 years ago. 

Again Creep sends another essay of passive aggressiveness, most of which I've forgotten. I thought that was the end of him, but it was only the beginning.

At first he tried emailing, calling, texting often, which I ignored. Then his MOM started texting and calling me, which I ignored. Then his friend (who had been one of my friends as well) called and basically said Creep was depressed and I ruined his life. Lesson learned- and I ignored any further messages from mutual friends. 

I tried making an anonymous blog at one point, and he found it somehow and messaged me through the blog. Had to delete the blog.

His mom called Christmas eve one year and left a 6 minute message basically  saying I had to talk to Creep or else he would kill himself. I called my therapist at the time (she was best) and she told me to report the call to his countries authorities, and then change my phone number.  Which I did, but that still didn't end the situation.

So for the past few years, I'd get the occasional email from him or his friends. In his emails he would bring up the really personal stuff I told him, and even tried to bring up the family member who passed away to make me feel bad. I would block the email address, but he has a bunch of them apparently.

I hadn't heard from him in over a year, and I thought I was finally done with Creep.

Well he emailed me again tonight. Basically  one if the old projects became popular again, and everyone is getting a bonus. He said he felt morally obligated to let me know, then went on to say about how he almost died recently and bla bla bla.

I do want that money, but Creep is crazy and any response back could reinforce the idea that persistence pays off. What should I do?

Tl;dr
A friend I did work for turned into a stalker. One of the projects i worked on became popular again, and all the workers are getting bonuses. Only way I can get money is to talk to stalker again who I've been avoiding for years.

119,"Sorry in advance for the long post.

So I had this friend, let's call her Lia. Lia and I were friends for 2 and a half years before trouble began. I would always help Lia out with everything, homework, I would always share my lunch with her, but her gifts, etc. That's just how I show appreciation for people. Well in our third year of highschool some things started to change about her. I would invite her to go places with me and she'd always cancel last minute ornever wanna go with me anywhere when it was just the two of us. The only time she did is when we went to this science center and I had gotten out tickets for free and payed for some of her stuff. But back to the point, she would always go out with a ton of our mutual friends to a bowling alley really close to my house. She would never invite me but always send me pictures of them all out together. 

Well one day after New Years she had canceled on our plans to go see The Shape of Water, and then about 3 days later asked for some money. I had made her a sword and she ended up not liking it. I offered to make her a new one I just needed time. There was no please, it was get me the money on the 21st or else. 

I was so furious at that moment we got into a huge fight. I had reached a boiling point and was so done with the way I was being treated, constantly canceling on me, being catty and then not even a please. And the whole time she never took a single thing seriously. I called her some regetable names and apologized the next day. But she never apologized, she said I would be unhappy the rest of my life, that I was a selfish person trying to keep her away from other friends, and was a toxic person in this relationship. She even sent all these screenshots to another friend of 5 years who went on to call me a toxic person. 

Along with that I had put some information about me being trans and she stated that she had sent the text messages to mutual friends that didnt know to get them on her side.

In about February she started skipping class and going into my study hall. I ended up reporting her and the other people who were doing it. We have like a mandatory report on that kinda stuff.

 I ended up paying her the money and later in the year she had talked trash about me to another teacher. I went to go confront her on this and she just laughed in my face and I ended up having to go to the guidance office with a guidance officer who didnt take my issue that seriously. 

I am now stuck with Lia in my College Stat class. I get an extreme amount of anxiety just thinking about her being in the same class as me agian gave me an aniextity attack last night. My mom wont let me switch classes due to that one being the only one with a physical teacher. Should I explain this to my grade's levels guidance counselors or not.

123,"***EDIT: This Backstory is quite long, but I implore you to please read it***

Hi everybody,

Here’s the backstory: 

I am 22 years old, who graduated last August w/ a Bachelors in Political Science. I am the oldest in my family of 4 siblings, the 1st born in the US, and the 1st to graduate college. I’ve always excelled academically. With all that, I’ve always had a great amount of pressure to succeed and do well, setting an example for my brothers &amp; sister, helping out our parents.

Thankfully, I have no debt, own a vehicle. I live in a rural area in AZ with not much opportunity in this field. My goal is to work in International Affairs whether as a policy dude, diplomat, or working with a NGO (ex: Doctors w/out Borders). The way different countries interact with one another and why, and how that affects us, fascinates me. I feel a strong sense of wanting to help others and believe this route would be the way to go to achieve that, along with using my degree.

I am also a Certified Medical Assistant with experience in a Pediatrician’s Office and Podiatry. More on that later.

Since graduation last August, I was jobless for 4 months until late November. Not even McDonald’s would hire me. At that point i decided to say “fuck it” and began volunteering for the local political club. I was always weary of Campaigns and Elections, never liked the seediness of it.

Being unemployed for that long after getting out of school. It messes with you. Tons of stress and you start doubting if you made the right choice in degree or by even going to college at all. I’ve also been living with my parents, which in itself was a hard transition for me after being on my own for 3 years taking care of myself. Back home l’m no longer the one buying groceries or paying what needs to get paid, or even maintaining the house. It gets rough on the psyche. That’s not to say I’m not grateful, but I did feel at times like a burden for not contributing financially.

After a month of volunteering, I get offered the job of Campaign Manager for a local State Senate Candidate. Awesome! Except, the pay is terrible at $1000 a month ($200 for December), the hours are near 24/7, and the toxicity involved.

I managed to help the campaign develop and get on good footing. I amicably and mutually parted ways with the Campaign in April after finding out I was lied to and there was no job/career plan for me after November. This meant no potential transition to International Affairs. I was also being manipulated into taking on more responsibilities and ultimately ended up backstabbed by people I considered friends, whom are now my former candidates primary opponents all while the State Political Party and an affiliate established a loophole for legal earmarking for Clean elections candidates. Campaigns and elections are seedy indeed. People would be disgusted if they knew what was happening at the local political level. I guess I directly learned some life lessons along the way.

For a brief week, I was Canvasser for a Get Out the Vote group, but ultimately decided that wasn’t for me. Walking around all day in Summer AZ is not something I recommend, unless you need to do it. Props to those that do. My own father is a roofer/Carpenter of over 20 years. I don’t know how he does it, but I respect the hell out of him for doing so for being able to provide for us.

For the remainder of April and May I was with no prospects for my International Affairs goal, so I decided to focus on finding employment again with my Medical Assisting background. Luckily this time, I succeeded. 

One of the local Reservations was opening up a new hospital and along with that was a massive influx of demand for M.A.’s. Interview was 1st week of June, 1st work day on July 2nd. 

I’ve been here for a month now. I love it and enjoy it here, along with the staff. Always learning. But I don’t see myself being here for 1 year down the road. The M.A position is not one with a promotion path or economic growth. I currently get paid $14.25/hour, about $29,000 a year, Down to $22,000/a year or about $11.00 per hour after taxes. 

I don’t want to be 23, 25, 27, 30 with no clear career development or path of growth. The uncertainty of the long-term. 

Over the past 2 weeks, I heavily contemplated joint the Air Force. I got my medical records done, met with a recruiter, and discussed Officership, and Intel. I ultimately decided it wasn’t for a long list of reasons, more so professionally. I didn’t want to be stuck with 4 years of a job position I had no desire in doing or control over, but have to stick with due to the commitment of enlisting. I could choose my preferences, but that wasn’t a guarantee I’d land them. But more so, I didn’t want to Be done with my time in the services and feel the same way I did after with college and ask “OK, now what.” with no long term prospect or path.

I’ve also thought about simply saving enough money to fund a 2-Year Masters Degree study of International Security Studies. I’ve been accepted to this program since August of last year, but have had no way of paying for it. Again, aside from finances, the only thing that’s holding me back from this is job prospects after graduation. I don’t want another repeat and would rather not make that investment if there is no certain return.

So now, while employed with my back up Medical certification, I am back at square 1 as to what to do for my long-term and the career I want to pursue. Thinking about it alone is stressful, but focusing back to my day by day goals calms that down.

So regardless of your profession, your location, I ask for your advice, guidance, and help. I don’t know what to do, and that horrifies me more than any nightmare.

**TL;DR** I currently stand at square 1 as it comes to finding a path to the career I want. I’ve tried online websites, volunteering (and then working) in an unrelated field, researching the Air Force, and thought about focusing on getting my master’s and learn more. I’m just not sure what to do.

 Please read the backstory if you’re just reading the TLDR. Context is key. I'd greatly appreciate it and value your input.",13Aug2018,1

I literally do not try to put on a show I don’t even flirt, but every single friend I’ve had has fallen for me. It’s like okay maybe I was to nice, but I bully my friends (in a joking way) do they just like the fact that I give them a hard time? I’m just wondering if any of y’all had the chance would you be a heartbreaker or get your heart broken. Because quite frankly I’m not liking this side of the stick. Do y’all have any advice on how to reject people, because I rejected someone tonight and I don’t know if it went the best. Also why do all my friends fall for me?",13Aug2018,2

128,"Like two month ago i used to date a girl that i really like it. We go to the same university and we took the same classes. We had a great time.  Even though she went on a trip she talked to me EVERY DAY in this trip. She came back and she ask me to go out with her, and idk why  i told her that i sleep with another classmate (before met her) and i think that this fucked up everything. Why i say this? Because after that i asked her to go out and she told me that she was very busy and when i talked to her she answer me in a different way, so i decided to stop talking to her. Then the holidays came and we didnt seen each other like for a month. 
I really miss her, i saw her in the classroom and i dont want to talk her because i think i lost the fight and because of my stupid pride i dont know if it is good to ask her out one more time, because i feel like i am an idiot. 
So please give me an advice.

129,"So, I work at a small workplace. We are four people, two bosses, one secretary and I. I am still in school (university) but I work part time and have the same things to do as my co-worker. It's a really good workplace. My bosses are the best and I really like my co-worker.

Now some month ago we got a student that started working too, she does assistance jobs. She works two days a week. We have two workplaces, like two desks and two computers. I work afternoons (11:30 am - 3:30 pm) and my co-worker works mornings (8 am - 12:30 pm) but we cross for one hour so that she can explain stuff that I should finish and make some kind of handover.

Well we have another firm that we share the rooms with, so the assistant started working on their computer for the hour my co-worker and I blocked our work spaces. When my co-worker left, the assistant switched to her desk.

My Bosses had a fight with the other firm and they said they dont want the assistant to use their computer anymore. Now every time she comes in, my Boss asks me if I can come one hour later so we dont have a problem with the computers.

First I thought it was ok but the last two times I couldn't make it, because she only asks early on the same morning she expects me to come in later and I had plans.

Now we have really much work and they planned to hire another part time secretary like my co-worker and I and another assistance. We have one empty room and the rumor is that they wanted to put a workspace (desk, computer, telephone) in the empty room for the new people. 

But nothing happened. I am feeling replaced and don't know how to address it without sounding like a jerk. I love to work there and I have 1,5 year until my bar exam and would really like to stay there until then.

How can I address this, the fact that they are hiring more and more people without having the workspace and without talking to us about this? My Co-worker also asked me how they are thinking of so many people working there with two desks.",13Aug2018,2
130,"So last semester I was screwing around with my computer profile and I put some North Korean and Mao propaganda on it. I literally thought about this and though it would be funny because why would you find communist shit on a school computer?

A few days later after fucking around i decided to put the Rebel flag as my profile picture. I did this for the same reason as the communist propaganda. Later that day someone I know but don’t talk to that much walks up to me and says that I’m racist and a “Neo-Nazi” for having the rebel flag and propaganda as my profile picture. I told him that it was my sense of humour and I don’t know why he was saying this shit because last year him and his friend group were doing Hitler salutes in class and shit, which I find pretty ironic for him to be calling me a Nazi.

He then approached me a few days later and was secretly recording me and he was asking me questions about my sense of humour. I thought he wanted to have a conversation about this so I told him that I find this stuff funny but I don’t support it. He then says that he recorded me and he was reporting me to the main office and luckily the Vice principal wasn’t a far-left retard and didn’t punish me for that shit I did but I was made clear that I don’t wanna do that again because people I will hurt people’s feelings. He then proceeds to bring up some recordings of his friends saying that I was saying some shit about illegal immigrants. I then realized that this person was a moron and I told the Vice P. that I was saying that out of my own mind since I didn’t have anything to talk about.

The next day I hear one of his friends “John”. John is black and he is way more better than me in every way. He then says that I didn’t get a punishment because I was White and “Privileged”. That was pretty retarded because I’m half-Mexican and I find men attractive. I’m also a Centrist and support Trump so me being Privileged is retarded. He probably is more privileged than me in every way.

What I learned from this session is that people will be butt hurt and call you a Nazi if you find Edgy humour funny.",13Aug2018,1

All my life things seemed to work out, I did well in school, out of school, things just always seemed good. 

But here i am at 26 - I feel fucking done. I feel like I have completely lost myself. I am unemployed. My dad is 86 - all my uncles are dead, all my aunties are old, all grandparents are dead. 

I feel fucking vulnerable, lost, jaded, and broken. 

I don't know If I fucked up too much or if its just unfortunate my life feels like its falling apart. 

Most my friends have moved on to bigger better things. And it looks like I am left to work in whatever I can take. 

I did 4 years studying graphic design and it was all for nothing, - 

I just hibernate in my room all the fucking time feeling like I dove into every trap life has to offer, now I want out. 

I used to attract so much good in my life - girls, friends, success. Now its like Im walking around with a deadweight of depression on my head all day every day. 

I feel like I have pressure on me at all angles, and I just wish I kept my head low and humble when I was younger instead of trying to make a name/success out of myself. 

Ive made countless mistakes that eat away at me every single day, but its only since my Dad has got old I really took responsibility for myself and realised how much these things matter. 

On top of this, I used to always attract amazing girls in my life, but it feels like I blew my shot so many times, wasted so many opportunities and there not comming back again. ",13Aug2018,1

I finished up an internship and realized it is not the career I am looking for and am struggling to figure out what I want and how to get it. In my exit interview by boss mentioned that my strengths were in client facing and talking to people but I struggled with following up with detail in my written work and strategy. I also realized through my internship experience that I am not as creative as I thought I was and can't come up with things on the spot, and my writing skills are not great. I feel embarrassed because I graduated with a degree in communications with a heavy emphasis on writing and I am not as strong or creative as I thought I was. At the end of the day its important for me to feel like my job genuinely helps people but I can do it with some level of creativity and make enough money to be comfortable (is that unrealistic?)

137,"I’m going into my last year of college before I graduate. This past summer, my friend and I studied abroad in Japan and I took on a temporary mentoring job for high school kids. I enjoyed doing both. I’ve told my friend before that I was thinking about applying for the JET Programme once I graduate and she said that she’d support me. After we got back and I told her that I enjoyed living in Japan, and that I was planning on applying this fall, she got angry with me. I suspected that she didn’t enjoy it as much as I did. Also, she was upset because we planned on getting an apartment together after college. I admit, that was wrong for me to promise. 

Still, a couple of days ago, she told me that it’s her fault for expecting to stay friends with me. I told her that we can still be friends when I leave and she said, “yeah, but not as close.” I told her that we can text and she scoffed and said, “yeah, like twice a day.”

I’m 22. She’s 20. We both are depressed and have self esteem issues; I’ve attempted suicide many times these past couple of years. I don’t feel happy in the small city we live in, I’m not close with my family, and I just need something to spruce up my love for life. Maybe Japan won’t be what I expect, but there’s no way of knowing unless I go. I don’t even know if I’ll be accepted in the program. I’m just applying.

My friend and I have a close-but-far relationship due to our depression. I’m worried that she’ll only continue to be my friend if I’m with her 24/7. I enjoy being alone and I know that losing friends is a part of life, but I’ve been friends with her for almost 7 years and I don’t want to stop. I, also, don’t want to work at a job I don’t like just because she wants us to live together. I’m not sure what to do about our friendship.

139,"(Its late and I’m in a shaky mood rn so formatting may be a little bad, my apologies before hand)

I’m 16 in a long distance relationship. This week I’m visiting my gf and we talked about personal issues. Mine being that i have sucked in school the last two years. I consider myself fairly smart, I don’t study or do any work and I do very well on exams. I try to, but I have been very depressed from problems inside my family. I’m getting worse and I haven’t been able to change myself for the better. I’m sitting at a 2ish gpa that’s not gonna rise anytime soon. If anything it’ll start to fall. 

Background: I have not lived a poor life. My family has always been in the middle-middle class. We’ve never been poor, we’ve always had food, we have a lot of newer tech like phones and such, and we recently bought a house. But, we’ve never been a whole family. My dad was a beer-only alcoholic. He would drink 18 packs like it was nothing and smoke weed a lot. If he didn’t have those things he would flip the fuck out. My mom recently told me that he spent $1,800 a month some months on those alone. He was abusive verbally and physically to my mom and me (not as much to my younger and older brother). Mainly verbal but he was never afraid to hit my mom. He got sick in February with some colon related things and took up god and all of that. So he changed completely but to me it’s too little to late that piece of shit can rot in hell (sorry about that that just how I feel). My mom has always worked hard. She would work her ass off landscaping alone. She makes good money too. But she was abusive in her own way but never as bad. She wants what’s best for me and loves me. She’s wayyy over protective and she has a hard time understanding what really is best for me and what’s not. 

What I actually need advice on: my gf and her family have offered to let me live with them and go to school with them if my mom says yes, and I really want to because I feel like getting out of such a toxic environment and receiving a fresh start would help me commit to raising my grades and not becoming some bum who can hardly afford to live. Should I even bother trying to talk to my mom about it? Would it even be a good idea? How do I bring it up? I guess I just want to know if doing this would actually help me out or not. 

If you have any extra questions just PM me and I’ll answer those asap. I leave Tuesday to go back home and I want to sort this out beforehand because my mom isn’t an easy person to talk to in person. Thanks if you read all of this. ",13Aug2018,1
141,"tldr: my (first) boyfriend has kiiiiiiinda been ignoring me. i know he’s busy, but it still FeelsBadMan. any advice?

extended version: a couple months ago, there was a period of time - probably three weeks or so - during which he belittled me in front of our mutual friends, didn’t acknowledge my attempts to make conversation, constantly cancelled plans due to being busy... i completely respect that he was busy, since we of course have lives outside of being with each other, but it made me feel forgotten? i guess?

we talked through it and cleared things up so everything seemed to be fine until recently. he’s kinda been repeating the same behaviour from a couple months ago, and it just kinda sucks to be feeling this way again. he’s been a bit busy as of late - which is understandable and reasonable - but he doesn’t respond to any of my messages asking how he’s been, and he cancelled plans with me to play video games instead.

it’s my first time being in a romantic relationship, so i don’t really know what to do next? i guess want to try talking about it, since that seemed to work out last time, but i haven’t been able to see him at all recently due to his schedule, and i don’t really want to have a text conversation about it since it’s easy for miscommunication to happen. communication is definitely key, but is there anything else that i could do?

143,"This is probably going to be long and dragged out but there are so many details that are included in this so I don't think anything should be left out. 
18 y/o Female here. My father has always been in and out of my life due to felony charges and prison time. My mother and him tried making it work when they had me but because of his abusive tendencies, it didn't work out. Ever since I was a kiddo, having a father like all of my friends seemed like a fantasy. 
There were a few years throughout 6th - freshman year of high school when he was actually consistently in my life. I'd go over to the basement he rented out every weekend and bond over Transformers and me teaching him how to use electronics. I didn't start seeing the first red flags from him until I was 12, when he forced me to chug 3 beers in front of him. I've attended a few AA meetings with him during this point as well. Noticed that he went through possibly over twenty women that had all met me and genuinely enjoyed my company too. He then went back to prison for 4 years after Christmas break of freshman year. 
I had decided for those 4 years that I didn't want anything to do with him. He would try calling and I'd hang up right when I heard the robotic voice saying it was from a state penitentiary, and I didn't let my grandmother update him with any pictures or information about me. 
Less than a month after my 18th birthday last year I had met up with him the day he got out of prison for lunch. Then from that point on, I began seeing him regularly, I would often give him rides and run errands with him, and visit him at his tiny 1 bedroom apartment in the city a few times a week. He wouldn't have any luck with day jobs he'd apply to and began getting back into the male stripping business. The empty promises continued, as an example, we were supposed to watch Stranger Things together and eat pizza, but instead, when I walked in the door he wanted me to leave right away so he could do cocaine with a buddy of his. 
He continued to lie and cheat on a steady girlfriend he had, would promise to go to AA but then have a beer in his hand at 7 in the morning. Then it got to the point where he would put me down, tell me that I had an ugly face but that ""Its alright though because you have a rockin' body"". He had a few rants at me by telling me that I was a worthless spoiled brat because I didn't feel like driving him 30 minutes away so he could go see his girlfriend. 
I cut him out of my life on Father's day because I just had enough of his bullshit. But now that I turn 19 on Saturday, and the fact that my late paternal grandfather's birthday is coming up, I'm starting to miss having my father in my life. I just want a normal father-daughter relationship. 
Something to add: My anxiety and mental anguish has gone down drastically since I cut him out of my life. It's only been about two months but I really feel like it was the best decision, but I'm having second thoughts. 
There's definitely more to add but I feel like this is way too much to read. 
TL;DR : Should I let my emotionally abusive/alcoholic father back into my life in hopes that I can get him to turn his life around, or should I deal with the fact that I will never have a normal and healthy relationship with him and keep him out of my life?

Ill just jump right into it. So like the title states i have a friend who is in really really bad shape. She has been going through a lot lately between work her parents previous relationships school and quite frankly our relationship. And she occasionally snaps and beats her legs to the point of bruising badly enough that she wears pants to cover it up. She knows im always there to talk to her and does usually right after the fact but i can only help so much. She is hurt deeply down to the core and often wants to push people out of her life (including me and explicitly asked why i wont just leave her like everyone else) in addition she abuses weed and alcohol. Now before everone jumps my boat on that part im fine with getting drunk to have fun and relaxing with weed every now and then but this is different. When shes hurting she often tries to drink it away. Or even when she goes out with friends mentions how the alcohol is gonna make her better/make her problems go away. On top of this many days she lacks the motivation to get out of bed or to even do art (which she loves)
And i am going to ask my doctor who is close to my family what her advice would be given whats happening.

On top of which i have a seperate question she does take oral birth control witch seems could be affecting her. Because she gets nauseus, headaches, wants to throw up, but everywhere i look theres conflicting articles to wheather it  can cause depression.(if you tell me one way or the other pls link me somwhere official i can read about it im tired of trying to sort throigh cnn,fox,business insider and other news outlets when i want scientific or somewhat difinitve answers) on top of which im super worried because this stuff is only effective if you take it everyday but if someone often lacks the motivstion to get out of bed how likely are they to take their birth controll

Im just super stressed out in general and have had the hardest most confusing week of my life and am legitimately worried for my friend like laying on the cold tile of a bathroom at two in the morning worried. 

Just any advice or support in general would be greatly appreciated until i can get back into town and talk to my doctor.

148,"So, i don't really know how to go about this. Is it okay to just spill my guts out here? I'm not someone who typically asks for help. And when i do i sure as hell don't usually go to reddit. However, i'm at a loss and those who i try to talk to and think can give me the best advice either a) don't care, b) don't know what to say, or c) spin the situation to talk about themselves. I'm not depressed. Just frusturated. I'm lacking with friends. When i say friends i mean good friends. I have ""friends"", but i dont consider them good. Let me explain. All my friends right now make me sad. Lately my going away party just occured as i am taking a huge step forward in my life. However, when i invited 15+ friends to come only 5 showed up. Trust me i know this is no big deal. People get busy. Life happens. I know. However, no one even responded really to my invite. A lot of them opened it. Some gave a ""i'll see"" response and then nothing. I'm someone who likes to have things planned and hate on the spot things. My family is the same way. So when they asked me to give me an idea of whos coming i just tell them ""potentially 15+"" and when they get frusturated i do too. Its hard to plan for an unknown number of people. I also understand that things happen rapidly. No one knows what might happen and i get that. However, no response when i gave people a weeks notice is really maddening. Only 1 of the friends that showed up i considered genuine. 1 i think can be genuine with more communication. The other 3 frusturated me. Im not one to post a lot on sc. I dont like shoving my life into other people. However, when the people i invite take videos showing off EACH OTHER being at my party, but leave ME out of their videos. Im a little hurt. Im grateful they came and went out of their way just for me, but it didnt feel like they came for me. It felt like they came because they were bored. The other 2 i mentioned as potential and genuine did feel like they came because they wanted to see me and i felt happy for them being there. Thats just the party tho. My friends also make me feel like i cant talk to them. I'll always try to conversate with people, but they either don't respond, respond with one word replies, or act so uninterested. Im sick of it. When i was still in highschool i always felt like everyone just didnt care to talk to me or associate with me. In group projects everyone ran to their friends and the ""friends"" i did have always had someone they wanted to be with over me. I was always the straggler. Except in calculus when people wanted to be my partner, so they would get full credit. I dont think im doing anything wrong. Am i the problem? Do i just have a lot of bad friends? Im willing to change, but i dont know what i have to change. I kinda just ranted and might delete this because i feel awkward texting it.

Here’s the dilemma, we are both getting burned out with the work we do, me because I dislike what I do and have zero opportunities for growth. My wife because she feels she’s missing a lot of our three kids growing up. We want to kind of tip the scales with me working full time in a job I like and my wife working a lot less or not at all. 

I am looking for a new job right now, and have an interview for an internship as a graphic designer on Tuesday. It’s a three month internship and I’m stressing about the schedule even before I know if I’ll get the job or not. 

Here’s the other issue. My wife makes about 3 times more than I make right now, and if I get a new job, it will be at the very bottom of the barrel and I will make even less than her. To get where we want to get, she’d have to continue working while I’m slowly working my way up the ladder in my new job to make even remotely close to what she makes. If we are both working so much our kids will get pawned off on other people. We’ve got family close that are already helping watch the kids on days we both work, one morning one night, but they are our parents who are getting in their late 60s/70s . We wouldn’t be able to afford childcare, nor would I want someone else raise my kids even if I could afford it. 

I love my kids so much, I get my two older daughters ready every day for school, I stay home with my almost 2 year old son and play with him every day. My son and I are so close right now, when he gets hurt he wants me, when he wakes up he’s looking for me, wants to show me all the airplanes and birds and trucks and busses that he loves. He’s not as close to my wife because she leaves early for work and is home for dinner on her work days and then bedtime routine which kids don’t like. I love that we’re close but I’m sad he’s not as close with my wife. I’m also super close with my daughters, I make their lunches, can do any girl hairstyle and love being home with them in the mornings. 

Do I try for another job that I may like way more and give up the time with my kids so my wife can have that time? Possibly resulting in far less money for our family but probably with a more nurturing definitely more kind, maybe too nice mother? I feel guilty for getting to spend more of the fun time with my kids. Or do we keep things as is until all our kids are in school and then I find more fulfillment in my work?

It triggered a panic attack on my second day and I passed out in the bathroom for a few seconds oops. Now the fear of these kind of images/videos being shown in meetings makes me feel ill a lot of the time, and it's triggered a few more attacks in the weeks since. 

I'm in the process of getting my anxiety under control, but does this mean that I can't have a career here? Or in this industry at all? I've had my heart set on going into the biomedical field since high school, so what do I do now? I want to be able to help people in my career, but I don't want to feel this bad at work all the time either. ",13Aug2018,1
152,"So last week my boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me. It wasn't without some level of warning, we were in a rough patch, but I wasn't expecting it to end, more of a patch we would come out of stronger. He was the absolute love of my life and the break up has left me feeling so broken and alone.

Throughout the last 6 months I did some minor things that he didn't like and they built up to things that he hated. Me texting an old friend with some flirty language made him think I was cheating on him (I wasn't), me being quite a loud voice on social media made him hate that I talked about things publicly so much (never our personal lives though, but I work in CRM which is a global email comms channel for a large gaming company do I'm always on or immersed in social media). Heck he will probably see this post and hate that I am sharing too much.

In March, we booked a holiday to Japan, which was supposed to happen at the end of the month. We talked this week about salvaging it, but it turns out he really doesn't want to take a risk again through fear of more pain. I respect this, and fight as I have over the last 7 days for him, we finally came to a breaking point last night and cut off the conversation chat we have been running for 2 years through WhatsApp. This is because I was still seeing it as a small connection to his heart and he didn't think it would help to keep talking right after the break up (and he is probably right there). Anyways I stupidly bought the plane tickets without cancellation insurance as the last thing on my mind back then was that we might break up, and now I don't know if I can get that back. It's not a big issue, but still a lot of money to be wasted, along with the JR Passes and Portable WiFi, around €2k. Now, the bigger commitment we made shortly after that was to the dog we adopted together. A little light of love in our lives which we both poured all of our hearts into. Every day he brought us stress from being a pain in the ass, but so much joy, and it was a commitment we made together (again though he stayed in my apartment and I paid for him, so he became my sole responsibility after the break up).

Now this dog brought us so much joy, but now he is a source of pain for me, as I see so much of my ex-boyfriend in him, and he takes up literally all of my free time looking after him, walking him and playing with him. It hurts more because he has little tricks that he taught him, and whenever he does one, I break more inside. The tough decision here is that I don't know if I can cope with the dog alone, and as such may need to give him away. It breaks my heart to consider it but I can't let a dog be the reason I get consumed by grief and my life falls off the tracks. It's unfair that after the break up I got left with so much baggage to deal with, such as all the Japan stuff, the dog, and the fact that my ex-boyfriend was the only reason I was still staying in this country. Now he is gone, I have nothing left to stay here for and might need to go back to my home country to feel a bit less vulnerable.

So reddit, that's some of the story so far, it's long and emotional, and probably missed some parts, but I need some advice, some comfort, some words of wisdom. I am not interested in hearing what I should have done six months ago though, just want to hear what I can do now.

Thanks for listening.

This guy literally to my face says ""I'm going to get you fired because I highly doubt you work here"". Once again... I say ""sir thats my spot"".

157,"This might be a little abstract but I’m hoping I can get some help because I’m starting to freak myself out a little! So I’m in my last year of undergrad and I definitely have a lot (too much?) going on. I’m taking four classes, which is actually less than usual, and am also doing research for 8 hours a week (Monday-Thursday, two hours per morning before I go to class). I also have two part-time jobs- one of them is at school at the Writing Center and I work a minimum of 10 hours a week, usually closer to 14 towards the end of the semester although I probably won’t be able to work as many given my class and research schedule. The other one is at a hospital and it’s only on Saturdays and Sundays in the mornings, starting at 8:30 with no set end time, just whenever I’m done (I’m a newborn hearing screener, so whenever I’m done screening all the babies is when I go home! Usually never there later than noon but it depends). Additionally, I’m getting ready to apply to grad schools which may not seem like a huge deal but it’s going to take up a lot of time. 

So all that being said, my question is how can I stay mentally healthy during all this? I’m not really worried about being able to get all of it done because I’m an obsessive planner user so I’m pretty good with time management for school and work stuff. But I really want to have time to work out and cook my meals and also have a social life with my friends and boyfriend. Is it just not possible at this stage in my life? I keep trying to figure out my time schedule and factor in my potential two hour commute (I live in Houston so it depends on the day) and it just seems like a lot. I wanted to start seeing my therapist more but it seems like I won’t have time for that either. So does anyone have any advice about how to approach this so I won’t have a mental breakdown midway through the semester? I’d really appreciate all your advice! ",13Aug2018,1

162,"My best friend is one of the most important people in my life. We tell each other everything (she thinks). 

But even though I trust her and respect her, I lied when she asked me a personal question. Over the last year I've lied to her several times when referencing the subject matter of the personal question. 

I lied because I was nervous and ashamed about the answer. Then I kept lying because of the added fear of destroying her trust. 

The weird part is that while I've told two other people the truth, I just couldn't tell her, and I'm still not sure why. I feel extremely guilty to have breached her trust, but I'm scared to face the repercussions of confessing the truth, especially because I can't explain why I told others but not her (and it would be counterproductive to exclude this part of the truth from her if I'm trying to do the right thing by coming clean.)

On one hand, my friend deserves to not be lied to. On the other hand, it's been too long for the truth to come out and not harm our friendship. In addition, what she asked me has nothing to do with her and only affects me. And the chances of her finding out the truth are slim.

167,"I can't believe I am posting on here, but here goes nothing... I am going to be a senior in high school and I have been crazy about one girl since freshman year, lets call her Emily. Lets start out at freshman year, I have always been really shy but I really wanted this girl so I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try to get closer to her. I started to become friends with some of her friends to try and get to know more about her, but that took a turn for the worse when they started to crush on me hard. I never had a thing for any of her friends so I cut contact with them. Although her friends were extremely pissed because I basically ghosted them, Emily and I continued to snapchat. Fast forward to sophomore year and I still have feelings for Emily, we still snapchat, but she responds maybe once a day or every other day, and we've only talked maybe twice. (This is where I get confused) As sophomore year winds down, Emily decided to snapchat me saying ""Hi"" or something along those lines, so I respond and I'm totally stoked. Sounds great right? Nope, I got no response back. Although I was a little annoyed I thought maybe she had accidentally sent me the wrong snapchat. WRONG, the next weekend she does the same thing, and the same thing the following weekend. Now at this point I really had no idea if Emily liked me so I didn't make any moves. As Junior year rolls around I decided it was really time for me to move on and I tried to stop snapping her, but I was met with a barrage of snapchats from her so I responded. Once I respond I get a snapchat immediately back, not even 30 seconds later and so I respond again, bad call by me I guess because she then proceeded to ignore me for a week. Now I'm pissed and over the course of the next couple months I am finally able to lose some of my feelings for her, aka I don't constantly think about her. Now fast forward to this summer, I am going out more and feeling great when I find out one of my friend's is talking to her. I really didn't have a problem with this until one night I did something I probably shouldn't have and sent her a (possibly drunk) snap of myself. Our friend groups ended up meeting up a couple times (she has different friends than before) which ended up reigniting my feelings for her. My friend didn't like Emily but supposedly she told him she liked him. This obviously hurt a little (or a lot) but at least I knew she wasn't into me. Now onto the most recent event where my friends and I went to a party. I knew Emily was going to be there, but I was determined to give her as little attention as possible to help forget about her. As soon as we walked in Emily runs up to me, gives me a huge hug and maybe a minute later she comes back up to me and offers me some of her drink which I obviously accepted but I really didn't want to. She continued to occasionally offer me drinks throughout the night while also attempting to make small talk. I was able to make it through the party without doing anything dumb but now I'm extremely confused and lost. This girl is tearing me to pieces inside, she is all that I think about and I need it to stop. Should I continue to pursue this girl and if so what should be my next steps? ",13Aug2018,1

I tried to change the brightness and test it using with both low and high brightness but no difference. It has a 60Hz screen that I can't change either. The saturation and contrast are set normal.

Before this notebook I used a cheaper Lenovo with no touchscreen. My eyes were okay. I guess because that had a different screen.

171,"I am a 23 year old female who is friends with a 20 year old male. We met about a year ago when I went into his work. We had common interests and I made it very clear right away I was only looking for friends. I got the impression he was lonely and was looking for someone as his ex broke up with him a month prior. 

Anyhow. Friendship was good we hung out and he met my friends. It seemed fine. Until one day I invited him to come hang out with my best friend Kristy. She lost something in her fiancées car so he tagged along to the place she was at. He acted weird the whole time and later I found out he was asking Kristy repeatedly why she was “here ruining our date”. I never agreed to a date or anything, we went as friends. It happens again a week later when myself and a few co workers and Kristy hung out. He then again asked her that. 

I told him to stop telling people we were dating. We weren’t. We are friends. He then got annoyed I wouldn’t hang out alone with him. Again. Not taking a hint. 

I distanced myself for a few months as I was working 2 jobs briefly helping a friend plus full time job. After it seemed better. He was acting normal. But then again about -3 weeks ago the creepy clingy stuff happened. Again, saying we were going on dates. And that I cancelled on his date with me as my friend was having a hard time... 

My friend Nora had her birthday about 2 weeks ago. Kristy, Nora, Nora’s friend and him were there. The entire time he had his hands on me at the bar and told Nora’s friend we were together. The next day I get 3 messages from Nora, Noras and my friend Shelby as well as another asking if he was my boyfriend. NO!!!! He told them all. 

I confronted him and told him to stop. I don’t have feelings for you. He seemed to get it. But nope. Then one night he was with me at kristys and when I was talking to her he barges in and says that he’s mad how she always ruins our dates and is mad at the “situation” not her. I nearly lost my shit. Her fiancée left her a week prior and this is how you speak to her???

Then I cold shoulder ignored him for maybe 12 hours. He texts Kristy and my close friend Grant who he met once about me not responding. They both ended up at my work asking wtf is going on. I explain and they are just confused. 

Then I responded. Said work was busy etc. then he starts in with the hearts and the you’re pretty and I think your hot 10/10 shit. Then invites me to some weird concert out of town. I had to lie and say I have a staff meeting that day at that time... HE STILL WONT GET IT. Then shortly thereafter: “I think you’re pretty I want you to know that”. 

I have tried being nice and always having an excuse, inviting him with friends around, saying no we aren’t dating. Short of blocking him I don’t know what to do! My friends keeps threatening to text him and go nuts but I don’t want that. He’s a nice person. I just don’t know how much longer I can do this. If I stop answering he will harass them and they will snap. He knows where I work. He’ll just come there and  talk to me. I neve lead him on and I have no idea where he got this idea from that we are a couple!!!! What can I do to stop this. ",13Aug2018,2

I’m currently working in an admin job that doesn’t mean much to me. I was planning on leaving in January when my contract is up but my boss is now pregnant (leaving October) and won’t be back til April/May so I think I will now stay back until then. But this field is not my passion. 

I completed 3 years of my 5 year degree but deferred when I realised I did not want to use it, however I haven’t officially dropped out because the thought of wasting 3 years of my life kills me. I have 2 years full time remaining of this course and I’m not sure if I should do this or not. 4 years part time is not really an option for me because I really want to have a baby in about two years. Unless I put this off??

I’ve enrolled in a part time online diploma in another field which I am excited about and start in February.

I had an old job which I really loved but left to go travelling and I’ve been tempted to go back there, however the problem is you need to be studying the degree I was doing to be able to work there. 

These are the most obvious two options for me from my perspective:

1. Drop out of the degree, continue working in my current job and do the diploma next year. Figure out rest after that.

2. Leave current job, enrol full time back in my degree, do online diploma at same time, work back at old job.

I’m 31 been with this girl for a year and a half. We are both in hospitality it was okay for a while and we moved in out of “fuck it let’s save money” kind of agreement. We drank a lot I never touched her she comes at me. Can’t really hurt me she’s 100lbs I’ve learned to just grab my dog and leave the apartment. But of course when I do that she starts breaking things (I’m really sick of cleaning glass) when I’m gone.  

Any way she helped me get the apartment we live in now. She’s not on the lease. I told her already that I’d pay 2 months completely and let her save to move out. I pay internet etc.  I’ve been trying to stay sober and going to therapy so I don’t go out drinking anymore. I’m tired of wasting money. I’ve been sick because of course when you stop heavy drinking you get really shitty for a while. And she’s kept up the same pace. I’ve told her I’m okay with her seeing other people. I just want to be at peace at my house but again she came home drunk saying she’s wasted so much time on me. And started breaking glass whatever she could get a hold of. My therapist told me I’m suffering from depression and severe anxiety. (I love bartending but I’m sick of it in so many ways) So at this point I’m thinking about my options do I just call the cops get her stuff out and get a restraining order? I’m a wreck most days and only get up out of bed for work and for my poor sweet dog. I’m tired of living this way and I’m trying not to do things the cut and dry police way.

182,"Hi, so I’m college student and I just started a job 2 weeks ago in a suit retail/rental wedding hire shop and I have also just been offered a job in Calvin Klein. Both jobs pay the same hourly rate.

The issue is I’m still waiting on my college timetable. The suit shop is open Monday to Saturday 10-6 with the exception of late night Thursday till 7. Calvin Klein is a small concession in a department store and is open 7 days a week from 9:30-7 with late night shopping till 9 both on Thursday and Friday.

If my college timetable does not give me a day off during the week and has me in Monday to Friday the only day I can work in the suit shop is Saturday as they do not do half days/split shifts. There is no such issue with Calvin Klein as I could work 5-9/3-7 weekdays and Saturday and Sundays. I need at least 12 hours a week to survive with 16 being ideal.

That’s the main issue and deciding factor and I don’t get my timetable for another 3 weeks, I will also have this issue/worry every semester when I get a new timetable. Other pros and cons of each;

“                “ cons - NOT FLEXIBLE HOURS BUT COULD SUIT DEPENDING ON TIMETABLE, multiple locations some with long travel times but some very close to home.

Calvin Klein pros - FLEXIBLE HOURS, discount clothes in the whole department store, one location which is easy to get to by bus as it’s in the city centre (20 minutes)
“                   “ Cons - can’t drive, monthly pay

I have previously worked in a suit shop like this before for a semester but going in I knew my college hours and that I had Monday &amp; Friday off. I may not be so lucky this semester or next.

I have till later on today to respond to Calvin Klein’s offer. Thanks for any and all opinions/advice.

Ps. This is my final year of my degree so two more semesters left, but if I decide to do a masters I’ll have 4 more semesters left. I’m looking to just find a job and get comfortable in so no more job hunting etc.",13Aug2018,1

184,"So, I’ve been living abroad for the past 6ish years (currently in Spain) and I’m thinking about moving home. To be honest, I think about it all the time.

It’s a gut feeling I’ve had for a while, however this is a pretty big decision and I want to make sure I don’t do anything I regret, so why not ask here! 

Here goes:

First, I really do miss my friends and family. I don’t feel like I have many friends here, when you teach English abroad people have a tendency to come and go. My life just feels a bit empty, I have little motivation. 

Work will pick up again in September so I have been considering staying one more year, my motivation is leaving me though. I mostly enjoy the work but it doesn’t pay great. I was hoping to take a vacation back home to test the waters but I’m not sure I’d be able to afford it. This month I’m just doing online work but it’s so infrequent I don’t know if I’ll be able to afford the rent next month. 

My mum she lives in a very rural area of the U.K. so it might be tricky to get a job there, however I would be able to continue with the online work. It’s also a very tranquil place to be which I think would do my mental health wonders, it hasn’t been great for the past few years. 

However Spain is a lovely place to live, the weather is fantastic, the food is amazing, people are very friendly and the lifestyle is very relaxed and laid back. 

So what do you think? What would you do in my shoes? I’m so torn! ",13Aug2018,1

205,"Hey!
As in my title, Id like to get tips as to not expect things from people. 
Im a 31 F, and my whole life I have been lacking emotional support (as I wrote in another post). So, I cant count on my family at all. For example, I have been outside of my country for more than a year, and I meet with my mother in another country. I asked her to bring me some snacks and some personal belongings, and during a month I was constantly reminding her about it. Long story short, she didnt bring me anything, which to be honest its something it made me very upset until now. 

Now Im working at this roadhouse, in the middle of nowhere. There are 3 girls working. One of them really dislikes me and has made racist remarks (Im latina, shes european) and unluckily the guy she likes got interested on me so theres som kind of anger towards that. The other girl is a very sweet girl that would get along great with me at the beginning but she decided to exclude me from the occasionally get together after work, so in order of not feeling sad about it I stopped sharing with her (i would stay until very late with her because she wanted me to keep her company at work). 

And the last girl works directly with me. She was asked to help me during mornings because my job gets super busy, and at the beginning she did it great! She was awesome help and I could rely on her, but now she doesnt help me at all. I understand that it might be because she is super tired, but Im also super tired, and all the help she doesnt provide me, means I have to do it for her. The problem with her is that she doesnt like when I ask her to help me. And today we had a big fight because instead of helping me, she goes to prepare her breakfast and eat it (for more than 30 mins) and instead of writing it as breaks, she just considers that as if she was working. I tried to talk to her by telling her if she had an agreement with our boss, and she started yelling at me, saying I was just spying on her, and that i was just ruining her morning and that I had a problem because they all hate me. 

Which is pretty much real. I can see that Im the problem in this situation. It is impossible that they are all the assholes and Im the nice one. Its
Like, when you smell shit, check your own shoes. But, how can I deal with it? I just work and focuse on that. After work I dont leave my room (thats after 3, until next day at 6) and even doing all that I still find red flags. I have a very high ethical values when it comes to work, and to be honest I may should had keep quiet with this girl not helping me, but I hve the impulse of saying things sometimes. I was in no way disrespectful or angry, I just wanted to talk to come up to an agreement about working together. 

Sorry if I took too long. The truth is that I have no one to tslk about this. The advice Im looking is about how not to expect anything from anyone, and how to deal with this work/live in environment (I wont leave because Im making tons of money)",13Aug2018,2
206,"So, I recently moved in with 2 new roommates, after moving closer to my job. I’ve known one of them for a few years, and only recently met his sister. I’ve slept with the AC on 68-70, mainly 68, the majority of my life, and every night at my last place, which I was at for 3 years. Recently, my roommate, the one who I’ve known, tells me that unless I pay extra for the electricity each month, we won’t be running the AC on 68. I told him I would make a compromise and run it at 72-73, but even that feels hot as hell to me. I don’t run it at that during the winter, for obvious reasons, as I can just open a window. But, it does get hot at night here. I don’t have a ceiling fan, but do have a standing fan. Even with that on though, without the AC on 68-70, it feels uncomfortably hot. I’m currently in my bed, sweating, and uncomfortable. Either way, more often than not at night, after I set it to 73, I wake up sweating to find out someone has set it to 75. 

Should I just “pay the extra %”, even though they’re utilizing the AC, since it’s not only being directed to my room? I feel like I’m not asking for a lot here, but, given that I’m being gone around on my compromise, I think it’s fair to combat this. Thoughts?",13Aug2018,1
207,"Hey, so my friend recently told me she joined twitter and she asked me to follow her

The problem is that I have 2 accounts, one person and one anonymous.

I barely use my personal account, in fact I haven't touched it in years.

Alternatively, my anonymous account is used daily, I have a bunch of tweets and followers and I use it to keep up with online friends. My personal one died after highschool ended and I have no real use for it now.

The only problem is privacy and I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not to do. A lot of the people I interact with do know my name and know what I look like, but other than that it's pretty impersonal.

There's nothing on the account I'm afraid of having there, and it'd still be pretty hard to for someone to figure out who I am from following her, but it's still opening that avenue. I've just always been open on privacy, however a lot of online friends are really open about who they are, what they look like, etc, so I don't feel too worried about it.

I started my job as a software engineer and within one year moved to become a support engineer due to my 1st company down sizing. I worked as a support engineer for a year and soon my next company recognized me to be a good fit for project management and I soon become a important person in the management team 6 months later. I was working 14 a 16 hours a day by this time. 

During this time I always wanted to do better as I was only earning roughly $650/month. So I quit and came to Singapore looking for an opportunity as a software engineer again(which is what I love doing) and I got a job after a lot of pain. No technical interview questions no drama..

213,"(I originally posted this on r/makemychoice)

Sorry if this sounds overly dramatic and is a bit long and rambling.

The job in question has been causing me massive amounts of stress for a while now but it has gotten worse over the last month or so. I'm not an emotional person by any means however I've been crying more in the past weeks than I've ever have and it's all because I'm worrying about work. I feel like I've not gotten a good night’s sleep in weeks and it's starting to affect my relationships with other people and the quality of my work. I constantly feel like a nervous wreck when I'm in the office and I don't feel like I can speak to my line managers as they just want results, not problems to deal with.

I do have applications sent for other jobs, but nothing confirmed yet - I just feel so unhappy that I can't even devote the time to write up applications when I'm at home because my mind is always on my current job. I'm wondering if I should bite the bullet and just hand my notice in ASAP and then I can devote all of my time to finding other employment - I know it's easier to find a job when you have a job but I don't think I can go on much longer without having a breakdown of some kind.

I'm not a student and I've been in full-time employment at this job for the last 2 years. I currently live with my parent as I'm saving up for my own place with my partner - so while I have no bills I do pay my parent every month to help with the food and bills etc.

I would drop my hours if I could, however one of my colleagues did something similar as she was a single parent and the upper management brought in someone to replace her and made her redundant when she had all her work taken off her. I'd rather that didn't happen to me too.

I do have some expenditure, car insurance and tax for example, however I do have enough saved up that I would be comfortable for 3 to 4 months should the worst happen - probably more if I started being more frugal with my money if I left this job. I just feel that there's more to life than work and my mental health is much more important than a nice pay-check every month.

I would really appreciate any advice on the subject - I've spoken to family and friends about this, but it would be nice to hear what other people have to say as well.",13Aug2018,1

Back in February of this year, I let a friend move in with me. I needed a roommate, and he needed a safe, stable place to live after years of going between couches and hotels. For the most part, things started out fine aside from minor lifestyle differences. He had some issues in the past with relationships and addiction, but I took pity on the guy.

Flash forward to May of this year. Around his birthday, he got a hotel room but couldn't pay the security deposit. I've paid for friends before because I know that will be refunded, and after an hour of convincing me to trust him, I put down my card for the fee. The room was in his name, so I figured he'd wouldn't do anything stupid. One week later, I'm sitting in the hotel lobby (the Doubletree in Mission Valley, San Diego if anyone's curious) in tears as the head of security was explaining the $2,108.56 charge on my debit card for felony vandalism. 

My ""friend"" had invited his trash ex-girlfriend to stay with him because he wanted to try and repair their relationship. The little angel is a p.o.s. heroin addict with a violent temper and severe lack of any personal decency. He had said something to upset her, so she took a key and snuck in after he left to check out, graffitied the walls, trashed the room, and even brought another dude in to help her. They were on camera together leaving the hotel. She also confessed via text to doing it, but said she wouldn't turn herself in because her mother (a city official for homeless resources in San Diego, which makes me even more sick) told her it would be best to let me take the financial hit. 

Both the police and the hotel told me to claim it as fraud since, because my card at the time HAD funds, there was nothing they could do to refund it and hold the real culprit accountable. She is also ironically homeless herself, so chasing her down for a court battle would be beyond pointless. Due to this, my bank account went (and remained) negative about $2000. 

This was just the beginning of my problems though... he wasn't able to pay rent after that. So in June and July, I paid our full rent plus my own bills on his word he'd pay me back for it all when he got a check he was expecting in August. He even signed a contract saying he would do so, but I honestly think I knew then he wouldn't pull through. ",13Aug2018,17

220,Just a short back story: I am 34 and have been in a relationship with my current boyfriend going on 11 years. I have two children from my ex-husband. My children are my number one priority in life however I am in a committed happy relationship with my best friend! I truly consider myself to be very blessed. Just this past Sunday my boyfriend and I both have our hearts over to God and became born again Christians. We do not live together. Nor do I wish  to until my children are grown and out on their own. My boyfriend and I have spoken a lot about marriage and have come to the agreement that having a legal marriage does not suit us. However we would love to have a commitment ceremony surrounded by friends and family and performed by our Pastor. This brings several questions to mind: One- Would a pastor be willing to perform such a ceremony if it won’t be recognized by the state? Two- Is such a commitment blessed by God? Please when you go to answer keep in mind that I understand that this isn’t the conventional way to do things. I understand that some may not understand our choices of not loving under one roof or wanting a legal marriage. I am strictly curious on the Bible’s view of marriage. Thanks again for any input! Be nice and God bless!,13Aug2018,0
221,So im about to earn a diploma in electronics engineering. Im thinking about doing a part time of bachelor's degree. Its like monday-friday is working days. In weekend i have to attend classes. Im actually in an internship and im awkward and i have social anxiety. But being exposed to an internship have improved myself by a bit. Im still not good at making friends and socializing. But i want to gain work experience while earn a bachelor's degree so that i can get a job easier than a bachelor's degree fresh graduate. Im actually not that good in this field. I have a cgpa of around 2.8 right now and i dont usually understand what the professors taught in classes. I always have to bother my friends and ask them question and teach me. What do you think?

222,"I have been studying Mechanical engineering in Germany for 4 years with no success. In all that time i never though of who i was or what my goals were. Everytime i thought about my future i instantly blocked it or thought of something else. Recently I advanced more in who i was and what were my qualities and all of that and i think i might not like mechanical engineering so much as i thought. What made me pick the career was money, all my friends were going to study that, i was good with numbers and physics so i thought it would be easier. Hell i didnt even know what an engineer did, i just thought people would think good things of me because i was an engineer. I have been struggling with my academics this past years and my parents have always been supportive of me cause they also say that because i went to high school in a different country it must be more difficult for me. I made a pros and cons of why should i change my career list and i wrote more pros than cons. I think the main reason is because i want to be happy and i dont think that if i continue in this career i will be happy. 
My pros of why should i be changing my career are
- A fresh star
- I dont even find a motor that interesting
- When i picked my career i didnt have goals, i didnt even knew who i was
- I dont feel happy with mechanical engineering
- I think when i picked to study this i picked it for the wrong reasons
- I didnt even know what an engineer did when i chose what to study
- I am not motivated to keep studying it
- I chose it mainly because of money and peoples opinion
Cons (Why should i keep studying this):
- Do not want to disappoint my parents
- I already started it
- I like planes (or the idea of flying)
- I am already 23 and i think i am to old for starting from 0
- What will everyone else think about me (Yea I know i think to much of that)
For possible careers i though of Architecture. I always liked to build things with legos and i like history as well. I would like to build things. 
So yea i wanted to ask everyone their advice or what do they thought about my situation?

224,"

Two weeks ago, I went to my hometown to visit my parents. My straight (M/20) best friend  (whom I have feelings but he doesn’t know) and I works in the same company and lives in one place (but we are not roommates).

My friend and two of our coworkers have drink that night. We chatted on Facebook messenger the whole night until after they were finished. Throughout the conversation, we said things we say in person. I know he was already drunk when said he loves me, and that he is serious. He also kept on asking me to come back (which I interpret as him missing me). I consider it as a joke, that he doesn’t know what he was saying. The next morning made me really confuse about our conversation. We continue to flirt, and even exchanged some sexual jokes. And he is sober. He even sent me his semi nude selfie. 

That made me believe that he still remember everything we talked last night. 

Last week, we go out for a drink with his girlfriend. She opened up to me everything that happened that night and the days after. She said that my friend was uneasy and kept saying why I’m still not coming back. She also said that the night he was drunk, he kept on talking about me to our coworkers, told her he’s already in love with me and says my name when he was sleeping. 

When I came back, we acted like it didn’t happened. I didn’t expect that something’s going to the next level because he is in a relationship. I also don't want to put myself in a position where they break up because he (if he's exploring bisexuality) maybe in a drunken or heated moment, decides to do something with me so I’m backing off. 

It’s just that I’m really confused right now about everything he said. I just want to know if it’s real, or just another drunk talk. ",13Aug2018,1

I’m now 21 and thinking of changing my course to accounting or business but I’m only left with two years of government funding. Is it worth applying from a private student loans company for a loan for the first year of my course?

233," Small summary; My boyfriend(M25) is 'close friends' with another female, but I suspect that there's more going on. I have the feeling they might had sex, but no clear proof. I found some flirtatious texting between them. The girl, lets call her Anne, is best friends with another girl Trish. Trish is on a long trip to Australia currently. Boyfriend and Trish don't know one another, but Anne told some stuff about Trish to my boyfriend.

Trish and Anne had an text conversation and it went like this(made it shorter);

Anne; So much happend since you left.

Trish; Guuuurl tell me all about it.

Anne; Had 4 tinder dates, new cat, new tattoo.

Trish; Whaaaat you never tell me anything gurll *more rambling*.

Anne made a screenshot of this convo and send it to my boyfriend. The caption was; she missed so much 😆😂😂😃 Boyfriend replied with; haha😂

So..why on earth would she send him this. The tinder stuff isn't related to my boyfriend because they didn't meet through Tinder. (Yes i am sure)

**What made me think; they made a vow that they won't tell anyone they had sex, and Anne wanted to show him that she doesn't even tell her best friend about it?**

Can someone give me advice? I asked BF about it, he says he doesn't know why she send it.

237,"Hello Reddit. I'm twelve. I could go around and lie about it like I usually do and fabricate myself another fake internet persona, but I have the bravery to say it here, with a throwaway.     
    
I'm incredibly lonely irl and I have no friends because I'm always sad and anxious. Almost a year ago I started joining small Discord communities about my favourite bands. As time passed, I've made better friends than I've ever had in my life. We talk about everything and those people know my personality and feelings more than my fucking mom. More than anyone else. They know my face (I am often confounded with an adult because of my height and features), my native country and language, but not my real name and age. Thank god. 

    
They are anything but predators, and although everyone can't comprehend their internet friends being predators (ending up meeting them, getting raped and dropped in a ditch), I am 100% sure they are good people. I know their face, age, name, whatever, facebook accounts, email accounts, and the whole pile of information. Got this out of the way. I snap some of them daily and I mean to much to them and they mean so much to me.    
     
    
My biggest wish is to meet them. Anywhere. For a few minutes. And I crave becoming an adult and seeing them in real life, not behind a screen. I'm trying to keep the connection tight, some of them already met up at a Radiohead concert. I genuinely care about each of my internet friends and we always talk about how much we mean to eachother. I daydream about seeing them on a park bench when I'm walking around, so we'd hug and cry and be happier than ever.   
    
But it's just a fucking dream. I have to wait 6 more years because we live in different parts of the world, plus I lied about my age. And it eats me alive to know that we want to meet eachother but there are 6. more. damn. years. to wait. I am so deep in my dreams and hopes I can not imagine not meeting at least one of them all, ever.   
     
I can't comprehend forgetting about eachother, we're a family. Even if our relationship will get dustier with time if we stop talking so often, we have our email address, we work on music together (we made an entire album together, released 3 months ago on all streaming services) and we have webs on all social media platforms!

Took an emergency pill (Levonelle) on Thursday morning (around 16 hours later). What are my chances of getting pregnant?

I got a restraining order after he showed up at my workplace, sent me emails threatening very clearly to rape me and drove to my parents' home, my dad's company and to my workplace again the next day, just to sit outside in the car and see if he could find me. He refuses to acknowledge that I'm married and thinks he has a chance with me, somehow.

His family is aware, there are lawyers involved, but I don't see his family committing him to a mental institution any soon - I think they're afraid of him, he's been violent with them before. 

I've blocked him on every possible media, but he still keeps making fake accounts to try to get me to interact with him. If he ever tags me on anything or tries to contact me again I can call the police and get his ass busted in jail, but they'd only release him after a few days.

252,"What should I do with the rest of my life?

I'm tying to decide what to pursue  in grad school. I'm giving my, admittedly boring, life story because my advisor said it'd help when I do apply.  

I'm an older student(40), and I've been working on getting a degree for the past 10 years. Yes, it's been that long. I had kids when I was young, I've been a single dad for about 6 years, and they are now grown up.  So my life is a little more free now.  I've held the jobs a college-less, once upon a time high school dropout could get - I was a store manager at various fast food places and smaller retail locations for many many years now.  

I'm also in the national guard, and I just finished traditional OCS; I'm the oldest in my class. For the past year I've worked as a store manager in retail(45 hours a week), kept in physical condition for the OCS program(plus accompanying work), and taken 8 classes over the last two semesters. Last weekend was my first day off in 16 months. It's been long.

I want, more than anything, to help young men who are as I once was. Guys who can't yet see the light at the end of tunnel. Guys who have no hope. Kids with kids. People in abusive relationships. 

I don't know which direction to go in at this point. For years the goal was a phd in clinical psychology - but I'm thinking behavioral would be closer to what I'm wanting to do. But social work also fits the bill? I'm not sure. 

I do not have research experience(how could you get that when you have to dad it up and work full time too?). My grades are decent; over the last ten years my cumulative GPA is a 3.88. I have not taken the GREs yet; I'll have to take some study sessions to do well.  My advisor says that grad programs like older students and I have a good chance of getting into a phd program; she mentioned that the typical student trying to get into these programs is 22-24 with no life experience. Yet I see the posts around here and many of these people get turned down with better GPAs and solid research experience.

Sorry this is long but i'm constantly trying to Work hard to get top grades but every time my anxiety keeps bugging me that it's not worth it and i'm wasting my time. ",13Aug2018,2
256,"I've always known they were both racist, but not enough to say shit to someone's face. I'm white and my wife is black. We decided a wedding wasn't our thing and just had a small party, which they came to and were pleasant people.

Our baby is a month old and we're already getting rude comments from my brother and SIL. We got gems like, ""What color was he when he came out?"" and ""Does he have a huge schlong yet?"" They wanted to know why I wanted a baby who ""doesn't look like me."" He has the same nose and jaw structure, but whatever. Skin color is all that matters. Why does my brother want a child who doesn't look like him? She has a whole different chromosome and looks just like her mom!

The best way to deal with them is to ignore them, because arguing is pointless. They are dumber than a sack of potatoes about most issues and use circular arguments and ad hominem. But I don't want my son to grow up and experience racism just by visiting Uncle and cousins. Our mom doesn't say that shit, but she also doesn't care one bit.

259,"I recently got a job at a hospital as a tech and today I have a Urine Screen. I don’t know if they are going to specifically test for alcohol or not. They may do a breathylzer, but I’m not sure. 

Yesterday I was having fun with some friends and drank a bit of alcohol. Basically I had a shot of tequila that was very diluted around 15 hours ago, and a few sips of a Long Island Iced tea about 10 hours ago.

My test is later this afternoon (it’s currently 8:30AM). 
So, it will have been a bit over 16 hours since I had my last drink when I take the test. 

Am I going to be screwed? I have worked hard for this job. I was just having fun yesterday and didn’t think anything of it until it dawned upon me when I was sipping the Long Island Iced tea.

Any advice would be appreciated. I’m really concerned and beating myself up over this. 

Obviously I shouldn’t drink the day before a Urine Test, but my mistake. I didn’t think it would be an issue until it dawned on me that it could be.

262,"Hi, so I go to a two year community college and I'm currently going to start my second year, and I am struggling a bit with being lonely. This whole year has been isolating for me and I really don't like it one bit, but this seems to be pretty common for community colleges as per what I hear. I have joined clubs but the clubs don't offer any events, and when I try talking to people, it's never a friendship, just a nice acquaintance thing that is never anything more than that. This is because these people either already have a friend group, are focused on leaving as soon as possible, or have zero common interests with me. I've tried but I just can't get past that acquaintance stage because of these reasons. I fear that when I transfer it's just going to be lonely again, and I really don't want that to happen. Also I've chatted with a few people from high school and even though we talk we don't hang out. I hung out with one old friend and honestly I think she's great and she asked me if I wanted to hang, and we hung out and she said ""this was fun let's do something again"", and we haven't done anything since. I asked her like a week later if she wanted to hang again and she said she was busy and couldn't go out because her parents would be out of town and she'd have to watch the house, but she posted a lot on snapchat of her going out with her other friends. She may be my closest friend, but I know I'm not hers, and that feels pretty sucky, but she has every right to hang out with her other friends. I'm not going to blame her, it just feels bad sometimes to realize you're really not as important to someone, and I am always left wondering if I said or did something wrong. I also bumped into a few people from high school this past weekend and they said they'd text me to hang out, and I'm just wondering if they really will. It seems like everytime initiate a hang out and ask people if they would like to hang out, it never works out. Some of my friends have left me on read and never replied, and it leaves me feeling ridiculous. I don't know what to do about this, because they claim to miss me and everything, but their inactions show otherwise.  I'm not needy with them, if anything I've become shy with the people I used to be close with since we don't talk as much anymore, so it's not like I'm being overwhelming with them.

263,"I just turned 25. I cut off all contact with my dad late last year, after years of dealing with him hanging up phones on me, telling me all I cared about was whoppers and pizzas and that my lips were as black as my skin (making mention to my eczema) getting married and not telling me for two weeks, embarrassing me in front of his girlfriends and this is just some of the list I finally couldn’t take it anymore.

I cut off contact and ever since it’s been pissing me off that my dad has been given a right to abuse me with my family only saying ‘that’s still your father’ and ignoring everything I’m saying.

Since I cut off contact he has popped up at my job, just to tell me I wasn’t grown enough to want nothing to do with him, tried getting me in public places, took away the dog he abandoned at my uncles to try to get me to talk to him, all the while gaining sympathy because the shit is starting to piss me off.

People call me one of the nicest sweetest people they know, I don’t treat the rest of family like this, they act like I cut off contact for no reason but the constant disappointment, manipulation and pointing at my shortcomings were getting too much.

264,"So let me start from the beginning. When I was in kindergarten, I had a bully. Like most kids. The difference with this story is. My bully, became my step brother. My dad didn’t know it, but the woman he left my mom for, her kid would pick on my everyday at school. Now I don’t remember what happened to me at school with him, but I do remember that he started getting clever with his tactics after the move. I was the oldest of 3 kids, when he was the youngest of two. So when we all moved in together. He started bullying my brother and sister as well. He would put them down verbally, break their toys, or physically beat on them. Keep in mind, him and I are both 5 at the time. But that didn’t stop this kid from telling me that if I didn’t do what he said, that he would keep hurting my siblings. So me wanting to protect my siblings, I listened to him. And he meant it. If I didn’t do what he said. He would hurt my siblings. He would pull me into my closet and pull his pants down and tell me to do things to him. And the first time I told him no. Then he went and started beating up my brother. So of course I did what he said after that. Then one day his mom opened the closet to me on my knees and him standing there with his pants down. And she pulled him out and left me there and closed the door. Before this, she always verbally abused us(my siblings and I). She would also manipulate our little minds. She would do stuff to us (like put peed on underwear on my sister head) and then tell us someone else did it(she said my grandma did that to my sister, even though I clearly watched her). And because I knew she could do this, i couldn’t trust my own thoughts. After she found us in the closet, I was told it was my fault. That I instigated it. Things didn’t stop there with the step brother either. He knew his mom would protect him and do anything for him. So he continued. And still beat up my siblings if I did what he wanted. It took me 15 years after that to know that it wasn’t my fault. But now that I’ve been battling these flashbacks for years. I don’t know what to do. I have so many questions. Why did he bully me? Why did he do those things to me just to go against his word? Why did his mom let me think it was my fault? Does my dad know? And if so, why hasn’t he done anything about it? So on and so forth. 

I guess what I need advice on is: Do I go to my dad? It’s been 21 years. Do I tell him? Do I ask if he knows? I know I need to go back to do talk therapy. But I can’t find a good doctor either. I’m working on finding one still. But for now, I’m turning to the people. Seeing if anyone else has a similar story. And if so, how do you cope? Does your family know? What helps you the most when your brain slips and can’t be strong anymore? Please I would like to know. At the moment I just smoke weed to subside the flashbacks and keep moving forward. I’m hoping that’s not a permanent fixed.  But if so, it’s better than alcohol I suppose. But please. Don’t be shy. I would love to hear your stories and what you do to help yourself.

269,"I’ve been thinking about this too much lately. i don’t trust my gf too much really (I do trust her more than I’ve trusted my other ex’s). I don’t know why I can’t trust.

I analyze every little detail in the relationship, and don’t forget easily. I’m always snooping in her phone, like I’m trying to find something (or I’m hoping I do).

I went through her search history and saw that she searched “have a crush on my boyfriends best friend”. I confronted her about it and she just said she was looking it up for her friend the night before. I don’t believe her at all, only because i saw her looking it up in the morning (and a few other signs).

I just can’t trust. I can’t just let go and trust someone completely. It saddens me that I can’t just be happy and not feel like there’s some sinister motive behind their actions. That there’s she’s always doing something wrong and behind my back that’ll only take me by surprise and hurt me later.

It may have to do with the fact I’ve been a completely different person since high school after someone lit themselves on fire right behind me. It took me two years to realize I wasn’t a coward for just standing there and doing nothing about it. It’s been almost 4 years since that incident, and I don’t think I’ve still gotten over it. 

Before the incident I had no problem trusting anyone. I was happier, more motivated, and just more optimistic about everything in my life. 

Now I can’t seem to trust anyone fully, nor can I seem to feel the same way I did. I’m more pessimistic about people and life in general. I procrastinate more and can’t seem to do things even when I want to do them so, so badly. I can’t ever seem to relax, I’m constantly stressed about everything around me, always hyper vigilant. It’s rare to be calm, if ever. 

Maybe I’m just blaming that event for everything wrong in my life, or maybe it really did change who I am, and still affects me today. I don’t really know. I just want to trust again, and I want to relax again. I want to be who I was before. I want all the color in my life back, I don’t know how to get it though.

When do I know I’ve healed? How do I know what the root of my problems are...

We are going to be driving for about 6 hours to get to this cottage, so the plan is to stop somewhere along the way to eat. We do this almost every year and it wasn't until I started working in customer service that I realized how annoying it must be for the waitstaff to have a giant group of people show up without a reservation or any sort of warning. Our group is notoriously late to everything because something always goes wrong before we leave, which means making a reservation would be difficult considering we would probably be two hours late to it anyway. 

My family is also horribly indecisive so it will probably take 20 minutes before we even order our food. Our family is also kind of cheap, always getting only water to drink, never getting desserts, and often sharing meals to cut down on costs. 

And when it is time to pay, it's a nightmare. There are usually 4-5 splits in the bill, everyone's talking over each-other about how they are going to pay, and my family isn't overly generous on the tip for being a group of that size, usually giving 15%.

273,"I’ve been living alone since I was 18 and never really had a problem with it, in fact enjoyed it. I grew up in a small village that was very quiet and calm but then moved into a very big city at 20 for my first real job. I loved that job and it was pretty exciting to experience city life, nightlife etc but my flat was still in a calmer area so I was pretty happy. I definitely felt ‚at home‘ in the city and in my flat.

Well at 23 I started another job and also moved to a different flat in a different part of town for it. At first it seemed fine but after a few months I started seriously disliking the new flat, mainly because of the area it’s in (which is a bit trashy and IMO ugly) and because it wasn’t as quiet and calm as my old one. I also hated the new job at first but it got better to the point where now I can say there is nothing objectively wrong with it - but I’m not ‚feeling‘ it, I don’t identify with the company or the job at all unlike the previous job. This has lead to the problem that I don’t feel like I have a ‚home‘, I feel no connection to my flat or my job. I have a few friends but overall I feel like I have no roots in this place anymore and I just don’t feel comfortable. That has also made me increasingly ‚homesick‘. I was just on vacation with my mom and now that I’m back I feel pretty depressed and just homesick. Like I feel so lonely and lost in this city and wanna move back closer to my family. City life has become increasingly annoying and made me realize I’m not built for it long term, I love silence and nature and don’t deal well with having so many people around me all the time. 

Sooo it seems clear that something has to change but I find it very hard to decide what that should be exactly. I’m currently looking for flats in more rural areas but I’m not even sure if I want to stay close to this city or move somewhere else entirely. Hell I’ve even been thinking about studying again or finding another line of work. I feel paralyzed because I cannot make up my mind on what I want so I cannot really commit to anything. Basically I just spend my time being sad and irritable as fuck. I can still manage everyday life and ‚function‘ fine but I’m so tired of being grumpy and uncomfortable all the time.

When I walked in to the front office I immediately had to prove my age because you have to be at least 18 to volunteer with children at this school.

284,"Tl;dr: I want to switch from marketing to programming via a 3 month coding bootcamp starting January. How do I bring this up at work?

I’ve been working in marketing for about 4 years. I’ve been with my current company since May 2017.

I’ve been getting fed up with the entire field of marketing and I feel like it’s just not for me in the end. I’m pretty introverted at the end of the day and I feel like this requires being very social all of the time and I’m constantly super stressed about work.

I’ve been thinking things over and have decided that I want to go for programming. I’ve dabbled with some coding as a teenager and some weekend course type of things more recently, but that’s obviously not enough for a full on career. I stumbled upon coding bootcamps and after lots of research and speaking to a friend who has gone through one, I’m 98% sure that’s what I want to do.

In terms of finances and apartment lease etc, I think January is the earliest I could start at a bootcamp. I go back to work from a three week vacation later this week, and I feel like I should bring this up at work sooner rather than later. My plan A would be to ask for a study leave from my current company, because I love the company, just not my job. It’s a tech start-up btw, so in the right field, although I doubt they would take me on as a programmer after a bootcamp tbh (although who knows lol). Plan B would be to quit come January and go to a bootcamp and work my mf butt off to get a job in programming while being unemployed.

I was planning on talking to our HR manager sort of ”informally” over lunch about how I’m not really satisfied in my current role and am looking to learn coding and get a job in that field and see what my options are. It’s a small company, and in fact, our HR manager used to be in my role in marketing until last year. He also happens to know the girl I talked to who went to a coding bootcamp and it turns out he’s the one who recommended she go to one, so he would hopefully understand where I’m coming from.

I guess in all simplicity, my question is how I should approach this at work?",13Aug2018,1

She was and still is in love with him and seemed to be quite upset over the break up still, so I tried being a good friend and talked to her about her feelings, gave her an update about her ex (because she asked) and offered her some advice. 
Such as, maybe she shouldn't see him in person whilst she was still hung up on him because she would try to go back to him and the whole thing would get 10x messier from their and it wouldn't be good for anyone. I also told her not to give him a second chance if he came back to her because they both clearly wanted different things from the relationship. 

I left it at that and didn't give it a second thought until today, when I got back to my place after being at home for a few weeks I was confronted by housemate about the things that I said to his ex and he was pissed (to say the least). After what I had told her to try and help her she turned around to him and told him everything that I said and claimed that I was bashing him. She told him that I thought he liked a mutual friend and that he was trying to sleep with that mutual friend's friend (which I didn't say, I just told her that he thought this girl was hot) and all this other stuff that was taken out of context or just not true. 
Rightfully, he was mad at me as anyone would be if someone you trusted talked about you behind your back but he's got information that is taken completely out of context (and in some cases untrue) and said to someone that was hurting and needed a friend.

I feel betrayed and hurt by this girl that I considered a friend, if I had known that she was going to turn around her to ex and tell her all of these things I would of obviously chosen my words a lot more wisely. I don't regret what I said or regret being a friend to this girl, I just regret hurting my friend.

Automatically I knew this was going to be an uphill battle but the pay was good. I built out the store, took some product photos, adjusted the site for optimum mobile usability, and synced our brick and mortar inventory with our online store.  

We've made some sales but not enough to break even on salary or the cost to run the site. We have ads in magazines and online that other people run. Nothing really related to eCommerce. 

I'm pretty sure that once my one year comes around, I'm going to lose my job. 

My question or reason for asking for advice is, do I have a viable skill to sell to a future employer even though this whole endeavor has yielded minimal sales? How do I spin that?

I enjoy working on the site and all that comes with it I'm just not a sales/marketing person. 

I'm really nervous because the cost of living where I live is high as it is. I also work a part time job on top of this full time job to help things along money wise. It would be tough to find a similar paying job. 

Thanks in advanced!",13Aug2018,3
295,I’m a college student who is behind on college credits so I felt pressured to take online course in order to catch up. I took two online course and I screwed myself by not doing the work on time. I begged the teachers to help me but the declined since they felt it was not fair to  he other students who met the deadlines and I understand this. Now I have to face my parents with two Fs and I don’t know how to talk to them about it.  Usually I am a good student and I get my work done in time but I just sabotaged mused this summer by not even trying. Any advice on how to bring this up and have a conversation with them and not have it be a one sided attack in how stupid I was by actually g this way. ,13Aug2018,2

297,"They saw the house, provided him with every contact for the home and have been there to figure out all other aspects of the house (which is extremely nice of them), but I've been on the outside of nearly the entire process since the beginning. This is because he says he wants to take care of everything, but now it doesn't feel like we're taking this huge step together - rather he and his parents are taking it instead. Now that we are finally approaching closing and have the opportunity for the two of us to take this final step, his parents want to be right there with us. Is it normal for the parents to be so involved, or is it understandable for me to wish they would take a few steps back?",13Aug2018,1
298,"My eldest dog is going senile, it’s been known for a few months now. Her behaviour is changing gradually and sadly we lost one of our youngest dogs because of her behaviour. She has no clue what she has done and she occasionally still waits by the front door as if he will just trot in at any moment. 

Earlier today I got down on my knees to fuss over her and another family dog only imagine my surprise when she suddenly grabbed my chin with her jaw a few times and tugged my face, something which she has never done before, she’s also grabbed a hold of my sleeve just about missing my arm a few times as I stood back up. 

Now here is where the problem comes in, lately any concerns or events that have had happened my parent brushed off and says it’s “just the voices telling me that happened”. They wouldn’t have said that last year when they didnt know of my mental health situation. My dog has left no marks, not even a bruise despite how hard she grabbed me, and there aren’t any holes in my hoodie either. 

My parent has done things like this before where things have been brushed off and forgotten or they’ve been reminded later on when the situation is a little more critical. I’m scared it will reach that point again with my dog (even though it already has with my youngest dog, she’s a gentle giant to most but it was figured that she may have forgotten her strength by accident when she was playing with him) 

If my parent does brush it off as the voices again, how do I convince them that my dog’s behaviour is changing quicker than what the vet suggested originally? I don’t want her final moments of life to be hurting anyone or anything again. ",13Aug2018,1
299,"I'm 20F, I'm currently working on my campus so all my coworkers are within a couple years of my age. They're all this big group of friends and whenever we talk about it they insist that I'm in the group too and they say they love me and want to hang out. This past semester, I went through some shit with another person in the group (let's call her Sherry) and she basically tried to isolate me from the group and was successful at it. It kind of wrecked my friendships with all of them, but towards the end we all talked about it and they all apologized for believing all the bad things about me and kind of abandoning me as a friend. 

So before the summer started we all hung out a few times and it was great, they were nice and fun and inclusive and there were no problems. Then a few days ago, I hung out with a few of them and it was super fun, they were really nice and it was just a great time. But this morning, I found out that they all hung out last night, literally the entire group, and no one invited me. And I have no idea why! 

I want to believe that they honestly just forgot, because their gatherings are pretty much never planned, they just kinda happen and whoever's there is there, and if that were the case then I want to message one of them and be like ""oh hey remember me?"" just so that it doesn't happen again. But if they didn't invite me on purpose then I don't want to look like an idiot and continue trying to be friends with these people!

Also, normally if this were to happen with a group of people, I would just ditch them because I don't have time for drama and pettiness, and even if it was just an honest mistake I don't want to hang out with people who forget about me. But I work with them and have to see them every day, so it's hard to just forget about them. Plus if I isolated myself, I'm afraid that it will cause behavior in them that will affect work. They promised that they would stop isolating me because of Sherry but she was there last night...and I wasn't. Please help. what do I do ",13Aug2018,6
301,"     I own a 2014 Toyota Camry SE. Other than Oil Changes, and washer fluid I haven’t had any work done to it. Everything is as I bought it in 2015. 

     I know this is not a good thing. I want to get my car ready for a New England winter and there’s no time like the present to do that. Unfortunately, I know next to nothing about cars and I’m worried if I take it to a shop and say, “What needs to be done?” I’m gonna get ripped off. 

What items should I get replaced? What should I have checked? I want to make an itemized list that I can spend the next couple months going down to make my car essentially ready to sell.

302,"I'm currently in a relationship that, to this day, lasts about years.  I'm a nearly 25 y/o male, my GF a nearly 25 y/o female. We are currently living together, have adopted three cats and are living a good, financially stable live.

She is a great girl and I love her, but there lies the problem: She is a girl, not a woman. When I grew up, she seemed to be stuck in a premature/teenage state of mind.

She started education to be a kindergartner with 19 and achieved her graduation around a year ago. It has been a constant fight to keep her motivated because she is overthinking \*everything\* to a point where she is just a sobbing mess. She belittles herself on every occasion and has absolutely no self-esteem to talk of. 

Additionally, she is very reluctant to make business calls and she needs me to proof-read her business emails in case someone could find a hidden meaning and get offended. 

We've bought a kitchen and quite a bit of furniture for our appartment and have build \~5k on debts together, which is why I want to save money on unneccessary things. A few days ago she wanted to buy a 3x4 Meter pool for our 3x5 meter garden because it was hot in europe. Another example is a 400 € battery vacuum cleaner (Dyson V6) which she ""needed"" because it was cordless and had an animal-hair module.

Needless to say: She threw a tantrum when I told her that I don't want to spend money on such expensive and/or redundant things.

I'm at a point where I have to decide where to go with my life, and even though I love her, I can absolutely not imagine her being a responsible and grown-up wife, let alone having kids with her. Currently my part in housekeeping and bureaucracy is endurable, but I fear that I cannot count on her to make responsible decisions on her own. 

It's tearing me apart to love her and still know that I might have to let her go at some point. I know her pretty well and I don't think that she can grow up to be a functional adult anytime soon.

I'm not sure what form of advise I expect from Reddit, but somehow it felt right to let out my thoughts on a (somewhat) neutral ground. Is my process of thought flawed? Am I over-reacting? I'm pretty confused in the last weeks.",13Aug2018,0

304,"I'll try to make this long story as short as possible. My mother was in the hospital for a few months last year after complications from cancer surgery. While in there, she told us she had wanted to adopt a stray black cat that had been wandering into her yard, so we brought it into her house for her, took it to the vet, got it shots and everything. When she finally got home from the hospital weeks later, she wasn't able to take care of it and didn't bond to it well. Without saying it outright, she wanted us (my fiancee and myself) to take the cat back with us. So we did. Now we have three cats in our small house (a little crowded but we manage.)

Fast forward to my mother being well enough to walk around and take care of herself again. She was talking about wanting to adopt an *adult* dog from a shelter after her last dog passed away a few years ago at 16. Her brother, who buys expensive purebred puppies for his daughters all the time and they either run away or get put down, bought her a puppy and sprung it on her one day. She was excited to have a puppy (and it was only a month or two old) but she quickly realized she wasn't really able to take care of it.

That was about three months ago. Now the puppy is growing and still isn't even potty trained. She's constantly cleaning up after him because she is either physically unable or unwilling (more of the second one) to stand outside and actually potty train him like he needs. She's asked me to take the puppy several times and I flat-out told her no, because we already have too many pets and recently had to put our dog down from cancer last year.

Today she called and told me that the puppy is sick. He's had diarrhea issues a few times since she's had him but he's apparently had diarrhea and vomiting for about three days now. Hasn't eaten in the past two days. She called to ask for my help applying for Care Credit but she was denied. I gave her the number of another vet that might be willing to do a payment plan and I'm waiting to hear back from her. But she keeps complaining about how exhausted she is and how she can't take care of the puppy, and I tell her calmly, ""Why don't you give him up for adoption?"" She's not willing to do it because she wants him to be ""in the family"" still so she can go visit him. I haven't exploded at her once but I'm about to. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS PUPPY IN THE FIRST PLACE IF YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF HIM. I know emergencies happen to people, and I know she didn't seek out this puppy and it was dropped into her life by a person who thinks animals are like pieces of furniture to rearrange when you feel like it. But she had PLENTY OF TIME to make the right decision with this dog and I'm at my wit's end here. I don't believe she's a bad person but she can be extremely selfish and short-sighted sometimes and this is breaking my heart. I don't have money to give her to take him to the vet or I would. I don't want to take money from anyone else either.

Basically, if she took him to a shelter and surrendered him, would they give him vet care and let him be adopted by someone else? Or depending on the shelter would they just euthanize him? He's just a puppy who's barely had a life and I'm devastated right now thinking that because my mother can't just do the right thing when it comes to this dog, and because most vets are so money-grubbing and refuse to work with payment plans, this dog has to suffer and die.",13Aug2018,1

Anyway. I was living in Poland for half year like 3months ago. With my girlfriend with which I was fully in love. But butterflies flew away,life happened and we break up. I came to London (I am Lithuanian) fully hopeful,motivated, acknowleding what happened to me and ain't afraid of changes and moving on. 

Had some trobles with NIN,got a job still,found some new buddies,met some old ones too. Found a place to live real nice,quite cheap compared to the market. Just needed the money to work things out. It is warehouse job but I didn't mind. Quite flexible,if you want to you can work a lot,if not - not,choose day offs,no one pisses you off (worked in restaurants for little more than a year) not amazing job but its OK. 

Applied for accountancy AAT level 2 courses online. Nearly two months now gonna last for about a year. (Cost more than 1k£ don know if it was wise but let's just do it)

Now why I write this.

Recently got bored.  With the job. With London. With everything. Started procrastinating and avoiding the studies. Start skiping days at work. Start using drugs. (Hard ones too) Got pissed at all my friends.

Right know I am in home.  Got sent from work because I was late 15mins (WTF?),just did some speed (I am tired of it now just want to finish and I am done with it) had some ideas that I will start to find a new job or go crazy with the studies or go to tinder or some apps and try somethin knew but I don't know. 
It's like something in my brain shifted and I don't have an explanation. I was smiling and not giving a fuck bout anything and just doin my thing. Now a weird guy siting next to me in a bus stop can ruin my day. Get soo angry on things I shouldn't.

It's like I've become full of principles and I got to get rid of them.. Maybe I just became lonely and that affects me now? 

I hope this post makes sense and if you guys have anything to share or advice me,please do so! :) (y) 

Cheers!

308,"I have a friend that I have known for about 10 years that I am unsure actually wants my friendship anymore.

Background: we met at a horrible job and stayed friends even after we moved on. We are both awkward and quirky girls and bonded over our strangeness. Fast forward a bit, I get married and so does she, I was even the maid of honor at her wedding. She ends up working with my husband in an office with only one other person. She seemed happy at first, we hung out quite a lot as couples. It was a little odd I knew because I'm sure she felt like she couldn't gripe about work anymore and I'm sure my husband isn't always easy to work with.

For what seems like a couple of years now she either rarely responds to my texts or does so weeks later. She has been through a lot this year losing a close family member in a terrible way. I've tried to be there for her any way that I can and I don't want to give up especially  because she's just been through this. 

I know things are not great for her work wise and I'm sure she's probably looking for another job. I don't suspect anything salacious at all. I'm not sure if I have done something to upset her and I have a hard time believing it could only be the work situation if that's even the issue.

I still send her messages, even if it's a song or a stupid meme. I often hear nothing back and it just hurts my feelings. Again I give her the benefit of the doubt because what she has been through but it feels personal at this point.",13Aug2018,2

310,"Hi, so basically i met this guy in a japanese language course at university during the last semester. We became friends and talked a lot. Now during lecture free time our grades got uploaded. He got a 2,0 (=80%) while i got a 3,0 (=65%). When i told him about my grade he told me to ask my teacher how my marks for homework and written exams were and I found out that I had 75% (=2,3). Further i realized that she didn't grade all of my homework and now my final grade got upgraded to a 2,0 (=80%).
I told him that the teacher made a mistake and about my new grade. His response was ""you nerd :D you can't even read all of it. thats kinda unfair""
What he means is, during this course we were supposed to learn the japanese letters and some vocabulary. Since i watched a lot of anime I already knew like 90% of the vocabulary we learned in this course (i never told him that im into anime and that i already knew most of the vocabulary). He knew that I had no problem learning the vocabulary, but i only barely managed to learn hiragana and basically learned no katakana. Since we sat next to each other during lessons he knew that i was far behind in learning the japanese letters. He probably thinks its ""unfair"" because he put in many hours of effort while I just sat around doing the bare minimum. I also handed in a bunch of homework at the last course day since I forgot to finish them, but the teacher said its alright.
I don't know how to react to his message. During the course we always shared the opinion that we couldn't care less about our grades since those won't be on the certificate you get after finishing 2 courses.

TL;DR:
made a new friend in language course at university. got the same grade as him with almost no effort and partly no knowledge of learned content we were supposed to know for exams. first he encouraged me to ask how i got my grade, turns out teacher made a mistake. got a better grade and he tells me its ""unfair"".

313,"Sry for the long post. Can’t stop thinking about him...

His “ex” girlfriend posted pictures of them together on FB, captioning it “a night out with my love and it’s my birthday”. 

He told me that night he was with family celebrating his younger sister moving to NY for a job promotion. 

He had told me when we first started talking he was working on things again with her, but that they had broken up 7/8 months ago, lived an hour and 45mins from each other and wanted to give it another shot but realized it wasn’t what he wanted anymore and wasn’t about to go down that road again. 

He told me I changed things. He told me he saw long term with me and started falling for me. He couldn’t get over how fast he was falling and how much he liked me already. We talked about going to Florida together next week. He wanted to come and be my date for a wedding I’m attending.  We basically couldn’t get enough of each other. We both were on the same page and wanted the same things and said the same things. 

We had plans to finally meet, after only 7 days of 24/7 non stop talk, sharing pictures of our day, selfies, staying up while each other worked night shift .....

I saw the post and sent it to him, I told him I wasn’t mad just confused. He told me “I’ve been upfront with you from the beginning”. He asked me if I wanted space and I told him no. I didn’t want to lose him. 

He said he needed space, he was confused and deleted his IG and line app (how we were texting and calling). I found his snap since it’s the same name as his IG but I haven’t messaged him on it since we were never friends there.

It’s been 3 days. 

I guess my question is this .... 

Was he ever single? I did see that there was a break in her posting pictures of them during the month of June to end of July. 

If he was worried about his “girlfriend” finding out about us, why would he make all these plans with me? Why would he be on bumble? He had gone on a previous date before meeting me. He wanted me to have his actual phone number so that would mean I could call/text his phone at any time....

He asked me to come meet him for coffee many times but I couldn’t bc of my work schedule, asked me to go boating with him and his friend next week and bring my friend with me, we were suppose to this upcoming Thursday.

Was his plan to meet me and see if it would go anywhere and then eventually pick between us? (I mean she does live soooo far away)

I’m just confused, hurt, sad and can’t seem to let go. I know I deserve better but I guess I’m stuck in this fantasy phase of what ifs. Wondering if he thought I’d tell her and that’s why he just left like this. Gave up so easily when he said he was falling so fast. 

Any advice would be helpful, please be kind I know this was a very short lived relationship and we both fell hard way too fast but it happened and it was real to me.

316,"My son and his best friend are both 14. His friend has spent the night about 75% of all nights this summer... He's like a member of the family.

For a couple years, he's been insisting that he doesn't need permission to stay over or do anything with us. When I'd call his dad, he'd say his son is grown up and responsible, and it seemed weird.

12 is old enough to stay overnight alone in our state legally, but it sounds like his dad just goes trucking and leaves him alone. He has food and knows how to go to the grocery store.

He cleans the apartment before his dad gets home, but unless he gets told, he doesn't shower, change his clothes, or take care of his hygiene at home. He used to also want to go around with no clothing on when he was younger, but stopped doing that at our house when he realized nobody else did that or wanted to see it. He brushes and showers every night when he's here now at least.

He's in advanced algebra and science, so he's not a stupid kid, but he fails English and other classes in 8th grade because he doesn't write his papers or do the busy work. He was supposed to go to summer school and forgot until the marching band director reminded him before the 4th of July parade. I don't know what happens academically if you don't pass middle school, but he seems to think he's going to 9th grade anyway in a week. I got him to be just a little more responsible and practice his Trumpet with my son when the marching band assigned it.

I don't know what happens if you call CPS and report this. It's technically legal if he has food and knows how to stay safe, but it's not responsible of his dad. He's growing up with little guidance. If I step in and ask to be his guardian, I'm worried his dad will say I should just parent his kid for him 24/7 forever. Having him stay in the summer is much different than being responsible for him on school nights for example, and he doesn't have a bed or anything here.",13Aug2018,1

But after then I’m so lost. 

I originally wanted to get a masters and then a PhD but I haven’t started looking at any fields to study in, and I’ve probably deadlocked myself into either continuing to go to school and pray I can be an adjunct scraping by or teaching high school somewhere.

318,"Hello /r/Advice this is my first post here.

Quick background: I was the mistake child. Mom and dad had me when they were 19. By then their parents all had left the state. Dad had to drop out of college to work construction at minimum wage, and my brother was born 2 years after with a learning disability that has gone unaddressed for his entire life. Fortunately he was able to graduate under 'No Child Left Behind' and now puts in 40 hours a week at his job of 5 years and has a better social life than I probably ever will :)

My parents divorced when I was 10 and have since been dealing with depression, my father was unintentionally abusive (psychologically/verbally) to my brother and I and has since apologized for it upon realizing that his father did the same to him. Anxiety, depression, ADD, and bad decision-making skills run deep in the family tree.

About 2 years ago my dad's 2nd wife walked out on him and left him with a hefty mortgage for which he had to file bankruptcy. I moved in with him to help ease the transition from one large house to a tiny ass duplex. We've been living here for a little over a year now, and my sanity is deteriorating. 

Being in the same house with him makes me feel like I'm walking on eggshells constantly. I child is to be seen and not heard right? I feel like I'm always about to be scolded even though I know full well that I saved his ass from having to move in with his own parents one state up, and I know he would never speak to me like that again unless he was distressed or anxious about something. I still have so much pent up resentment that I can't open my mouth around him without being an asshole. Lots of cognitive dissonance regarding pa.

Anyway since we moved in here it's been bad decision after bad decision on both of our parts and it's taking its toll on our mental and physical health. 

Dad has a new girlfriend with so much baggage you'd need a 2nd plane, and he literally drove his truck to failure trying to take care of her, so now I have to give him rides to and from work every day. I've had to listen to them fuck at 3 am several times and have lost lots of hours of sleep over it. 

Dad breaks his back trying to moonlight as a cement mason sometimes (his trade of over 20 years) and usually needs my help instead of just picking up overtime at his current job which would make the same amount if not more than what he's charging for labor.

Dad lent all of our rent money to his girlfriend so she could move into a new place after getting evicted. I don't plan on seeing that back. We've been living on coffee and pizza pretty much for the last year. I've walked out on my last 4 jobs, and when I was working it was harder than hell to even get out of bed because of my anxiety.

Now I know what I need to do to get my health in order and get my debt situated and all that, but my dad doesn't. He and his ex-wife were both horrible at money management and made several poor decisions including taking a mortgage out on a house they could never afford to pay off in their lifetime. 

Instead of quitting weed he would rather just say he's addicted and not eat food. Instead of making a lifestyle change he just accepts that he'll be miserable for the rest of his life. Now I know I need to get the hell out of here for my own mental health, but I feel like if I leave my Dad he may attempt suicide again, or end up homeless despite him saying he would never attempt suicide again. I've been suicidal as long as I can remember and I know the thoughts don't go away forever.

Anyway currently I've been pot-free for 3 days after smoking daily for 3 years or so. I'm working on cutting out caffeine and I'm trying to live a less sedentary life, but I feel like I'm being held back by my dad. I'm on the job hunt again and I still have mental health issues that have gone unaddressed for almost 2 decades at this point.

I'm ready to turn my life around, get healthy, and be happy finally, but I need advice on how to get out of this shitty situation with my father and deal with my mental bullshit so that I can truly be happy. 


Thank you for reading my short novel of a post. Even if nobody responds it helped just thinking through all my troubles and typing them out, deleting them, retyping, deleting them again, and redoing the whole post twice. Please if you want to know any more about my situation I'll gladly go into more detail in a DM if you think you can offer advice, or if you want to talk about shit I'm open ears and fast fingers.",13Aug2018,3
319,"This is a pretty simple post, I would just like to have some advice and opinions.

I live in the Southern US and it’s averaging 80-90 daily. The only problem is, when I am at school, I have the constant dilemma of wearing either light clothes for the hot weather or warm clothes for the freezing temperatures inside.

It’s ice cold in every classroom, I end up having to hug myself every now and then and try to generate heat. I get goosebumps and shiver constantly.

Here’s the real problem: during lunchtime, me and my friends walk around the football field for up to 30 minutes, and after school, I have to wait outside for 20 minutes for my ride. 

What should I wear? I have shorts, t-shirts, hoodies, sweatpants, everything. ",13Aug2018,1
320,"I’m posting here because I don’t know any better place, if there is one, please let me know!

Just to give context, my Mom and Dad have been married for a couple decades. I’m 18 and my sister is 21. Over at least the past 10-12 years of my life I’ve realized that my father is an extreme, controlling narcissist.

1. He is obsessed with money.

It dictates almost every action of his, obsessively looks over credit card bills, and has kept control over the rest of my family’s money. My mom, even though she has a well paying job must consult my father on every purchase she makes, while he is free to spend however much he likes. Simply, he puts money above his family’s happiness.

2. He has extreme anger issues

Whenever anything remotely goes wrong, my father’s first reaction is to scream “god fucking dammit” and hit a desk or wall. He does this for any remotely minor inconveniences. He once dropped his food on the ground and ran upstairs screaming and hitting things. He hit me once as a child, but never again.

3. He believes he is perfect

He didn’t have a great family growing up, so in his mind, he has crafted the perfect family out of my Mom, my sister and I. We all have to play the role of the nuclear family and thank him for everything he does, or we are “ungrateful.” He was asked if he had any regrets about raising my sister, and he said he had a “clear conscience” despite my sister having a bad eating disorder and anxiety issues. On top of that, he has done little to nothing in raising my sister and I despite his belief that he has done most of the work. He cannot take jokes about himself, or criticism, or he’ll get angry and won’t listen to you. 

I’m asking this because I’m leaving for college in a couple days and my mom has told me on numerous occasions that she’s jealous that I can “get away” insinuating that she is stuck with my father. My sister told me once that she tried to convince my mom to divorce my father after something bad happened, but she was too scared to do so, probably due to my father not listening 
to her or possibly turning violent. Keep in mind that there are still things I don’t know about my mom and my dad that my sister hasn’t told me.

My mom is one of the best people I know, and I think I owe it to her to be happy, which she certainly isn’t with my father. Any advice on talking to my mom about this or how to best deal with my father if she decides to ask for a divorce I would appreciate a lot.",13Aug2018,1
322,"I did well in High-School. Got into a pretty decent school (no scholarship) and decided to do pre-med. I come from a family of Physicians. It's a field I do believe I like. 

But my grades started slipping. I got so caught up in making friends that my grades slipped. I was academically suspended. Not once. But twice. 

I felt like I was trying hard, but I guess I was not. My grades are ass. I have never seen my parents so disappointed in me before.  They are very close to giving up on me. 

I am just so fucking stupid. I did the same bullshit as before. I don't want to be a disappointment. 

It just feels like laziness overcomes me. I try to get motivated, and I do. For a 2 week stretch and then laziness hits. I just want to give up. 

I don't know what to do.

I wanted to keep the conversation going for more days until we get to know each other more and jump into a relationship but she doesn't really text first,doesn't send me photos or posts or anything to start a conversation, but I did, I tried 2 and her response was a little late but the reply was really really good, she seemed like she was really happy that I text her.

326,"I don’t live too far from my job. It’s about 16 miles and without traffic, it takes half an hour if I take the highway. However, living in South Miami to get to pretty much downtown is about an hour and half of travel, possibly more since school is starting next week for the kids. 

I don’t take the highway because it’s about $10 one way just because of tolls. I will be essentially spending $400 a month for tolls. To avoid that expense, I usually take the local US1 which takes even longer. I basically am tired of traveling and have explained to my boss if there was some way they can compensate for the tolls at least, but it seems that suggestion went through their other ear. I’m getting paid $18/hr which isn’t bad but still. 

I have a coworker here who lives 35 miles away from work but it’s a drive. So he only comes in twice a week. I want to be able to just tell them I’m moving as far as my coworker. As far as my address, I’m not sure if changing it to a random house is a smart move. Is there a way to go about this? They don’t send anything to my current address at all, only shows up when I receive our pay stubs and that’s it",13Aug2018,1
329,"I am the bride-to-be and I want to do our wedding a little different than the usual and have the wedding ceremony on one day with intermediate family and the ""reception"" the next day for extended family and friends. The ""reception"" will be more like a family reunion type setting with a self serve taco bar, outdoor games, swimming, etc. I plan to do two different invitations for the events; one formal for the ceremony, and one informal and fun for the party.

We want our wedding ceremony to just be the people that we grew up with and feel most comfortable with since it will be such an emotionally vulnerable moment for us. The groom-to-be has agreed that he also feels most comfortable with this decision.

My mother-in-law has been a little resistant to the idea but has been very kind about her opinions. She believes that the extended family would not fly out if they will not be attending the ceremony. She says it is because of family traditions that they would have their feelings hurt by not being invited to the ceremony. I don't want to start off this marriage by offending anyone, especially his side, but I also know that I can't please myself and everyone else at the same time.

My fiance and I are both very stubborn people and hold onto decisions closely without wavering but i wanted to know if others have advice on this decision or how to approach it. so far, my side of the family is fine with the idea and I have explained as best as I can why I am choosing this alternative approach.

330,"My mom is a good mom most of the time. She takes care of my siblings and I. She didn’t disregard my depression as a made up thing and helped me go to all my appointments. She didn’t mention how my grades had been dropping and she was totally fine with me saying no to her life long dream of her children becoming doctors. Despite the culture she comes from she has let me go to parties. I even get drunk once at home because she didn’t want me to do that in a dangerous setting. When I went travelling with my church she sent me some very love filled texts and in all that she does I can feel her love.  She’s helped me with my confidence. I can talk to her about almost anything. 

But sometimes she has done things that still haunt me. 
That one time when I was around 9 and she told me something my dad had done to my half sister, his step daughter, which then ruined the trust I had for him forever even though I now doubt he ever did that and my sister who isn’t mentally capable just lied. Either way I was way too young to hear about that stuff 

That one time I was 12 years old and I came home late without telling her I was going to, she screamed at me,  slapped my face and called me a whore. 

That other time I was 15 and I didn’t pick up on my phone because I was busy and when I came home she seriously asked me if I had had an abortion even though I spend like 90% of my time at home. 

And recently she called me mid sleepover screaming in my ear that she wants me to come home because she never allowed the sleep over, despite that we had talked about it and my presence at wasn’t needed, and if I didn’t come home immediately then I shouldn’t come back at all. That sleepover was important because it was supposed to be part 1 of a birthday surprise, which she knew, so the plan almost got ruined. Next day I had to finish another version of part 2 and she called me again screaming that I had been out for way too long, even though I had been out for longer than that previously, and I had to come home immediately. I tried to reason with her but she kept screaming over me saying that she didn’t want to listen to me. She suspects me for everything even though she knows I’m just having fun at a friends house. She said I was way too nice to my best friends and they eventually they’ll leave me, even though they’ve done the same stuff for me. She can be so irrational highly reactive and unforgiving it drives me mad and incredibly sad. 


That’s not everything she has done, just highlights. So now I’m wondering, am I overreacting and should I just keep going until I eventually move out? If I’m not overreacting I could never report her because she still has done everything for me. I can’t turn to any of my best friends because I don’t want them to see her negatively or see me struggling at my home situation. After every fight I’ve just copped by suppressing my feelings and pretend everything was fine but I can’t do that anymore.  What should I do? 

TL;DR: My mom is like any supportive and kind mom but she’s done things that still haunt and effect me. Recently she’s taken it a step further and threatened with throwing me out if I don’t follow her irrational and very irregular rules. What should I do? ",13Aug2018,1
331,"I just need some advice on how to accept my husband’s past. I understand that everyone has a past and it can’t be changed. But this is something that just really eats at me and I just need tips on how to cope. At the moment, my husband and I are separated but we are trying to work things out. I think if I can figure this out, it would help us a lot. 

My husband is six years older than me, obviously he’s going to have done more things than me. I have a past too, but it’s just not as colorful as his. I’ve only been with 2 people, my husband being my first. He has been with at least 20 people. I’m not sure of the exact number, he told me that he’s lost count. 

This never really bothered me until he started telling me about some of the things in detail that he used to do. I also found a receipt from where we broke up when we were dating that he had bought condoms. I know this may sound ridiculous but it just eats at me every day. 

I don’t know if it’s where I’m not as experienced but I just feel like I’m being compared to every girl he’s ever been with. I can’t get it out of my head and I don’t want the mental image of my husband being with someone else.  

My therapists says that this happens in a lot of relationships and marriages. In the beginning, you think you can accept things because the endorphins are higher. But as time goes on, the endorphins wear off and then you realize that this stuff actually bothers you. 

I just need advice on how to cope and how to push these thoughts away. ",13Aug2018,1
332,"My boyfriend, Jake, is 20 and has divorced parents, Susan and John. And a 16 year old sister, Sam.

Jake was physically abused by John at a young age and his parents got a divorce when he was 7. Since then he has lived with his mom, Susan, who suffers from a textbook diagnoses of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. She also likely has some other severe mental illnesses similar to that of bipolar, but none of these are formally diagnosed. She is perfectly fine and normal one minute, but then will flip at something she was fine with previously and become aggressive and display some rather threatening behaviors like slamming things or throwing things but doesn’t technically physically abuse either Jake or his sister, Sam. Although recently when Susan got angry, she did slam a door on Sam’s ankle and minor abuses like this are very common. Their mom has joint custody with the physically abusive father who lives next door, so if CPS were called (and they have been called but dont investigate because Susan is very good at manipulation and leaves no physical marks) Sam would be sent to her dads and then beaten. 

Jake is financially tied to his mom, as the first college he went to she helped pay for, though he took out loans as well. Jake became addicted to adderall and xanax, and realized that he had to leave that environment to get clean. He left that college and went to another, where he dropped out once for a low gpa. Jake is extremely intelligent but has had trouble balancing school and his personal life as he was in a STEM field major that he had no desire to be in but was encouraged to pursue by his mom.
Jake then reapplied to the second school, tried again, and fell short by one point on his gpa. 

This was last semester. Since then, Jake has been living with his mom. Susan, among her other issues, has become exceptionally worse to Jake and his sister due to the fact that I am in Jake’s life. I do not tell Jake what to do, but I encourage him to become independent of his mom and pursue his real passions in college (though I have always been kind to her). 

She has exhibited many unstable behaviors to me, as well, including on a holiday when Jake an  I went out of our way to say hello to her. When we arrived at her house, she was outside and I said hello, and she told us firmly and aggressively to leave because she didn’t want to see us. 

I should add that Jake had a fairly lucrative IT job and had his email deleted and was effectively laid off just as the school year ended, leaving him with no income.

He left his home a few weeks ago and has been staying with my family after a particularly intense fight with his mom. 

He has applied to a college that he could commute to if he were to stay with his mom, but  that is looking more and more like a bad decision. 

He has pretty bad loans he must pay for September 1st if he doesn’t get enrolled in a school now, and since he is 20 he cant file as an independent (I think you must wait until you’re 23) so he can’t afford it without Susan. 

He also has signed a lease for an apartment near the school he used to go to, since he thought he wouldn’t be permanently dropped. 

He can’t stay at my place since I am going back to school in a few days, and even if he were to get a job in my area he wouldn’t make enough to pay off the loans and pay for rent and food. 

He began recording calls and arguments with his mom, and he called her yesterday to try and see if she would be willing to get family therapy so he could go back home and try to mend the relationship which he really wants to work out. The conversation only lasted a few minutes as she immediately began gaslighting and blaming Jake and the call was ended before anything could be proposed. 

Jake is heartbroken that he is going to have to lose both of his parents and the fact that neither seem to want him or help. 

We made an appointment with the college to speak to a financial aid advisor but, as colleges are, I doubt they will do much to help the situation. 

He is a very, very intelligent and kind person who has made some mistakes in the past but is trying to make good decisions. We are at a loss. 

It seems to be either go back to his emotionally abusive mother, physically abusive father, hope for a miracle from the college, or be homeless.",13Aug2018,1
333,"My significant other was in an accident, 15 years ago, and now deals with chronic pain. He is not faking and has neurological deficits on exam but also has chronic nerve damage on EMG/NCS study. He has consistently pushed his pain doctors to change his medication regiment and taper off opioids. For the past 2 years he has been off opioids with the help of medical marijuana (CBD), completely legal in our state, but lately has been experiencing some depression and anxiety due to a break in at our home. We sought the help of psychiatry at our local academic medical center where his initial consultation went terribly wrong. He opened up with the psychiatry resident and attending doctor about his pain regiment and was basically told that he shouldn't use ""dope,"" that opioids are not an option, and that he has a substance abuse disorder due to his medical marijuana use and should got to substance abuse counseling to learn motivational techniques. We have NEVER encountered an experience like this before. All of his doctors up to this point have encouraged him to use CBD and have applauded him getting off of opioids. While he still has pain he is doing better than when he was on opioids, he is graduating in December with a 3.8 GPA and working part-time. I feel that while we can all work on motivational techniques, that this should be addressed by a psychologist or licensed clinical social worker NOT substance abuse counseling. We are interested in requesting a provider change but am worried because he has less than optimal insurance that the clinic will not let him switch.

338,"Just fyi, I'm currently a high school graduate heading in to college, so I'm not exactly there yet. But yea, it's kinda crazy that I'm already thinking about life after college lol

Anyways, I've seen a couple people that I know take time off after college and work for a year or two before heading into grad school, but these folks were business majors. However since I'm an aspiring science major, I have been discouraged from taking a gap year, being told that it's dangerous for my career, it would negatively affect my grad school admissions, how I would end up with a low paying job, etc. I've been told that only those with a business/computer science major can afford to take a gap year between college and grad school. 

However, I don't like the idea of rushing into a PhD program immediately after college. Being in a PhD program requires a lot of mental strength and commitment, and I'm thinking that it's probably the best if I take a brief sabbatical before diving right in, taking time to mentally prepare myself.

339,"Too start off with, by self destructive habits I mean binge drinking and excessive drug use. I've watched a lot of close friends and family suffer heavily from both, so every time I see a friend pick them up it stings a little bit. 

I am going into my second year of college and most of my friends are from highschool as lots of us stayed in the same area. College of course is a time where people often start getting into drinking and drugs and I have plenty of friends that drink and take drugs within reason that I do not worry about. 

That said, I also have several friends who feel like drugs and alcohol have taken over who they are. They are hardly the same people I was so close with back in high school, they talk about how they almost pass out from drinking or how they haven't been sober for a week straight. I have had other friends note these changes and that they are for the worse.

It's killing me watching this happen to them. I don't believe I can really get them to stop these habits as they would blow me off and possibly just stop talking to me entirely. What I really want is advice on how to find peace with their choices, so the years we are all in college don't become hell for me.

356,"I’m 19 and I’m about to transfer to an out of state college! A little backstory: I got a full ride to BU. Finically Im covered for college this year. I’m moving from Mississippi to Boston. 

My parents have been suggesting I should sell my car because I won’t be using it as much. (I’ll be flying everytime i visit home and come back which is probably going to be twice). 

Also, when I visited Boston for orientation, the traffic was insane and i kept getting honked at. I’m not use to driving in the city and it’s much more difficult driving there than here at my small town. 

For these reasons I’ve considered selling my car because I won’t use my car there. Instead I’ll be using other transportation like the bus, train, subway, bicycle. Ill also be living on campus. 

It’ll also help me save some money, my Porsche Cayman is worth a little over $70k and i could use this money in the future for my startups, etc


However, for the reasons it’s hard to give up my car because this was my first car. I had this car since I was 16 and there’s so many memories in this car.

358,"My area has been getting lots of rain lately, and somebody from town went down a private road with their Camry. The person stupidly kept their foot on the peddle and dig themselves deep into the mud until they couldn’t get their doors open. This person climbed out the window, and she walked on foot to my residence, and my wife answered the door to her being in a panic. 

I decided to help out, so I got the big tractor and some chains out of the shed, and gave this girl a ride back to her car. I hooked onto the car, and told her to put her vehicle in Neutral, but she apparently didn’t. 

I ended up towing the Camry in Park, which means a lot of crap got fucked up on her vehicle, especially the transmission and linkages/pawl. Iirc, this means that her vehicle is going to be incapable of being put into park. 

She apparently caught onto this, and sent the car to the mechanic, where he’s already finished with the repairs, this lady sent me a copy of the bill in the mail, although I have no idea if she’s already paid the mechanic. The Transmission repair alone is $3,000 and the parking pawl and linkages are another $400 with the parts, and services making it another $500. 

I’m not a mind reader, but I would assume her mailing me the repair bill would mean she expects me to pay it, and that she believes I’m at fault here. Do I just ignore this, and go about my day? Or should I inquire about this with her? Perhaps the mechanic can get me her name and number that way she doesn’t just passive aggressively mails me the billing and invoices again? ",13Aug2018,1

I felt bad, told her no, and told her we should no longer talk, I blocked her on all communication. This happened within the span of like 20 minutes. She didnt send me anything back, and she legit just wanted to see it, since she hadnt seen one my size before. Nevertheless, i feel awful. I feel like ive really started to develop love for this girl and feel like i cheated on her even though we arent officially dating. I know if she knew i did that she would be hurt, and it just tears me to pieces knowing i did that. I would never do it while we were actually dating, and ill never do it again, but i feel awful.

Alright so I’m an 18 year old university student who lives in Canada, I’m going into my second year of university right now. This summer after my first year I started working during the summer to save up some money for school and paying my off my phone bill during the school year if I can’t work then. However it seems that my family mainly my older sister and my mom keep thinking that the money I have and I keep trying to save is for them. My older sister is nice and generous and I’ve bought her and given her so much money not just from working but I earned a $3000 scholarship for school and I could have used it for anything but I gave it to her and my mom cause they asked for it and I really didn’t care. Not only that from the pay checks I’ve earned I’ve given them $2000 alone within these past months which is honestly a lot for a person working a minimum wage job trying to save up some money. However they bought me a red suit for a wedding which I never even asked for and they said just wear it and return it after. I kept the tags with me and I gave the receipt to them to hold but now they claim I took the tags and the receipt that is now apparently lost. My younger sister who is only 16 told them I for sure only took the tags, my dad doesn’t really care he’s always just calm about this but now he sides with them. No one listens to my little sister cause she’s young and they know that I get along with her the most so they think She’d side with me. I told them I’m not paying for it cause not only did I not lose the receipt but I’m tired of hearing all this crap about your older sister is generous. I gave them my god damn scholarship money for school and transferred them more than $2000. For some reason both of them seem to forget that and say that I’m just greedy. I’m just trying to save up my money for school and so on. I honestly wanted to save up more money to go on a trip next year but I can never do that cause they always want whatever I earn. They’re so angry that now they’re not talking to me. Which I honestly don’t give a shit anymore, I’ve done everything I can. Not only have I taken blame for this stuff thought my life when I was younger but now they do it to me when I’m older too. I didn’t even want to work this summer as I wanted to volunteer and do some research for school to build up my resume. They told me to work and save up and I listened to them. But honestly it feels like they just wanted me to work so they can have some extra money. Am I just being greedy here deciding not to pay the suits bill which is $800? A suit I never wanted that they only bought to use for one day of a wedding. I really just need some advice on what to do, my mind just can’t take this anymore. ",13Aug2018,1

377,"About a year and a half ago I moved away from a town I grew up in because my father lost his job in a company merge. I started high school out of state half way through my freshman year. The school looked promising and offered a lot of tech courses which interest me. Fast forward to today and almost all of those courses are not offered anymore and my family is considering moving back.

My old high school offers a lot more courses and is overall a more competitive school. The problem that occurs to moving back is that my dad would have to stay here and we wouldn’t see him very much. Only my mother and I would be moving into a small rental house. My brother would be at his college about an hour and a half away. 

The other option is to stay here and do classes at a local community college at night. They have a few good courses that would certainly help my career. The problem with this is that they are 6-8:30 at night on top of my regular school. I am going into my junior year so homework is going to be time consuming and trying to balance a job and another class on top of my regular life would be difficult and I probably wouldn’t be able to do sports. 

My mom said I should try to have my mind made up by dinner tonight and I just wanted to hear some other opinions. I can’t tell anyone outside my family, like my friends, so I’ve really only had my own opinion on this. I do have a girlfriend here and if I move back it will definitely hurt her.

So.. I've never told anyone this and I really need to get it off my chest.

Here it goes...

I'm a 26 year old Male, been struggling with depression and anxiety for almost 10 + years.   
I have tried therapy (never told them this story though) and prescription drugs.

I'm starting to realize that something that happened in High school is still effecting me to this day and I can't shake it.

In high school, I was madly in love with this girl. It was very unhealthy. I would ditch my friends for her and lie to them about hanging with her because they knew she wasn't good for me.

She wasn't mean to me in anyway other than leading me on...

We had fun anytime we hung out and I loved being around her. She was nice to me. We were young. We kissed.. slept in the same bed together and we texted non stop.

I asked her out and was turned down...

I was gutted...

Found out a few weeks later she was hanging out with one of my good friends.

They start dating.

The rest of my high school years were miserable but I got through it.

They continued dating for 2+years so I tried my best to forget about her and move on.

When I thought I was ready I started seeing another woman, who i'm still currently with (6+ years).

Through this whole time with my current girl friend it's been a struggle trying to forget the past and her.

It's been almost 10 years and I still can't get her our of my head.

I've blocked her on all social medias and I'm really trying to better myself and move on.

Unfortunately we live in the same city and I pass by her house on the way to work everyday. It sparks up memories in my head every time (only the good ones though) and it's very unhealthy.

I love my current girlfriend and i'm really trying my best to forget my high school crush but it's just not working.

I feel like i'm going crazy and I can't take it anymore. I'm constantly miserable.

380,"I’m 22 years old and live with my parents (I need to move out, I know). Earlier this year, I decided I wanted to pursue a career in animation. I know and appreciate that it’s an extremely difficult career to get into and be successful at, but I honestly believe I will enjoy it and be good at it. I’ve found a university in Texas that has an animation program with direct ties to Pixar; many alumni currently work at Pixar in California.

For a long time, I thought I wanted to be a teacher but once I got to college, I realized that I wasn’t going to want to be a teacher for the rest of my life. My mother, who believes teaching is my calling, doesn’t think I will succeed in animation and will wind up with no money and no degree to fall back on. The worst part is that I know she’s probably right, but I still want to pursue this because I know if I don’t, I will always wonder what would have happened if I’d followed my heart. The last thing I want to do is be an old man and have regrets. 

But I hate to see my mother disappointed. And to be honest, I really want to succeed just to prove her wrong! She doesn’t think I’m aggressive enough to make it in such a difficult field. I’m *not* an aggressive person and that something I need to work on.

I'm atheist, studying in college, a scientific degree. I don't drink, I don't smoke, and so I don't go out, I just do sports, love art, music, cinema, trying to get into paintings too, and so on.

Honestly, I think I'm hotter and more interesting than most people, but I guess being a fake person and getting wasted, not having personality and all of that crap makes you more likeable and able to fuck.

I have to say I suffered from social anxiety until last year, when I finally removed it, but I've been healthy one year, I should have been able to fuck already, and no way jose

And other problem I may have is that I'm picky, I know the type of girl I like, and I want that, not other thing, I say this, because I could've fucked already with a bunch of fat or ugly girls, but I don't want that.

And last thing, I know i said ""fuck"" but I don't really want to fuck, like to meet with a stranger for that, it'd be too much work for something so little, but if I don't even fuck, if I don't meet any girl in a romantic way at all, I'm never gonna find someone to raise a family and all. 

So what should I do? Tinder, go out, be a fake person, smoke, do do drugs, wait? And what do you think the problem is right now?

My question is...how can I approach her in a way that doesn't make her uncomfortable in order to share some of my experiences? She seems open to communicating with me, but is also a very shy person. 

Both her dad (my boyfriend's brother) and my boyfriend have asked me to help. An important detail to add is that her mother died when she was 6. She is such a sweet girl who is intelligent and musically inclined. I want to help her, but I don't want to overwhelm her or overstep boundaries. Does anyone have any suggestions?",13Aug2018,1

398,"First, sorry for my bad English.

 I have BDD and I can tell when someone has it because I know the signs. so I have 2 brothers and two sisters, and for real we dont look like we are from the same mother... Mom ?? WTF . and I'm the ugliest one in the family, my biggest sister and youngest brother have darker skin my sister is attractive, my youngest brother is SO CUTE but I think he will never see it, unfortunately!!!! he is 13 years old, he is kinda black not too much, and where we live there aren't many black people, in fact, I can't recall seeing one in like the last few months, if not years, I actually know only one black dude from high school, Idk maybe I don't by much attention, but you got the idea, and my brother with a really few kids you can count them on one hand are the only black kids in his school, I just realized that lately and it makes me sad how he see it from his side. anyway something happen to him lately, I don't know whats going on but I know that BDD demons are growing inside, before he was joking around and he has so much energy,  he is the flame of the house he talks too much with everyone and everyone love him you just can't hate him, he have a great personality and he is always out with his friends ... but now ... I think depression is on the road, he spends all day sleeping witch is a sign of sadness, and he spends a great time in-front of the mirror like more than +4 hour a day and he never goes out. so all he does is starting to the mirror or sleep. once we had a talk about self-loving because I'm aware of how important is to love yourself ... and he said he doesn't like his skin color and he changed the topic SO FAST he wasn't uncomfortable talking about it and I didn't push it.

Please, I need some pieces of advice, I don't know what to do right now, I wanna help him cause I know BDD can be a hell, my parents are horrible at parenting and don't know how to deal with those things and don't understand mental illness at all. my mom dont like when my brother keep looking in the mirror, I'm sure she thinks he may be a gay or something like that, when she finds him looking in the mirror she ALWAYS say  ""Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the fairest of them all? "" and this is the same exact sentence she used to use it with me 6 years ago when I used to be 13, I guess it never gets old. and she thinks he maybe being bullied because he doesn't get out as he used to, so she goes to his room and she open that door like an FBI agent with her high voice you can hear it from Mars, she yall ARE YOU BEING BULLIED? SOMEONE IS BULLING YOU? Hey, mom why don't you write it in the newspaper ""SON ARE YOU BEEN BULLIED?"" because I'm sure everyone in the neighborhood heard you.  I dont think its the right way to do it as someone who's been bulled and someone who been sitting on the other side of the room and watching that frighten scene of my mom opening the door that way.

I think my brother feels like he is special in a bad way and alienated, and ugh I know that feeling. I wish he can only see how beautiful he is and how amazing he is he doesn't have to be defined by his look.

I feel hopeless I don't know what to do, please any ideas? I wanna help him and I don't want him to know what I am doing. 

The only idea I got is to tell my mom about how serious this is and request to remove all the mirrors in the house, but its stupid idea because we have way too many mirrors in the house...so I just don't know.

Again sorry for my English, and sorry for this walls of text. ",13Aug2018,1
399,"Hello everyone!

I’m currently sitting here on my lunch break at my aforementioned “boring vet hospital job.” I accepted this job offer 2 weeks ago and I can’t stand it!!! It is dead silent here most times (no music nothing) except when the phone rings and when the occasional client comes in. My head feels like it’s gonna explode from boredom (I literally clean the hospital 60% of my work day because there’s nothing else to do 🙄). 

I should mention that I do have another job (my main job) it is a startup, a newly built animal emergency hospital that is opening soon. The opening date is delayed and unknown as of now due to unexpected complications, and because of that I had to accept this job in the meantime as I really need the money. It’s also been 3 weeks since I’ve had an update from the emergency hospital (still have no idea when I’ll start working there loll the start date was supposed to be June 18th 🙄)

But back to the boring hospital I’m at right now.. the unknowing of how long I will have to stay at this soul sucking job is killing me!!! The doctor is nice sometimes but also aggressive and a smartass when she gets stressed (ie grabs your arm in an aggressive manner when she doesn’t like the way you’re restraining a dog) 😑😒 the vet techs are good at training me but things are awkward sometimes as they won’t let me do anything until I’ve mastered the skill (even simple stuff like refilling medication) which is frustrating as when it does get a bit busy they expect me to do these things I wasn’t allowed to normally do. Therefore I’m confused and the doctors get frustrated 😡😑 btw I’ve worked in veterinary medicine for the past 2 years and already am trained, they’re just SUPER particular about the way they do things :/ 

I dread coming into work everyday and count down the time until I can go home... another 4.5 hours to go 😭 thank you for listening and any advice for this type of issue is welcome! 

Also, I do plan to quit this job as soon as I get an update from my manager at the emergency hospital, and if you have any advice on any cash jobs I could do for more money so I can quit this job sooner that would be awesome 😎 haha 
Is resigning by email sufficient for a job I’ve had for 2/3 weeks? And should I give two weeks notice? 

Thank you!! &lt;333",13Aug2018,1

408,"Hi everyone, 

I want to ask a guy I’ve been seeing for about 10 months to a friend’s co-ed baby shower that’s coming up in September. 

We are not together, but he knows how deep my feelings are for him. I’m not really sure where we stand honestly, but we’re very honest with each other and always have a good time. He’s admitted that he cares about me a lot, wants me to be happy, and safe, but has also admitted that he doesn’t reciprocate feelings of “love” for me. 

In my opinion, he’s afraid of commitment, and the feelings he’s described to me sounds like love, though maybe he can’t/doesn’t want to categorize it as love. 

Anyway, I’d like to get some advice: should I ask him to go with me? (It’s out of state so we’d be there for 2 nights, we’ve spent nights together before). I just don’t want to scare him off if asking him to a friend’s shower is too serious? We have not met each other’s friend’s... which makes sense because... we’re not together.

I have one last semester off before I’m able to return to college (debt free!) after a year and a half. The little school attached to my church called, and asked if I would come be a substitute teacher for a lady on maternity leave. They want me to work there full time for a semester. I’m surprised, pleasantly so. However, I’d have to quit the steady job I have now, and find a new one after this ends. On top of all this, my boyfriend and I are working towards marriage, and I want to be in a financially steady place for him. 

The biggest factor in my indecisiveness is the uncertainty of what would happen after this job is over. What if I can’t find something that pays as well? I might screw myself over.

412,"**So TL;DR Single Paragraph Version** \- I am pretty good at relationships to a point. Can generally end up with whoever I wanted to be with in that moment. Was always like that for me growing up. However, first time I actually was truly happy to just be in the presence of this girl. Just a text from her puts a smile on my face. Thing is, didn't want to ruin it in the future so played it a different route than usual, my real self, not what they want me to be. So I was me. Somehow along the lines I was stuck deep in the friend zone, and used every method I know of to get out. How the heck can I get out of the friend zone and be in a relationship with someone that I care about more than anything else in the world? 

**Slightly Longer Text Wall Version**

Met this girl a little while ago and she was in a relationship (still is, sorta, not really, long story). Anyways, because of this I chose to not like push myself through, but made it a point I was highly interested in her. Spend my nights and days texting her about anything and everything (like at this moment in time she's nagging me to let her read what I am posting on Reddit x\_x). We've gotten relatively close and have yet to tell her a single lie (major improvement on my part). I drew pictures for her as well. She posted them all over her social media super happy. She even listens to my favorite song every time that she's sad (I personally use it to cry). Thing is... I am literally starting to feel like that stereotypical gay friend. Whenever we text and she sends hearts sometimes it get's followed by ""best fran or best friend"". We have nicknames for each other that only we're allowed to use. Whenever I flirt, she seems to take it in a friendly, non-flirty way, so she does it back. If I was naive, I would assume she would have a thing for me, open up completely, and watch my heart get destroyed with our relationship. I know she may be single soon and my female friend managed to give me a hand with her by showing a text I sent my friend in private about how I feel (when the girl I like, noticed I was feeling down and quiet lately). So that way, she knows how I officially feel, and now she realizes all the flirting was me not actually joking around (I could've told her, but she would still think I would be joking around in a friendly way). I don't know where along the lines she decided to friend zone me. I retrace my steps, and I have been flirting with her since day one to show my interest. Yeah, it's her choice to date me or not or see me as something more. She cares about me a lot and I her. I just need help trying to see if I can get out of it or not, or just lock my feelings of her away and continue being a friend. 

Any idea on how to get out of this situation and eventually be more than friends? 

I have tried making myself scarce (she is worried), showing less of an interest (she is worried again), I created competition (it was literally with a girl similar looking to her but more attractive and smarter... she didn't care... so I thanked the girl for helping me try and moved on), literally tried the Ben Franklin Effect (she does it anyways), I have even rewarded her for certain behaviors (she gets happy and nothing happens), and A LOT more. I am running out of options, and want to try everything I can before giving up my feelings for her. She's the only person I have actually connected with in a positive way in over 15 years. So once again:

413,"Hi,

I don't really know how to begin or what to ask, it's just that I don't really know what is wrong with myself or my life.

Okay, so, I'm m/17 and one could say that my life is pretty good, and in many factors it actually is, I'm doing great at school and I managed to get some of the things done that I wished for when I was younger (f.E. actually learning how to program), I won some programming contests (or what they're called in English) and I could be happy about it, and most people expect that of me. I have 2 very close friends, they're the most amazing people in my life (apart from family) and they're my 2 real friends, and no, I am not here to ask how to get more friends, those two are all I asked for and they're not the problem here, and until now it seems that my life is nice, and normally I enjoy it, but the moments where I don't are getting more and more frequent.

I don't think I am depressed or anything, there are some great things in my life but they are not the things that I want from life. One of the things is that I would love to have a girlfriend. Yes, I know, sounds like a clichee. And yes, I'm only 17 and I know that I won't get one by sitting here and complaining, I have to meet new people, and I enjoy that. This is just an example of the things that are missing in my life, like there is a hole that popped up a while ago. It sounds silly to say in my opinion, I don't really like talking about my feelings, that's why I'm writing it here pseudo anonymously. I feel like this one person that is so close to you, I am really missing this feeling of closeness.

What I actually want to say is that all of those things that look great from the outside (being good at school, etc.) are not what I care about. I would give all of it up for the things that really mean a lot to me, like making people happy, there is no better feeling than when the people around me are happy.

Well, I don't know what I should ask or anything, there was lots of other stuff that happened in my life that I am done with (at least I think so, even though they still make me kind of sad when looking back), like my parents divorcing or being bullied in school by the people I called friends.

 I'm not here because I want to be pitied, I am here because I know what is going on in my life because I am some sort of confused and don't know where I belong or anything, all of those questions that arose this year are the ones that I thought were already answered, and all of the things that I wished for (being good at school, I worked so hard for this this year), don't really mean anything to me at all, they are not important.

421,"Hi, so I have no idea where else to put this. But I really need advice.

I work in a super busy, super well-known brunch place in my state. 35-40 hours a week with weekends off, which is amazing. However the stress of it all has really been getting to me lately.

We are super short staffed, meaning sometimes I have to work my entire 8 hour shift on my own. It’s super hard on me. My entire body hurts and I’m so tired. My smoking has made a pack that used to last me a week into lasting me a day. The sous chef is a total dick and fucks up everything in the kitchen and takes off during his shifts to go do random bullshit leaving everyone scrambling to get orders out in time, and yells at us for falling behind when he gets back. The owners won’t fire him.

I’m constantly covering shifts or switching with people or coming in to help, pushing myself so hard. This industry has turned me into a total party animal. This past weekend I went to a local music show, downed three beers, 750 ml of rum, and for shots of tequila.

I also tried cocaine for the first time that was probably cut with meth.

I’m really fucked up about it but I’m so tired and I just wanna have fun. I don’t know how to say no to things because they’re so tempting. I usually just smoke a joint or two to relax but I keep getting told “just one time won’t hurt” and I’m afraid I might go down the wrong path. I’m only twenty years old and I’ve already been hospitalized for alcohol problems (it runs in my family).

I know this is really long and I’m sorry but I guess the question is: fellow restaurant workers/former addicts, how do you learn to tell yourself no? I know in this industry drug and alcohol abuse are common no matter where you work, I just need to know how to stop myself from diving in to the temptation because I’m afraid I’m gonna do something that will fuck up my entire life.

427,"Two months ago, I was hanging out with some friends and one of my friends had his new girlfriend, who's pretty shy. I was doing alright and things were fine but suddenly I felt really sick and overwhelmed--I hadn't slept in 3 days and I think it had finally caught up to me. I felt like I was going to cry and break down and I didn't really want to do this in front of someone I just met, cause I didn't want to freak her out. I told one of my friends I was leaving because I didn't feel good, and apologized for ducking out early. In hindsight, I should have probably said good bye to everyone but I didn't want to make a big deal out of it because I was kind of embarrassed (I don't like crying in front of other people).

Fast forward to now, apparently my friend thinks I don't like his new girlfriend and that I was being disrespectful for leaving early and not saying goodbye to her/them. How do I resolve this issue? I was really unaware that anyone 1) remembered this and 2) took my leaving early the wrong way, because it literally didn't have anything to do with anyone other than me.

429,"Background: I was hired on at my current company early 2017. Took two months maternity leave at the begining of 2018. While on leave I was asked if I could attend a videoconference call with the President/CEO and my boss (a VP) to discuss an opportunity. This opportunity was that my boss is retiring early/ again and they offered for me to take the helm at my divisional office. At the time it was only my boss, myself, and another guy. Other guy wasn't working out so he was let go and I was told to get to hiring, which I've done over the last few months. 2 hires and an intern on deck for the fall and this rounds out my team for now.


Last week I got an email from someone I had interviewed with when last looking for a job (when I settled on where I currently work) and due to timing and circumstances on both parties part we couldn't quite make it work, which I lameneted because this company does more of what is in my wheel house and interests (I work in construction with numbers, so project type and company portfolio of work matters when it comes to what you're good at and like to do). Per his email, he definitely regrets not having hired me at that time. I like my current job and while its not a factor for everyone, I weigh in that they have been very good to me. 

So I respond back thanks for thinking of me and it was kind of a former boss of mine to tell the offeror (they are old friends) that he was an idiot. 

Fast forward to this week and I got a wall of text saying he can appreciate that, sounds like you have a good set up, but I'd be remiss if I didn't make my offer hard to say no to. The current company I work for is big, does work nationally. The prospective company is a juggernaut and there was a very open ended tell me what it would take and could we even convince you to come have coffee with us (people with owner or a ""C"" in their title). Its a position with similar weight to what I have and I'm sure I could go knock it out of the park. Perhaps relevant or not, I'm young to have found myself with the particular title I have in my industry - usually its guys in their 40s- 50s (which is how our other offices are structured/staffed) and I'm a few years off of 30 yet. 

I'm conflicted on whether even entertain this. There is an off chance that if I went through the interview circus and got everything I wanted (which I know they can afford and I could name my price) I might be causing people that I just hired their jobs. That and not wanting to scorn people who were good to me and put a lot of faith in me. On the flip side, there is a lot to gain and day to day content I'd be happier doing (I do like my job here, I just like project type and dollar value of prospective company's projects better).


What would anyone else do? Is it worth hearing them out in person? Am I letting an emotional component (seriously, if this panned out and I left there would be some major guilt) possibly over ride something that could be yet another big jump up in my career hold me back, or are those things valid?

Thanks in advance for any advice you may have.

431,"Recently I had an unnerving experience. Well, two unnerving experiences that may or may not be related...

First of all, I am a single woman living alone in my early 30s.

What happened: A couple days ago, around 3pm, I was lying on my bed when I heard a tapping or knocking sound. My cat reacted the way he does when someone is at the door -- but it didn't quite sound like the door. I ignored the first series of taps, and then after the second time it happened, I opened the door to find no one there. I said *Hello, is anyone there?* and nothing. It is possible that someone was holding the front door to the apartment building open, but I'm not sure.

So I locked the door and walked back to my bedroom. Then, from the hallway, I heard another series of taps, and turned around to see *a man leaving my living room window.* I would have seen this man at the window when I went to open the front door because my hallway faces the window head on. I would have noticed a man standing there, looking in, or trying to get my attention. He would have seen at least my figure. I never got close enough to see him clearly because he was turning away, but also he never got close enough to see my face. 

So: a man was tapping on my window, and also seemed to be hiding from me. 

This is scary enough, but what was even scarier is that he generally resembled someone who had harassed me in the past -- I had moved because this person's stalker behavior was escalating and he was scaring me. Unfortunately I couldn't get a clear look at his face because he was turning away and leaving when I saw him, and wearing sunglasses, but it is someone who *could have* *been* him. Similar hair, build. Or it could be a coincidence. But it was my first thought, my first reaction, and I panicked. 

The thing is, I moved in February and haven't heard or seen this person since. I do live in a small town and it is possible he saw me around or found me some other way. But it's been awhile. That's why I opened the door without asking who it was (I won't be doing that again...) -- I just wasn't even thinking about it anymore!

Some people (including my landlord) have suggested it could have been someone coming to the wrong apartment or building. The thing is that it seemed he was playing some kind of game, not genuinely trying to get my attention, because I would have seen him looking in and he would have waited before leaving.  There was also significant delay between tapping incidents and he never knocked on the door. He didn't come inside the building, even; our building's front door is *not locked* so he would not have had any trouble coming in to knock on various doors to find whoever he would have been looking for. The behavior of this person was abnormal. I also know everyone in my apartment building, which is 4 households (including me) at the moment. And, honestly, if you know someone well enough to tap on their window, instead of coming to the door like a normal person, I'd think you'd know where they live. Or that they don't live in a place anymore. I mean, really. I would only do this with my best friends, not some acquaintance. 

I suppose it still could be that, but I am not content relying on this explanation and relaxing. Some more reasonable alternative explanations I have considered:

1. Casing to burglarize during the workday.
2. High on something and confused/erratic, looking for a drug house in the area or something.
3. Some other creeper followed me home from my earlier walk.

I called the police, so it is recorded as in incident. I also called them a second time when someone was acting weird. I had been standing outside and a man had come by on a bike and stopped and stared at me a moment, then turned off the sidewalk and seemed to be coming my way -- I don't know if he really was or if I was imagining it because I ran back inside so fast, and couldn't get a good look at him from that distance, either. He rode into the (non-residential) lot across the street from my apartment (also facing my front window directly) and hung out by the fence, got off the bike, kicked some dirt around. He was also *wearing sunglasses*, like the person who had turned away from my window. I believe the cop found him and I received a call saying it was not my previous harasser. I am wondering if it was the man who tapped, or if I was just freaking out and paranoid, ready to call the cops on any man who acted weird. If the biker was him, I hope the cop questioning him scared him off.

Also, possibly related: someone stole stray mail from atop the mailboxes the week prior.

I alternate from telling myself I am overreacting to feeling like any moment I am going to be raped and killed. What is your take on this? What would you do in this situation? ",13Aug2018,1

435,"Hey! I’m a teenage girl, and I am in need of opinions. 

I went to a camp early this summer, and it was a training week for the counsellors. I met a lot of new people, as well as this guy. For the purpose of privacy, we’ll call him John. So initially, I really liked how he looked, but I didn’t have enough insight on his personality. Knowing he was willing to volunteer at a summer camp, I thought that was a good start. Although I didn’t get to talk to him much that week, my friend talked to him a lot, and it seemed like they liked each other. I was a bit disappointed, but I told myself there were other fish in the sea, and to move on. I didn’t know him that well anyways. 

Second week of summer camp rolls around, and this time, there are actually kids we need to focus on. My friend wasn’t there that week, but John was. He was wonderful with the kids, and I got to talk to him more that week. A lot of small talk, but I still appreciated it.

I spent a few weeks away, until my third week at camp rolled around. This time, my friend and John were both back at camp. We had a lot of small group conversations, and he seemed to enjoy talking with us. I felt like I was friends with him. I told my friend on the first night that I liked John, and she told me she was excited, and that we’d be cute together. I had also asked her if she liked him, and she said no. 

After the third week, nothing much happened but I got back home, and my friend told me she’d try to get him to like me. After a few hours, she reported back to me that John thought I was attractive, cool, and fun to hang with. He had asked if we should start “talking” but he thought it might not work out since we live far from each other, which is half true. He lives about 45 minutes away. 

Anyways, he is at camp this week again, but I was wondering if I should hit him up when he gets back. I’m afraid that he will think I’m desperate, or he’ll reject me completely, despite what he said. 

Advice appreciated!

TLDR; I [F14] like this guy [M15] who thinks I’m attractive, cool, and fun to hang around, but he seems to think physical distance is an issue. I’m not extremely close to him either, in terms of friendship (having only spent 3 weeks w/ him) but I am wondering if I should shoot my shot anyways, or just let it go.

438,"This will be really short, due to using the reddit mobile app. First time posting in here. 

Here’s the deal, we met over a dating app by accent. I was traveling in her search area and being bored I was swiping right. Turns out she messaged me and we started talking via chat. 

With two days of texting back and forth, we started talking on the phone for hours. We found so many common interests, told and listened to each other’s fun life stories, played 20 questions and so on. 

We decided to meet and have lunch two days after talking. She was driving by my city on her way for a girls weekend. When I finally saw her in person I couldn’t believe she was real, but she was super pretty and I was kinda in shock. We spent just about only 30 minutes together before she kept looking at me with a smile we both said how crazy of a feeling this is. We spent about 4 hours together at the restaurant bar outside on the river and it went by in a flash. She went her way and I went mine, but we called each other as we drove and immediately both said that this can’t be real. 

Thru the weekend, we texted and called each other then decided to meet again on her way back home. We spent just about another 4 hours together and left with butterflies and this weird feeling we both can’t explain. 

We agreed to try to figure out what this really is, because we’ve never felt this before and I told her I would make a post on Reddit and ask this question...

Is true love real? How do we deal with this living 3 hours away from each other and both of us just being a year out of our 1st marriages? I have no kids, 1 dog, she has a 4 year old girl, and two giant dogs.  We both are pretty successful, and just want to know... ARE WE CRAZY?! Has anyone heard of this happening?

I said I didn't want to, and said I wanted to go back to class. Sally said I wasn't allowed and refused to let me out of the bathroom (we were in a cubicle and she wouldn't move out of the way  of the door). Sally then said that we had to touch each other and kiss each other in our 'private places'. I said no, everyone else was fine with it. They touched each others bums, front parts and kissed both parts too.

I did not cause any big trouble at the volunteering site. Other volunteers often complimented me on my work. I don't know what I did wrong. It's so unprofessional of her to treat me like this. I feel quite angry at her for making me go through this struggle.

Is there anyone here who were in a situation like mine? I'm thinking about reporting her to her own supervisor, but would that be a good idea? It's so tiring to be treated like I'm a worthless person from others...This has affected my confidence level quite negatively. Any advice on how to recover from this low point would be much appreciated.",13Aug2018,1
456,"I fell for this dude hard. We started talking sometime early April and continued throughout June. Come early July, he told me he couldn’t do it because, although I was amazing, he was t ready for a relationship. Mid July he told me he missed me and I told him I did too but that I understood he wasn’t ready and that I wouldn’t beg him to stay with me and that we just let whatever happens happen. He’s a close friend of my best friend and one point she brought up is that he’s never talked about me that much. The reasoning for this, according to what he’s told me, is that it makes him anxious. Well apparently he’s talked about the other ones and even taken one of them on a date; something we always planned on and never got around to. I feel lost. Did I do something to deserve this?

460,"Hi.

To cut a long story short, I'm 25M, never had a girlfriend and spent the past year or two sleeping with escorts in order to stay sane.

However, I've recently moved into my own place and so can no longer afford to keep up this habit, and I  would like a girlfriend. 

I got tinder, had about 20 matches but weren't really going anywhere and after trying PoF I got off tinder as it just doesn't seem as good or active.  PoF is much better so been using that more often but I'm really struggling with small talk. I think my problem is because I'm used to just paying a girl to get what I want, I don't have the practice of what to say to get these girls to meet me in person.

Any tips on how to improve?

461,"I’ll just get right into it, I’m a 21 yr old female and I’ve always suffered with social anxiety. I’ve never been a large friend group type of person but I’ve always had a best friend that I’ve done everything with, and I live with my best friend now who is a male (no romantic connection at all - he’s in a long term relationship and his girlfriend essentially lives with us). 

I’ve always been able to talk to guys easier and feel more comfortable with them than females. I wouldn’t call myself a tom boy but definitely closer to that on the spectrum than a “girly girl”, probably cause my brother was always my best friend growing up.

I started seeing my boyfriend 9 months ago and he’s very jealous and it’s something we’re working on, but I’m acknowledging that i can’t just hang out with and talk to guys like i used to, so now I’m trying to make friends with more girls.. but it’s so damn hard for me. I over analyze everything i say and get such bad social anxiety and I’d rather just be alone at that point.

But now i just feel very lonely. My boyfriend works a lot and my best guy friend that I live with is always with his girlfriend. She’s chill but I still feel so weird with her one on one.

Does anyone have any tips or advice for me?

462,"People (especially guys) who have grown up in a dysfunctional family, how did this affect you in your teens and twenties?

I come from a toxic background filled with constant fights, addiction, depression, suicide attempts (some stopped by me), irresponsibility, emotional abuse, lies, traumas. How it affected me: I became extremely responsible for them (and for everybody else, for that matter), I became a people pleaser, I never, ever cared about myself, I developed something of a jokster personality, I was always lonely, depressed, couldn't really enjoy anything. I had extremely low self esteem, I had troubles with girls (every time I got close to a girl, I sort of blew it, without being a jerk or anything, I just didn't know how to react).

467,"Hi reddit. I really need some advice on what I should do regarding a problem I encountered with my employer. You see, they contacted me because they were in need of additional man power for an activity outside of their main office. I accepted the offer since I didn't have anything to do for the next weeks. It was 4 days of work and my shift was from 11 pm to 8 am. I was promised a daily rate and was told compensation would be given two weeks after the event.

Every agreement was verbal and they didn't have me sign anything beforehand.

So the day of the activity came and it was all good until day 4 where they called me in at 2 hours earlier than my expected time in. I commuted to work and adjusted my sleeping schedule to come to them per their request. I got there on time only to find out that they only wanted to talk to me about an incident regarding a client complaining which honestly, I wasn't even a part of. Pissed as to how they could have just asked that on the phone, I left the building and decided to sleep the 2 hours left before my shift.

Unfortunately, I overslept. I woke up late and got to work an hour late. I rushed to the building asap and started work immediately. I apologised to our team leader and explained how much of an honest mistake it had been and offered to give up my breakfast break to make up for the time I wasn't there.

Two weeks later and they text me to get my salary in their main office. I come by and receive an amount much lesser to that promised. I was shocked so I texted our team leader asking why. She responded with a vague ""maybe they deducted some because you were late"".

I text back asking her ""woah, an entire day's salary deduction for being late? If you had told me that you wouldn't be paying me anymore for the 6 hours I helped out, I wouldn't have come back to the activity and just continued sleeping.""

I'm asking for advice if I should just let it go and move on? Or should I go to their office now to clear things out and raise my concerns to their boss?",13Aug2018,1
468,"A little background first. I'm mid twenties and work in the trades.I've had a considerable amount of success in my profession and currently work for one of the top companies in my field within my state. 

The company I work for was sold at the beginning of the year, and the new owner and I are having some issues. I am normally the go to employee, the guy who gets things done, and who knows what to do. The past two weeks, I have had two mistakes happen on projects that we really could not afford to have them happen on. I understand that, and admit to it. When my boss and I had a conversation about it I said that I wont make excuses and that all i can say is that I messed up, im sorry, and I will work to have it not happen again.

Fast forward a week, I have a great Monday training a new employee, we get work done, she learned a lot, and we generally had a good working day. At the end of the day, my boss pulls me aside once everyone leaves and tells me that even though he doesnt think I am, I shouldn't try and hide mistakes that may pop up during a job from him. He then says that he wants to be the one making the decision of what needs to be done with them. I can understand wanting to know whats happening out in the shop, but for me to walk over to him every time any small anomaly comes up, and ask him what to do, is pointless, and a waste of his time. Additionally, I feel as though I should be trusted enough to be able to judge whether something is fixable, or whether it needs to be redone.

I'm just trying to figure out what to do. I have felt for about the past two months that my enthusiasm and general enjoyment of my job has been declining, and I am seriously considering leaving the company. I know its hard to give advice on this without really knowing all of the details but anything is appreciated. 

tl/dr: I dont feel as though my boss trusts me, even though I should be one of the employees he trusts the most. This general feeling of not being trusted makes me question whether or not I should even continue working at my current employer.

471,"I recently made a new friend who is seemingly not respecting the limits and boundaries I am trying to set. She and I met when we went on a date and mutually decided we weren't right for one another in a romantic sense but would make excellent friends. 

It was alright for the first month or so, we'd talk and text constantly and that hasn't changed. It's when it comes to hanging out in person that's become an issue. She and I have a similar schedule so it should work on paper because our weekends are free, I have a girlfriend so one day is often dedicated to being with her and the other I like to try and spend with my friend. 

Lately instead of hanging out with me on the weekend she keeps trying to hang out with me in the hours before work. I did it once and now it's expected of me at least once a week to do something before work. I have told her time and time again that I do not enjoy hanging out before work, I can't fully relax with the looming pressence or work on the horizon. We usually get 2 hours to hang out, eat something, talk in person about things, during which i'm constantly checking my phone for the time. I get to work and i'm fine but by the end of the day i'm mentally and physically exhausted. 

When I asked her why we couldn't hang out on weekends anymore she said she reserves those days for people who don't share her schedule, so she can see them instead. When I express how much I don't like hanging out before work she insists i'll get used to it but now I have started to pull back emotionally from her and am feeling myself wanting some distance.

473,"For context, I’m 26 and I just got home from living overseas for about the past 4 years. I’m staying at my parents until I find a place to live and a new job. 

My parents have been nothing but emotionally and financially supportive of me whenever I’m in a tough time, and are really good people. 

However, they both struggle with alcoholism/addiction to pain medicine. I’m pretty sure they haven’t been drinking, but they both seem really spaced out on meds, but I don’t know specifically what kind. My friend came over (whose parents also are recovering alcoholics) and asked if my dad had been drinking (it was 8:45 am). My dads speech as been slurred and he seems out of it since I got home, about 2 weeks ago. My mom has been seemingly high on something for about 3 days since she had a major panic attack. 

I don’t really know what to do in this situation. I love my parents so much, but I also know from years of this kind of thing they won’t stop if I just talk to them. The thing is, is this something to even worry about? They are retired, so they’re not missing work, but I worry about their health. The awful thing is, I know when it comes down to it I just don’t like them being zombies all the time. 

My parents are both smart and kind and funny when they’re sober, but when they’re high or on whatever medicine they’re taking they’re 100% different.

475,"Why do I feel I make others so uncomfortable? My anxiety leaves me without a steady stream of thoughts to jab into conversations with others, like I feel most people have ( and also makes people more comfortable ) unless I’m on a substance of sorts but even then that’s not an 100% be all. I recognize I lack confidence but at the same time I can stare at myself in the mirror for any given amount of time in very vain way. I also know I have very little to offer to others from overall lack of involvement, mainly because I am somewhat afraid but the commentary that I do actually have in my head ,when I’m not completely depressed ( more so when I am by myself ) is in my favor, I’m the best. It’s not until I am around others the facade is shattered and I’m left broken and unsure, almost in disgust.  

I have no idea how to work any of this out, petty much all problems have solutions but it seems every time I’m around others I’m seeking common ground, to some extent, and that the only place I know to start is  “ Hey, I’m uncomfortable, I don’t know what I’m doing “ it may be my tone or body language but I know it comes off as negative and I know this because I’ve been told plenty I need to stop being such a cynic. Also after while everyone knows what to expect from me and they become disinterested( as they should ). And on top of it all I feel like less of a man because of it, rarely do I meet other people, much less other men that are willing to talk about there thoughts and emotions. I’ve even gone to a therapist to talk about all of this and in his exact words I got “ You need to grow a pair.”

It’s gotten to a point that I feel it almost effects my sexuality in a way. I know I’m not attracted to the same sex but something about it all bothers me. I’ve had several relationships and a few girls I can say I truly loved, one relationship lasting two years which ended with me cheating; I wasn’t confident in myself and suspected she would cheat given the chance so I try to beat her to the punch, come to find out she thought I hung the moon and loved me with everything. I’m 6’1” 180 lbs and what most would consider an above average looking guy ( not saying this to boast just trying to be truthful to myself ) and in the past 3 1/2 years I’ve almost completely lost the ability to actually talk to women to the point I avoid it. All the while I picked up a couple addictions, mostly to opiates. 

I know most would read this would probably say “ Oh, you’re clearly just overthinking everything “ and I know it probably seems as such but I really just wanted to try to harvest everything that troubles in hopes someone could have advice or words from experience. I really am just dying for a human connection at this point and suicide has been/ is thoroughly considered on my dark days. I can tell it’s disrupted my family dynamic and they do not know how to approach me anymore and I feel are beginning to become very standoffish.

Background Info: My mother had me when she’s was 15 my father was 22. When I was around 4 he joined the military to avoid some kind criminal charges and never had any real contact with him after that, so no prominent father figure around during development ages beside an abuse step-father who was around for about 10 years whom I feared, substantially. My mother has always had a young spirt and has always been more of a friend rather than a mother figure. I don’t respect her as a normal person would respect their mom. Even though I always wanted to. ( I do not trust her and unable to talk to her about my problems because lack of trust ) Even though I was a kind kid I never really excelled in school and had trouble keeping long lasting friendships or having any real meaningful connections in general. Maybe I have extremely high functioning autism? To the point somedays it doesn’t even exist? 

I want to tell somebody all of this and express how I feel but I also understand how emotionally and mentally draining that is for people who don’t directly deal with things as such and even those that do. I’m lost and feel hopeless and not currently not getting high because I do want to get better because I feel it’s possible. But everyday it seems like suicide makes more and more sense and it scares me. ",13Aug2018,1

484,"I’m still fired up about this, this fight happened last night. My grammar is going to be messy... 

Me and my girlfriend have been in a stable relationship for the past 5 years, with the exception of this past year. Meaning we’re dating 6 years, if we’re going to round. 

Our relationship took a weird turn this past year when my girlfriend and I had disagreements with our future careers, she wants to accept a job at a major hospital in state, but wants me to give up the family business to put it simply, it’s more complicated than that. 

I found out she was cheating on me because some guy was texting her all sorts of stupid lovey shit. It turns out she’s now ghosting the guy, but he’s still texting her. I asked her about this and she got defensive for a while, and admitted that she did this because she was under stress and wasn’t thinking straight. It basically started with her hanging with her friends and they pushed her into dancing with a guy, and then swapping numbers and making out at the bars. 

As far as me and her right now, she’s telling me she fucked up, but she’s trying to convince me to stay with her so we can fix the relationship. I was so fired up when she was trying to comfort me, by putting hands on me, that I did something I shouldn’t have. I pushed her out of my way just enough to move her, so I could start packing my things from her house. 

She was pretty much wrecked that I was doing something so rash like this. She started crying her ass off in a way I’ve never really seen before. I didn’t even bother differentiating between clothes, I just threw everything in my big travel case and was gone at 12:30 in the morning. 

I’m currently checked in at a motel I didn’t use any joint accounts of ours, and I plan on staying a couple days here, we’re not in the same town anymore. I’m 2 and half hours away, watching TV, she won’t be able to track me. 

She’s been texting me, telling me she’s going to file a missing person report with the police if I don’t respond, I would let her go ahead and do it, but she’s got a description of my car and the LP number. The police would only have to pass by the parking, and they’d see my car and report me. 

I can’t decide whether to end the relationship, or not, I don’t know... I feel like she’s seen her errors, and tried to correct them, but on the other hand, I’m seriously hurt. I don’t know if the same thing will happen again. I just really want to try and stay away to make her come under the impression that she didn’t know how good she had it with me. 

Bonus question: if I turned tracking on Snapchat off, will she still be able to track me on the map at all?

485,"Idk if this belongs here but my dog is 14 years old and a cocker spaniel female. That’s one more year than the average life expectancy of her breed. She’s been suffering and in pain lately (past 2 months) so we made an appointment for last Friday but all throughout Tuesday-Friday she was much better and happier and stopped whining and yelping so I canceled the appointment. But Saturday morning my mom told me she’s violently whining and yelping so I called the animal hospital to make an appointment for Monday. 3 hours ago I had her sedated euthanized and cremated. My husband and I fed her hot dog weenies, wet food, candy bars and the vet gave her baby food at the animal hospital. The vet was kind of pushy suggesting her cancer and other ailments were treatable but I felt as if it would be cruel to MAYBE take away half the pain with meds and keep her alive until she is absolutely miserable and suffering even more. I’m supposed to nanny a 2 year old from 7:25 am-5:30 pm tomorrow but called the dad just now to cancel because I’m positive I won’t feel up to being bubbly and energetic for a toddler. Am I being overdramatic? I don’t think I am as she was family to me but I really don’t know. I called the dad of the child I nanny to explain and he said he understood but that he would have to call out of work. He was nice about it but I feel kind of guilty and like maybe I should just suck it up and go. ",13Aug2018,1

487,"## So this is my first post on Reddit so sorry if I’m not doing this right! I’d really like to lose my virginity but am afraid I might repulse the guy if I’m not clean shaven. I’ve never been one to shave all over and I just think it’s uncomfortable. All my (girl) friends, however, tell me to completely shave. But I’m not huge on planning anything out and don’t want to completely shave ALL the time. Is it gross to most guys if there’s hair? Thanks for your response.",13Aug2018,1
488,"This will be a long one and I want to apologiese for my spelling and grammar because I'm dyslexic. This is taking alot to write so please forgive me for not wanting to read over it and correct mistakes.

The first time I was aware my Dad was watching porn was when I was as young as 10. I would walk in the room and he would quickly ex out of a tab or turn his moniter off. I always felt weird about it and pretended not to know mainly because I never explicitly saw the porn in detail, just a glance. And I never saw him touching himself from what I remember. The first time I remember being aware that something was wrong was when I walked in the room and he exed out a picture of a blond toddler (it was not pornographic) but I knew this something was wrong because his reaction was the same when he was watching porn. For a few years it was always on the back of my mind but I managed to ignore it and convince myself he'd not a pedophile. For those years I often saw glimpses of pictures of children or porn on his computer but continued to ignore it. When I was 13 I became interested in gaming and at this point my dad had built a gaming pc because he was a gamer aswell. He got me into gaming and I loved it. Throughout this time (I was 13-16) I would get up early in the mornings and play games. Often times I would have no problems but sometimes he got clumsy and accidently left some files open. I never went searching because I was scared of what I'd find but obviously I couldn't ignore things right there. On those times they weren't images but names on file and video files that were obviously child porn. I would just ignore them. One time it got very scary. I remember one morning I went to play video games on the pc and when it turned on there were a few images open of very young boys and they were very explicit. There were a few files open with what I could see 100s of photos (I didn't go scrolling but the scroll bar was tiny). I quickly exxed everything out and booted up my game. My stomach dropped as I heared my dad running quickly into the room looking panicked. He asked me to get off the pc because he needed to do something (He obviously realised he left stuff open). I remember feeling so sick but played dumb. I just complained about having to ex my game out. From that moment on I ignored everything; the porn, the tissues from the night before left out, the fact that I felt like I couldn't touch his keyboard and mouse. I grew up with OCD and this just fueled to it. I felt so disgusted by touching his pc of any of his belongings. My parents got divorced (unrelated) and now I live with my mam and have been for a year and a half. I rarely visit my Dad and avoid it at all costs. As far as I know nobody knows except me. It makes sense since I was the only one to use his pc. I also know he's secretly gay as I found adult male porn aswell on one occasion. I'm scared he's victimizing kids, I'm scared my sisters or I were abused. I don't clearly remember being abused but I remember small things here and there that should not have happened. I'm not sure if I was abused or if I just don't want to remember. I know I should have told someone when I saw his childporn but I was a kid and I was scared. But now I'm 18, I'm an adult and I feel like I should tell police. I don't know how and I don't want anyone knowing it was me who told. I don't want to be selfish but I was raped a few weeks ago by a friend and I'm chronically ill so I don't think I can take on anymore stress. I love my Dad and I always will but I can't keep thins secret anymore.",13Aug2018,4
489,"Backstory... I would really like a cheapish laptop to play World of Warcraft on while I'm in the hospital. I was wondering if makig a gofundme for this would be over the top entitled. I don't know that I could bring myself to share it on my facebook, because frankly, I'd feel a bit ashamed.   


 I have a lot of medical problems - been in the hospital over a dozen times since Janurary. I've been on life support a lot, and the intubations have severely damaged my trachea. I just got out of the ICU after a tracheal stent was placed to hold me over to have tracheal resection - they're going to be removing a portion of my windpipe. The underlying condition causing me to need to be intubated (myasthenia gravis) is not curable, and is very likely to flare while I'm in the hospital. The doctor said a minimum of a week in the hospital after the surgery, possibly more, and at least a few days on the ventilator. I'm highly tolerant to sedatives and narcotic pain meds, so I'm going to be awake and in a world of pain - and unable to speak while on the vent. And will have trouble speaking after due to the T-Tube that will be put in. If I don't end up with an emergency tracheostomy. The laptop would help me communicate - type messages - a lot easier and faster than on my phone - to tell the nurses and people what I need, but mainly so I can play video games to try to distract myself because I'm going to be in tons of pain.  


The reality is, the underlying issue that has been putting me on life support isn't going away. So far, it isn't getting better. Can't work, can't even take care of myself. I'm in the hospital usually about half the month every month. It gets really boring and I get depressed. But I don't have the money for a laptop - I can't work, obviously. I'm only 29 and frankly, with all my health issues, I don't know how much longer I'll be alive at this point. But it would be nice to find a little comfort when I'm in the hospital. I don't have much family so I'm usually there in the ICU on ventilators all by myself, no visitors. It's scary.   


But it feels like complete begging. For a laptop. I don't HAVE to have a laptop. No one HAS to. It's not like I'm homeless. Is this asking too much? It would improve my quality of life when I'm in the hospital but it's not a required thing. I'm just really down because I do not want to do this surgery, it's going to be so painful, but the doc said it's that, permanent trach, or I'll die shortly without treatment because my case is very severe. I thought maybe this would help me deal - at least with the actual 1 week+ after when I'm in the hospital. ",13Aug2018,3

493,"Hey everyone, I'm an 18 year old male that can't give up on someone who doesn't love me back. Let me get you up to situation.

For the past year and half of the previous year, I was going out with a group of people who, in most part (not all of them), were extremely toxic towards me, I was legit suffering everyday because I couldn't let them go because I didn't wanted to be alone. Never the less at the time I also fell in love with a toxic person, he was also another male but he was cruel to me when I actually confessed that I loved him. That cruelty is what pulled me away and made me ""stop"" loving him. 

Time went on through out the year and I still was going out with this toxic group (keep in mind there were a few participants who were really nice to me, but I let the toxic people beat me). Then when my summer holiday started, I met someone else who had a similar experience that I did. At first I just thought he's just another guy and I didn't really give much care towards him ,but as time went on, he was super nice to me and because of my previous experience I thought I pittied him. But I was wrong, he did really care about what I said and what was going with me. So I told him my previous experience and how I felt awful all the time, he made me feel so much better with his advice and then he got a bit confident and started to talk to me about his ex-gf and how she left him for another woman. 

At this moment I started to fall in love all over again, and especially when he said ""I hope if I find some guy or woman, he won't be  a fucking fool"" so that meant that he was bi-sexual, just as me.

So we played videogames together and we laughed and everytime there was a problem he was always there for me. Which made me love him more and more. 

Then came the time when I said ""fuck it"" and I confessed to him that I loved him. He said he wasn't ready for another relationship and he didn't like me that way, but he was mind open to it and said ""its okay, we can't choose who we love"". I felt really bad about that but at the same time I didn't. That phrase made me love him even more, even though I knew that what I wanted will never happen. So time went on, the same as before, he still really cared about me and so on, I tried to not to love him but I cannot do it, he is just the sweetest thing, there is no reason for me to hate him or get away from him , he brings joy to my heart aswell as pain because I know I will never be with him.

Now this evening I confessed once again, this time a few friend helped me with the situation and I asked him to block communication with me on aplication such as Whatssap because I knew I needed some away time from him. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate him I just (even though it hurts so much) need someway to cut a bit of communication just to get myself straight. 

So even though I have done all of this I still feel an existencial dread inside of me, he is like a drug for me, It feels really painful for me and I don't know what to do.

Am I doing the right thing? My heart is absolutely shreaded , even though he didn't do anything wrong.

Thanks for the help in advance.

PD: The last 2 weeks or so he has been a bit weird, he doesn't place his little hearts emojis has he used to or tell me to call him what ever the problem but I think its just in my mind.",13Aug2018,1
