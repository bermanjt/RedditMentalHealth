0,"I'm almost 18 years old. I work as a grocery store clerk. My job includes bagging, bottle machines  (changing bins, fixing them), retrieving carts, stocking milk &amp; bananas, cleaning up sometimes, and just other odd jobs.

I think I do pretty well. It's been extremely hot where I live so carts aren't my favorite but I suck it up and do it anyways. I keep up fairly well. My managers are all good with me except one female manager who continuously tells me ""it's a man's job"" ""it's only going to get harder in the winter"" ""once you're 18 we gotta get you on a register"" I don't like her to say the least.

I had a an older woman customer come at me simply for telling her I couldn't write a rain check and that's something the cashier or manager has to do. She told me that I don't like working and that if I.was a good employee I'd do it. I ended up getting the manager because of her attitude. My manager who is also a plder woman ended up laughing it up with the woman and told her that work isn't new to them like it is me. 

It was 95 outside and I had no help getting carts. They refuse to schedule two clerks. I genuinely tried my best. The bottle machines are always giving out issues because they clearly need mantience. Other coworkers just give me the odd jobs they don't wanna do. Sunday, while getting carts they came out to get me so I could a firefighter take hundreds of dollars of drinks to his truck instead of.someone doing it. They knew I was busy but they didn't wanna go outside. I was so pissed after the incident with the customer I ended up crying in front of my manager after she told me for the 20th time that it's a man's job despite me keeping up fine. I outwork the majority of the men in that buidling, may I add.  Anyways, after seeing me in tears she just told me ""it's ok hun! It'll be ok"" she knows how rude she comes off. Just a few weeks ago she told me that she may come off mean but it's just her tone. Lol but no.

Customers like me.  After one saw how my manager was acting one time the guy said ""you're doing fine babe! I could never work here. I hate people like her."" So I'm not the only one who sees it. 

Anyways, this isn't a permanent job for me. As much as it may be viewed as a man's job I'm up for a challenge. I don't know what to do with this manager but the good thing she is only the night manager. The bad thing is I usually just work evenings. Lol.

How to deal with her? How to prove I'm fully capable? How can I defend myself without getting fired? I'm a outspoken person but have kept quiet because I'm not trying to get fired. Haha. 

I might ask the day manager (she likes me I think, she hired me on the spot) if she can schedule me for days more. I just don't know at this point. ",20Jun2018,5
1,"So there’s this REALLY cute girl in my class. She’s super thick too and she’s just really hot. She’s kinda short too. But she’s got a really bad attitude and she’s lazy and I feel like if I had sex with her she’d wanna date me and I’m not ready for dating. 

I just wanna kinda “hit and quit” but I think she’ll latch on you know? In your experience, or opinion, how do you stop a girl from latching onto you post sex. ",20Jun2018,0
2,"I just moved into a really cool condo after living in an apt. directly behind a train on the 1st floor. I love my new space. It's about twice the size and the same price. Muuuch quieter too.


The only issue is my downstairs neighbors. At 4:30am today, I woke up to what sounded like fireworks right outside. I could hear my neighbors laughing downstairs. Probably on drugs or drunk or both. There are a lot of people who filter in an out of there, so I'm not exactly sure who lives there. The firework noise went off at least 3 times followed by lots of laughing.


As I was cleaning my patio today, I noticed a joint with a mouthpiece on it on my patio. Not mine. I heard my neighbor sweeping earlier, and I think he/she must have tossed it up onto my balcony because my other neighbors aren't home, and it wasn't there this morning. Irritating, and I'm not sure why they would do that.


Also, I get awkward looks from these two crackhead-looking men while I'm walking to and from my car sometimes. They were blocking the stairwell more than a couple times, and I say hello out of politeness, and they look me up and down, and it makes me sick. They look like the previous tenants who were talking and cursing loudly in the parking lot more than a few times.


The previous downstairs tenants moved out about a month after I moved in. They smoked a lot of cigarettes and were pretty noisy too with lots of crap blocking the stairwell, so I was happy to see them go, but it seems like the new neighbors are basically the same people. I won't be here for more than 2 years though, and by then I'll be able to afford a house rental where I'm less likely to have neighbor issues. 


Does anyone have advice for steering clear of bad neighbors?",20Jun2018,3
3,"First i want to say i understand he has an aweful past which is partly the reason im so conflicted. 
Is it dumb of me to be feeling this sad over xxxtentacions death? I have never cared for a celebrity death, ever. But as stupid as it sounds this kid changed my life, not through his music but through his actions and instagram live videos. He made me feel human again, made me feel like i actually belong in this world just as much as anyone else. When i watched him on live it felt like he was my friend (i dont have any friends). I really hoped to meet him in person one day as everyone ive seen says hes completely down to earth ive even watched videos of him where he zones everything out and just has 1 on 1 heartfelt conversations with fans like theyre his true friends. His death has left a huge hole in my heart and i dont know if its reasonable for me to feel like this or if im being stupid",20Jun2018,0
4,"I met a girl online and she's from another country. I met her on a language learning app, as I tried to learn Norwegian by communicating to someone who's from Norway. We talked a lot for a couple of days on the app. We talked more in English, than Norwegian but that doesn't matter. After a few days I asked her if I can get her Facebook and she gave it to me. We continued our communication on Facebook and she told me some few things about herself, as I did tell her some things about myself. She told me, that she was depressed for a few years and that she hurt herself many times. She said that talking to me is helping her. I started to like her even though I didn't know her in real life. However we started talking less because I had (still have actually) a summer job at a café bar, and that is wasting a lot of my free time. A few days ago I messaged her (said 'Heyyy') and she told me that we should stop talking and that I shouldn't take it personal. I was like 'Are you sure?', 'What's the problem?', 'Did I do something wrong?' etc. She told me she was sure and already thought about it. About doing something wrong - she said I did nothing wrong. After a couple of minutes of me trying to find what the problem was (because I was stunned from the message), she blocked me on both Facebook and Snapchat.

My question is: What should I do?
I really like the girl. Probably the nicest girl I've met since God-knows when. Should I try and talk to her again or just leave it be? If yes what should I say to her?

P.S: I'm sure that the reason of her wanting to 'remove' me from her life was depression, and maybe she felt pathetic those days. I've let the thing chill for a couple of days (5 days I think) and didn't spam her with messages. Please help me. I hate losing someone I like, even though I didn't know her in real life. I was hoping one day that I would've met her.",20Jun2018,0
5,"I've been depressed for a very long time now, fighting it with varying efficiency, I've often turned to alcohol during past years, but now I'm trying to climb out of this pit for good. The only person I really have social interactions with is my childhood friend, who is a complete opposite in many ways, a very sociable guy who drinks a lot.
I haven't talked to anyone except cashiers for four days now, but I know that if I call him and we go out together we'll end up getting drunk. How do you think I could handle this situation?",20Jun2018,1
6,"So here is the situation. My paralegal does good work and really does a lot to help with my cases. I made a deal with him that I would give him $100 for every positive review he's able to get from a client after the case closes. The firm pays me a $400 bonus for each one I get and I told him I'd give him 25% but he has to go out and ask the client for it.

He never does. Instead, I end up having to ask the client (we have quarterly deadlines so I have to ask in the same quarter the client's case ends or I don't qualify for the bonus) which really annoys me because I hate asking for reviews...it bugs me.

So now I've had a few clients leave nice reviews and I know that my paralegal has done really good work on the cases but I had to be the one to ask for the review. Should I still pay him $100 for each review? I'll acknowledge that part of the reason I get good reviews are because of the good work that he does.

Also, none of the other attorneys in the firm give bonuses to their paralegals for reviews and the other paralegal I work with jumps at the chance to send out review requests if we have a case together and I pay her out every quarter.",20Jun2018,1
7,"This feeling started when I blacked out this last Saturday. My friends and I had a great time but I don’t remember half of it. From the sounds of it, we had a great time. 
I met a girl that night and somehow got her number despite being obliterated. We hung out at the beach Sunday and drank and talked for the day. I learned a lot about her and she’s had a pretty messed up past. She’s visiting a friend and isn’t welcome to stay with friend because of some things she said while she was blacked out.
I let her borrow my new truck and it got a dent/scratch that she got fixed and admitted to. Now I’ve gone and bought a flight for us.  (I was originally going by myself)
I don’t know why I’m doing this other than she’s interesting and that I think should try and be something positive for her at this time. 
Do I need to stop what I’m doing and evaluate my life a lot?? Or just roll with it??",20Jun2018,2

12,I’ve been working in a “teaching” position for about a month now and I still can’t seem to shake the feeling that I’m not doing things right.

13,"I went through a break up in which my ex told me he no longer felt sexually attracted to me. Sex is an important aspect of a relationship to me and I am in general a quite sexual being so hearing this was devastating.

Since then, I've been tindering and it's really easy to get the validation I feel like I need bcus pretty much every guy is DTF. So it makes me feel wanted and sexy and attractive when they show interest like that. Recently I've become more aware that this isn't quite the best way to go about things or really deal with the emotional damage to my confidence my break up caused me.

So does anyone have any advice on how I can be okay with just my own validation instead of hunting around for it on a dumb app?",20Jun2018,1
14,"I don't even know how to start. 

My sister went to go ride her horse today, and suddenly she got bucked off, luckily she was wearing her helmet and back brace and was riding with someone who called the authorities and within 45 minutes she was airlifted to the hospital. Me and my family rushed there and we were told she's had a brain contusion. We were then told that it was minor and it wasn't as bad as they thought, so me and my other sister went home and my mom stayed since they said she would wake up in an hour. They then told us that it is extremely severe and they are fighting for her life, luckily her swelling is going down so the brain damage is likely minimal, and they are taking great care of her, but they've put her into medically induced coma until this Friday. 

I love my sister so much and I have no idea how to handle this, I'm a mess and I can't imagine living without her, it was such a sudden and rapid shock I have no idea how to deal with it. I feel like until Friday when they try to wake her up I'm going to be living in hell, and I feel selfish for it.

I was wondering if any of you have any advice on how to deal with these kinds of situations or how to handle my emotions until Friday, I feel like I won't be able to eat, drink or think about anything else until we see if she wakes up, and I'm desperate for any advice that may help me and my family cope. We are allowed to visit her so I'll most likely try and do so every day.

Thank you so much for reading it really means a lot!

15,"I've been using a really crappy Asus laptop for the past two years, and I finally saved up enough to get something better. I bought a Microsoft Surface, but immediately hated how it limits its users to only using apps from the Microsoft store, plus it signed me up for Skype without me asking. 

What I'm looking for: something with the ability to use Google Chrome, Gimp, and Office 365 (windows 10 is fine), has at minimum 2 USB ports, a cd drive, and SD card reader, decent photo/video storage and editing capabilities, and speedy processing.

I will not buy another Asus, and I'm too cheap for a Mac. I'm not looking for something too too cheap, I'd like it to be a decent laptop, but not looking to spend much over 1000.

17,"So, as my username and total allude to, i'm severely depressed. Enough so that i've been actively suicidal for the past six months, had attempt after attempt, hospitalization after hospitalization. And that's not going to change. And i'm kind of saying this now just to ask that you guys can spare me the generic advice, suicidal hotline referral, etc. I've tried it, tried anti-depressants, therapy, everything. Nothing works, and at this point i've accepted that i'm probably going to die by suicide and I actually have a plan to successfully do it in August. I have a job this summer and i'm saving up to purchase a safe, high rate of success method. And that's actually part of my dilemma. 

I believe my depression and mental illness has manifested in toxicity for my friendships and relationships. I've never actively or even passively tried to be a bad person, do shitty things, or hurt people... but the fact that I hate my life and circumstances has caused my actions to come across that way. In December, I lost my best friend in the entire world because my depression caused me to form a dependency on him, and he just couldn't handle it and gave up on me. I don't blame him for that. I'm a piece of shit and he deserves better than me. I shared with him my dark ass thoughts and I thought maybe that was going to help me get better, but in actuality, all it did was weigh down on his mental health. And that's unfair of me to do. And since then, despite me realizing how shitty I am, things really haven't changed in terms of me being just a negative leech to my other friends. I've lost alot of other friends over the past few months, but some have stuck by me. And I am incredibly grateful for that. But something i've come to realize is that every single one of them deserves better. At this point, despite how much they love me, I feel like i'm a ticking time bomb. I can have good days, but eventually, something happens to push me over the edge and they get a call that i'm in a hospital because I tried to kill myself again. I feel terrible everytime I hear them say they worry. And that they wish I didn't feel like this. I feel terrible everytime I realize that my suicidal actions are selfish. And I don't want to hurt them. One of my friends actually told me that she thinks it's so unfair of me to have to put her through all the worry and stress of wondering how i'm doing and if i'm gonna try to kill myself again. And she's right. I'm a terrible person for all fo these attempts and she just doesn't deserve to have such a shitty ""friend"" as me. I don't want to hurt her anymore.  I don't want to hurt anyone.

And so my solution for her - and a bunch of the other people who have somehow miraculously stood by me - is to push them away. I haven't talked to any of my friends in weeks. I've blocked their numbers, deleted my social media, and removed any and all contact from my friends for their own sake. I don't want to be such a shitty person and have them care about someone who doesn't even care about himself... but what's so conflicting to me is how I feel like this action of mine may just be exacerbating it... and I don't want to do that.

The fact of the matter is that **I do not want to be alive.** I hate my life, I hate my past, I hate my future, I hate my self. I just don't want to be here, and I wish I could just press a button that made it so that I was never here at all. That way my mom won't have to be sad that i'm gone, that way my friends won't have to be sad, etc. But I can't. I'm stuck here in this shitty existence. And so my only option out of this pain and shit i'm feeling is suicide. But my friends don't deserve someone like that in their life. I love them so much... but I clearly don't love them enough to want to stay alive enough for them. But still, i'm a conflict because I don't want my ex communication of them to make things worse. 

So basically my question here is what should I do? Should I keep ignoring my friends? Will things be better for them for when I do kill myself if I just isolate now? Or should I continue to just be a shitty friend by sharing with them my depressed negative feelings?

I feel so trapped because something tells me depe down that i'm gonna just kill myself anyway, so I don't want to waste my friends time and emotional energy and have them worry about me.

I really don't know if this is a good kind of advice to ask for but here I am...

One of my closest friends birthday's is today... and I want to tell her happy birthday because I love her. But I don't want to do that, go ghost again, and have her find out i'm dead in a couple months. I love my friends so much and I am so grateful and they mean the world to me.... but the problem is that I don't love myself or them enough to keep staying alive for them.",20Jun2018,1

I got my paystub on Monday and she has me at $12. I feel like I deserve more, still, and I feel like I should be paid more for being expected to do this administrative work on top of it.

22,"Hi, I’m 18 and recently got accepted into a job I really dislike. It’s roofing, hard labor, long hours (9+ for 6 days a week) and something I don’t see progressing with. My uncle is one of the people who runs the business and he was the one who recommended me. 

Thus being said there is a very high opportunity along with it and a nice amount of pay(average roofs 14.50 an hour, government roofs 30 an hour. 600-1300 per week.Something you don’t see in every day jobs for an 18 y/o). 

It’s just not the job for me for I am a very small guy and very tough, I pass out after 4-5 hours and I feel humiliated when everybody else is going on strong. Parents won’t let me quit because they need me to have this money more than I do. 

The only way I can get out of this job is if I can find another good job or I get fired which seems to be coming pretty soon. 

Reasons to stay:
- High paying
- build muscle
- get a nice tan ;)
- High opportunity to go higher in the company

Reasons to leave(for me):
- Cannot bond well with other coworkers(they don’t speak English very well nor are they even close to around age)
- I get easily exhausted 
- No time with girlfriend and friends 
- I barely make it through work or I don’t*** (embarrassed by the fact)
- Just graduated high school, need to focus on college 
- I don’t want to continue.

So if I leave to a low paying job then no one will be happy, 
Something I want to do: 
- Gain friendships with coworkers
- work with people my age
- I’d like to travel
- Technology related
- I like clothes, music, and photography
- I want to also learn 
- projects
- Have time for family and friends
- Want to move up in the company

Stuff I don’t want to do: 
- Be glued to one area
- don’t want to be exhausted and to hate my job
- Work in retail or fast food
- Work for Minimum wage...

30,"Last year’s state games, our soccer team decided to compete in the “serious” soccer event. We made it to the finals in the event, but got robbed when I was about to score, and the defender made a sliding tackle into me, and not the ball. 

We ended up losing 1-0, and after our medal ceremony, I ended up tossing my silver medal in the nearest dumpster. A games official saw me do this, and reported it to the governing body. He also returned the medal to me, and gave me a quick lecture on why I shouldn’t do that. 

Fast forward to now, I got notified by the state game’s governing body, and was told that my silver medal has been stripped, and that I need to return it by the first week of September. Apparently this wasn’t a big priority of theirs if it took this long...

35,"Hi everyone,

I thought I had a handle on being able to ignore people who were toxic in my life, basically by being comfortable in myself and knowing that I'm doing just fine without. I occasionally see some of these people through mutual friends and this past weekend while at a party this toxic person was acting very violent and aggressive towards me. I shook it off and went about my night.

Just today this person was being insensitive about a public topic in a group chat. When I got a little worked up about it they went off about how I should take a step back and look at myself compared to the other people reacting in the chat. I know comparisons between people are a weak argument to stand on, but it really annoyed me. This person was telling me to relax, while just this past weekend they were tossing me (easily half their size) around for literally no apparent reason other than me saying, 'Hey, what's up?'.

Instinctively, I wanted to respond to the person in chat by retorting about out past incident, but I decided to just not say anything.

What's bothering me is that even though I feel fine myself, this person's words made me feel vulnerable (I guess is the right sense) and hurt. Almost as if they are trying to get a rise out of me.

39,"Most agents that I know of simply rent out the property and let residents settle issues on their own.

Mine is taking a very strange interest in the property. For example, if my housemate complains about ""water on the kitchen counter"" or ""stains on the kitchen floor"", the agent personally intervenes and demands that it be cleaned up immediately. Said housemate never talks to any other residents about this and will immediately go to the agent to file a complaint.

Im pretty sure that most agents would tell her to deal with it on her own, but mine doesn't for some reason. And she's the head of the real estate agency so there isn't anyone higher up.

My mother expects the house to be perfect. I'm not a super clean person, at least not to her extent. I'll leave dishes sometimes on the table or cereal boxes, etc. I know I should pick these up. It is 100% my fault.

The issue is, my mom gets really angry about these things. I know the solution is to pick up after myself, but the other problem is how to deal with her anger.

She blows up insanely fast. She doesn't think she does. I try to be rational and talk to her in my regular voice. She likes to shout and call me names. ""You little fucking lying piece of shit"". ""fucking little fucking fucker"" ""you're a horrible person and I can only imagine what you will grow up to be like"" ""You're just like you're dad"" ""fuck you! fuck you! fuck you! fuck you!""

My name is Richard, I am 26 years old recently honorably discharged from the USN due to physical disabilities. I have no degrees no post high school education only a deep interest and passion for psychology. My only concern being that if I were to go this route, from what I have gathered, it will take roughly 8-12 years of schooling leaving me in my mid 30's by the time I graduate and enter the work force ( I see it as a potential problem maybe it's not). Paying for the schooling is a not an issue, due to the trade deal I made with Uncle Sam for my leg. I have no problems with hard work and studying really my only concern with it is my age.

I guess what I'm asking is am I too old to focus on this degree just to end up new to the field at the ripe age of 35. Or is age just a number as they say and since I am serious about it I should just go for it even though I would be, generally, 8 years behind my peers in the field.",20Jun2018,1
54,"I work for a financial credit card in customer service. I joined about 8 months ago and has only started out part time and you have to meet certain stats twice in a row in two months in a row to get full time.

So how it works is that we have to meet an average of 60% or higher on dollars and we have to average an 8 or better on our calls that we get listened to. And bloody hell I have been meeting one or the other for the past 8 fucking months but could never be consistent and meet both at the same damn time. 

We get our calls listened to and scored 4 times in a month. 0 being the lowest and 10 being the best score.. Whenever I get a random call listened to by these “experts” it hurts to see that I get scored a 4 or a 6, I’ve rarely gotten at least a nine or even a fucking 10. I’ve talked to my boss and my ‘coaches’ multiple times to help me with what I need to work on but it’s like they can never be consistent and follow up with me. They only listen to my calls that I get scored and I get some improvement but that’s really about it. 

I know my fucking job inside and out it’s just that I can never seem to be consistent on meeting stats and whenever I see that my scores aren’t good enough it hurts because I can’t be qualified for full time and be qualified for the many benefits I get working there alone.

60,"I'm 20 years old and went to college to study film for two years. With each semester I lost more and more motivation as I realized that a) I absolutely despised school (not a new realization, really, since it's been true my whole life), and b) I didn't want to work in the film industry, but rather in music production. With each semester I got more and more D's and C's.

I began thinking about dropping out my first semester of my freshman year... finally, the spring of my sophomore year, I raised the question to my parents. Surprisingly, they said that they would support me and help me pursue my two main goals: become financially independent, and have a sense of purpose/meaning in life. For years I haven't had either and that has caused me to often be depressed.

It's been a couple months since my classes ended and I've been working on music production (releasing songs and making plans to collaborate with others) and applied to a few jobs in food/retail. I finally got hired to a Starbucks yesterday but it will probably take a few weeks to get a training scheduled.

Meanwhile, I've noticed that so many of the adults that I tell about my decision react extremely negatively and start trying to convince me to go back to school. This happens with so many middle aged people when I casually mention that I dropped out of school. So many Uber drivers ask me if I'm a student, then act judgmental when I tell them I decided that college wasn't personally worth it for me for a range of reasons. My temporary airbnb host keeps telling me that I'll barely be able to make any money without a degree, even when I tell her that I'm willing to work hard to attain success in my life. I've argued with her a little, but I try to be polite and avoid conflict since she is hosting me in her home for the next few weeks until I can find an apartment.

My self-confidence is starting to get beaten down by all these older adults urging me to go back to college. I would rather do almost anything than go back to school, but the way these people talk, they make it sound like I'm dooming myself to a life of failure and destitution. Initially I was confident and committed to working hard and making a path for myself, but this consistent feedback from others is starting to scare me.

Should I try to ignore these interactions and not let them get to me, or are they right that I'm setting myself up to make very little money?

65,"I apologize in advance for probably sounding so naive and dumb.

So I am 21 and will be going back to school to study accounting this September. I slacked off majorly after highschool and don't have anything to show on my resume.

I realized that my resume is empty in February so I got a job at a call center doing customer service in March for a cable company. I thought I would challenge myself with this kind of work and improve speaking skills, etc. And I can also have 6 months of experience on my resume working an actual job at a legit company.

Well, long story short is that this job is literally driving me crazy. I've endured the last month telling myself that I will quit on the first week of August so I can at least list ""March - August"" on my resume. It's still not even July yet and I think I will implode if I try to survive working here any longer. Nothing has never made me any more angry and upset than this job.

I am thinking of giving in my two weeks notice. So I will have ""March - July"" for this job on my resume.

A part of me thinks that I should just stick it out to August because I've already done this much and I think ""six months"" carries more weight than five. Another part of me thinks that I should quit because I am probably 99.99% overthinking it and no accounting recruiter will even care about my work experience at a call center and how it was 5 months vs 6 months. But the fact that I have nothing on my resume worries me a bit. I have slight anxiety and tend to overthink stuff like this so I need a third opinion from people who actually know how the accounting world works.

Does any of this actually matter? Will working until August and having ""March-August"" on my resume for a completely non-accounting related job before I start school actually worth suffering the next month hating myself and the world than just having ""March-July"" on my resume? Will a recruiter or interviewer be like ""Hmm, why did this person quit in July. Is he lazy? Wait. What did he do before this job then?""",20Jun2018,1

I had an immense liking towards this University and I soon had it as my #1 Choice. Come November 5th, 2017, I got my letter of acceptance. I had applied early decision and that made my acceptance binding, despite it being circumstantial. Nine days later, I was sat next to the girl I would soon come to love. 

I'm a bit of a high school loser, I hadn't had my first kiss and I was only friends with a few people. Don't let this fool you, I am very outgoing and a bit of a class clown. Anyways, this girl happened to catch my eye for her beauty and I got so red. I put my head down and didn't say a word. After 9 months of happiness, joy, great memories, strong bonding, and pure love...I made a decision. I want to stay here with her and I want to keep that love alive. I legitimately see a marriage with her, I see her being my wife, I see us as a real thing.

Here's where the problem starts, I haven't told my parents about my decision yet and I leave in 3 days, I have yet to put in my 2-week notice at work, and I have not submitted a transfer request. I know I have to speak to my parents about my feelings as soon as possible but im petrified because I know that they will not approve of my decision. In the event that does take place, my contingency plan is to run away, spend a night in a hotel, miss move-in/check-in day and force their hand into letting me stay. The cool thing about that is, they would realize my dedication to my decision.

\*EXCLAMIER\* I am sorry if this next part comes off as mean, I promise you I do not mean it to be. \*EXCLAMIER\*

I have made my mind on staying so please do not suggest I ""Give it a shot"" or ""Try long distance."" I really need advice as to how to best approach my parents and telling them my feelings, how to prepare for the answer to be no, what to do when the answer is no, and how to solve my problem with enrolling at my local community college.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME, CARE, AND ADVICE! IT DOES NOT GO UNNOTICED!!! :)",20Jun2018,1
79,"I rent a room from two of my friends who were gracious enough to let me live with them after a break up. Something is wrong with the HVAC vent in my room, even though they said it had been fixed. The air blowing is so minimal, you can barely tell the AC is on until you step into the hallway. I have a ceiling fan, a smaller Honeywell and a stand up fan going and it is still so incredibly hot. I split the bills three ways but my friends own the house. They know this is a problem but it’s becoming too much (especially with 90 degree days with 90%+ humidity). My one friend grew up in a house with no AC and I feel like she might just write me off. If I purchase a window unit, our electricity will skyrocket.

80,"I fear living life wrong. Death is going to come, so if I live my life wrong, it's an irreversible mistake, and I will have died (knowing that I?) living my life wrong. 

I fear spending my time wrong because I don't know how to spend it. People say to ""do what you like/makes you happy,"" but if one does not know what that is not matter what they do, then they are stuck. 

I know I am probably thinking wrong about something, but I'm not sure what.

[Response to possible advice that may not be relevant]

Call it meaning or whatever, but whatever answer one gives, it involves that person knowing that they value something. If that person does not know what they value, they are stuck. If one ""creates their own value,"" they have to genuinely value said thing in the first place for whatever reason (how they are brought up). Otherwise, it's not possible. One can't choose to care about something ""just by willing it,"" one most likely already cares about it in the first place, or has an actual reason to care about it. 

Calling it depression dismisses the fact that some people don't value the same things or value in the same way other people do. If one person thinks ""life is stupid,"" you can't convince them by purely saying that ""life isn't stupid."" ]

There is this thing called terror management theory which essentially states how people deny death in various ways, even if they say they know they are going to die.",20Jun2018,1
81,"Our friend (18) gave an alarming message “would you miss me if I died?” and we panicked. We wanted to message stuff like discouraging it and saying that life gets better but he doesn’t believe in that stuff. He thinks saying stuff like that is BS and a waste of his time. Instead of messaging the “BS” stuff, we decided to be real with him and say some truths about life. He retaliated by saying that he already knew that and he just wants to die. We decided to give him space and we haven’t contacted him since.

We talked to his other close friends since he’s not keen on talking to us and asked what all of us can do to help. It seems that word got out of how we were asking these other friends to check on him (off we told them to not mention his situation, we told them to say hi and ask how he’s doing) and now he doesn’t want to talk??  We had to explain to his friends the situation because we couldn’t really put it into words, we really didn’t know what to do ourselves and it’s really hard to understand this friend. We want to understand him more but it’s really taxing us and affecting our mood lately.

We really love this friend and we want to help him out but it seems that he doesn’t want to help himself?? We know it’s hard to pull yourself out of certain mind states and anxiety isn’t something that is easily dealt with but we think it’s about time he acknowledges it since he’s interested in getting better. All of us are about to enter different colleges and have our own problems to deal with, we want to help our friend before we become busy. 

It’s a complicated story but we really want to help out this friend. Any advice?? ",20Jun2018,1

Now I find myself trying to initiate conversation but they often leave me on read and don't respond.

87,"Hi /r/advice , My name is T and my girlfriend's name is S. We both have just graduated our junior year earlier this June and will be upcoming seniors in highschool. We are both 17 and I will be turning 18 this August and she will be turning 18 next January. We have been dating about 3 months and I'm now in a pickle.

My girlfriend's parents had always been a bit overprotective of S because they had lost another child before her and now S is an only child. Yesterday, S met me at my house to hang out for the day. Everything was going well until we had to decide what time she wanted to go back home. We both agreed that 9pm was a good time, and so S asked her parents to be picked up at 9. S's mom replied back with 8:30, so S asked to stay til 9 again nicely by saying please and sad faces. S's mom's reply to that was to call S and yell at her ""not to bargain"". The yelling was enough to make S cry in front of me, which she doesn't do in front of others often.

So here comes 8:30 and S's parents pick S up and drives her home. I text S to tell me when she's home and casually mentioned her mother was a nuthead for yelling that harshly over the phone. S's mother took her phone and read through our text messages, and saw that I called her a nuthead. A phone call followed and S's dad is pissed at me for calling his wife a nuthead, which is understandable. There is also a lot of yelling in the background about S's mom thinking I was controlling S and trying to force S to stay until 9. The phone call hangs up and I write a long text message stating what I thought was right and wrong about this mess with the assumption her parents would take S's phone from her and see it. Her parents just reply I'm a terrible person and a relatively large argument ensued where I basically tried to tell her Mom to respect S's privacy and treat her like she is actually 17, not a child. It lead to S's mom telling me to stay away from S and that S didn't love me anymore and all that nice stuff. She started saying that she didn't want to talk to a child despite being childish herself and me trying to justify why we were both wrong with the things we both did.

I care a lot for S, and don't want to split with her due to this, but at the same time I don't think it is possible for me to get back on good terms with S's parents. They will certainly keep her away from me despite her wanting to see me too. I  can't currently talk to S because her mom still has her phone, and she won't return it to S until July 18th, one month from yesterday. What should I do reddit? I'm lost and need some guidance. Your opinion would be wonderful. Thanks for reading.",20Jun2018,1

Unfortunately some asshole found a bit of money I had saved and took it. It wasn't much (half a months salary of a recent graduate, to give you an idea). I was going to use the money to buy a new phone, so it isn't a big deal. Fortunately I found a job recently so I should be getting some money soon. 

I have a very good idea of who did it, and I want to find out so I can tell them to fuck off and, most importantly, keep my distance from them. But I feel like I should just take the L and move on, with a GOOD lesson learned :)

I figured most youth my age are in college however I decided not to go because I have a solid job working as a machinist for my Dad's small company.  The only regular F2F interaction is with mostly relatives at work and old people at my church.

I thought about church hoping but I enjoy being there even if there isn't people my age. I don't like wild parties so that's out of the question. Idk if it's my generation or what but it's hard to find people my age out and about, it's like everyone just stays home/ goes over to friend's houses. It's kind of hard to start from scratch.

92,"My fiancé and I just had a baby so we can’t take care of his mom; she has a lot of needs we can’t keep up with and include a baby. So while we are going on about our lives, they take care of her until we get back home. 

In the past month she’s gone through 4 different people. All of which seem to have the same issues:
Laziness
Poor attitude 
Annoying habits
And the worst
Stealing. 

We barely have enough money to buy food for just the household family members, let alone for them and their families, but every single one so far has taken mass amounts of food from us. We get food bank food since we didn’t get approved for government assistance. That’s the first thing established when they come, so they should know they are taking from a very poor and young family.

But today topped the cake. 

Today the new girl was given the run down of everyone stealing, ignoring the purpose of their job, and we need someone to show they’re serious because we don’t plan on living here much longer. 

According to my mother-in-law (who is bedridden and only gets the ability to be mobile when her physical therapist comes), this girl offered all of our food to her kids; made pots of coffee; brought her kids with her; left constantly; and she spent hours playing on her phone when my mother in law kept asking her for help doing things.

We called the supervisor over inappropriate actions, but I’m really tired of all of it.

We came home to all of our mail gone though, our computer and Xbox on, food missing from the pantry, and appliances still on. 

I thought we should set up the webcam to see what she does in our living room, but I am more worried about the food loss at this point.
What should we really do?

Like I was thinking about working some temp jobs or another retail chain, but I kinda feel I'm just wasting my time. 

That's not even mentioning that I spend most of my time alone or with my mom or sis of whom I live with. Rarely get to hang with friends and still single (which that loneliness REALLY digs in when I lie on my bed at night). 

I don't know even when I go back that 2nd problem is likely to be there. Not to mention I feel my creative abilities have essentially reached a ""wall"", and that I constantly worry if I'll actually achieve some modicum of success in illustration and writing like I want to.

95,"I know a person who makes life choices that seem bizarre af to me and I wanted to get some insight into what's going on with them. So -

They're 25, they currently work an (almost) min wage job - it gives them free travel benefits, but they don't really use them because they don't have enough money. They rent a room in a house with two guys in their 50s, which they don't really like. They left the marines two years ago, with 10k savings, but stayed out of work for a year, spent their savings, and then got said min wage job. They're qualified for a better job, but they don't want to commit to anything better because they want to go to college. But they're not going back to college this fall - I asked why, and they said they took out a 4k loan for a truck they want to pay back before they go back to college, as they don't want to work part-time when they're there. But on the min wage job, they don't really earn enough money to do that. This really doesn't make sense to me, because the GI Bill would pay enough to cover a small car payment anyway, but they haven't even bothered to find out how much it pays out and to budget it out. They're from the other side of the country, but they stayed here (in a super lame part of the country) for the last 2 years after they got out because it has an airsoft field? I pointed out that, with the GI Bill, they could go anywhere in the country, but they still want to stay here because of the 'potential' they can see in the airsoft field. They don't have any friends here. They get on with their co-workers, but don't see them outside of work. They go to bars alone alot (borderline alcoholic), and play airsoft occasionally, but don't seem to have many regular hobbies outside of that.

So, I don't get what their deal is in life in general. None of their choices make any sense to me. We went out a few times, and they never made a move on me, and then said that they either wanted to be friends with benefits or just friends, but they couldn't get into a relationship right now. So obviously, I told them I didn't want to be fwb, because that's just gross af. I agreed to be friends, because he's not a bad guy (he's nice and sweet to me, so nothing against him, I'm just weirded out). I'm just not used to guys wanting to be friends with me, without making a move on me - I'm pretty cute (not epic hot, but cute), and he drove 40 mins to teach me how to drive and let me stall his manual car infinity times, and asked to take me to dinner - I'm not super used to guys doing that \*without\* an ulterior motive to take things further. I guess maybe he's just lonely and wants friends?

But yeah, I'm interested in what's going on with this guy in general, and in why he approaches me the way he does, because its \*super\* different, in alot of ways (good and bad), from other guys I've met, and idk what his deal is.",20Jun2018,0
96,"I recently broke up with my long distance  girlfriend but it was really hard. She told me that she’s still very much in love with me and saw a future with me. Now the reason why I broke up with her was: 1. We would argue a lot about several small and different things. 2. I didn’t think I had the same passion for her that she had for me. 3. She wanted to rush through our time together. Get married and have 4 kids later on. This is what she planned out. And I always said, we will know when it’s time when we get there. It just made me very nervous and anxious.

So we had a fight this morning and she told me not to call her back. Then she called me 8 hours later, and when I told her it would be best if we split. She broke down and started apologizing and saying she’s in love with me, and how she wanted to get married and be the mother of my children.

So as bad as that sounds, idk if I made the right call. Like this girl would do ANYTHING for me. And I realize more and more that I’m selfish, but I just don’t want to have any regrets.

101,"I'm so sorry this is long I just haven't really had the chance to really vent like this. Thank you so much for taking your time to read and give any advice it means a lot. 

Although I've been diagnosed with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) I still don't feel like its right. Growing up I always felt stressed about my family's constant arguing and money problems. I was always sent to my room so I always spent a lot of time alone. I really felt all I could do was ignore it and try my best to be happy. I never wanted people to feel sad like I do so I always tried my best to make them happy even it meant humiliating myself. I made a small group of friends from my primary school and had made a few more when I went to High School. Problems started getting worse, my friends always had some sort of drama. Blowing situations out of proportion. I was surrounded by 'one up-ers' the whole ""My life is worse than yours"" or ""You have it easy, nothing is wrong with you"". It felt like hell but all I felt like I could do was smile it off. My priority was making sure others are better than myself. One day we were put in our theater to watch some people talk about mental health and it opened my eyes. It felt like things added up and made sense about myself but I never really self-diagnosed it I just felt happy that I wasn't the only person that felt like what I did. Feeling a lot more collected about myself I talked to a close friend about how I was considering talking to someone for help. She laughed and said ""You've got nothing wrong with you. I'm the one with problems, don't waste their time."" It hurt but I accepted it and continued going through this stressful cycle of friends saying the same things. Things at home weren't great all I would get was £2 for lunch and I always skipped breakfast. My parents would fight constantly about problems I didn't find out about until later. I just decided to bottle everything up and keep to myself, rarely go out and cry most nights to sleep. At 14 I had detention for not turning in homework so I had to finish it at school and then I could go home. Beside my school, there's a small patch of woods that a lot of people pass through to get to school or walk their dogs. After my detention, I decided to through the woods and take a detour and watch the ducks at this small tucked away pond. Before I could even move someone wrapped their jacket around my upper body and dragged me along the ground a bit. I screamed and kicked about until I felt something sharp poke my stomach. ""Scream again I'll kill you."" All I could see was black and felt them undress my lower half and rape me. All I know is he was an older person that was it I never saw his face. After he was done he flipped me over and pushed my face into the leaves as he ran off before I could even look. If I could even do it, I was in so much pain and all I could do was lie there for half an hour. I got up and couldn't even feel like I could cry. I pulled up my trousers and walked home and showered, ate my dinner and went to bed. I couldn't tell my parents or even my friends, all that replayed in my mind was ""I've got it worse than you"" ""Nothings wrong with you, you're fine"". I was sketchy about attending high school after that and just went with being 'fake sick' or 'playing hooky' 'skiver'. I suppressed it so far down that I felt like I couldn't think about it. I eventually got my first boyfriend and had to pretend it was my first time saying I broke my hymen in gymnastics. I met really good friends and hung out with them more than my older friends. I felt good until I decided to drink with one alone and he assaulted me while I was on the verge of passing out. I was 16 at the time, I remember waking up on the ground in the corner of his room. I soon felt like I couldn't take things anymore. I couldn't talk to friends or my boyfriend at the time until I broke down. I was 18 and I was still with my first boyfriend I left him since I didn't feel happy anymore. After a while it was rocky I was on benefits but couldn't do any of the work they asked, kept failing at the jobs they gave me so they sent me to get a mental health assessment. My first diagnosis was Depression, not severe for medication until they gave me a weak dose after a few breakdowns. But I didn't feel comfortable with the feeling it gave me also the fact I didn't eat much or wanted to kill myself. I kept trying to overdose on any medication I could get mostly painkillers. Eventually, it got to the point where it felt like there was always something behind me and talked to me. I decided to give it a nickname to make me feel less scared about it. Constantly telling me to kill myself, don't eat. I tried but I could never go through with killing myself. I want to live but with the feelings I had, it was hard to believe myself. By then I was living with my uncle who had diabetes and had a leg removed due to it. So I cared for him and stayed in the spare room. It was nice, no shouting or slamming doors or anything like that happening. My relationship with my family got better and felt like I could talk after them understanding my mental health, so did some of my friends. I was still suicidal and rarely ate. My body started getting bigger and it was disgusting to look at myself in the mirror. I would binge eat then throw it back up then eat barely anything. Drink something fizzy just to fill my stomach, playing video games to distract myself from food or the need to hurt myself. I went through another relationship at that time and it was nice but mental health got in the way and he felt stressed trying to help while juggling a job, uni and moving into his own place. I understood and now we're still very good friends to this day. I felt good about things I ate more and tried to do better with myself. I met someone new through skype. a few months later and it let to meeting up. I was mentally tortured through that relationship, he hurt me physically and cheated on me and left me. I started cutting myself to vent the pain and frustration I felt, it became addicting and it became a stress reliever. I went through some more mental health assessments and said I was even more depressed than they thought and set me up with a psychiatrist. I could barely afford to travel to it so I missed appointments a lot and was put on and off the list a lot. Eventually, I'm where I am now I was diagnosed with BPD and PTSD at 20 and shortly after I felt strangely better about things. I was learning about what they were and moving forward with my life. I met the love of my life and it has been a struggle, we were friends since I was 18 and would play video games all the time. Shortly after we got into a relationship my uncle died. I found him dead with his face lying in a bin as he had a heart attack the day after Christmas. He was like a second dad to me he was always in my life like a third parent he lived with my family for so long. It knocked me so hard I felt that horrible moment I did when I was 14. I kept dreaming about the moment I found him, screaming and crying. How his eyes were open I had no credit on my phone I ran in front of a car to use a strangers phone to call my mum after I called the emergency services. That day will be the worst day of my life. Its now been almost two years and my family wants to try and get me to get help again. I'm 22 and now I'm moving on with my life again, My boyfriend and I want to get a place together.

Every now and then and I would say about once every 2-3 weeks he snaps. He yells at me for up to ten minutes about the most minuscule issues. His anger almost always stems from my inability to do tasks the EXACT way he requested. I try to please him, I really do but it's never quite satisfactory. There's always something I missed. I always listen to what he has to say to fix it. 

This anger is especially prominent when he has a bad day. I can't cheer him up with my work or simply talking to him. 

His anger usually starts with a few hurtful comments and then stems into yelling cusses, concerning body language, and no regard for me as a human being with emotions. 

I start to get worried he might start throwing things as he as done it before. I remember some instances where he threw the rice cooker into the sink because he did not like the way I prepared it. He seems to project a lot of his poor emotions onto me. I never see him acting this way towards my brother thankfully but I am ALWAYS the reason for why he had a bad day. 

What should I do? I talk to my mom about this nearly every time it happens but I don't think she understands how scared I am. He really is a nice person when calm but he is terrifying in this state. ",20Jun2018,1
104,"Im 17, my parents are slowly beginning to retract financial support. As an adult, ill need a job, and a house. Ill go to work, then come home, then play on my computer or take my dog out.

Im going to be losing a fair chunk of the time that I would usually have as a teenager. With the money, ill be able to save up for nice things - but they can't fufill me.

106,"Here's the super short version: 

Friend robbed me twice and I'm going to expose him in instagram until he pays me back. 

Long version: 

My ""friend"" or so I thought stole from me twice. I didn't see him in the act, but I'll explain my story on what happened and what I have been contemplating doing to get him back, or my money back. It's a bit detailed, but honestly it could be even more detailed. 

My friend moved from Ottawa to Toronto and would always tell me to go visit him, that I'd have a place to stay. I went on a weekend and he let me stay at his place, It was a filthy room but I didn't mind and I would buy him food in return. He was the type to always ""forget his debit card"". Regardless I never called him out on it even though it was blatantly obvious, he was bad with money and never seemed to have any. We went to the gym to workout and I needed a lock to put our things in it, so I bought one of those locks that are acronyms that you can't forget. It was DOE - depends on experience. I told him the combo. All in all it was a good time and I visited him again about a month later.

When I arrived the second time he wasn't there and said he was at the barber getting a haircut. I told him I'd be going to the gym next to his place to hang out in the sauna and relax after my long 5 hour ride. I used the same lock I bought before to lock my things. When I got out I went to my locker and my lock was gone. I thought I went to wrong stall so I moved over and my lock wasn't there either. I went back again to my first choice and opened the locker. All of my things were there. I thought that it was really weird that my lock was gone so I went through my bags to make sure I didn't lose anything. Everything was still there, except for the cash in my wallet. $100 gone. I drove straight to barber he said he was at and saw him waiting for a haircut. So he probably couldn't have robbed me I thought. When he got out I told him what happened and teased him that it might be him. He acted really surprised and got really defensive. I was still rattled but I let it pass because logically I had no proof, and he had an alibi. The next day my friend quit his warehouse job he despised and was spending money on food. Usually I buy him food. He spent $30 on McDonald's and up to then I had never seen him order more than two cheeseburgers, that I'd pay for. The same day I met one of his roommates who was acting really weird. He didn't talk to me at all, only my friend. I didn't talk about the robbery, but him and my friend were chatting and literally the only words the roommate said was that he's broke and he's been gone all weekend. That's what got my attention. Why the hell would he say that? At this point I was pretty sure my friend coordinated the robbery with his roommate, but I forgot about the whole ordeal and let it pass. 

We were supposed to travel Europe together a few months later but I decided not to when I found out he was planning to hitchhike with little to no money. I wasn't interested in finding out he had lost his debit card again.

A few months later he ended up in Colombia. I was planning on going for a vacation and decided to follow so long as I didn't actually say with him, because I'd have a wing man to show me around. I stayed in a tourist hostel and was very careful with my things, my cash was always with me in my bag I carried. I hung out with my friend every few days, and all in all we had a good time. We planned to go to Guatape for a day, and I brought my bag and cash with me. It was a day trip and we were having a really good time, and at one point we sat down at a restaurant and had a nice meal. During this meal I went to the washroom for 2 minutes, and when I got back it didn't even cross my mind to check for my money, and he paid for his food too. I pretty much forgot to check for my belongings until later that night. He had parted back to the main city by this time, and I discovered that all of my cash was missing. $700. Now I know your thinking I'm a complete moron, and I probably was. But quite honestly it was a silly mistake. It was a short vacation and every day was pretty busy and I was always on the go, so I would mindlessly bring my bag with me. The cash was there as a just incase measure.  And the biggest mistake was not trusting my gut and cutting off this scumbag the first time, but I was blinded by our good chemistry because we got along well, and I gave him the benefit of the doubt from the first experience. 

After this happened he got very coy, and it was hard to get a hold of him. I had to fool him into hanging out with me at my hostel, and he denied everything. He left immediately, and threatened me not to tell anybody, and he actually blamed me for blaming him. He played victim. At this point I'm positive he's a sociopath but that doesn't get me my money back. 

It's been 6 months and I have been contemplating getting revenge by posting this story on all of his instagram pics until he pays me back. This is a pretty bold move because I don't use instagram and it might make me look  bad but I'm just curious to know if you have any opinions on this. I know he values his instagram the most. What do you think? 

Sorry for the long story, hope it was at least entertaining and a lesson could be learned from this. ",20Jun2018,1

109,"I’m really not sure where or who to turn to as I don’t have a real support system but I’d like to do something for my mother after all she’s done for me. My mother divorced my father and remarried to my step-father in 2010. After their marriage, my step-father suffered multiple strokes, leaving him in a wheel chair and unable to operate half his body. Not being able to use his right side, my mother had to quit her job and live off disability checks while taking care of him. Recently, my mothers vision has been worsening and worsening before finally getting her vision checked and discovering she has astigmatism. I really don’t know anything about vision but from as far as I can understand, best case scenario she’ll lose vision in one eye if not both. She also has had tooth pains for the past few years and I know that improper care of the teeth can lead to heart diseases. Her teeth are yellowing, chipping and falling out and I can see how embarrassed she is over it. I love my mother dearly and I’m currently working a summer job to save up for a car as I’m only 17, but the severity of the situation has grown on me and now that I have a job I’d like to do something for her rather than myself. 

I really would like to avoid a lecture on how it’s not my job to worry.

After she had left, I plugged in my phone, and put my headphones away. In the morning, it was exactly as I had done.

I personally don't know what to do. But I am creeped out. I don't know if she's done this before or not. I thought about telling my dad but the last time I told him that she had been rude to me, he flipped out on me. Is there any way I could word it maybe that would get the point across to him? Or should I confront her about it? I'm just so weirded out and I feel like my privacy was invaded.

113,"Background: My (23/F) younger brother (18/M) and I fought a lot (physically and verbally) when we were younger, but now have a good relationship. Overlapping humor, catchup calls every other month, travel together. He has lots of close guy + girl friends, and is generally a pretty fun guy to be around.

Last year my brother was accused of ""assaulting"" (pushing) his ex, causing a lot of his highschool friends to stop talking to him. My brother told me his side of the story, and of course I sided with him and thought it was an exaggerated story.

This year, his freshman year of college, he joined a frat and is starting to turn into a huge frat bro - pastel shorts and everything. His new frat friends are pretty nice, some have girlfriends. They party a LOT. He also has a new girlfriend who I recently met. 

His new gf is this cute international chick. He treats her like garbage, doesn't even like her. He invited her over without telling me or my mom, and left her in his room for 20 min because ""she's mad boring"" while he made himself a sandwich. He talks to her like a ""bro"" but it feels much more demeaning and disrespectful.

I've talked to his close friends about it, and they agree. They've told him he needs to treat her more respectfully, and he says ""he knows."" After witnessing his behavior myself, I'm starting to worry that the story with his ex isn't so exaggerated. His friends, who he's grown up with, have also noted that they think him joining the frat is changing him.

I'm growing concerned about his behavior towards his girlfriends, and how I can stop him from turning into an intolerable asshole who treats his partners like shit. I'm sure there is something deeper, but how can I start the conversation?

115,"I'm not that picky about conversational topics, but occasionally someone will decide to talk my ear off about something really specific that I'm just not into, and I dislike that. The most recent example is over the weekend, my 9-year-old nephew (whom I don't know well) spent the entirety of a long family lunch telling me about the minutiae of all the characters and story paths you could take in a specific video game that I've heard of but not played. I'm okay with humoring someone for a few minutes, but he just kept going and going. Even after an interruption like getting up and going to the bathroom, he'd get right back to it.

I don't want to be rude or hurt somebody's feelings, particularly not a child's, so it doesn't seem like I should just straight out say that I'm not interested in that topic and don't want to talk about it.

Also, this has mentions of suicide and self harm

My mom (40f) and dad (48m) have been fighting for two days straight. This morning (6/19) my dad woke up and was screaming at my mom, throwing shit, getting in her face, and slamming doors. He left in a very hostile mood and he would keep coming back every couple of hours and repeat. My mom made the decision to set in motion a separation so that she can eventually get divorced from him. When she told him, he immediately tried to manipulate her, tried to kick me out so that she wouldn't have a support system (she has no family except my brother and I) and told her he's going to take everything away from her; car, house, etc etc. 

Currently, he's trying to come home and we all are feeling very anxious about that. We hid all of his guns because the last time they got into a fight, he pulled one out in front of my teenage brother and told both him and my mother that he was going to ""blow his brains out."" We also called the cops who pretty much told us that they can't tell him to leave or not come back until he physically hurts my mom. It's the middle of the night here so she can't put in for a restraining order. She's so afraid of him. One of our dogs jumped on the wall in another bedroom, making a knocking sound, and she jumped up and looked terrified. 

He's never put his hands on her, but he emotionally abuses her and has been manipulating her for 20+ years. He's been texting her for an hour saying he's coming home, whether she likes it or not, and we're all scared. We locked all the doors and windows leading into the house, but the officers told us that we can't legally keep him out. 

We came up with a plan, for right now, that goes along the lines of: let him come in and make it verbally known that he will be sleeping on the couch because the officers said that was acceptable. Make sure my mom is in her bedroom with the door locked and if he tries to break into her room by breaking the door down or whatever he tries, we will call the police and tell them what he's doing and hope it's enough to get him to be escorted away. 

My father is a dangerous person and once he gets close to my mom again I know he'll manipulate her into feeling bad and taking him back.

128,"Hello everyone,

A bit of context here : I have been with my girlfriend for almost 5 years. We have been happily living together for a bit more than 4 years. I work two jobs and she is a minimum wage worker. Money isn't really an issue in the relation, but I am a big saver and she is more of a spender.

Two years ago we bought an appartment together. We managed to get a loan and everything is great. We are co-owner (50-50), but money-wise we refund the loan to the height of our salary, so for now it's more like 60-40.

In january, I got a 10&amp;#37; raise. Of course I told her because I was really happy, and we rearranged our shares accordingly. I though that because of that raise we would be able to refund the loan AND putin savings in order to have a little cushion. Long story short we couldn't : the appartment costs way more than previously expected (we have to buy all furniture and home appliance).

I recently started to be a bit afraid : she wants to buy everything ""new"", we want to have a baby, she wants to buy a new car (for said baby). Even though I can't complain about our lifestyle, the future is dark money-wise. I often expressed my feelings, but she doesn't want to discuss it, failing to see the difficulties I'm painting.

A few days ago, I got an unsolicited pay raise (again around 10&amp;#37;). This time, I didn't tell her right away. I'm having a hard time deciding if I should tell her and hoping she will start to see things a bit more like me, and if I should hide it from her and put the money into savings accounts (or even maybe investing it). 

TL;DR : Gilrfriend of 5 years is a spender, I'm a saver. I had an unsolicited raise recently and have a hard time deciding if I sould tell her or not.",20Jun2018,2

 I started looking last May. I have applied to several places (which were all next to minimum wage), and I haven't gotten any calls back.

The only issue is that they specifically mentioned on the tour that they prioritize juniors and seniors for these positions...so that isn't even guaranteed. This summer is so boring. I have been homeschooled all my life, and I don't have any friends to hand out with. I feel like I could be making money, but I feel really lazy just sitting around the house.

144,"So, our Westjet flight was leaving Houston when a boy threw up in his seat right before take off. They drove back to the airport, had everyone get off so they could clean and then re-boarded the plane. We left 90min later than our scheduled departure time. 
We arrive in Calgary to find out that they have bumped all passengers on connecting flights to the next available flight to their destination even though some passengers had time to make their connections. 
The next flight for most of us was in the morning. They handed us new tickets for the next day and then told us to be on our way. No hotel vouchers offered. 
I, myself, traveling with three small children including a 15month old strapped to my chest was not okay with this. I complete customs and have 20min before my original flight is taking off but I can’t get on it because they cancelled my ticket. 
To top it off, they had us wait for nearly two hours while they “got our luggage” only to find out that they had lost my bag with diapers, medication, toothbrushes, etc and are not sure if it is back in Houston or on its way to my destination city. 
I filled out a lost luggage form, made my way out of the airport and caught a shuttle to the nearest hotel. They had no rooms so I went to the next one and am now sitting up writing this while absolutely livid. 
Westjet maintains that they cannot comp any rooms because this was out of their control. However, the other passengers and I disagree. If you are not giving anyone a place to stay, let them try and make their connection. If you are going to decide for them that they will not have time, then give them somewhere to sleep! Am I wrong? 
Not sure if this is the right subreddit but I wanted to get some opinions on if this seems like a fair “new policy”. Please reply with any advice because I am unsure what I should do next.

#Backstory

I've moved back in with my mom a few years ago after being out of state to graduate high school. I immediately started college, where I met my very-soon-to-be wife. Long story short, fiancé's home life was abusive, so I convinced my mom and step-dad to let her move in with us.

 My mom has always been a high-stress, emotional, and overeactive person. She also has a severely adaptive personality, in the sense that when she is in a relationship, their personalities and interests become hers, but pretty much on steroids.

To make things relatively short, my step-dad is kind of a workaholic, as he's always very busy and never makes much personal time for himself. You can probably deduce how this affected my mom's personality: working to get her Master's online (in a field which, personally, I find very obsolete, to put it mildly), which includes taking a temp position; she also works as the entire marketing team for a community college that treats her like gum on the sidewalk; she's constantly volunteering to help promote the college (which I think is a vain effort, considering the fact that we're a *very* small ""City"", and it's the only higher educational option for over 100 miles); she also tries too hard to give off a charitable light to other people, even though she seems incredibly apathetic to us at home. She's constantly buying things and then never again touching them, making other *major* financial decisions that will destroy the two of them, and she won't listen to me because I'm always just gonna be her son. She raised me, so why would I ever know better than her, even though I have some experience in psychology, financial management, and an unbiased, outside perspective of her problems.

#The Issue

Fiancé and I are getting married at the end of the summer, and we originally wanted to move out of the house after then. Well, we finally decided where we're moving, and it's across the country, far away from this shithole state. They support this, and are even - very generously - going to drive with us to help us move all of our stuff there. Well, fiancé and I decided that it would be safer (physically and financially) to wait until after the spring semester to travel. If we left after this semester, we'd be traveling by car convoy from the Southwest all the way to the east coast during the winter and holiday travel season. Fuck that noise. If we wait, we'll be able to save up more money to pay for the move and recover from the wedding.

This didn't sit well with my mom. She used to be very loving to me, but it seems that all this stress she's conjuring up is getting to her. Before all this Master's+temp+work+everything else bullshit, she probably would've dropped a set of china to shatter on the floor to come help her children. Now, she wants to kick me and my fiancé out when we're both currently unemployed and about to spend the rest of our money on a marriage that people are already RSVPing to. She doesn't understand what this town will do to anyone trying to escape, since she doesn't want to escape. 

It's so easy to get stuck here. Fiancé has been looking for a job non-stop for like 4 months straight, to no avail. I just got fired from a fucking coffee shop job (I've almost got another job set up, miraculously), and we're both students at the college. We pay for our own groceries, car insurance (a *very* ridiculous fee for just the legal minimum), and school. The only things we don't pay for are shelter and my phone. In fact, they used to charge us rent, until we both enrolled in classes (kinda fair).

The main issue is pretty much that she feels we're not ""pulling our weight"", which means we won't pick up after them in their own house, while she's out of town buying bulk vegan food that will just hog up the fridge so wet can't keep any of *our* food in it. We clean the kitchen and the bathroom *everybody* uses, I mow our dead yards, and we keep to ourselves in our room. That was the original problem, in fact! We ""didn't go out to spend time with her in the living room anymore, and instead stayed in our room and played video games all day!"" We were not at work and school all day, and my mom was always doing her homework and getting all stressed out about it in the LIVING ROOM WHERE EVERYONE TENDS TO TRY TO RELAX. Every time we tried to talk, she'd always get frustrated and tell us micro-aggressively that she ""hhhhhhas...to finish this"" and can't be bothered. Okay, so now we keep to our room. Then what does she say? That she ""can't have any time or space to herself"". Oh, and did I mention that she constantly tells us through her guilt trip tears that her marriage is ""falling apart"" because of *us*? That is beyond acceptable and it's completely untrue. Step-dad loves us! If there's any problem there, it's her, and I can guarantee that on my own fuckin grave.

We are tired of living here, in this house,""city"", and state. We're so close to leaving that I can taste it! *It's so damn close!* But she's completely unwilling to help us just a little longer. I honestly, wholeheartedly believe that once my uncle moves out (tl;dr: not biological, but my mom was best friends with his wife since childhood and she passed away two years ago, so he moved in from across the country.) and she's done with school (I think she'll be done after the fall semester), she'll be at ease and return to relatively normal. 'Til then, she's like this.

There's a place we might be able to move (I *really* can't stress how much I don't wanna live there), in case we have to, but we really couldn't afford it and be able to move out of town on the future. Pay here - assuming you even *get* a job - is abysmal. Truly. There's no way in hell we won't get trapped here for god knows how long, if we go that route. Impossible not to. It's much safer to wait just a little bit longer than we originally planned, so we can leave for good. They'll never have to deal with us again, if they really didn't want to. In fact, she always used to promise me that she'd do anything to help me; I need her the most right now! This is our once-in-a-lifetime chance to get out of this place for good, which nobody here gets. ""You live here? You die here."" is one of our unofficial mottos. Everyone in town uses it.

Now that you're caught up, what should we do? Should we leave on time and risk the journey in the extreme weather and not have as much money? Should we leave in the spring so we can save up and just grit our teeth until then? Or should we move in with my uncle and risk being stuck in this town for quite possibly the rest of our lives?",20Jun2018,2

153,Hello Advice givers! I’m from Sydney (if that matters) and wanting some stranger advice regarding debt. I have a car which I currently have about 12k owing to finance. I need this car for daily commuting and general getting around.  I’m getting a tax time bonus from work which will pay around 8k of the car debt. My question is - I could essentially buy almost the same car (give or take a few kms) for around 9k outright. I know from gumtree (did a test listing to see) that I could rent the car out to someone for about $220 a week.  So I’m wondering if you think it might be worth it to invest in a second car and rent it out to someone. (I would pay insurance and get them to give me bond money which is the equivalent of my insurance excess should they be in an accident). It would help me to put extra onto my existing car loan and pay it much faster and after the existing debt is paid would be a little extra income. Good idea or not a good idea? ,20Jun2018,1

It kinda does add to the excitement being high around them and them not knowing at all but it kinda just gets old fast or idk.

\*p.s, Sorry if it doesn't make sense, I'm really bad at explaining things. \*

I've been struggling for awhile now and I mean struggling. I have 0 motivation, drive, passion... Like, I just cant find the will to do anything, be anything.. I have depression, anxiety and all those lovely mental health problems \*I've seen therapist in the past but always feel like they don't quite understand my problems so I stopped going\*  I can't stop blaming others for this, Regardless if they have actually hurt me or not. I don't have any friend, friends, I'm just known by a few people, No one who I can just ring up and hang with.  I have 4 siblings, All of which dislike me because I'm gay (I live with 2 of them \*Only Sister+Oldest Brother+My Dad) And how do I live when people whom dislike me? Lol... Basically, If I don't, I sleep on the street. I just hide and wait, I get up extremely early when they are sleeping to get things organised \*Food, showering. That type of stuff\* And IF, I do come face-to-face with any of them, I just stare at the ground, hoping they don't notice me as I quickly rush myself back to my room, I realise some people may suggest opening up to my family and seeing if things have changed but, I've done that time and time before, They legit have 0 time for me. My parents have both told me that they would have preferred it if I wasn't born.  (My mother kicked me out when I came out to her) I have only told 2 people since that day, My sister who was cool at first but has completely changed her mind due to her religious views. I told a ""friend"" of like, 15+ years, you know that friend from the very beginning? Yeah, once I told her.... she freaked out and said ""I cannot have somebody so reckless in my life, it will effect my chances at my own happiness""  I tend to avoid people as much as possible now, I've isolated myself. I only leave my house on payday or to buy drugs. \*I'm not addicted to anything, Just a little MJ to take the edge off when the feels are strong or I can't sleep\* I'm extremely shy/introverted, I have no idea how to talk to strangers at the shops, How to make new friends.  I have only have 2 hobbies?interests? - Music and gaming. Neither of them can be anything more then things I like. Trust me, I've tried. I've tried the whole ""Connect with other gay people or people with the same interests/hobbies"" \* I posted a selfie last night, Not sure why or what I was looking to gain from it... It made me feel good for a moment, Then I realised, All the nice comments and up-votes were a lie, I wasn't the person in the picture. It just resulted in me feeling even worse about myself, How could I possibly connect with other people, When I can't even connect with myself? I try and fake happiness, Like I've got it under-control and I know what I'm doing.... But I really don't.

I have worked quite a few different types of jobs over the years, Nothing fancy. And nothing that lasted... I'd always fall into a mind-set of ""I'll just take today off and refresh"" which turned into another day, then another and then I would just not go back. I dunno why I do this, I feel like I get scared because I said something or did something that might be weird. And to add to this, My last job was nearly over 2 years ago, I have only been able to obtain interviews since leaving my last job. \*And Yes, I realise how bad it looks to leave a job like this, I don't use them as references on my resume, I have done short-time roles which I didn't leave and have those bosses give me a reference\*

I'm not quite sure how to handle life... I have no idea what I'm suppose to do..

I contemplate suicide everyday... I've even tried twice... The first time, I cut myself but as soon as I seen blood I freaked out and stopped (I hate blood/needles type of stuff) The 2nd time, I took my mum's heart pressure tablets and sunk whatever was left, I just got really sick.. I haven't tried again, I'm not sure what stops me now, The feeling is so strong. I know, It will happen if I can't turn things around. 

Every time I feel like I've taken a step forward with my life, I instantly think about my problems and instantly go back to my usual self destructive self. And whatever that step was, is now gone... lost in all the thoughts going through my mind.

I'm sure I've left something out but I feel this kinda sums up my current situation..",20Jun2018,3

I’m starting to figure out what I want to do with my life, and the research is vague for the field I want to work in (esports) I can’t seem to figure out what other people in the field did to get to where they are today, that in combination with my views on the career changing has been sort of shitty for me.

Another thing is that a couple of people who I thought were my close friends started harassing me online. Let me explain, (for the sake of the story I’m giving fake names so don’t worry) these people were some of my close friends from high school (Wes, Nathan, Troy), with the addition of John, which was one of troys online friends. We would play video games together and chat on discord. We were playing Fortnite when I rage quit because of a mechanic that I felt was broken (double pumping) to make a long story short, we all got into a argument about it where it was all of them vs me. John was the main instigator of everything. He would target me and say things to me directly. Some examples of things he said were “you are mentally deficient” and “you will never find love”

The whole argument was lengthy, as it went on for 2 hours in the discord chat, ask me if you have any questions. Either way all of these things have made me feel really shitty, and I have really bad anxiety so that doesn’t help too. I feel so low right now that it’s hard to pick myself up.

164,"#Before proceeding I am not here asking for advice about my mental health

I've been unemployed for a couple of years now dealing with a lot of issues from when I was a kid and later - abusive work places (more than one... in a row...)

Because of this I don't bring in a steady income and when I do get paid from a side job it's usually a decent amount $100-200 for a couple days of work (graphic design stuff). However I'm not an official business and don't have any idea how to make it into a business that has a steady flow of clients (specifically graphic design concepting not finalizing usually.). Here's the problem:

My partner and I live in our own apartment. She's the primary bread-winner and I do what I can, when I can around the house to try and lessen the stress on her; however, we live in a 2 room apartment (1 upstairs and 1 downstairs). My partner's brother lives downstairs. The apartment is in the same yard as her parents house infront of ours (very unique circumstance). Whenever my partner's sister, brother, or parents get the chance they hound my partner about me not making any income.

Which is understandable in most situations however, they are fully aware of my mental issues and have been quoted saying such classics like:  ""their mental issues are just bullshit excuses to be lazy"" or ""you know what would make me happier than you getting that promotion at work? Breaking up with your partner."".

So her entire family is being really really manipulative and since I'm dealing with mental issues as best I can right now, and have recently picked up a few jobs, and up'ed the amount of work I'm doing around the house... what else can I do in the meantime? Aside from saving up to move elsewhere (which is complete bullshit we even have to do, and they can't just respect our boundaries and my partner's life choices).

P.S. I have never in the history of being with my partner tried to put distance between them and their family but I don't know what else to do at this point. Any time I do what they want they always come up with something else that's wrong with our lives.",20Jun2018,1

Every morning when he leaves for work at 4:30a, he calls me until I wake up out of my sleep to go check on my grandmother everyday even when she is sleeping which wakes her up. (She is always sleeping at this time.) My grandma's dementia makes her sensitive to noise but she is a heavy sleeper when she does sleep. He throws Lysol cans at my bedroom door during the day, &amp; has even through a plate of some kind at me to try and get my attention, hitting me in my forehead drawing blood, only so he can ask me something like 'What time is it?' . He also speaks to my Grandmother in a disrespectful manner. Even though I bled after the Lysol can hit my forehead, he continues to do things like that including spraying me with a water hose as I was walking into the house. I have tried to talk to him about things, but it always end up in argument because as soon as I speak back to defend myself, he threatens to put his hands on me and has once before. He is taller and much bigger than I am. I am in my late 20s (F). He also buys stuff from Amazon all the time and it just sits everywhere, all over the room that my grandmother used to sleep in before she got sick. (She sleeps downstairs in a bed in the living room, uses a commode, ect). He uses his old room on the third floor as well as his actual room on the second floor. 
He has turned our basement into a gym for himself and is basically using my grandmother's house as his own. He is constantly threatening to kick me out (I am in the process of moving to another state right now, still packing actually, but I haven't told them at all) because he thinks he will become power of attorney if my Grandmother passes. There is a reverse mortgage on my Grandmother's home, so when she passes it is going to to the bank that she took out a housing loan with, leaving my Uncle homeless. 
He also just leaves his clothes everywhere, and constantly accuses me of not having a job because I don't have a job where I am working for someone else or having to report to a boss. 
The house is a mess, with my Uncle's crap everywhere, material and the way he behaves. When he leaves during the day, I am gathering boxes and packing my things during the time I don't have to work.

I'm pretty much falling head over heels for this friend of mine. She's who I want to have in my life for as long as I plan to live. However, everytime she would message me, my body just shuts down. It's like there's a power outage. The closest thing I could associate the feeling with is when you are so cold to the point that you've started shivering. It's not a cold air shiver though, it's the freezing water type. (not sure if that's a difference, but it makes more sense for some reason) 

As you can imagine, I do not enjoy this feeling. It always puts me on edge and I genuinely cannot stand it. These messages she sends aren't even important information per say, just the usual ""hey what's up"" sort of deal. For example, she just messaged me a web address and my body's response was like ""Time for an unscheduled restart, would you like to continue?"" and my only option is ""Yes"".

What is wrong with me? Why does my brain deflate when I require its assistance?",20Jun2018,12

First day into the trip and she messaged me “i just want to be friends” i cried my ass off and then she said “we can try this again when school starts” she kept on saying those two things and going back and forth so i told her i was gonna give her time to think and i told her i wasn’t gonna text her until school started again, only three days after i said that i texted her if she wanted to get back together (i know, bad move on my part but it was because of xxxtentacion’s death and she was being very depressed and so was i since he was an idol to both of us, don’t start shit about what he did in the comments) she said that now wasn’t the right time so i agreed because i didn’t want to bother her and so now i’m sad, waiting, impatient, and just confused because i was going through my pictures and it’s all her and just messages i screenshot because they make me happy and now they make me sad because i overthink shit and i keep thinking it’s my fault for the breakup even though she told me herself that she still loves me and wants to get back with me later this year but i can’t help being sad about it, a lot of my friends have told me to give her space, and no shit i have so i don’t want to hear the same “give her space” bullshit, give me some real advice please",20Jun2018,0

172,"Hi, new to reddit. I've been wondering about this for a while but I was wondering if I could get any advice on whether to confront a friend about our shaky relationship? The thing is, they are quite a self-absorbed person who doesn't really listen to others but I don't think they're intentionally malicious? Just completely focused on what's best for them rather than giving any regard to the feelings of others. They are known to dominate conversations and put others down (like stating someone wouldn't be able to be successful in their profession, always think they are right/hate it when others disagree, being judgemental of small things like people's clothing choices etc...and really be really negative and hypocritical) but I'm not sure if they are aware of that. 

Recently, I've been finding it hard to deal with them and their comments so I've been more passive aggressive than usual and somewhat rude (giving curt responses etc.), which isn't really helping our friendship. I'm not sure whether to confront them about the way they've been making others (and me) feeling and apologising for my behaviour or to just let things be because there hasn't been an argument yet and things are okay for the most part as well as me being afraid of her reaction.

Td lr: just wondering whether to confront a friend or not or let it pass since its been affecting our friendship/others. Any advice would be appreciated! ",20Jun2018,1

Since I quit smoking I'm a fat pig.  I was sitting there while my god damn Tivo wasn't working and of course 'little fat Jimmy' (myself), 'little fat stupid boy', can't figure it out.  The Tivo isn't downloading properly, I've been watching Taxi and the Osbornes.

Nothing is working for me and I literally was sitting there in my underwear looking at the window of my apartment, standing in the living room of my apartment and I'm thinking, ""Throw you fat worthless body through it."" I live on the the 22nd floor, I should have plunged.

You understand what I'm talking about?  The rage of being so god damn impotent when it comes to anything that a man should be able to do.  God forbid I should look at a problem and have a little situation.  It's always a mishap and then I pinch my fat and call a real man to come over and fix it.

I really literally looked at myself without a shirt, I couldn't fix the god damn Tivo and I'm thinking, do it, just jump.   I could imagine the sound of the shattering glass, my fat torso going through the window and serving me right.  I walk around without a shirt on to make myself mad.

177,"I was informed by a friend/coworker yesterday that this woman (I’ll call her Pearl), told one of my assistant managers that I 'asked her out' and she had to reject me. About a month or two ago we used to get along and I considered her a friend, but due to some stupid drama she started ignoring me recently. I am bisexual and she knows this—Pearl is gay and while I’m not usually one to talk about sexuality at work, I felt safe telling her this information since I thought she of all people would understand me. I have never EVER been attracted to her or attempted any kind of move on her and I just don’t understand why she felt the need to lie. 

All day today I started feeling extremely distraught about this whole situation. For one, she made it sound like I harassed her, and two, the fact that she said that to someone in management made me afraid that she will make up even bigger lies about me later. I already felt uncomfortable working in her department or working similar shifts ever since she started ignoring me, but this new twist made me feel like my position at the company is threatened if she wants to take things a step further. 

I just spoke to a manager about this tonight, but I’m afraid this situation is ballooning out of control. I have no desire to get Pearl in trouble or fired, but according to multiple sources (including that manager), she is notorious for talking shit about people. My manager asked that I keep a written statement of everything that has transpired leading up to this, but I honestly don’t know if I want to get pulled into a huge work affair. I don’t know what to do at this point—was it better to keep my mouth shut? I just wanted to cover my bases by talking to management and making sure she doesn’t make any other false claims, but now I feel like I rushed into this and I’m in way over my head. She is an older woman and if (in a worst case scenario) she loses her job, I would feel extremely guilty about it since I can only imagine how hard it is for older people to find consistent work. Am I in the wrong here? And if so, is it too late to fix it? Any advice would be so, so appreciated. ",20Jun2018,2

181,"On my way to my finals exam in engineering mathematics, I lost my wallet In the bus, and only realised when I had to show my uni ID to enter the exam room, which I kept in my wallet. I had to go to the student central to buy a temporary ID to be able to enter the exam room. It took 25 minutes to get the ID and almost 3 minutes to run back to the exam room, which gets closed 30 minutes into the exam and you are unable to take the exam after that. I lost almost 30 minutes out of my 2 hour exam because of something out of my control. I could not even think properly while taking the exam because I couldn’t stop thinking about the cash I lost in my wallet ($300) and the 30 minutes I just lost, so I think I did extremely poor in the exam and definitely failed. You need a 40% in the finals to pass the class even if you accumulate over 50% average in the class, which is also required to pass.

I have an average of 85% in this class which consists of 5 tests I did, 3 of which I got a 90% in and 2 of which I got a 70% and a 81%. I’m not quite sure what these  are in GPA (I think a 3.8?) because I study in Australia, but I worked really hard to get this high average. My point is, I have a very high average because I’ve studied throughout the semester and was expecting to also get really high in the finals too, but I couldn’t due to the stress and loss of time during the exam because of what happened. I wasn’t able to fill out form in time which allows me to apply for special consideration so it may be too late for anything to happen. (You must do it before 1 day after the exam)

I have no idea what to do and am really anxious about failing an entire class I was doing really well in all because of not meeting a threshold in my final. What should I do??


I was thinking of emailing my class coordinator about a possible compromise of lowering or removing the 40% needed in the final to pass the class due to my situation and my high grade average. I haven’t got the exam mark back yet because I took it 3 days ago, but I reckon I fell just short of the 40% threshold. If this 40% threshold didn’t exist, I would have only needed a 15% in the final exam to get a 50% average in the class and pass it (because of my previous high marks).  Do you guys think this could possibly happen even after I didn’t fill out the required form in time, and am just sending an email to the coordinator? Obviously you guys don’t know my university or it’s policy, but I was hoping you guys could share what happened to you in a similar situation to me. Did the uni help you out?",20Jun2018,2

191,"My (24F) partner of nearly 10 years (25M) has been struggling with depression for over a year. He has tried 4 or 5 different types of medication, most recently Mirtazapine. Since starting his dosage a month ago, his moods and attitude has rapidly gone downhill. He used to be a relaxed, funny, happy person who would crack jokes and make me laugh constantly. Now I'm walking on eggshells. He gets angry over anything and stays angry for days. He has fallen out of love with me - he doesn't touch me, kiss me, or show me any kind of warmness. We have 2 young children and while he is a great dad he has been switched off to them. He doesn't help out around the house anymore and while we both work full time jobs, I am expected to do everything. On top of that he is becoming increasingly verbally, emotionally and physically abusive. 

I am at a loss with what to do. I try my best to be patient and kind and care for him. I know he is suffering from depression and having depression myself, I have so much sympathy for what he is going through. But he refuses to get help, he won't go back to the doctor (has an appointment in a couple of days which he has said he isn't going to) and has stopped going to his weekly counsellor. There's nothing I can do to change his mind.

194,"Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of a pickle. So, my gf (fiance, but I'll get to that later) and I have been together for about 4+ years now and we've been long distance for about 3 of them (currently still going). However, her service is ending and we're finally able to move in together in a couple months! We've finally made it and now is the part where we tell our parents.

We're both 26, but our parents still mean alot to use and have a good amount of say in our lives (usually is not a huge problem). So I told my parents about her moving in and to be honest, they weren't too thrilled about it. They lean more traditional and say that should we should be married before moving in, but they're gonna let me make my own decisions and allow us to move in together. They also like my gf and everyone gets along pretty well, so that's also a factor as well. When my gf told her parents, however, they absolutely did not want us to move in together without being married, and would rather have us go to a court to get a marriage license literally the next few days she lands in my city. That way we can have a license and then plan the wedding (which we are already thinking of) for whenever we want (June-ish next  year). 

I don't think this is going to jive with MY parents, and it's a tiny bit unsettling to me as well, as it seems rushed and not really the correct way to do things. We have a few options at this point: I tell my parents about the situation and hopefully they agree (which is highly doubt), or they don't and say that she should just move back in with her parents for a while. If that happened, it would be a horrible time for my gf. She and her parents do NOT get along well and it's to the point where they would yell/hit her quite often, esp for this situation. At this point it seems we may have to do this but I'm realllly trying to find another way out of this.

Another option we have it to announce our engagement openly (only our very close friends know, not our parents because of another long story) and give people a date for our marriage in June. This might give them something to use but my gf said her parents won't care, they'll suggest she come home at least for a month to plan the wedding out (the ""proper way"").

A few months ago I stumbled upon a remote job opportunity as a remote customer sales representative and they agreed to hire me for $8 an hour for 5pm-11pm M-THU and 5pm-8Pm Friday’s. 

The work is not challenging at all, I pick up calls and listen to people complain about a “magic weight loss pill” and I’m kind of in charge of the website they sell on. 

Every now and then I get assigned very random tasks but mostly copywriting articles or content creation tasks that my boss gets paid to do but makes me do it for much less. 

My boss seems like a nice person but sometimes makes me feel guilty about his lack of instruction. And gives me work I didn’t sign up to do, I wanted a customer service job and don’t enjoy doing all the side jobs for such a low hourly rate. 

I’m not really a morning/afternoon person, I like to stay up late and wake up around 10am. I’ve always enjoyed going outside and being active around sunset. Or even running errands. I just don’t prefer it as much to be out during daytime when I enjoy evenings more. 

This job keeps me stuck in front of a computer for 6 hours of the time I used to enjoy the most. 

I’m planning on learning more marketing skills online so that I can do freelance work on my own time.

204,"I keep making new accounts but he always finds out who I am.


He uses rude, vulgar language, calls me things like ""immature"" when he doesn't even have sufficient evidence, says I am prone to confirmation bias (nothing wrong with that... I am open to hearing other opinions but if it goes against my beliefs, I won't listen...) , and is just rude. I know he has anger issues and some serious problems.

I've asked the mods of the subreddit a I frequently use to ban him (asked earlier today and yet to hear back), but idk... The stuff he says just stinks and hurts. If you look at his post history, you can clearly see that as of these past 6 months (or longer), he's only been using reddit to target/hurt me. All his comments are replies to me or others on MY posts and they aren't positive things either.


Like, I know he's trying to give genuine advice, but  he does it with a bad attitude and foul language, and he fails to realise the reasons I can't follow his advice. 


Besides blocking him and trying to get the mods of subreddits I frequently use ban him, what can I do? How can I forget about the shit he does and move on in life? 

I've made all the posts I've made to get help. Instead of helping me, he puts me down. He's rude, seems like a jerk trying to put his anger out on me, and does other crass things.


For instance, I am an incoming college freshman. I would like to switch to another impacted major at my college. I made a post asking if other students who had done the switch could give me advice. He responded saying to go to community college. 

I didn't ask whether or not I should go to college A and try to switch majors or go to community college. No, I asked how to switch majors at college A. I know doing that is hard, but that was the point of making the post... To get some insight on what I need to do. But no, he has to come around and post something off tangent.


He's always off topic, doesn't help me (even though he's trying), and I don't like him. I haven't been taking his posts or comments to heart but it still hurts sometimes seeing some of the vulgar shit he types.



I don't know what to do and how to move on and forget him. I need help. I actually forgot about him for a while and he came out of the blue and  commented on my post today as well. Now his taunts are circling fresh in my head.


I can PM his username to you guys if you want to take a look.

He only uses reddit to hurt me these days. 


Please help if you can. 

I want to stop him but more importantly forget about him

205,"this is something i think about all the time, I've started taking care of myself a lot since I've realized I'm only gonna have this young body for only so long. I eat healthy, exercise, good posture, stretch, and avoid all sugar and candy. but it's inevitably gonna happen I'm gonna be old, all I'm doing is preserving my existence. Sometimes I think I'm more afraid of being old than being dead. I know it's really dumb but it feels like im going through a midlife crisis at 17. I just want to make the most of my younger years by getting into good habits and being more social, but I talk using my voice and I'm always thinking about how it's gonna change as I get older and sound bad. I guess this fear is good at some extent but I think I think about it too much.

207,"Context:

I'm 16 and recently after like 2 months I decided to leave a group of friends that I just never felt like I connected with any of them.
(They were all girls and friends of my ex, I felt left out and things got awkward and resentful between me and my ex so I left rather than pretend that they were my friends, save for two who I've explained myself to.)

Now it seems like I have a few choices;

There's this group of people that seem like people that I'd enjoy hanging out with and I already have some kind of relationship with some of them (I actively play games with one of them and used to go to primary school with half of them) but it doesn't quite feel like I'm part of the group.

There's another group that has actively welcomed me but they don't seem too close and have a semi-bad reputation of being loud/weird/rude but I don't think they're bad people, I'm just kind of wary of them.

Or I could wait another year before going off to university and make new friends there.

All I want is to feel like this is it, I'm satisfied and I'm happy and I beat this.

Both of them are un employed and not in college so they spend every moment of the day with each other, 24 hours a day 7 days a week,  so there’s no way I could just hangout with Ashley alone. 

I keep making excuses saying I don’t have the money or I don’t feel well enough to see her but the truth is her boyfriend disgusts me and I think she should leave him but she’s dependent on him and says everyday that she’s going to marry him.

I'm hoping you can help me with this. My husband and I are good friends with this couple- let's call them Jane and John. John and my husband are basically best friends, Jane became one of my good friends very quickly, both of them stood up in our wedding. 

Recently, Jane and John have been going through some marital problems, unbeknownst to us until last week. John has been staying with us as Jane kicked him out,  they are both from out of town, and don't have any family. They are in counseling, etc. It isn't clear what exactly the problem is although we have asked. 

My husband and I both have huge hearts but want to be clear on boundaries. This appears to be something that is is going to be more long term, and my husband and I want to ensure we are helping John in any way that we can however we don't want to be taken advantage of. We gave John two weeks to stay with us. 

On the flip side - Although not super religious I am someone who has faith in Catholicism and believes in Jesus and God's message of taking people in and helping them when they can. 

Part of me wants to only let him stay for two weeks and the other part of me wants him to stay for as long as he needs. 

Any feedback is helpful. Feel free to ask questions. 

TL;DR - Friends are having marital problems, husband is staying at our house, not sure what to do on timing for how long he stays.

I'm frequenting the last year of a Computer Science School, and i'm living a Ldr with a girl in the southern part of italy (i'm in the northen one). I planned to transfer to her when my studies are finished.
I've always loved the computer, i started using it when i was 4, and never stopped since then, but lately i've been thinking that maybe i'm doing the wrong thing with my life, maybe i'm wasting the best years of my life just sitting in front of a monitor writing virtual things. So, my Grandpa was a Carabineer (the italian gendarmerie), and i was thinking of joining myself the Carabineer Army.
I've talked this to my gf, and she don't agree with me, because she said that is a dangerous job, and for the first time she would be against me with a decision. Plus, if i join the Carabineers, for a year i have to stay in the Carabineer's School, which extends the period of distance between me and my girlfriend. Once this is finished, i will be sent in a destinantion choosen by the Army, and that can be near my gf or distant, that's all about luck.

Anyways, i was working Saturday, and she texted me that night saying she was gonna get her period soon so there might not be any funny business when i see her Thursday, she started bleeding Sunday night (the night after she told me that)

So she got her period around the time she was supposed to and everything, but she mentioned it was light this time around (she also said its happened before like this, but idk if it was to say this to comfort me). She didn’t mention she was worried about being pregnant or anything else. But i looked up causes of light periods and started freaking out. Obviously i didn’t cum in her or anything, but we did do it twice without a condom that same day (yes terribly stupid). i did clean my penis after the first time and urinated before the second time. its been going on 3-4 days (i think its ending), but last night she told me it was so light she didn’t even wear anything (pads or tampon)

Remember she’s said this happened before, and she did get her period when she was supposed to. Should we be worried? And should i bring anything up? i freaked out once about her being pregnant, she said she knew she wasn’t; and she was right. Should i listen to her again? ",20Jun2018,0
215,"I have severely self destructive behavior, to the point where I purposefully ruin good things and relationships in my life. Whenever something is getting stable and I have a good relationship, friendship, career, etc, I will ruin it just to hurt myself on purpose. I feel like I am not worth good things or love. So, I end up pushing people away and completely ""numbing out"" and not caring about anyone or how they're feeling, or really about anything.
I purposefully bombed a test I was prepared for just to hurt myself. Another thing I do is push people away. A friend of mine was struggling with depression. There was so much I wanted to say to her, but instead I was completely toxic in order to push her out of my life. She really needed me, and I didn't even help her because I felt nothing. I have pushed so many people away that I am becoming alone.
There is so much going in right now, that I don't want to feel pain anymore so I end up not feeling anything, and then self destructing. What the is wrong with me? How do I stop toxic behaviors and pushing people away?

I know it sounds stupid because I know I can do little to nothing about this, yet it still depresses me to constantly get hit by bad news. When I go to the Internet to get distracted, I see people actually debating over this events, some people even defending them and as a person who works in the media I know they are entitled to their own opinion and I respect that but it just really saddens and angers me.

Earlier today I had a discussion over the Internet with a man that was a self-confessed pedophile (Though not a child molester) and it disgusted me so much I couldn't even be able to keep the debate going on.

So, I've been in a relationship with my fiance for almost 3 years now. We've been polyamorous (or, in an open relationship) for those 3 years and it's been fine. Recently we started dating someone I met online, which was fine at first. You know, we're all happy, having a good time. After a bit, I kinda notice I don't...really have feelings anymore. And I've been fighting with my sexuality and stuff for years. At this point I'm like shit, this keeps happening in like all my relationships, I think I might be asexual and aromantic. The only reason my fiance and I are fine is because my fiance is also ace/aro so we get along in our relationship really really well. So I tell my partner this, and we break up but decide to continue to be friends. Everything seems fine.
Except it's not.
Like I mentioned, we met online, they live in our state but hours away. They're in an awful living situation. They need out, so we're trying to help find a new place they can afford. Nothing major. But it's starting to feel kind of like they're fully relying on us to find them a place. Their roommate is kicking them out because they don't really get along amazingly, and they don't have a lot of money so they're stuck.
In addition to relying on us to help them find a place, they're also constantly saying how we're the only people who care about them and they never want us to leave and they can't live without us. It feels like if we're not there when they're breaking down, they might kill themselves. Their mental health is kind of in the shitter and so is mine, but rather than feeling like we're supporting each other I feel like my every waking moment is being forced to focus on them and making sure they're okay. It's really taking a toll on me and I'm so exhausted, I keep having breakdowns, and I feel like I'm dying. Not only all this, but they're here to visit for roughly a week, and they're coming to an event with us that I was looking forward to, but now I'm dreading because being around them is so draining for me.
I'm at a loss and don't know what to do. I need to cut them out of my life, but my fiance is still dating them (I think possibly out of sympathy), I can't just force them to leave, and I feel like if I cut ties they're actually going to break and kill themselves. I feel trapped. I'm terrified, I'm breaking down, and I feel like an idiot. I just need someone's take on this. Thanks in advance.

tl;dr: unintentionally manipulative ex partner, now friend, is staying with myself and my fiance to escape their shit roommate, relying on us to help them get out of there, and emotionally manipulating me into staying friends. Killing my mental health, and making me want to die in the process. I'm stuck and don't know what to do.",20Jun2018,1

I've been recruiting for six years and I have always had the odd person with a fantastical story for why they can't go to their interview or accept a job offer. But lately I have been getting 100% back outs an hour before the interview (even phone interviews), with various medical excuses. I've had a heart attack, someone who had two heart attacks, an unspecified surgery, a Gastrointestinal issue that required hospitalization, and a bad back, this week alone. 

I typically recruit for mid to high level permanent positions that pay between 45K and 80K a year and provide benefits. My bosses are convinced that I just don't know how to do my job properly and so people are backing out an hour before and clients are reaching out to other agencies because none of our candidates are showing up for their interviews. 

I do an interview prep call with them 24 hours before their interview that comes with an email full of pointers and a good luck text the day of the interview. These all seem to go well, but the last 10 interviews I've sent over to clients have backed out an hour before hand leaving me holding the bag. I'm starting to think that all of these ailments aren't real and that at least a couple of them are lying. It's also frustrating that they wait until an hour before the interview and after confirming and preparing with me over the phone a second time after I prepare them for the interview.

Whenever he is uncomfortable about saying something (like after I compliment him or if we are in an argument) he'll say, ""Im really bad at this but..."" and then say something like thank you or sorry so I think maybe he is just too awkward to say it? Do you think I should ask him about it? Or should I wait until he says it to have sex with him?",20Jun2018,1
243,"I didn't really know where else to ask this, so I figured this subreddit would do.

So I'm 16 and this girl I'm in the same class with for 3hrs/week once randomly snapped me just when Easter vacation started. Tbh I first thought she had the wrong guy since we didn't really talk too much during class, but we chatted until evening. We chatted a few more times after that (with me initiating) and I eventually asked her if she wanted to meet up sometime that weekend, but she said she couldn't. Next week I asked her again and she said she couldn't that week nor the week after (she did say what she had to do both times though, not just an ""I can't""). Afterwards we didn't really talk anymore since I figured she'd initiate as well if she was interested. I caught her looking at me multiple times during class though and we often made eye contact, but never really talk. About 2 weeks ago though we had to do some kind of assignment in pairs with me sitting right behind her and she turned around to ask me and the one next to me what the correct pronunciation of some word was since she was arguing about that with the one next to her (during which she barely looked me in the eyes). When I replied she said ""Yeah, see! (to the one next to her) I like you!"".

So, I'm just really damn confused about this. I've never had a girlfriend, though I did try a few times. From the times I did talk with her she seemed like a pretty interesting person and I'd like to get to know her, even if it doesn't result in anything. Do you guys think she likes me? I don't want to be *that* guy who thinks eye contact is a marriage proposal.",20Jun2018,1
244,"So i moved to Belgium 2 years ago to marry my belgian girlfriend, plan was to marry abroad, and do her green card paperwork from this side of the pond. The process is moving along now, and i reckon we could be stateside in the next 6 months. However, i have a job i love here, with opportunity to grow, and am starting to get comfy. I dont have a degree so im scared im throwing away a good career. 

The general idea is to get her citizenship taken care of sooner rather than later (at least 5 years in the states first), so we can move freely between the EU and US when were older. 

I guess its a fucked up time for america at the moment, but am not worried too much about it to be honest. My wife had a masters degree and speaks 4 languages so i think she will make more money stateside than here, but when it comes down to it, general happiness is more important than money for us. 

So should we keep going on with the process, give the states a try and see what happens, or continue to live comfortably here but probably regret not going at some point in our lives. What would you do, reddit?

249,"Hey!

So as you can tell I'm a 4'8 girl. I'm 18 years old. I'm finishing school after this year and I'm super worried about prom. I dint really like parties etc. cause I don't really like drinking and that's not what my friends do. That's not my main worry though.

At 4'8 dresses are really hard to find and although I'm sure I could find one it will be hard. Shoes are the worst though? As I'm size 1 heels are max 2 inches normally so I'll be 4'10. All my friends will wear heels too but as they're normal sized they're wearing bigger ones. They're all between 5-9 and 6'3 ish in their heels so it's going to be super awkward with photos as I won't reach any of their shoulders. 

I'm also worried as I'm quite self conscious so being in a crowded room with the majority of people 6ft+ is going to be super hard for me. How should I deal with the inevitable comments about me being even smaller and people using me as an arm rest?

Thanks!

252,"Without getting too specific, I've been working in a corporate environment for the last 5 or 6 months. This is my first job ever (I'm a 23 year old grad), so I don't have much to compare it to, but I've never really liked it. 

Since basically the first month or two I've been thinking about quitting and getting back on the job hunt, or taking a vacation and then getting a new job (I have some savings), but I've been kind of giving it time to see if this job grows on me. But it hasn't.

Mind you, I don't hate it. It's gotten increasingly easier as I get used to it, but also more boring. Workplace culture is mediocre to nonexistent. Pay is real solid for a first job but nothing groundbreaking. I could probably find a new job within a few weeks of looking (I imagine), since my field is pretty marketable, but it's of course a gamble. I might not find another job soon, or a new job could suck.

256,"Hello! My husband and I have two kids and an almost 2 year old husky. We adopted him at 6 months old when he was saved during a raid of an abusive puppy mill. He is so healthy, smart, wonderful in every way. We have never missed a shot for him, we got him fixed, we take him to check ups very regularly, etc. We have an established doggy hotel for when we’re out of town, we walk him every 2-3 hours around the neighborhood, and take him to the dog park a couple times a week. 

The problem is, he seems very depressed at home. His appetite is fine, he will engage and play with us happily, and is always excited to go for a walk. But at home if we are busy and/or sleeping, he acts very depressed and lonely. He is either howling or sleeping. We pay a LOT of attention to him, but ya know, sometimes we have things to do. His vet said maybe we need to look into getting him a companion since he was older when we adopted him and was used to being around other dogs. 

Is this a good enough reason to adopt a second dog? Obviously we’d care for it just as well and love it, I’ve just never had two dogs and don’t know if the stress multiplies in the same way it does with children. We can afford it, and I’m a stay at home mom so I am home more than I’m not. I’m just nervous because I don’t want to bring another dog home and it be unhappy too.

A bit of background, I have one older sibling and my Mom does not sleep in the same room as my Dad due to some disagreements (like my Dad snores really loudly and doesn't turn on the ac even when it's really hot.) So my Mom has been sleeping together with me for almost my whole life. 
It's starting to really get on my nerves as I have to conform to her sleeping patterns and I really want my own private space. 
My older sister similarly wanted her own room and got it when she was 18 as well. (Previously the three of us slept together.) Unfortunately my house only has 3 rooms - my sisters room, mine and my mothers room and my fathers room. Hence unless my mother migrates back to my fathers room, there is not really another option.
I have spoken with my parents about it on numerous occasions, but my Mom seems unwilling to share a room with my Father. Sometimes they also shrug me off by changing the topic or simply walking away saying they need to do something else. They have talked about remodelling the house to create more rooms, but to be honest, I think it is all bull and they will never do it. I don't know how to convey my point with more seriousness without coming off as rude.

Our parents are absolutely horrible. They are alcoholics, they hit us with belts when they are angry at something, they steal our earned money and so on. They used to only abuse our older brother, they simply used him as a punching bag for their anger, he ran away when he was 18. He started contacting us and our parents but our parents didn't want to hear of him until they realized that he is somewhat rich.

We started talking on skype and our parents would always be sober and nice when we were talking to him just so he would send us money for various things but instead our parents would just waste that money on alcohol. I once logged onto my skype account on our computer and was only able to tell my brother that things were now that good here. Once our parents discovered that  they beat me. So since then I was afraid to tell my brother anything.

Me and my parents are getting poorer and poorer every day even though our brother sends us about 3000$ every month, they waste everything on partying and alcohol and I have to go work in a supermarket to get us some food.

About few weeks ago I used my friend's phone to contact my brother and told him absolutely everything. He said that he will come to visit us when he can and he said that he will get us out of there in no time. He told us to stay strong till then and he will think of something.

261,"Often times I get motivated to try out a new hobby or skill. I'll do some research, pick a handful of tutorials and online courses, then make a big to-do list of goals. I might get through one or two of the tutorials/courses and maybe check off one of the goals but I usually get burned out before I even get anywhere. Occasionally I will stick with it for a decent amount of time but it feels like a chore; not something that I enjoy doing daily. Then I'll get depressed for awhile, feel like a failure because I couldn't get anywhere. Then I'll repeat the cycle; which I'm feeling like I'm about to do fairly soon.

In case that was vague I'll give an example of a hobby I tried to get into. A few years ago I became very interested in game development. I learned to program in college; when I became fairly comfortable with it I started to try and teach myself how to make games. I tried on and off for a few years repeating that cycle I mentioned above. Got a bunch of tutorials that I thought were finally going to make it click and I could make a cool game I was proud of. Realize I'm not figuring it out, get depressed and give up for a few months. Cycle repeats.

I've gone through this cycle with other things as well. Drawing, writing, learning a language, pixel art, world building, electric guitar(still going on this one 9 years now), disc golf, the list goes on. Some I've spent years on, some only lasted a couple weeks. But all of these things never click no matter what way I try to approach them.

Well i have been in college since graduating high school and i am just tired of it. I changed my major about 4 or 5 times, i never took a semester off and cant seem to het ahead, i dont even have my associates degree. I could not pass chem which was the only class i needed to get it. Failed it like 5 times. I was in one college for about 5 years trying to pass never wanting to give up because thats not me. My gpa slipped a lot and i changed my major to what i actually think i love to do which is computer science.

Now thats i switched however i needed a gpa of 3.0 i was at 2.0 and with so many F’s it would be impossible to get my gpa high enough, so what do i do? I transferred colleges to reset it. Now i am at a 2 year college trying to get my associates still, and i just finished my first semester there, i got all A’s. I think because of the different environment and me wanting to actually pass got me through that. What bothers me the most though is that not a lot of credits transferee over so i got about 2 semesters to go before i actually get my associates, and then transfer to a four year were i can get my bachelors.   I think it will take me about 2 and a half years to get it.

It makes me soo annoyed that i could not graduate on time and walk down that asile and make my family proud i would have been the first but now i gotta wait another 2 years. I wish i realized then what i know now, but i guess with age comes wisdom right?

I don’t know where I’m getting at, I lost my point I just don’t know how to deal with her anymore but she’s really sensitive so I can’t just say I’m not going to talk to you anymore your too negative, I just kind of have to TRY to be positive towards her while she blatantly ignores anything positive that I say....help.

288,"I was at the optometrist, and I was struggling so hard to not bust out laughing at the way he talked, his mannerisms, and the ""1 or 2?"" part. It felt so surreal! When he looked at me at one point, I looked away and grinned a big grin. It was SO hard to keep a straight face. I didn't want to seem like an insensitive jerk.

I also have a bad habit of thinking of triggers that make me laugh in the wrong situations. I always seem to take the neural pathway that does that in the wrong situations. I'll think ""Hey. Someone is talking to me..Ah crap."" or ""Hey, I'm in public. I forgot about that..Ah crap."" The ""Ah crap"" is in reference to the neural signal taking the route of the trigger.

I'll crack jokes in situations like that to help alleviate the discomfort. I crack easy, because I don't know how to regulate my emotions. The emotions bubble to the surface like a pot that's about to overflow.

291,"So last week my friend texts me and she is very upset because she thinks her boyfriend (who she tells me shes in love) with is cheating on her. They are both only 17 and its clear to everybody but her that he doesnt feel the same way about her so i was convinced but she wasnt fully convinced herself... until she guesses his snapchat password on the 2nd try and finds messages with one of his exs from before they were dating up until the same day she was reading them. the messages clearly indicating he cheated like he wasnt even trying to be any type of discreet. I meen he actually said it himself that he doesnt care about her in the messages.

She confronted him over text and he leaves her on read for the entire day and she even got screenshots of him saying he doesnt care about her finding out and he was gonna just move on.


This has happened before so i thought it would be the end of it but she starts telling me she doesnt want to live anymore and how every guy does this to her and then after hours of comforting her trying to cheer her up by reminding her shes fucking 17 and so is he and she should stop looking for something so serious right now.. But instead she sends HIS MOTHER a paragraph about how he did her wrong and how she still has feelings for him. I told her how stupid and unnecessary it was and that she should move on but she went from being devastated about him cheating to being really sad that he isnt texting her back trying to get her back.

So her mother reads the text the next morning and texts back that she didnt raise her son like this so she was gonna force him to make it right or she would take his phone and make him stay in the house all summer and all the rest of this typical punishments moms give their teens so sure enough he texts back apologizing and that he wants to make it better with a weak ass paragraph that didnt take up half her screen so she responds with  3 fucking essays about how he fucked up but everybody fucks up and how she still wants to make it work...

Again i told her how stupid it was and that he doesnt care about her  and is only doing this for his mom but she didnt wanna hear it and told me she doesnt want to hear my opinion on the situation anymore cas she wants all happy thoughts about the idea of her getting back together with him. Also she tells me specifically that she isnt in love anymore and she just wants to give him another chance and if it goes bad she wont get hurt.

A Week passes and after just not thinking about it i wake up and she posted 36 pictures in a night on her spam account which she has never done before even tho it is a spam account. But every. single. one. is about how she is back in love and she is posting wedding rings trying to hint to him  i guess and it brought the whole thing back into my mind and its all i can think about and i cant focus at work because i know the heartbreak is coming and none of her friends think shes crazy they all are fully supporting it so im probably the one whos gonna have to deal with her when she doesnt wanna be alive again and i just cant right now. I already have anxiety and I just got out of a month where i was so depressed i actually didnt go outside for 2 weeks just stayed in bed so im not actually equipped to deal with another depressed friend... I want her to end it before she catches him cheating again because im 99% sure it will happen because he isnt the smartest kid.  

I dont know what i expect from you guys because this is my first time here but im her closest guy friend and the only friend she comes to for serious problems and advice so i thought i should atleast try here. 

-Also i want to add that her past 3 boyfriends have also cheated on her which is why i think she was devastated thinking all of it is her fault.",20Jun2018,1
292,"I feel like I chose this major only because of the potential money I could make after I'm done with it and because of the hard-ons adults get when they hear that that's what I'm taking. 

I just feel like I'm lying to myself. Computers have always been pure entertainment for me. I never cared much about programming or about math. What tickles my willy is biology, behavioral science, psychology, history and other things. But not comp sci. I want to be an intellectual, well rounded person, even if my paycheck isn't so glamorous. I wanted to go to university to broaden my horizons, to have time to volunteer for the community, to set some time aside for hobbies and develope myself as a man. Comp sci is a packed shit show of maths and other unspeakable horrors. 

I would take my choice back and go do what I like, but the thing is, I went to a university that isn't considered the best, yet it's the only one that would let me take comp sci. And I also paid a lot of money for a year in the dorms. I signed the contract and I feel like I'm fucked now.

298,"I don't want to bore people to tears with paragraph after paragraph of my concerns so I'll try to keep things short and sweet, but there is a lot to get through as I have a number of issues which are really impacting me living a healthy, happier life. I also don't have a huge support network, so I'm hoping (praying?) people here can fill in that gap. I do see a counselor.

I appear to have a very difficult time establishing good relationships with people, and whilst I understand people tend to come and go in life...I seem to have experienced this more-so than others. I show genuine interest in other people and sure enough I can make some pretty good friends, but more often than not these new-found connections are short-lived and I find myself very much alone with very few people to talk to or spend time with. What few, genuine friends I do have seem to think the world of me, but they don't really make much of an effort to keep in contact or plan anything. Unfortunately, I find myself getting upset and a little jealous when I see more outgoing people thriving off their social success, and feeling I can never achieve such.

By extension to the above, I've also made a number of toxic ""friendships"" over the years which have hurt my self-esteem / confidence. I've cut all of these people out of my life, but I'm left feeling empty or second-guessing myself as to whether or not I'm a good person, because they make me feel this way. A couple of examples would be a female friend who turned an entire social group against me (no idea how, either) and another friend who completely fell out with me for, erm...leaving a night club early.

My first love, who I had a relationship for four years, falsely accused me of emotional and implied sexual abuse. I was devastated when this happened and spent the few years since then seeking therapy / counselling. There have never been repercussions from this accusation other than my own internal bullying / fear, and everyone who knew me at the time were by my side. My second love, who I dated for six months, was a much better partner in general but whom I ended things with when it was clear she was not over an ex. She was with someone else soon after. Despite both of these relationships occurring years ago, I find myself depressed over what I've lost and upset that I may have been forgotten or the good parts of our relationship / me ignored.

My current dating life is, well, non-existent. I've tried dating online and off, ranging from attempting to establish a serious relationship to simply a casual hookup, and I've had no success in any of these areas. I've had my profiles reviewed, spoken to friends and family, spoken to people online, hired a dating coach...and all of them have told me I'm a great guy, very attractive, have a lot going for him...all of which I always thought would have given me some advantage. It's knocked my confidence certainly, which in itself is an issue, but it's very disheartening to read stories or even witness myself how easily people seem to find casual sex or a date. I do go out clubbing / to bar regularly but have never made contact with a woman in these settings (and am seemingly invisible to women in general), and online although I do get a fair number of matches they never translate into anything.

My family is dysfunctional and has been for years. A conflict between my mother and father has been ongoing since I was around twelve years of age, and they are ignorant to any effect it may have had on my upbringing. It often feels that I am trying to keep the family together by listening to their rants, but on the flip-side they also don't appear to take me seriously or treat me like an adult. A lot of what I have achieved has been done off my own back, as my parents were never truly supportive (and would often try to put me off things, for example going to university).

I was bullied as a child in high school. Enough said about that, really.

Despite all of this, I seem to do very well in life. I used to have severe social anxiety which, over the last few years, I've managed to overcome and put myself into situations I never thought possible. I have achieved very highly in my academic endeavors and the organisations I have worked for (I have done a TON of volunteer work) have praised my efforts, resulting in me being mentioned in articles, invited to interviews or to give talks etc. People have expressed how proud of me they are and have told me how much of an amazing person I am. I've been told many times, specifically and without prompting, that I come across as a confident, kind, intelligent and interesting person, and have also heard it mentioned that I'm ""very popular"". Throughout counselling / therapy it has never been alluded to or even outright said that I have something fundamentally wrong with me, in fact I've often been told I'm an emotionally mature, sensible, kind-hearted, intelligent guy who ""will go far in life"" and whom ""will be fine"". In life I don't really aspire to much; I simply want to live a happy, comfortable life and have a decent amount of social / dating success as well as begin a career in teaching, but it forever seems to be out of reach.

Thoughts? Advice? If anyone knows of any other sub-reddits to post this in, that would be great too.

TL;DR

I have a lot of issues in life which I am unable to address because I don't truly know what, if anything, I am doing wrong. A lot of negative things have effected my self-esteem / confidence, but I have also come leaps and bounds from who I once was.

He was surprised because he’s never seen me before and these are his exact words: “You’re damn beautiful!” Which he kept on saying in between sentences. He also said exactly this as I left: “This is definitely not the last time we’ll see each other.”

311,"Hi all, this is my first time on this sub. Let me know if I've done anything wrong. I am usually on r/relationships but this doesn't seem right for there.

Here's the situation. I work as the administrative assistant for my workplace (a small organization), and among other things I answer the phone. Everyone who calls our main number either gets me, or if I am on another call (or otherwise busy) they get a recording prompting them to dial 1 for out list of staff extensions, etc. etc. Because I answer so many calls, I have a set greeting I use, and I work to make my tone clear and pleasant (but not chipper).

But while I have gotten compliments on my telephone voice, I also get people thinking I am a recording. Sometimes they interrupt me to state the name of the person they want to talk to, so I get cut off with ""JOHN SMITH"" yelled at me. Even more often, I am cut off with ""Are you a real person?"" or just ""Are you a ROBOT?"" right in the middle of my sentence.

For reference, here is my greeting:

""Good \[morning/afternoon\], you've reached \[name of organization\]. This is \[my first name\] speaking, how can I help you?"" 

I don't see how I could make it more clear that I am a person. I give them my NAME and ask how I can help! I don't want to stop naming the organization because we get a lot of wrong number calls based on people googling badly. Also in the recorded greeting, callers hear ""thank you for calling \[organization\]"" and then the menu, so my spoken greeting is different. I don't know if I can alter my tone to sound more ""human,"" this is just my voice. I don't have a strong accent. I don't have vocal fry or uptalk. 

How can I make this stop? What do I say in response other than ""uh yes, I am a real person""? I HATE being interrupted like that. It's jarring and rude. Has anyone else had this problem?

School ends in two weeks time and I(M14) want to ask out this girl(F14) but therein lies the problem.

First of all the entire year knows I have a crush on her(obviously including her) which makes it very awkward, we barely know each other because I’m very shy around her and we never talk(I’m usually very outgoing and energetic to others), most of my friends say we’re in similar leagues however she is usually the quite type and me on the other hand is the loudmouthed type, and I’m pretty sure she thinks I’m a creep.

So what do I do, do I go for it and risk rejections(a pretty high chance) or just wait till school ends and next year I might not have a crush on her anymore?

320,"I live in the US, a country that is very aware of the opioid crisis it is currently having. My mother has multiple sclerosis, an illness causing her immune system to turn against itself. Along with this she has depression, rheumatoid arthritis, and an issue that I do not know the name of relating to the consistency of her blood. I know that this seems like an extreme combination, or like I'm lying for Internet points, but I swear to you, this is an honest cry for help. The situation that is created by her combination of illnesses is that she is in constant agonizing pain, and cannot take typical pain relievers such as Aspirin and Advil because they thin her blood. She was on several serious pain medications which, yes, were opioids. She took them as instructed and they did not make her feel loopy. With the new regulations on opioids, my mother is now no longer allowed to have her medication in a dose that actually does anything to help her pain. While this may not accomplish anything, I want to write to someone higher up. My faith in the government is not the strongest, but I would be a fool if I did not at least \*try\* to express how my mother's condition has made her an unfortunate collateral exception in this system, and cry for some form of help. If I were to do this, however, I would have no idea who to write to. Does anyone have any advice?",20Jun2018,3
322,"I was super close friends with this girl for over two years, but we both kind of stopped talking to each other at the same time (a little over a year ago). 

We’ve talked a little here and there and we’re still on really good terms, but we don’t associate with each other anymore. Probably because in a nutshell I’m an “old soul” introverted type and she’s a young, wild, and free extroverted type. 

I just talked to her briefly in public and we caught up a little bit and I realized how much I miss her, but idk if being “bffs” is really in the cards for us or not.

327,"I was in a super small fender bender and the other driver said she didn't want to go through insurance because her car had basically no damage. She mentions if she needs to get it fixed, she'd contact me and let me know how much the auto body shop estimates the damage to be worth. This was my first accident so I was completely unaware of what information to provide and what information to withhold. She asks for my phone number just in case she does have to go to a shop to get it fixed and asks to take a photo of my license (did not take a photo of my plate) so I idiotically agree, thinking it's standard stuff. I did not take down any information, which is incredibly stupid of me, and only snapped a photo of her car's license plate. 

It's been a full day since it's happened and I just looked up what someone can do with your driver's license information, which is apparently identify theft. I don't know what steps to now take to ensure that the identity theft doesn't occur, would anyone happen to know? I've read that you can file a police report that your license was lost or stolen to have a paper trail of possible identity theft but I don't think that would be applicable in this instance.

Once I asked her she said yes but also told me she would have to ask her father for permission.

The next day she says her dad thinks she is not mature enough. I asked to talk to him but she tells me I shouldn't because her and her dad have decided she needs more time. Despite the fact that it really bummed me out I told her to take all the time she needed. I kinda hoped it would take a week or something but it has been over a month and still no update. My mom told me that when my day asked her to be his girlfriend she asked for more time too, but told him yes the very next day.

Me and this girl talk pretty much everyday (despite the fact she is over in San Diego for the summer) and I know she likes me because she told me so herself when I first told her how I felt and her friends have told me in the past that she likes me.

331,"Between mutual friends and social media, I’ve heard that my first girlfriend’s life has really gone to shit lately. Her boyfriend of several years left her once he discovered she wanted to get married, and now she’s living alone in a house really far away from all of her family and friends and evidently she’s turned to heavy drinking as a coping mechanism. Last Wednesday evening she called me, and though we haven’t been together in almost half a decade, I recognized her number and answered. I said hello and asked if she was okay, but she hung up without saying anything. I’m happily married, and told my wife about the situation and she was fine with it.

Now my main reason for posting is to see where I would need to go from here to get further involved in the medical field. I’ve already been looking into universities that will give me the best education that’s affordable (once my post 9/11 gi bill runs out.) My most desired school is PACE University in NY, NY but the problem lies in getting there. When I was in high school I didn’t have the best of grades, concentration and constant depression from bullying paid its toll on me (low end of the spectrum with a 1.75 gpa) After high school I went to a community college part time and performed very well, but I was also in much better shape and had a steady flow of income from working full time.

I guess the main things I’m looking for are; What do I need to do to be able to attend the university I want to?; Will I need to go to a community college to get my grades up before transferring to PACE U?; Should I plan to take an SAT prep course, an SAT and an ACT?; and what should I try to study while preparing for my high end goal of Med school?

344,"I was going to the dentist and getting nitrous oxide for some routine dental work.  I found that when I would have the dental work done with nitrous oxide, I could easily see the answers to all of my problems in life.  I later found that you could buy nitrous oxide online in small cartridges.

I bought some nitrous oxide online, inhaled small cartridges (through the use of a balloon) and would write down the answers to my problems.  I was adjusting and growing and fixing many things in my life.  At one point my intuition told me to put on soft meditation music.  The insights were more profound.  I was inhaling small doses,just a couple cartridges a week, each cartridge was 8 grams.  I would wear an eye mask, meditate for 10 minutes first, and later, inhale and hold the nitrous and relax and let insights come to me.

 My method was to take several slow and deep breaths of air, and relax.  I would then take one breath in as large as possible into the belly, and slowly let all of the air out, so that my lungs were as empty as possible (this takes practice and work, and most people would describe it as painful or at least uncomfortable, but I wasn’t scared and didn’t find it uncomfortable)  after completely exhaling all air that I could possibly get out, I would in one big gulp, (by relaxing my diaphragm or lungs or something) ingest the entire 8g (one medium sized balloon) in less than 1 second, then hold it and relax.  The more relaxed I was, the longer I could hold it.  There was never ever any sensation of panic, fear, pain, or the feeling of wanting to breathe (I feel like my body had probably shifted in metabolism and/or blood/oxygen flow).  I felt like I could hold it for minutes, and one friend once told me that my lips would turn blue.  One particularly relaxing time something interesting happened, my lungs or diaphragm or something (all while I was 100&amp;#37; conscious) relaxed, and allowed for a slow, comfortable exhale, this seemed to be completely beyond my control, and I was still completely conscious and I hadn’t decided to exhale yet.  Then I was taken to a deep world of nitrous oxide insight.  Supreme bliss, peace, and calmness, all while still being very conscious and aware of the world around me (although I had on an eye mask, and meditative music). Many of my muscles relaxed, and went limp (while I could have \[and sometimes did\] stopped my muscles from going limp, I merely used my meditative knowledge to just observe and not change anything)  The high would slowly be less intense, and then after several minutes of breathing room air, I would repeat the process, each time the high being more intense, and I would observe more muscles relaxing (going limp) and I would have deep profound insights into the workings of my human body and mind.  

After I finished this session, I was the most relaxed I had ever been in my entire life, my mind and heart felt that they had oceans of new space to allow for compassion, love, effort, school work, friendship, etc.  For days after that experience my closest friends noted a marked change in my outlook on life, compassion, and ability to not become upset or frustrated.  

I repeated several sessions over weeks and realized that I had been mildly anxious my entire life, and now I had met an extreme of calmness and relaxation that was sublime during the moment, and the long lasting after-effects of calmness relaxation and love were powerful.  I realized that some people operate everyday of their daily life in a mild panic state, and that some people carry out their lives in a calmer and healthier state.  Deep wisdom was imparted on me that a lifetime of operating in a panic state would be detrimental on so many levels (physical, mental, emotional, societal, school, work etc)

I would occasionally be in a slightly exhausted or frustrated mood and decide to inhale one cartridge.  I would go through the ritual of soft music, meditation and eye mask, then inhale one cartridge, and be taken to a universe of deep relaxation, I’d come back to reality with boundless energy, serenity and the ability to focus.  One time the thought struck me that maybe it was dangerous to go so immediately from a frustrated state to such a peaceful state in the flick of a switch.

I am sure that I was tapping into new hormones, parasympathetic nervous system, vagus nerve, etc.

One day I had an overwhelmingly frustrating soccer game, I was amped up, extremely angry and frustrated (about as angry as I ever would get in life) I went home and was unhappy that I was so frustrated, and decided to inhale a nitrous canister and meditate on why I had allowed myself to get so frustrated.

I inhaled the gas, held it, held it, held it, and my muscles never relaxed, never let go, my lungs were burning, I exhaled sharply and quickly took many deep breaths as if i was out of breath, it was so bizarre, I had only held it for maybe 20 seconds (I would often hold it for a minute or more) and I had felt the strong desire to exhale and breathe for the first time ever in any of my uses of nitrous oxide.  I tried again with the same result, nothing happened, no high, no deep insights, only the strong desire to breathe as soon as I had inhaled the nitrous.

I never was able to get high from Nitrous again.

I tried every other day, a few cartridges, every time with failure to get high, and failure for my diaphragm to relax and exhale without my conscious control (which was my goal).  Eventually after about a week or two of trying every other day, on one holding of nitrous in my lungs, my ears started to ring and I felt like I had been punched in the face, my nose felt pressure, and I felt panic, I (without control or thought) got up and sprinted out of the room in a terror state. “Woah wtf?!”  I was shaking and terrified, definitely my flight/fight system had been activated.  I rested and tried again the next day and after holding my breath for only 10 seconds of nitrous, the same thing happened, terror, ringing in ears, panic, etc.  Over months every once in a while I would try, with the same result, the most extreme terror I ever experienced in my life, all just from a few seconds of holding my breath with nitrous.  If I would try a 2nd or 3rd time in the same day, the terror and ringing in ears and pressure in my head would be worse.  I felt like my head had so much pressure that it was gonna burst.  

   
Once I think I had a seizure, I was playing a song and trying to do dose of nitrous when I felt like I got stuck in the song, and I felt fireworks go off in my front of my head above my forehead, maybe it lasted from 5 to 45 seconds, where I had no control over my body and was convulsing kind of, it really hurt at the front top of my head, and felt like sparks/fireworks/electrical overload. 

I eventually gave up on Nitrous Oxide, but had persisting facial aches, around the lips, teeth, jaw, with ringing in the ears, and inability to concentrate.  These face aches have continued now for almost 2 years.  I get face aches most days,  sometimes the pain is mild 2/10 and sometimes it reachers 8/10. 

Now when I have facial pain my oxygen saturation and heart rate remain normal.

Coincidentally I noticed that when I take alprazolam (xanax) for fear of flying, it immediately and completely resolves all symptoms for the rest of the day. 

Things that make the facial pain less severe:

Xanax,

Full body Ice water immersion for several minutes

Sleep,

Relaxation yoga

Meditation

Strenuous exercise

Face massage

Things that make facial pain worse:

Alcohol

Caffeine

Lack of sleep

Stress

Dehydration

Hours of schoolwork

My theories on what the problem could be:

INTRACRANIAL COMPRESSION OF THE TRIGEMINAL NERVE

Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity

Dysautonomia

I am confident that the symptoms that I am having are due to hypoxia/anoxia, not due to the nitrous oxide itself.  I notice that when I do have facial pain, the muscles in my lips/mouth/jaw are constantly flexed, and if I focus, I can relax them with my mind which relieves a little bit of the pain.

I have seen a couple neurologists (but I wasn’t transparent about my history with nitrous)  who just recommend SSRI’s which I refused because the side effects listed were atrocious.  I have tried vitamin b12 supplementation and injection, it didn’t help.

How can I start on getting rid of this facial pain?  Any idea what my diagnosis actually is?  Is there a doctor or specialist I can see? I am willing to travel to anywhere in the world if someone can help me.

Thanks in advance.

Tldr: i have facial aches likely due to repeated episodes of hypoxia, how can I get rid of them?",20Jun2018,1
345," So... I'm 20. I made some money working for 8 months. I barely used any of it. Not to grab, just for the answer, besides I don't think its much. I got 9k€.

I want to move out of my house. That's why I start working. I have toxic parents. I quit my job, due to the lack of time. It consumed me 13h per day because of the location. I couldn't study at all. I read while I was on the BUS. But always 1 trip (go home / go work) had lights off ( plus I was tired the later days in the week, and when lights were on when back to home, I was also tired because of the work, althrough i kept on pushing, I was just not that effective)

My plan now is to find a room or some place where I can study. I like programming I really do. I started when I was working but I read mostly about self help.

Do you know any place on Europe where I can do this type of thing. I live in Portugal where the lifestyle is cheap. But I'm kinda ignorant about this. I searched a lot. I heard there's dorms in America where you can study, they offer you sleep and food for money, even tho I prefer Europe, I can't find any of it.

I don't mind using this money to invest in myself I just don't want to be here anymore. I got divorced parents and well my stepmom is really hard to deal with. And my mom is literally all the time being annoying, complainning about whatever I do. Seriously really. Makes me overwhelmed. I learned mindfullness and I keep on practicing it. It helps me a lot. But also I need to move. For me.

Now what I need to know is. Do you know how could I make this happen with the amount I have. I think 2 years is enough and I would get a job or part-time close by in those 2 years. I don't have much specifications and those are low, yet I don't mind working in whatever(tiring = part-time, relaxing = fulltime/part-time, although at the beggining I really take whatever). The job I was in, I worked really well and hard. I was well seen there. I could move close, but still I needed to buy a car then and the type of job is very tiring and needed to be fulltime.

Last time he pulled up next to us, got my passenger to roll down his window and screamed at me like ""how dare you who do you think you are I have insurance I hope you have insurance because if I hit you you'd be paying"" etc. today a similar thing happened where I needed to make a turn.

351,"I'm a 20 year old male. I just finished my third year of college. I was going for a Biology degree. I've been doing poorly in my classes. In my science classes, I've mostly received C's, D's, and a few F's. I even did a little poorly in a few of my Gen-eds. My GPA was a 2.6 at the end of last term. It's not that the work was ever difficult, I just simply never had enough interest to study and do my work. I started losing interest in school the further I went.

I wasn't premed. I never wanted to go to Medical School to become a doctor. I thought about PA school, but I wasn't sure. I thought about becoming a nurse. I was thinking about leaving my university and enrolling in my local community college to take prerequisite classes for nursing programs. But now, I'm not sure if I even want to do that.

I only went because I saw no other option and my mother kind of pressured me to go. I didn't even know what to major in. I just picked Biology and went on from there. Even if I wanted to go to professional school or nursing school, my grades are too poor to get into a reputable program.

I've never had a job. I still don't have my driver's license. I suffer with social anxiety and possibly ADHD. Having social anxiety and ADHD can really hinder me as far as with career aspects. No one wants a nurse or other professional that's an introvert with no people skills. I've lost my scholarship twice for not being able to maintain the GPA requirement.

I just don't think I'm in the right frame of mind to be in school right now. I shouldn't be in school if I don't know what direction I'm going. That's just wasting my time and money.

I'm thinking about taking a few years off from school to work full-time, probably volunteer on the side, learn how to drive, and get my mental health in order. But most importantly I want to try to find my passion in life.

I'm $17,000 in debt right now. I know my student loans are going to be due in a few months. If I don't go back to school next year I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and use up my grace period. If I can find a full-time job before repayment starts, I can start paying the loans off. I think this may be a better alternative than wasting time in school with no direction on what I want to do.

I would like to hear what you guys think. Do you think it's best for me to take time off to get my life together or just continue?",20Jun2018,1

360,"first off, hello everyone.

a few months ago i was dating this girl that i had met on the internet. this girl was the most beautiful, sensual, cute, smart, interesting, talented, and thoughtful woman i’ve ever met. and by dating, of course, i mean dating online. we talked nonstop every day, did video calls, the whole 9 yards (as she lives across the country.) we were madly in love and knew everything about each other. i had a few relationships before her that were much longer, yet i had never felt true love before i was with this girl. she felt the same way about me. things were going great for a while, but then we had a fight over the smallest of things, and it turned into a huge shitshow that eventually ended up in a breakup. we both exhibited bad qualities and hurt each other, and both reacted in a really bad way. 

later on, we started talking again from time to time, slowly fixing our relationship as people. we both were aware that we would always love each other, and that no fight could destroy our love, even though we weren’t together anymore. we kept in touch, and would occasionally talk. then, yesterday, she sent me a video that was only intended as a little goofy clip to watch, but when i heard her voice and saw her body, it just sent me back to that magical, unreal place that i had lived in before. i instantly told her this. what happened next crushed me. we went on to talk about how we would love to date again, but doing it online just wasn’t going to work for either of us. we both needed the physical support in addition to the emotional. of course, the issue with that is that we live across the country from each other with no possible way of getting to the other side. i realized that there was no way that we could be together at this point in life, and that i needed to move on. 

when this hit me, it hit me like a bus. tears instantly started rushing down my face at a rate that i had never seen before. i also realized that she had figured this out earlier, and that’s why the initial breakup had fucked her up so much more than it had to me. i couldn’t stop crying, and she kept saying that it was her fault and that she was sorry. but there was no other option, i needed to move on. how do i do that? how do i just turn off the passion i have for the one woman that i love the most? she is my everything, i would take every bullet in the world for her in a heartbeat, i would give my life and my everything for her. how do i just put that aside and look for other love? i feel so helpless and fatigued, and it couldn’t have come at a better time, because today is my birthday. i just need some help here. anything from you guys is appreciated so much :’) thank you.",20Jun2018,1

Me, personally I’m about ready to burst out saying it but I’m a little skeptical. Every time that theres a moment, a good moment to say it I always tell myself “no, its not time yet.” Im just having the hardest time getting it out without also knowing he’s on the same page or who should really be the one to say it first.

I’ll be going back to school in the fall, but it got me thinking about this particular girl in mind.

The college that I go to is a division one school meaning the sport is televised. The girl that I’m crushing on please women’s basketball. When I see cameras are on her when she gets on the basketball court I literally look at the TV and ask some of my friends how I could get her. At this point she looks way out of my league and she gets quite of media attention, but not like a whole lot compared to other players though. Sometimes I go to the actual game to watch her play, but I really want to talk to her and I don’t know the best way to approach. Is just better for me to approach her before a game or after? Is there any possible way to physically get closer to her so I could get her attention or that will be difficult?

370,"My boyfriend and I moved into a second floor apartment in October 2017, we only have one apartment above us and one below. For months we never had any problems whatsoever with any of the other tenants and we pretty much keep to ourselves. Randomly when I had a friend over, the woman living downstairs politely knocked on the door and asked us to quiet down. We didn’t think we were being loud, but apologized anyway and watched our volume. There were two other incidences before today but I don’t remember the order of them. Anyway, one of the times I was listening to music at 3am a little too loudly and they called the police. I hadn’t realized they could hear it so I apologized to the officer and turned it off immediately and fully admit my fault to it. The other time it was around 1am and I had been laying on the couch watching tv at a reasonable volume for several hours, only having gotten up to use the bathroom and get a glass of water. The woman and her husband came to the door complaining to me about my “excessive” noise, to which I replied that I had been sitting on the couch for hours. She got annoyed but was being generally respectful. Almost six months went by after that with no complaint until today. After I woke up I started doing normal daytime things - watering my plants, vacuuming, doing laundry, making lunch, etc. A bit before noon the woman and her husband came to the door. She was raising her voice at me to the point where I’d call it yelling telling me to “stop jumping around like a 4 year old”. I was upset but kept my cool saying that at the point where she came up I hadn’t gotten up from the couch in an hour. Her husband asked me “where’s your man at?” and before I could answer she nudged him away saying, “go away, this is between her and I” . She said she could tell people what tv shows we watched, hear my boyfriend playing guitar at 2am (which is an outright lie because he’s not even finished work by then), etc. When she left I went and explained what happened to my boyfriend and called my mom to see what she thought. Based on previous interactions we decided to file a police report just to make them aware in case something happens again. The officer told us they knew who the couple were from previous domestic disputes and is going to call the couple and our landlord to get the story straight (and to tell them both that if they’re the only ones with a problem that they just need to move). 

We’ve taken more than enough measures to cater our lives to their complaints and we’re just done being nice to these people.

374,"I posted previously here so you can look at that post for more details on why she is. TLDR: I royally fucked up and cheated on her and our relationship is long distance as was the cheating and I put an end to the cheating because I felt horrible about it.
She can’t trust me anymore now. She stresses a lot about me cheating on her again and I try to tell her that it was a horrible mistake and that I never should have and never will do it again, but I don’t think she ever believes me. We’ve been together for a year and a half and have many amazing memories together, but she can’t reminisce on them because it reminds her of the cheating. I have a feeling she’s holding a lot of things back and doesn’t want to tell me a lot. She has grown more and more self conscious and shy and rude, things I helped her with before this mess started. I asked her if she still loves me and she said she doesn’t know. She means the world to me and I love her with all of my heart. I’d do anything to keep her. Outside of the hole I dug for myself by cheating, we were always so happy together and we were the perfect match; we have similar interests, taste in music, humor, and values. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should let her go so that she’s happy, or to try to mend our relationship and show her that I will never cheat on her again and that we can still be happy together. I’ve never loved anyone as much as I love her and I want her to be happy, but I’m scared.

Let me stop there for a moment and say that I’m not suicidal, but suicide keeps harboring my thoughts, if that makes any sense.

I won’t go into details, but I nearly always go an extra mile for people I barely know. It makes me feel good, knowing that other people have what they need for their show..

But it’s not enough happiness. Day in and day out I wake up and think “is today the day my dreams come true?” But every day it’s like I’m getting older and that time has already come and gone. 

I have no family here. Just friends. My family is all ripped apart across the United States. We all live in different parts of the country. We used to all be together. Now I can’t even go see my mother or father to get advice. I miss them terribly. What I wouldn’t give to be able to go have lunch with one of my parents and tell them what I’m telling you guys here. Phone calls aren’t enough. 

I think my girlfriend is falling out of love with me, and for the most part I feel it’s an effect of everything else in my life turning to shit.

At night we normally keep him in the kitchen but lately while he’s been ill he’s been very restless at nights meaning he refuses to go to sleep constantly barking and whining and scratching at the door. The only way to stop him is by letting him out t come into our rooms to lie near us.

Unfortunately when we do this he often pants all night and licks the carpet (it’s a stress thing apparently) and no one can sleep, he also tends to have accidents on the carpet too.

381,"I’m not sure where to start but I would like some advice on how to approach this. My sister is 8 years old and is about to enter the second grade. She doesn’t have the best handwriting and that’s fine because she’s a kid. However she has trouble with reading and writing. Whenever she has trouble with one word, she will not try to sound it out or spell it or anything. Sometimes she will read it but say a different word instead. For example, she might be reading the word “water” and instead of saying water she’d say where. 

Her reading level in terms of books that we get for her are “My first reading” type books. She throws tantrums when I want her to read more than just 2-3 books like dad would suggest. She says that it’s her choice on how many books she reads and she’s already read enough so can’t she go watch television. She also is now saying that “my friend says that god says it’s my choice” and is pouting. When I took the remote away earlier, she went to her room and cried for half an hour very loudly. I don’t know what to do. My parents have always let her do what she wants as long as she does the minimum. She had to do summer school for first grade if she wanted to go on to the second grade. 

I ask her if she can show me that her handwriting has improved by asking her to rewrite something that she had written earlier this year but she keeps telling me no and that she is on the A honor roll and so isn’t that good enough? 

In terms of television, we do not have cable. We have Netflix and YouTube. She likes to watch YouTube more. The things she watch, I wouldn’t say I’d recommend but it’s your usually kid stuff. Minecraft, Roblox, and mobile app gamers. I don’t think it’s good for her to be watching that stuff. 

I’m not sure where she should be in terms of her reading level or writing skills or handwriting so I’d like some help please.

383,"Known the guy for four years. Always been introverted, but he broke out of his shell since I met him - trying to improve and step out of his comfort zone. There was even a time when we roomed together and he said I was one of the few people he could be around without it feeling 'draining.'

It got to a somewhat unhealthy point where he became clingy as a friend - afraid to lose friendships because of various irrational fears and emotional things he was going through. He overcame all that - but now it almost seems like he's taken a total 180.

He's gone from never leaving me alone - to never talking to me. Just today I got home from work and he was making food - some for me. I was happy to see that so I lounge in the living room, mention a couple things, and pull up a video on my phone to watch for a minute. the *second* he hears sound from my phone he leaves the food he's making, goes to his room, and comes back to plug music into earbuds.

He was already listening to music out loud before - and the video was literally like 50 seconds long of a guy talking.

I didn't even realize until I asked how his day was once the video ended and realized he had earbuds in and couldn't hear me. And he does stuff like this *constantly.*

It almost feels like passive aggression, except he's much more obvious about things when he's being passive aggressive. It's more likely that he's just unaware he's acting this way. Nevertheless it still bothers me. As I'm typing this he enters the room to make a joke about soup. So I know he's not upset or anything - but it's super jarring. Like - one second we're fine, and the next - he's doing something that comes off as really abrasive.

I've given up on even voicing any opinions that disagree with his - since he's one of the most defensive people I know. To make matters worse, he's one of those that is hyper-focused on being understood - rather than *understanding*. Or in other words, I could understand him perfectly, but he'll continue to be argumentative with me because he thinks I don't understand. Even on things we are actually *agreeing on*. I know this because I usually bring up the conversation later when he's cooled off to clarify things, so we usually clear the air and I figure out where the misunderstanding was.

I don't know if there's something I'm doing wrong or some way I'm looking at the situation incorrectly, but I just feel less and less comfortable around the guy. 

Honestly, I'm sure he's totally unaware that I'm even bothered about this. Every time I bring something up about it, we come to the conclusion that I'm just misreading him (mostly because I don't think he ever thinks about his non-verbals) and kind of laugh it off.

Every since then i told myself i wasnt go to try them ever again. A year ago my son was born and this is really where my mushroom fear really came back. I was at the park playground with my son playing soccer and i notice my son picking up what turned out to be 1 of a handful of mushrooms that were growing next to the tree. I cleaned off his hand and started to feel super anxious about this mushroom he touched thinking it might be poisonous, i googled how to know what types are poisonous which didnt really help since there are so many you cant really know and ever since then my phobia has gotten worse and would love advice to get rid of my phobia does anyone else feel this way? I literally threw my shoes and my sons shoes the day we stepped on them and had to buy new ones, its so bad when i see some growing in my neighbors lawn i just avoid walking through and just cross the street. Im just really afraid my son will touch a 'psychedelic ' one. Thanks any advice helps.",20Jun2018,1
385,"You might hear older people say “Millenials these days wont pick up the phone and make a call!” Well for me that holds true. Everytime my phone rings at work my heart starts racing and my anxiety blows up. I don’t answer 95% of the time unless I know who it is but people call me a lot for work and it’s really affecting me.

I’ve reflected on it and have come to zero conclusions as to why I’m like this. I guess you could say a lot of it stems from me being a “think first, speak later” type of person. I have a difficult time relaxing and getting my thoughts out clearly so I prefer to speak through email which is starting to prove difficult.

Does anyone else have this issue? Is there a tactic to help me relax or think clearly? I don’t have tons of anxiety when speaking to others in person or in general. Any advice is much appreciated!",20Jun2018,3
387,"I've been able to survive with the bare essentials but as you can imagine there are a shit ton of things I need that costs money that is way outside my budget. For example, a car. I want to get back on track but I'm having a hard time deciding what to do....

 Go to college, pull out loan money to help get myself out of this hole quickly, get a degree and possibly find better jobs. I want to go to school but there's always the possibility I don't succeed.  Don't really know how loans work anyway...isn't there a limit to how much you can receive?

Get another minimum wage job. Deal with the bullshit, save up and try my hardest not to quit. I go to a job with the intention of working there a long time but shit goes always wrong eventually despite me being a good worker and staying to myself.

400,"I’m on mobile, so I apologize for the formatting if it’s shit.

A bit of background:

My sister and I have always been close and been there for each other, whatever we need. Even though we’re five years apart in age, we have a twin-like connection. About two years ago, for very personal reasons, my husband, daughter and I had to move out of our house. We had nowhere to go, and my sister and her husband took myself and my daughter in. My husband decided to stay at his mother’s because it was the only place where our dog could be, and he wanted to make sure the dog was well taken care of, seeing as his mother is...not the best with animals, and we couldn’t bring him to my sister’s house because their landlord despises pets and they have super nosy neighbors who would have ratted us out in a heartbeat and they would have been evicted. Even though we stayed at separate places, we were only 5 minutes away from each other. I stayed at my sister’s house for close to a year, until we moved across the country into our own home.

Now, my sister and her husband are in a bad spot financially. There’ve been times when they haven’t had anything to eat and have had to resort to charity. We are in a much better place than we were back when they helped us, so I want to return the kindness: I’d love for them to come and stay with us until they can get back on their feet. The place where we moved offers so many more opportunities, and I know they’d be on their feet in no time considering their professions. 

The problem is that they have three pets( two cats, one dog) and my husband doesn’t want them to bring them here. He says he’d have no problem with them living with us, as long as they leave their pets behind. I don’t have the heart to tell my sister that she can only stay with me if she leaves her pets behind; she can’t have children and those pers are like her babies. It’s not like they’re destructive either, they’re better behaved than my own pets (one cat, one dog). 

I realize the decision is not only mine; we are husband and wife, this is OUR home, we make the decisions together...but I can’t help but feel resentment because he won’t help me speak to them and see if we can reach a solution. My sister’s husband has been one of his closest friends since seventh grade. I asked him today if he could call him and explain the situation and see if together they could come up with something, but he didn’t even let me finish the sentence. He just cut me off with “Why should I have to call him and explain myself?”
I feel like I’m leaving my sister to her fate. I’m the only one who could get her out of her situation. They NEED to get away from where they are so they can progress in life, and I’m the only one who could give them that chance, she has no one else...

Am I the one being unreasonable? Am I expecting too much? Is he being unsympathetic or am I asking for too big a thing? ",20Jun2018,4
401,"I've been looking at the things that can make me a toxic person, and working on resolving them and being a better person. For example, I can be a bit of a hot-head and snap at people when I'm stressed out (I've only ever done it to my boyfriend and my parents which I think is even worse bc they're the people I love) 
Getting stressed and having no patience are the root of it and I'm working on fixing it. There's more but thats the main one. All I want in life is to be the best version of myself and to only ever be kind and compassionate and that is my life goal.

However, because of this I've started noticing toxic behaviour in most of the people around me. One of my good friends who I've been friends with for years constantly talks about people behind their back, even about her friends. She is complaining about things all the time and never seems to have anything positive to say. She humiliates me in front of our friends by telling them embarrassing stories of me (most of them not true or immensely exaggerated) I'm always too shy to speak up about it, she can be quite verbally agressive (I've seen her argue with her boyfriend) so I tend to just hold my tongue.
Another friend slept with my ex boyfriend and didn't tell me and hoped i'd never find out. I forgave her quickly and we are fine now but recently she got mean drunk and spoke to me in a way that i'd never heard her speak before and my opinion about her has changed again, remembering the thing she did and realising that she isn't as nice as i thought. 

Another friend snaps at people constantly, he is a lot like me which I hate because I never ever wanna act like that. He gets stressed easily and snaps at his girlfriend who doesn't deserve it because she is actually a really nice person. There was one point where he would get angry multiple times a day which upset most of our friend group. He's gotten a lot better with it now though. I don't think he's a toxic person though, just has some issues. 

I had a friend group throughout highschool which I was close to in school but I drifted apart from after we left school, I still met up with them every now and then and would attend parties and even hosted a house party and invited them all. I thought they were my friends but last year they decided to kick me out of a group chat in which they were all in, where they would organise events and get togethers. Apparently one of them did this because they didn't think i spoke enough to the group and hung out enough. No one added me back and I had to ask to get added back. Sometimes I think that I'm ridiculous for putting up with that and begging to come back to a group that didn't even seem to want me. I've seen them a few times since and those times have been fun but i can't forget that. They can also be very judgmental of other people and act quite childish.

A friend who I thought was really kind has suddenly started being so much more hostile and rude lately. He's started to pick arguments over nothing and getting irritated with people. I never expected it from him because he's always so nice.

My boyfriend is nice a lot of the time but there are times where he can be very toxic. He often says things that he knows would upset me, and riles me up on purpose to get a rise out of me and when i become quiet because i don't want a confrontation, he gets annoyed at me and riles me up more just so that i'll say something. He will never admit when he's in the wrong and makes him to be a victim, there have been times where he's done something horrible and will laugh at me when i cry about it and tell him how much he's upset me and gets angry at me for getting angry at him when it was he who messed up. He once threw my clothes out of the window because i was angry at him for something he did.

My parents can be toxic in different ways. I find that a lot of traits in them that I don't like are traits that i have found in myself which i hate. 

I try to be kind to people and treat people with respect but I don't feel like I get it back with most people. I can be an ass sometimes to the people I love which i most certainly want to stop. I'm learning to control my emotions. There are people who I do believe aren't toxic people and just have some qualities that need attention and fixing but some people around just truly aren't nice and I feel so down about it and it makes me feel like shit ",20Jun2018,1
402,I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years and 7 months. We’re super comfortable with each other but for some reason he has a hard time opening up to anyone about his emotions. We have a lot trust in our relationship so i know that’s not the problem. I asked him why he wouldn’t talk to me about his feelings and he plainly said “I’m above all that”. I feel so worried because i don’t think it’s good to keep everything to yourself like that. It’s good to talk to someone once in awhile. The only thing i know for sure is that he is depressed and he has been so sad for so long. I just want him to understand that his feelings aren’t a burden to me or anyone he talks to.

404,"So I havent had sex since me and my girlfriend broke up in May, not terribly long but still. I tried tindetbamd stuff, talked to a few girls, but it's very time consuming and not very rewarding. 

I'm single, and I want to focus more on myself, take time to do hobbies, learn shit, and work on my own personality. However, I also really want to fuck. 

Well, this all resolved itself when I found a sex worker advertising on tinder. I won't describe her in case anyone recognized her, but she's definitely my type. Anyways, she advertises her ""services"" on Snapchat, normally she would do one time meet ups for $150, and unlimited meet ups for $200. But today, she did a special hour long deal where you could get unlimited for $100. To me, that's basically nothing for someone I think is hot and would want to fuck anyways, so I went through with it.

We are meeting this weekend. Thing is, I've never been with someone who fucks for a living before. I'm gonna get a haircut and shave, I've been growing my hair out but it hasn't looked very good so now's a good as time as any, my face is also Scrappy so I'll shave.

405,"I work at an elementary school as an emergency assistant, but I pretty much work part time, all the kids know me. 

So, today one student (who is white) called another student (who is black) a bunch of racial slurs. # 1 then proceeded to lunge at # 2 several times. # 2 went to the office, I'm not sure if anyone spoke with #2. # 1 was talked to by teacher and sub principal about how those words are wrong and we can't say those things, blah blah blah. # 1 kept going off about how we're white and they make fun of us so we can too, blah blah bullsh*t. I did not witness the altercation, what I witnessed was the conversation with # 1. There was no remorse from the kid what so ever. Now, I'm still getting details, so from what I've been told # 1 was not suspended. No one call # 2s parents or # 1s. I'm sure if someone spoke with # 2 about the incident but I don't know, I'm assuming. And I'm sure that conversation would've been about how he didn't mean it, he has anger problems (which # 2 does for sure) and he's being spoken to about this. 

So my problem is, should # 1 have been suspended? The boy is in no way incapable of knowing right and wrong, he knows 100 percent what that means, his one and only issue is anger, so he is part of an integrated class room and considered ""spec Ed"" 
# 2 is just a quiet kid, who whooped # 1 a** at soccer during recess. 

Am I wrong about pushing this matter further? We have a Zero Tolerance rule, and this boy wasn't suspended, and I truly absolutely believe that should be a suspension, they should make him aware of how serious this is by watching a video at least, like do frigging something. My opinion is, the teachers aren't ignorant, just incompetent, so please don't think badly of them, by how they were handling it I'm assuming this isn't something they've dealt with before. 

Anyways, should # 1 have suspended? That's hate speech imo and attempting to go at him is aggression and since it's zero tolerance, I'm positive this should be dealt with a suspension of some kind and some kind of reprimand to the ones who handled it. Right or wrong? 

And would I be wrong to ask him send him home with a note detailing  the incident if his parents weren't informed and he wants them to know?

Reasons why i didnt go? there were money issues and family stuff going on and we are moving to Utah soon. But thats not what im getting at right now.

I'm almost eighteen years old and will be graduating this next year. As a result of this my parents are moving out of our house and selling it which causes me to either live with my parents when I am going to college or with my boyfriend.

My parents are totally cool with my bf and I moving in together, they aren't really religious but my parents know that I shouldn't rush to get married just to move in with someone. 

His parents on the other hand are religious, yet all five of his other brothers are engaged and living with their fiancee'sand that's totally okay for some reason. 

I want to move in with my boyfriend because I feel like it would be a great experience for the both of us since it's both be our first times leaving the nest but I also don't want his parents to hate me. He is the baby of the family and the last one to leave the nest but I am an only child and my parents are totally cool with it.

Should my bf and I say we are engaged to his parents so they are cool with it or?

411,"My friend reddits so I can't say exactly what I think he did. 

Me: 29m
Friend 1: Good guy who is friends with friend 2 and doesn't like my boss.
Friend 2: not a good friend of mine but i rec'd him for a job and then the offer fell through because of a questionable reference and my boss whatever I'll explain later. 

Boss: good dude but not everyone likes him. Owns a small ish company that doesn't need any shit. 

I think one of my friends did something behind my back that made a fight between me and another person worse and may fuck shit up for my boss's company at least cause him a lot of inconvenience. Ireally like my friend and i can't prove it but a lot o stuff is pointing in his direction. 

I got friend 2 a job offer at the place where I work where friend 1 used to work but doesn't anymore. But the reference check came back a bit bad and my boss was on the fence about him anyway and the offer was rescinded. There were some other details but I'm not sure of them yet I had to lie to friend 2 about why the job offer was rescinded, and I fucked up and told friend one what happened.

Friend 2 is pissed as shit at my company. I'm just an employee but I really do respect my boss who is also the owner. It's a pretty competitive industry and we don't really need extra shit to deal with.  Friend 2 wants to go on a revenge mission against my boss. Like, suing for discrimination and shit and i don't think he has a case, but it's still a lot of fucking drama that we don't need right now. And if it gets really bad it could do some harm to be fair. It also proves my friend was right to rescind the offer.

Here's where Friend 1 comes in. He's a mutual friend of me and friend two, but we are closer. He's the kind of guy who is nice to everyone and he's a real good dude. But I think he helped friend 2 to get some information on my boss to use against him. I chat about work and shit who doesn't and I know that friend 1 doesn't actually like my boss as much as I do.

Friend 2 (job offer rescind guy) has gone apeshit over the last week and it looks a lot like he's using information that Friend 1 gave him or he's being encouraged by friend 1. Friend 1, i know he's not doing this to fuck with me, but if he fucks with my boss and my bosses business it will fuck with me you know?

Its a little bit irresponsible and this is where the betrayal is if this is true. 

Friend 1 (the possible betrayer) has been saying stuff to me over the last while that makes me think he encouraged friend 2 to go ahead with this wrongful discrimination revenge mission. I can't say how I know because he probably knows if he's reading this already but I can't say what it actually is. {no, he was not discriminated against he just didn't get the job}

I wouldn't be posting here if I didn't have good reason to suspect my friend. Im pretty hurt actually. friend 1 would not be hurt if my boss's company was fucked with but it will make a ton of a lot of extra work and stress for me and the company to deal with Friend 2.

I could just flat out ask my friend if he is the one who told friend 2 about (x information about our company) and if he is the one who suggested a wrongful discrimination thing. I could flat out ask him. And i would know if he was lying even if he said no i would just be able to tell. I don't know if I want to know. He's a good friend, we met through work when he used to work there a long time ago and maybe i don't want to know.

but my suspicions are adding up. There is shit that friend 2 is saying in emails and shit that sounds a lot like what friend 1 has to say about my boss.

Friend 1 it looks like he feels a bit bad for gassing up friend 1 to do this (if he is hte one who did it.) Do i call my friend out and flat out say to him did you do (the things I think he did.)  

Or do i just go on with my suspicions and keep being friends with him? He has old information about our company and if hes the one who is pushing friend 2 to do this, I need to tell my boss what to expect.

412,"I do not care at all for the material I am learning in school, which is not unexpected. 
I am a very capable student. If I really put in the effort, I can learn so much in so little time.

I could start studying just a little everyday and get extremely high marks but...my brain is not allowing me. I have this belief that studying will not help that much in actually getting more marks, which lead me to study less and less, and then my beliefs were confirmed. 

I saw people around me studying hard daily and they all failed exams that I passed from just studying the day before a little.
Our math exams are always just time attacks. Studying for maths only gets you to answer the questions a bit quicker, which requires a lot of practice if you want a noticeable difference. This is a common theme between all my subjects: Study a little, get a pretty good grade. Study a lot, get a...more than pretty good grade, just a bit. You’re not finishing that math exam, you’re just not. It’s near impossible. And no way in hell are you getting more than 80 on that physics exam. By doing just a little work, you’ll pass. By doing a lot of work, get in the SEVENTIES WOAHH.
It’s just not worth it. I never feel accomplished and I can’t bring myself to study. I’m always doing the bare minimum.
Right now i’m reaching a level where i’m not even doing the bare minimum. I’m not studying at all, info just doesn’t enter my brain even when I really try. I’m sick of it.",20Jun2018,1
413,"If the title is vague allow me to explain. I have a history of depression yes yes I know we all know where this is going. I've always coped with it but recently I'm very angry and on the verge of just acting on impulse and punching something or throwing something. I've dealt with anger my whole life and I've been better at controlling it but this anger is different. Its a mixture of annoyance, sadness, and the sheer fact of existing. i work myself up into a rage with just my thoughts, or other peoples actions. I go to work, I clean, I bathe but I have this anxious pit in my stomach like my ready to burst into tears at any moment but I'm unable to cry. I'm more scared for people around me because i might lash out and do something I really didn't mean to do. I really and truly don't want to hurt anyone. And ive felt like killing myself for a few years now almost daily but i just learned to deal with it and accept that i wont do it. I just feel stuck and  today I had an anxiety attack at work and it felt good to let go but hours later I'm hot-headed again and ready to fight. Its a new feeling for me and I don't exactly have the funds for a therapist. Also, i feel that therapist doesn't really give a crap about you anyway. Seems like a rant but I needed room to explain. Any and all advice would be helpful. ",20Jun2018,1
414,"Recently been seeing a girl who suffers with borderline personality disorder. Now she's spoken to me about it and her past. Found out a lot more about her past due to mutual friends. She's getting all the help she can get professionally as she's attempted suicide on a number of occasions.

Anyway recently she had a bit of a dark day where she wanted to attempt suicide but the people she has support her stopped her. Now I've said to her I'm here for her no matter what. All the flaws she has I can deal with but the suicide thing is really bugging me. Been dating for a few months now and I truly care about her but my head is telling me to run away from her but my heart is telling me to stay. Apart from the BPD she's perfect in every way but I'm struggling to deal with it recently. 

Since dating we have never argued or had any problems with each other but when she's feeling down I just want to do more to help but i know I can't and it hurts me.

Any advice would be great as I'm unsure what to do at the moment. Should I leave her or stick with her as I truly love her.

415,"Long story short, my best friend's boyfriend is extremely narcissistic and abusive to her. I've been hearing for the last 10 months about how he verbally abuses her, kicks her out, PRESSURES her to drink with him and even ignored a safe word during sex... Now her boyfriend is taking her dad to court because he feels threatened by her, and her dad is taking her boyfriend to court because he found out about the alcohol and I assume is tired of seeing his daughter so anxious and depressed all the time because of this shit head she is with. Well... My question is the title. I have a couple pictures of her completely drunk and out of it, alcohol in the picture, she looks fainted... Should I just make a fake facebook or something and send it to her mom asking her to send it to her dad? Other people have this picture too, though I know she could find out it was me. I'm tired of her letting herself stay in this situation with a bad guy who not only is abusing her but has ruined her relationship with her dad... I personally believe her boyfriend should be locked up...",20Jun2018,1
416,"Does anyone have any advice on how to stop being a pushover? I feel like I am being pulled in several different directions and would just love to stop helping everyone who asks. I'm currently back home with my parents while I head back to school and pay off some of my student loans and I'm just getting to the point where I'm overwhelmed with classes, my jobs, and helping them with every other semi-complex issue that arises. I feel like a personal secretary that doesn't get paid. I find my self sometimes just bursting into tears when I'm along or feeling like I'm drowning because of everything I need to do. My siblings never get asked to do any of this and are just free to live their own lives. I am flat out overwhelmed, frustrated, and starting to get more and more anxious. How do I say no and deal with the guilt and disappointment? I don't know how I ended up being the one who gets asked to handle so many things when my other siblings never had to do any of this and got to focus on what they wanted. I feel stuck in life and like I'm never going to amount to anything. I constantly have to maintain this facade and its exhausting.",20Jun2018,1
417,"I'm having a lot of problems with my thought processes and don't know how to fix them. 

Right now i have a job making relatively good money, but i don't enjoy the job. The people in my life say ""so what, you're making good money"".

This is almost completely irrelevant to me. 

I constantly have the thought that i would rather be dead than work until i die because that's the way someone said it is. I don't know how to break myself from this thought. 

I used to want to die because i wanted attention, or i wanted to stop hurting. 

At this point it's just a practical thing. I have days i enjoy and stuff, but on the whole i would prefer to stop interpreting stimulus. I would prefer non-existence to both the good and bad aspects of life.  

I don't know what to do to fix my thoughts. I'm not sure how to be invested in life, or find a sense of purpose. At this point I'll try anything. 

There's not a lot of opportunity available to me, so I'm not aware of what to put myself into for a sense of purpose. 

I've done a lot of therapy, but if anyone has suggestions I'd be willing to try something else. 

At this point I believe I'm completely okay with dying, i mean it's not some dramatic thing it would just be a huge fucking relief for me. I do feel obligated to try for the people in my life though. 

I don't need suicide intervention or anything, I've been dealing with this long enough that I'm safe and won't be hurting myself in the near future. 

If anyone has suggestions for dealing with these thoughts that would be great
