I don’t know what to do now. Whenever I was overstressed or anything like that I could always put that energy into writing some comments or looking forward to something. Now I’ve got nothing, and I feel completely lost. I’ve been stressing myself out about the whole thing and I’m choking up, please help.",23Jan2018,2
1,"This is a long one. Sorry in advance. 

I moved back to my hometown after 2 years in a different state, which meant seeing a lot of people that I used to know, and reconnecting with some old friends. Out of this, I met one of my (f)riend’s (we can call her Madison) girlfriend (we can call her Sarah). 

Now, one of the things we’ve all bonded over is our shitty experiences with depression, abuse, etc. Broken people are drawn to each other, and it just ended up that way. But that means we all have issues that we help each other through, and we’re all emotionally open with each other. 

I’m in love with Sarah. Normally I get over a crush within a matter of weeks, if not days, but I can’t shake my feelings for her no matter how hard I try. It’s gotten to the point where it almost physically hurts to be around her because she’s dating Madison, and I only want them to be happy more than anything on planet earth. I care about both of them so much, god, I don’t know what to do. 

Another thing we bonded over is drugs. Bitch at me all you want about how they’re only going to hurt me in the long run, I know this, and I’m working with myself and them to get clean (except for weed). The last time we got high, we were all sitting in Sarah’s car, and things got a bit intense. First of all, me and her had like a 10 minute staring contest, (probably only like 30 seconds, high people time you know) and while it was wonderful, it also made me almost a bit uncomfortable just because her girlfriend was in the car too, and it reminded me of how much I care about both of them and I’m not sure if Madison could handle knowing that I like Sarah. 

And then today, after we went and got lunch, she asked me if I’d ever been in a relationship where I’d simultaneously started to develop feelings for another person.  It’s at this point I should probably mention that Sarah is bi, and we’re ridiculously flirty with each other, and despite the fact that I want to stop, I can’t. She just makes me too happy not to. 

Shit. 

It’s made worse by the fact that Madison’s brother recently died of a heroin overdose, and we’ve all been trying really hard to keep her in a good state of mind (or the best we can get her to be in), and I’m 100% sure she couldn’t handle a breakup if that came to pass. Part of me wants to be with Sarah, and part of me knows that if by some miracle I end up with her, it’s likely going to mean that Madison kills herself when nobody is looking. 

TL;DR I have to choose between my friend killing herself or living in agony knowing that a relationship with the first person I’ve had real feelings for in a long time very likely has feelings for me too. 

Someone please help me dig myself out of this mess. It’s hurting me so fucking much I don’t know what to do anymore.  ",23Jan2018,3

7,"So I'm an 18 year old Hungarian guy who also happens to be a kissless virgin and an extreme introvert, however I wish I had a girlfriend or boyfriend since I desperately crave and lack romantic affection and emotional support, but I simply can't make a move. Every time I go into public, I dread having to interact with others and I get really anxious.

Besides not even knowing how I'm supposed to find and approach potential partners, I'm afraid I'll screw something up, say something fucked up because of my strange sense humor, or just appear unlikable in general, which in all honesty, I think I am. I don't have any interesting stories to tell, I'm arrogant and often say shit that makes me want to post myself on r/iamverysmart, I have done barely anything productive in my entire life (to be fair I haven't lived a lot but still), and all my interests and hobbies are niche, at least in Hungary, so there's usually just an awkward silence and no common ground to talk about when I'm in a conversation. 

How could I possibly fix this? It's just my personality, and I can't really change it, not to mention that my appearance leaves a lot to be desired as well. My body looks like a skeleton fucked a vampire and raised the child in their basement, which in all honesty I could probably improve on considerably by working out since I'm tall and have an ok face, but I'm a lazy piece of garbage without an ounce of motivation. 

And this is just the beginning of my woes. Even if by some kind of miracle I did manage to go out with someone, the relationship would crash and burn the moment we wanted to start going to the next level (as in having sex), even though it's not the main aspect of interest for me. The thing is, I'm not really interested in regular penetration. Perhaps if I tried it it'd seem more appealing, but currently it seems so mundane and repetitive that I can't imagine it not getting boring after a few times for me as there's not a whole lot of room for variance, and if fapping has taught me anything, simply feeling good through the same exact stimuli over and over gets boring fast. Now on the other hand, what I would likely be into is other fairly niche activities which the other person is unlikely (or at least probably has less than a 50% chance) to also be interested in. I'm talking humiliation, pet play, pegging, being caused pain, choking, you know, the sort of stuff that's stereotypically associated with such ""classics"" as 50 shades of gray, except in this instance, I'd be the one to be dominated by the other party, which again, restricts the ""potential dating pool size"" considering that statistically males are significantly more likely to favor the dominant role than females. 

Now, this probability could be increased by a homosexual relationship, but then again, the vast majority of males are heterosexual so that restricts the pool as well, also a lot of people in Hungary are still regressive homophobic retards and I don't need that shit in my life, especially since I'm emotionally fragile as fuck. 

Now, what potential solutions could there be for my situation? Well if we're taking the term literally a small dose of a cyanide solution would solve it. But on a more serious note, I honestly have very little information at my disposal about the subject. Dating sites are one option, but oh boy, Hungarian ones suck more ass than me in my wettest dreams. Now, I could also try to pick someone up at a bar or some such place, but unfortunately that has a low rate of success, and I'm unlikely to be interested in someone who's part of the target demographic of such places, and vice versa, also I don't know if just going out in public and trying to invite strangers on dates is socially acceptable, seems a bit creepy to me. Maybe I could go to a psychologist and talk about these issues to lighten my anxiety, but I'm afraid it'd worry my parents if I asked them to see one, I'm pretty sure they're expensive as fuck, and I don't even know if this shit has anything to do with what their field of expertise is. What should I do in this situation?",23Jan2018,2
8,"Right now I work in a form of IT at your typical corporate company, which has it's pros and cons for me.

**Pros**:

* Good pay/benefits.  Right now I make about $67,000 and get 2-3% raises annually.  Plus 401k and medical benefits.
* Plenty of jobs
* **Specific to my current job**: I get to work from home every Wednesday.
* **Specific to my current job**: I like my coworkers.
* In my past 2 IT jobs, the office environment has been pretty lax (not too corporate-feeling, get to wear whatever I want)

**Cons**:

* Constant education (have to stay on top of new and emerging technologies)
 * I don't have anything against learning new things, but IT, especially when it comes to corporate use, really isn't something I care about, so I don't really have much drive.  For example, today a coworker asked ""How are your C# skills?"" and I answered ""Pretty much non-existant."" and he said ""We might need to both brush up on it for this new project."" and all I thought was ""Fuck...I don't want to learn C#.  I got out of programming for a reason.""
* Bringing my laptop home with me everyday makes me feel like I'm bringing work home with me.  I'd like to work in an environment where everything work-related stays at work.  However, a good part of this is that if I'm sick or need to stay home for some reason, I can work from home.  So this one is a double-edged sword.
* Even though I said my past 2 jobs haven't had much of a corporate-feel, I still want to get away from working for a big company, or anything where you're working in a typical office building.  Also, not every corporate job down the line is gonna let me wear jeans and a hoodie every day.  My IT internship in college had me wearing khakis and a collared shirt every day and I hated it.  I don't mind needing clothing that is required for the job (i.e. construction requiring a hard hat and boots and gloves), but I really don't want to have to dress business casual or even formal to go work in an office.


**My passions/hobbies/interests/things that just make me feel good**

* Playing guitar
* Hard Rock/Metal (music)
* Parkour
* Ninja Warrior
* Martial Arts
* Nature
* Asian culture, particularly China and Japan.
* Dogs (animals in general, really)
* Video Games
* Cleaning/organizing
* Creating things that are visually appealing
* Building/fixing things (I'm not instinctively handy, but I'm a quick learner when it comes to it)

13,"

I’m 26 and in my last semester of University, in December 2017 I found out that a friend of mine died, he was an ex boyfriend of my Mother’s and we always stayed in touch, my father died when I was 16 so he was like my “father figure” cheerleader, the only reason they didn’t stay together was because he was an alcoholic although, not a violent alcoholic, a very very sentimental man. Anyways, after he died I found out that he made me the Executrix of his will and estate, after a lot of traveling and probate court and paperwork and investigation I found out he didn’t have anything left of value, $147 in one bank account and $80 in another. He lost everything he had to scams and fraud. Then as investigation continued, I found out that he had 2 annuities valuing $150,000 in total of which I am the sole beneficiary. I don’t have much of a plan for my life, or a real career path. My plan has been to leave the country after graduating and teach English abroad for a while, I’m also pretty certain I want to have kids one day. That’s it, that’s all the plans I REAlLy have. My brother is a banker and is advising that I reinvest pretty much all the $ aside from maybe $5,000, in stocks, and he is pretty much saying that he can guarantee that if I leave the money alone for 10-15 years I will have close to a million dollars to retire early on. My question for Reddit is, What Do You Think?! I am very hesitant about reinvesting because I am not very trusting Of the system and I am a “live for the moment” type of personality, so I’m afraid it will all get lost or I will die before I get to travel the world ( which this money would allow ) ... if I didn’t reinvest I would want to travel, pay off my student loans, help some people who have helped me along the way, and set aside a good bit for later life.

14,"I've had and still have a dream of playing video games professionally and I am willing to work as hard as I can to achieve it.

However I live with my parents and my brother , and my brother who I share a room with denies to allow me to have the privacy to practice by Inviting people constantly and indirectly kicking me out of the room.

Talking to him about it is definitely not an option as I've spent years trying to communicate how Important this is to me and how little he would sacrifice for it.  He is an ignorant douche.

I come from a stubborn culture I am looked down on from everyone around me(my  family) for trying to pursue this dream and I get no cooporation within the house and statistically more than 75% of my time I am interrupted in various ways even if I lock myself in my room.

It's been years and I've never found a solution to my situation.

I'm entirely oblivious to my options I feel stuck.
I feel forced to let go of my dreams and get a job or go to college and then Years later MAYBE try to get a career within gaming.

And I am at the edge of doing that now...

To get specific my brother started to go to a job recently and he has 2 days of work and 2 days off.

which means I also have 2 days (when he's at work) and then 2 wasted days ( when he's at home)

I am trying to figure out if I can pursue my goals with those 2 days I've got.

It seems to me Its unlikely ill get anywhere ljke that without getting use of the wasted 2 days.

So as far as I see since I cannot solve this with communication my options are 

-Try to achieve something with half the time I planned to and want to invest.

-Give up all the progress I've made, restart life and try to find meaning in other things.

Do I have other options ? ",23Jan2018,2

But even when I beg my mom to the point of tears, I still cannot convince her to travel.

I live somewhere you can’t really report anything to welfare services, and there are no authorities in general you can talk to.

My neighbour is an old lady who has been living alone for a considerable length of time. She bought a cat to deal with the depression and loneliness, but it’s mostly kept outdoors because indoor pets are culturally kind of frowned upon here, besides birds. However, the cat began leaving the house alot, showing up to other houses including our own, and killing / hurting other people’s cats and dogs.

As a result of it repeatedly escaping, I assume, it’s often tied to a leash now, sitting outside the house’s gate. And it yowls and shrieks the whole day. It is literally yowling as I type, at 0600 AM. It’s incredibly distressing, I’ve never heard a cat sound like that, even when they’re caterwauling or mating. 

I need to assert that I live in a country where people don’t often know how to handle pets, and they get them without knowing how to care for them. I don’t know if people ever keep cats on leashes, but this seems intuitively wrong. I don’t know what the best way is to approach the lady, because she is more likely ignorant and confused than deliberately abusive or neglectful, and was probably recommended a pet by a therapist. I need to talk to her, but what should I say? What should I recommend as a course of action?

40,"Hi, so, I really enjoy writing stories and playing music. However, whenever I try to make something of my own, I very rarely can see any merit in what I've done, despite others telling me that I'm good at these things. I end up getting into a downward spiral of negative thoughts and am not really able to do anything productive afterwards. This kind of makes me scared to try writing stories or music because I can get into a pretty bad headspace for a day, or maybe more. This is kind of a vicious cycle because I can only get better by practicing, so I remain at the same low level of skill.  Does anyone have any advice for how to stop criticising myself so much or how to avoid these downward spirals? Thanks. ",23Jan2018,7

I told her she has two weeks to move out and she took it bad and started hitting me. She doesn't want to move out as she feels we have to ride out the lease because that's what we agreed on when we moved in. 

I ended up calling the cops, she left and she hasn't been back, She isn't on the lease but has lived here since June and gets some mail here. I need to know how can go about getting her to leave, possibly avoiding having to put out an order of protection.

51,"Hey guys, first time posting on this sub. Please hear me out.
I'm torn between two fraternities on campus, and I just want some opinions when you guys read my situation, cause it's kind of weird.

First and foremost, one of my best friends and the first upperclassmen I began talking to is in the first fraternity. Me and this person got very close through running, and even travelled down state to run a half marathon together. I showed great enthusiasm in joining around that time first semester, but we have deferred recruitment so I wasn't able to. 

The second fraternity is one where I have many friends. I've had these people in classes and have just generally built many great relationships with the people there. Their philanthropy is exactly in line with my personal beliefs, and some of my freshmen friends are joining it as well. It sounds like the perfect match. 

The reason I'm torn is because I really do want to join the second one, because of the reasons listed. But my friend from the first one is just so heavily expecting me to join his. I've received bids for both now. I feel as though I don't have the heart to turn down my friend. I just feel weak, and incapable of choosing. But if I did, I'd be joining for him and nobody else. I don't know anyone else, and don't care too much about their philanthropy as I have no personal ties to it. I have one freshmen friend joining, but that's about it. 

I just want to get out of this making everyone happy, but both really want me and I'm just really beating myself up about it. I don't want to let him down, but I feel like I have to. I'm a mess.

Any advice, good or bad, is appreciated. I just need some help. Thank you for reading.",23Jan2018,5

I skype them and e-mail them, and it's gotten quite a bit better, but he says there is no substitute for talking in person.

I’ve made one really good friend and have a boyfriend but my friend spends most of her time with her bf.

So here's my deal, I have pretty severe anxiety around most people smoking. Even though I *know* that there's nothing wrong with pot, and it's not dangerous, etc etc etc, I am very uncomfortable around it. I've never smoked myself, and I don't really know what this stems from. But I want to change. 

My boyfriend smokes only every once in awhile, usually with friends. But he never smokes around me knowing how it would make me feel. The other night some of his friends came over to hang out, and they brought a bong etc. I kind of isolated myself to the other side of the room, I was so uncomfortable. Heart racing and everything. He would come over to check on me, and make sure I was okay. He even asked if he should send them home, but of course I didn't let him do that. So I held on until everyone was ready to go bowling. He didn't even take a hit the whole time. Amazing boy right? 

I want to change. I don't know why I get like this but I want to be different. Normal. I don't want to separate myself from that part of his life anymore, I don't want him to constantly worry about me or feel like he needs to be different for me. Part of me even wants to be able to partake once in awhile, be apart of the gang when he brings everyone over. (We don't live together but I spend most weekends at his place) so I guess I'm asking y'all what your best advice is for someone in my situation.

My mother suggested after my wedding me and my soon to be wife go live with them. I think she's making this offer because she's lonely and is also afraid what she'd do after my father passes. 

She said we could stay as long as we'd like. After my father passes the house will be put in my name, and she asks that we'd let her live with us since at that point the house would be mine.  If we don't move in then my fiancee and I will just find an apartment. Our combined annual income is about 70k.

Pros:

Save a ton of money. We'd be paying rent but they'd only want maybe 500/month. 

My fiancee wants to go to nursing school. She would be able to just work part time and focus her energy on school.

If/when we have a baby we would have lots of help, wouldn't have to worry about who would watch baby, etc

Spend time with my father before he passes

Everyone gets along great. My mother is basically like best friends with my fiancee. 

Cons:

No real privacy. The house is three bedrooms. There's no finished basement/anything like that..We'd get a bedroom and they also offered to cut their double parlor living room in half...so we'd get a bedroom and our own mini ""hangout"" area I guess.

One bathroom

63,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a short amount of time, but we've been best friends for many years so it has felt like we've been together forever. However, he's continued a habit into our relationship that I am uncomfortable with.

He texts other girls, including his exes, and comments on other girls' pictures, saying things such as ""Daaammnnn, nice"" or something similar. He claims that these girls are just friends, and I believe him because I've known him for so long. I also know the majority of these girls, and they know we are dating. 

This girl who's pictures he comments on consistently has a long history of ""mental health issues"" (some may be real, but majority of it is for attention, or so I feel), all cumulating to an overall conceited and somewhat selfish personality. She texts him when she has a ""breakdown"", one text saying, ""I'm depressed, love me"", and another stating, ""Is it my beauty? Is that why people hate me?"". Clearly not the best person in the world. She is also one of his exes. We got into a fight over this girl and how I do not want him commenting on her pictures or texting her unless she texts him first. Yet time and time again, he comments on her pictures. And time and time again, I ask him not to. 

He also texts these other girls more than me some days, and sends me screenshots of the memes they send or whatever. I understand it's meant to be lighthearted, but it ends up leaving a sour taste in my mouth. 

I don't want to control his relationships, but I feel uncomfortable knowing that he texts these girls and prioritizes them over me. I prioritize him over my friends the majority of the time, but I feel like he may not with me. Perhaps I'm looking too much into social media, and I'm being overly concerned and selfish. I'm unsure as to how to speak to him about this because all prior attempts have failed. Can you guys give me a truthful view of the situation? How can I confront him about this, if at all? Thank you so much!

64,"I'm dealing with a situation with my now co-worker who used to be my supervisor. To give some background: She is the coordinator of a program I work in. She was very integral to getting me a full time job, but I do know that there was an incentive for her because it expands the program and will help her become associate director of the department. I have done a lot to coordinate the program, but she controls everything. 

I told her I was going to apply to present at a conference on a specific topic. A couple months pass and I found out my proposal was accepted at a national conference. This was the first time I ever put in a proposal by myself. She found out and was ""excited"" for me, and then said ""oh, did you use the proposal we submitted (she actually wrote it) a couple years ago?"". I was caught off guard, because why would I turn in a proposal she submitted, and why would she even think I'd do that? 

She proceeded to tell me it's a good starter conference to present at because it's not like I'll be presenting in front of 500 people, like at the conference she'll be presenting at. It's interesting because she is doing a presentation on a topic I have more background in than she does. She talks about ""neuroscience"" but has never taken a college biology course. She throws around terms like ""action potential"" and ""glutamate"" but I can see through her and know she doesn't know what she is talking about. I have a strong science background and was in medical school. I actually took a medical neuroscience class...but no one else realizes she is full of it.  

The confusing thing is, it's very difficult to pick out these little ""jabs"" she says because it's done in a ""nice"" way. I don't think anyone else notices them, so I wonder if I'm being sensitive. 

Examples of how I helped grow the program: It was my idea to start creating events. I had a vision for one and it was basically taken over by my co-worker. Small example, I spent hours and hours creating marketing for the event and she just completely re-did it just because she wanted it her way. She takes credit for coordinating the program, and I still have the same title I did when I was part-time. 

I created some other marketing tools. Our mutual boss liked what I did. So did my co-worker but she wanted it worded her way, so she completely re-did it. 

I'm super frustrated and don't know what to do. My co-worker has a lot of influence, so I'm afraid to speak up. She has tenure and won't get fired ever, but I don't. 

I work at a university and want to apply to a different department, but if I leave, I'm afraid she'll retaliate. 

Any advice? ",23Jan2018,2
66,"Basically the title. The only time I truly feel at ease and relaxed is when I'm drunk. I'm physically incapable of relaxing otherwise. I'm constantly tense, suffer from anxiety and insomnia. The only time I feel close to what others describe as ""normal"" is if I'm drunk. 

I only drink MAYBE an average of once a week. I'm scared of becoming an alcoholic. I try to avoid social drinking because of this but damn I just feel so good when I'm drunk. I wish I could feel like that without the alcohol. I know I'm not near the threshold of drinking enough to actually BE an alcoholic, but I'm worried someday I'll get there.

I’d never made the first move before, but he was the first guy I ever messaged afterwards.. but when we were messaging he seemed uninterested so I gave up

I saw him a few months later at another social setting and as we were talking, he helped me get a job at the insurance place he works at, since it was a job I really wanted. I’ve been at this job for about 4 months now and say hello here and there, some small talk but not much conversation because I already felt shot down from before.

About a week ago, he sent a snap to me asking if I knew how to braid hair (asap rocky style), I told him I could braid his hair for him and he came over a few days later. 

The braid up took about 4 hours and we talked non-stop about everything in that time, I felt a connection, the way we perceive the world and life matched up perfectly! He was telling me I was pretty, he told me deep stuff like my heart is pure and that I have a wonderful personality, things like that.

I recall in our conversation we talked a bit about relationships and he mentioned that he really loves the chase, he loves chasing after a girl and likes to be the first to make a move

Because of this I’ve refrained from starting any conversations or talking to him because if he wanted me he would chase me... right?

83,"So just for background, I recently had a 3 month re connection with my ex after being broken up for three years. She ended up telling me it wasn't going to work in October, and while I was upset about it initially, I realized that she was right and that we really weren't right for each other. In a way it was good that it happened since I finally had closure on our relationship that had been missing after our first break-up. 

I knew I would end up seeing her again as her best friend and my best friend are dating, and she had recently been hanging in our social circle more often. I was fine with seeing her around and just generally being friendly acquaintances. Things seemed like they were all fine. 

Fast forward to the beginning of January and I get back from a NYE trip to New York. One of my best friends in the group tells me that another friend (I'll refer to him as DB) of ours ended up bringing my ex to their NYE party as a date and that they had actually been dating for the last few weeks. I had absolutely no idea that DB and ex were even talking. I understand that DB and ex don't need my permission to date, but to keep it from me and the rest of our friends for multiple weeks just made me feel like they knew they were doing something wrong and were keeping it secret. 

DB contacts me that he wanted to wait until I was back from vacation to tell me in person. Even though he brought ex around all my other friends and basically paraded their relationship around while I wasn't there. I told DB that I didn't want to hear from him again. 

I want to cut both DB and ex from my life completely and basically try to never see them again, but since we have mutual friends I feel like I'm putting them all in an uncomfortable position. They all agree that would DB did was shitty and not right, but they've all been friends for a long time. I don't expect them to cut contact with him.

97,"I'm a 20 years old doing a biomedical degree in UQ Australia and already at my last semester before starting honours (honours being part of my degree)

I have mediocre grades (5.3 GPA) however this is definitely not competitive enough to go into med in the future
or even to undertake a phd to better my chances of getting into med.

In other words, I'm lost to what I want to do with my life. I was a hardworking student in high school getting mostly As and finally knew my purpose. However when my first semester of university started,it was just overwhelming with the whole culture shock (since I lived in Malaysia my whole life) and suddenly fell into depression (for the first time in my life).

After that semester, I've never really bounced back-&gt;I have gotten a few HDs(High distinctions) and Ds(distinctions) in some of my biology courses but that's it.

I know I can really do well if I applied myself. I also know I have no one to blame but myself for wasting this opportunity and most importantly time that I will never get back. I know for a fact that I was way too immature to have started University so early (just turned 17) as well as my lack of time management and laziness.

I just don't know where to go from here and I can't help from feeling like an utter failure to my family and to myself.

I'm worried if the latter 2 choices are picked, he'll get a slap on the wrist and not delete them or anything, but I'm worried of him attacking me if i confront him, because he and I would both be kicked off campus if i defended myself.

101,"So I babysit my mom’s friends two kids, girl 12, boy 8, pretty often. It’s my main source of money. The 12 year has started to become pretty angry with me pretty often for little things because she thinks that she’s told old for a babysitter and wants the job. A few days ago she got really mad at me for touching her stuff and called her mom to tell her to fire me and told her that we had been watching TV, when we weren’t supposed to, (not the best choice I’ll admit). When the parents got home they were a little salty about the TV thing but not the other issues. At this point, we good. Anyways, she goes to school with my little brother and today, she told him “I saw your brother smoking pot, when I was with my friend and my parents are gonna fire him soon.” FUCK.  This is really weird to me because I haven’t smoked anywhere around her neighborhood in over a year. So I’m very worried right now and I’m hoping she’s just saying that to my brother for no reason, very unlikely though. Or that she’s just making it up, which will still be bad if she tells her mom. So I can’t talk to my freinds about this because they’re not available (long story), and I for sure can’t talk to my parents and my bro is asleep, so I’m just sitting here absolutely tweakin and waiting for my mom to get a text from her mom getting me in deep shit and losing me my job.

Colleague has recently told me his intentions regarding resigning, his new job and start dates etc. 

This is all fine and well until the point where he noted he was going to give as little notice as possible (out of spite). There is an 8 week time frame and the minimum notice period is two weeks. (I have tried to talk him into giving longer notice) 

Here’s where it gets tricky, being a small business, losing one staff member has the potential to hurt us and put undue stress around the departments for a period until rehiring commences. 

Reddit, here’s the question I ask. Do I have a moral or ethical obligation to tell other colleagues or superiors of the intended resignation? Or do I wait till it happens and it comes out that I’ve known for weeks? (possible ramifications pursuing each avenue)

I worked as a lab technician in Rochester NY for two years, then quit to try a career in a more commercial setting.

Now I have been at this job for one year.  I am overqualified for my position, everyone who works there hates it, and it made me suicidal before talking to a therapist.  I have no one I know here, and my mom had to drive six hours to help me with things.  I want to move to Philadelphia to be close to my family / most of my lifelong friends.  The only thing keeping me in western New York would be its easier to get jobs nearby and Wegmans.

I have been applying to jobs similar to the one I had in Rochester, but at UPenn and Drexel and Temple.  I am thinking of returning to school, but not for a PhD in biology, maybe master's in math or data science.  I am aiming for tuition benefits.

I am worried that these positions are not going to hire someone so far away, since they have a talent pool already.  I have had a few phone interviews, but nothing in person.  The furthest I've gotten is an in-person interview at Cornell.  The attendance policy at my current job is strict, such that 3 more days I take off without 3 weeks notice will get me fired.  I am considering just heading down there first, but quitting without a job lined up is what got me this job in the first place.  The advice I keep getting is to wait for a job until I can quit.

I want to know if it is a viable plan to keep applying to these postitions from where I am , or if I should make the jump to Philadelphia.  I have a few thousand saved up.

I would also like to posethis question to other subreddits, ones like /r/Personalfinance, /r/iwantoutjobs, etc.  But I would also liketo pose the question to subreddits about employment in biology, so I can determine if employers would really hire someone like me, but I do not know these subreddits.

I finished high school with terrible grades and because of that, university wasn't an option. So I took time to  travel the world. I found myself working all sorts of random crappy jobs. I became a cleaner and worked for a couple different ski resorts. This was the most fun I've probably ever had.

2) As somebody who is more than willing to put the effort in but doesn't always get the best grades, is it worth it for me to pursue something like CS? All I've ever heard about computer science programs is how frustratingly difficult they can be and it's very disconcerting.

I am a just turned 18-year-old who is going to college. My parents are paying for everything, ranging from my dorm to my tuition. 

I have been very irresponsible with my money, and now I am pretty much getting uncomfortably low. Like I said, my parents are paying for my college, so I don't have to worry about that. However, the thing is that I have also been bodybuilding over the past few months that I have been to college, and paying to get on the bus to go to the gym 3 times a week and having to pay 10 bucks a month does add up quite a lot. There are also things about dieting that I have to consider, such as buying food to cook when the cafe doesn't have the food that will help me grow. In other words, my life style is taking up a good amount of my money. 

I am too serious about it to just quit ( I have attempted to gain muscle for a while now), but I need to find a way to be able to maintain it. I was considering getting a part-time job ( which will hurt since I have to find a way to incorporate that into my busy class schedule and my gym time/cooking). I was also considering restarting my youtube page/twitch as so to hopefully gain money that will at least help pay for my bus rides. However, if both do not work ( or if I can't find the time to do one or the other), then I was thinking of going on pornhub and doing...camming for pay. 

Porn, especially gay porn, seems to pay a good amount. Since I could post a video whenever I want, it wouldn't act like a real job.  I could do it whenever I want, and still, gain a considerable amount of cash. If I was to incorporate this into getting a part-time job somewhere near or in my school, then I might be able to rebuild my account. 

However, I am worried that porn might end up ruining more than expected. I want to become a game developer, and I am worried that someone might connect me to my  NSFW videos and end up locking me out of the industry. I'm worried that porn might end up making it hard to get a real job in the future. There is also the fact that I am not out to anyone in my family, so if anyone was to find out then I could face a lot of trouble. I considered getting a ski mask to at least hide my face, but still...

Please tell me what steps I should take to rebuild my account so I don't end up seeing myself broke and having to ask my parents ( who are already paying a lot) for more money. Should I go through with making porn or not? Should I consider getting a part time job or doing side work like making videos and writing in order to gain some cash?

For engineering, the school I’m at is good with connections to multiple big companies, my gpa is worse than the other school, it costs a shit ton more and I’m not enjoying myself, but that could just be because I’m not in specialized courses yet

If anyones ever been in a similar situation I’d really appreciate some advice",23Jan2018,2
140,"Hey!

Well long story short my ipad screen was smashed and I got it replaced at a phone shop, setting me back 80 quid. A month later I woke up and it's completly unresesponsive, I can't even slide to unlock it. Now, I want to get all the data off it and just put it all on a new device (seeing as it's about 5 years of photos/music/documents ect). However I am worried about going to a place for this as there is lot's of amature porn of myself on the device as well as pretty extreme porn on it too (nothing illegal, but you know..EXTREME extreme, cannot emphasise that enough).

Any advice? Should I take this to a shop and hope for the best? When I plug it into my laptop it shows the Ipad but clicking on it just returns a 'no files' message. Also I can't click the button saying I trust this device on my ipad because it won't react.

Should I just give up on the files and move on? What do? 

Thanks!",23Jan2018,29
141,"Okay, so, I'm not sure what I should do here.

My girlfriend's daughter (16) is hitting on me (29, yes, my girlfriend is older). I've been in the picture for a couple of years now, and she's never really had a father figure before, and I've done everything I can to essentially become ""dad."" I think trying to build a close relationship has backfired to a degree.

This is a relatively new thing, within the last two weeks, and I'll share some examples. Firstly, she's always on top of me, literally. I've never really minded her laying her head on me or something like that when we're all watching movies, but she's just straight up sat in my lap a few times now, coupled with extra hip movement that's definitely unnecessary.

Secondly, nudity. Her mother often will walk around nude for a bit after a shower or something like that, but no more than that. Her daughter has taken to doing the same thing, only it's all the time now, and seemingly only when I'm home. For example: the other day I came home from work and she was fully clothed, then she decided ""she was tired of clothes"" all of a sudden and went nude. Clearly, this is pretty inappropriate, and I've told her multiple times as much, but she's holding to ""my mom does it, why can't I?"" which can be pretty hard to refute. This is not the first time it's happened.

She tends to try to play around with me wherever we go (play fighting, cracking jokes, etc), which isn't out of the norm for the past couple of years, but it's just got a different feeling over the last couple of weeks. 

She's generally a really good kid, and I think it's a case of just being too attached and not knowing where the line is. I've brought it up to my girlfriend and she seems to think it'll just go away if I don't pay attention to it.

She's never really in my face about it, and at times things feel normal, but then she'll make remarks about finding a guy like me, etc. She's never had a boyfriend, or any close male friends for that matter, and I feel like that could play a part in this.

I'm also pretty sure she got her hands on some pictures that were definitely not meant for her, based on some comments she's made.

So, I don't really know what I should do.  Do I just ignore it and hope it goes away? How do I go about putting a stop to this without making her feel awful? 

Any advice would be very helpful. Throwaway for obvious reasons.",23Jan2018,97

I'll get right to the chase, December 31st my boyfriend broke up with me at 3 in the morning we had been together for about 5-6 months around the time he left me scared of my bisexuality (I had not cheated and had no plan to begin cheating) and his own insecurities he decided to ""give up"" on everything. I let it go and continued on but we've begun talking again he gives me small hints that he misses me, maybe im misreading some of what he's saying? but regardless i do miss him we were honestly happy together for a while at least and i miss that. However today we got to talking again and man it the best thing ever, nothing but laughing,jokes, and a healthy bit of flirting, but i'm scared. Im scared that we may get into a relationship again part of me wants him back, truly alot of me wants him back but another part of me thinks it may be too soon for me it has been only 3 or 4 weeks since our breakup.

One is a hippy guy he’s pretty cool straight forward guy, the other is kinda a Trouble maker, and me I’m semi in the middle I don’t want to stir the hornets nest to much considering these two have been there longer than me by like a year.

Well they watch the video and saw me standing on a cart (big no no at this company and understandably so) so the manager is absolutely pissed about it. The container can’t leave the building with out a label because pa has to scan everything they put on the truck so it couldn’t be scanned at all let Alone go out on a truck and it was a first offense for all of us quality wise. Well almost at the end of shift at about 9:15 or so I get called to the office and informed I’m being wrote up, I ask for what became my supervisor is cool I like him just not the department manager. And they said because I didn’t follow my standard work instructions for initialing each container that is filled by the machine operator and for standing on a cart. Now I’m s grown ass man own apartment pay all my own bills and even do laundry I do think I can read. Not write( sorry for grammatical errors lol :D ) but I can read. I tell them it’s not in my work instructions for me to initial any of the labels and never signed any form of deviation to do this. But standing on the cart I’m totally guilty of it was a Friday night 10 minutes before clock ou time and I was told just because it’s not standard across all shifts I need to do it because they want me to, which I do t mind that it’s not even extra work I carry a sharpie any way for other purposes but it’s more the principal of me getting a half bogus write up and kinda want advice on how to be petty the correct way to show my manager he needs to work with us and not agianst us any advice from you guys?

I continued to sit and text quietly as the women were talking and one sounded like she went into the stall. The other was my coworker.

SIR!"" then he looked through the space between the door right into my eyes. I said ""HELLO?"" and I don't remember what he said but my female coworker started apologizing and told me the other day a man fell asleep in the bathroom. I accepted her apology in the moment, at least i said ""its ok"". I don't think its ok.

Fast forward to now, I have two really close friends, and three pretty good friends, all of which I feel like I can talk to. But I just don’t feel connected with them the same way I was with my ex-best friend.

One is moving interstate, and I know that we will grow apart because of this, and she’s the closest thing I have to a best friend and I’m really upset about her moving, though of course I support her.

Three other friends are taking a gap year (I’m starting university in Australia in a few months) and therefore I feel like we won’t be growing together as I’ve gotten used to over school. 

The last friend I am really close with but she’s introverted and doesn’t like to hang out with me too much, preferring to stay home alone. She’s going to the same university as me but we don’t share the same work ethic and I feel like I’ll get stressed with academics and she will find someone more fun:

TLDR; I have friends I am close with that love and care about me but I’m still lonely.

162,"Location is southeastern Arizona.

I've been unemployed for three years. Half the reason I still haven't found a new job is my chronic depression, which got really bad when I was fired from my old retail job (my fault for being late too often). I'm trying to manage it with therapy and medication, but I'm on bare bones Medicaid so treatment is not always consistent.

The other half of the reason is that employees are incredibly disposable thanks to At-Will Employment laws, and there are million ways for corporations to screw over their workers, legally and not, and mostly they get away with it. Just check out /r/legaladvice if you don't believe me.

I am so tired of being poor and being unable to pay my own bills. (No unemployment, no food stamps, no welfare.) But I've worked retail and food service jobs before that were so stressful that I became suicidal. I absolutely cannot get another job like that, but I have no degrees or any significant skills which makes it very difficult to qualify for anything else.

* Should I take a gamble on chain companies anyway? Most have fairly explicit policies that protect both worker and supervisors but it can be a crapshoot whether they're actually adhered to, and HR exists to protect the company from liability, not necessarily to protect the workers. 

* Should I explore small local stores? From what I understand, they don't have the same level of federal and state protections for employees which could cause its own set of problems. Not to mention, most small business owners prefer to hire people they know through networking, and I have no network to speak of.

* Regardless of where I get employed, how do I keep myself from being abused (wage theft, hours slashed, asshole coworkers)? I don't want to be too assertive, but neither do I want to be a doormat. As someone who was raised from childhood to be obedient and submissive to authority (especially male authority) it's extremely difficult for me to stand up for myself against someone who has power over me.

So I was left with 0 friends because my image got ruined by the bullies that crossed the line and made false allegations that I was racist.

I work a basically min wage job, have no car or license (due to misdemeanors), and have essentially zero in savings.

I want to move out of state and go back to school, I have a friend in CO who would be able to help me get a little acquainted with the new city and would be of moral and emotional support but that would be it. I currently make approx $250/week, and only have $150 saved. I know I can realistically save $100/paycheck until I move.

Okay, so here comes the issue. A neighbor brought home a group of men saying they'll be able to restore power in the two streets of houses where I live in. They weren't from the authorities, so my dad and mom said hell no to that because they didn't looked professional at all + we were good with our generator and buying gasoline for it every other day + that shit is fucking ilegal.

We thought the house was on fire and we would burn inside, and that we didn't have much time. It lasted a minute and we ran outside.

The authorities came to us and they got rid of the shit they did that was causing the fire, also there were surveillance cameras on that night so we have evidence that they were messing with the electric pole and that there was a huge fire/explosion.

177,"Here is the situation. My parents divorced (1975), father remarried (1982). The woman he remarried had children, three girls. At the time they were 10/14/16 years old. Years go by and the oldest of the girls (call her Betty) gets married and has three children - two boys and the youngest a girl (I'll call her Jamie). I grew up with these people albeit only on weekends. Jamie grows up (probably about 40 by now) and all seems ok to me. I saw Jamie a couple of times and she had a girlfriend (lesbian if that's not obvious) and seemed fine. Along the way someone tells me that Jamie has some emotional problems and sees a therapist of some sort. Hey, we could all probably use one, right? Then a few days ago my father tries to tell me (in tears) that a few months ago Jamie told her mother Betty that a couple of times when she was really little my father sat her in his lap and had Jamie play with him (sexual abuse). Of course I believe my father, maybe I am wrong, maybe I am biased but it just doesn't seem to fit together. None of the three girls will speak to him now and honestly they were closer to him than I was. So for sake of argument assume that he is completely innocent. What should I do? What should he do? He is really hurt and is tormented by this. I don't want to jump to any conclusions or make any accusations but I do remember Jamie's father always wanting her to sit on his lap and maybe she is misinterpreting an old memory? I don't know what to do but I really want to help my father, and even Jamie if she did go through something like that. There will never be evidence either way.",23Jan2018,1

Have you had more success with the opposite sex when you are less concerned with starting a relationship and more focused on having the most fun you can? Or has it been more fruitful when you know that you want a relationship and you focus on approaching, flirting, escalating, etc.?

191,"(TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM)
I’m going to see a girl I like from High School soon, we will call her Gwen. Gwen went on a bit of a wild track after we lost touch. She’s polyamorous, a bleeding heart (I mean, I’m a liberal but sheesh), hippie who apparently developed some sort of heroin addiction that she had gotten over last year. Despite this she is definitely a nice person. I’ve known her since we were just little kids and essentially our story makes her out to be the Jenny to my Forest Gump, except I’m not mentally handicapped and she doesn’t have aids. No matter how long we stay apart we keep popping up in each other’s lives and I’m always just fine. I’ve always had a soft spot for her, one that is perhaps undeserved. I’m going to see her soon and this is the first time I feel like there may be some romantics between us, though I’m not sure. We had flirted a bit over text when we were younger but this might be different. If we got together it might be a tumultuous relationship that probably wouldn’t last very long. 
Some background is that I just got out of a 4 year stable relationship so I’m not even sure a long term stable thing is what I want right now. I know that there’s something to learn if I got with Gwen. 
On the other hand I saw another good old friend from high school tonight, we will call her Becca. She is funny, kind, cute, we like the same music, we agree on a lot, she has a few mental issues (depression), but all around she is a good person. While tonight wasn’t exactly a date, it was a bit more than just a friend meet up (we were brushing up and touching a bit) and I definitely like Becca. She is related to one of my best mates though and In his words “if you get together with her you better walk like you’re on glass. I don’t want things ending miserably between you two.” Things with her wouldn’t end miserably though. In fact, I can see us being very happy together in a long term relationship that lasts at least a year. 
I guess my question is this: I’m young so what should I end up pursuing? A stable relationship that I know is going to work? Or a possibly tumultuous relationship that holds mysteries and lessons to be learned?

TL;DR: Should I play it safe and pursue Becca, a girl who I know is going to be good in a relationship. OR should I take a risk and pursue Gwen, a wild childhood friend that I can learn some lessons from?

193,"Hi reddit, I'm dealing with a family situation and I just want advice on what to do next. It's nothing major really, I'm just not sure where to go forward.

So a couple months back, for my birthday my mom promises to get me a new smart TV. She told me she couldn't afford it right then but within the week we'd be going to get it. My birthday's in august so I just kind of let it slide when it didn't happen the next week figuring it would happen eventually. Cut to late September during her birthday.

She'd loved this particular kind of cake for a really long time, so I'd planned to get it for her. We'd gotten in a particularly bad fight the night before, so I'd stayed at a friends. I called her, set up everything to pick up the cake, bused home, and as I got home she told me: ""You're going to stay at your fathers for the next week."" To be fair she was quite sick at the time, so that was the reason for me needing to leave, but I told her that she couldn't expect me to pick up my life in the middle of the school year for a week and just expect it to be fine, so she agreed for only the weekend. We both agreed that'd be a long enough period of time for her to recoup.

At this point it was raining out so I ran out to get the cake. I don't have a drivers licence so I took the bus, and did my best to make sure the cake didn't tip, or get crushed. 

When I got home she told me she'd called dad and he was coming to pick me up that day.

I tried to not cry, and told her that was fine. We ate the cake I gave her her card, and she passed out. When dad came to get me I tried to leave without waking her up, but she came to give me one last hug.

When I got in the car with dad I just started bawling my eyes out. He did his best to console me, let me talk everything out, and we tried to make things better.

Cut forward (again) to Christmas. The TV still hasn't come in but at this point I wasn't really expecting it. She'd told me in November that I was gonna get it at the end of the month, but she'd said the same thing in October and September. So I guess her plan at this point was to give me the TV for Christmas, which was all well in good, except in the way that it basically meant she was  trying to weasel her way out of getting my any birthday gift at all. So Christmas comes and goes and no TV. Now I know saying this within this post is going to seem hypocritical, but I'm not really one to complain. We don't have a lot of money, we can't just go out and buy expensive things when we want them, I get it. But at this point it's January. So I'm in the shower thinking about this whole thing, this whole big ordeal and I figured I'd just ask her about it. Sit down, talk, etc etc. So I get out of the shower and I say. 

""Hey mom I just wanted to talk to you about that whole TV thing.""

and she says

""Oh yeah, grandma and grandpa told me not to get for you cause it was too expensive.""

So after all these month's of IOU's, and telling me it was gonna come in the next week and all that. She'd decided that she wasn't going to get it for me, without telling me, and just let me go on believing I'd get it eventually.

Now she wants to give me $500 to go to a new laptop for school, which is great, not gonna deny that, it just feels hollow. It doesn't feel like she's putting thought into a gift she knows I'd like, it's like she's paying a debt or settling a business deal.

Every time I try and bring up that it hurts to feel like she was completely fine with just not getting me a gift she blames it on my grandparents. No apology, none of that.

At the end of the day what I think is the worst part is that, I would've been much happier with a smaller gift, if it had been one that shown that she understood me. We don't need a TV we have two already, I'm moving out next year anyways so it's not like I can take it with me. 

I don't really know what to say moving forward or what to say to her about this whole thing.",23Jan2018,1

196,"My husband (37) and I (28) invited my friend to relocate to our state and move in with us while he gets on his feet in August last year. At first we were pretty flexible and accommodating, but we're severely struggling now. I need your help identifying flaws in my thought patterns. I think I'm being overly demanding.

My husband and I both work full time, and my husband works from home. 

J (24) lived at home with his mother in a different state and couldn't find a job. We thought it'd be fun to invite him to move in, help him out while he got a job. We knew going into this that, as an online gamer, he went to bed very late and woke up early afternoon. It was mentioned to him before he moved that this would have to change, but it wasn't pressed too much. He has previously spoken about getting his waking hours under control (10am - 2am I believe was stated at the time). 

Now 5 months later he's finally gotten a casual job, has applied to a masters degree in education, but is still keeping the same schedule. His waking hours have devolved somewhat - he used to eat dinner with us but now eats 2 hours later, then again in the early morning. He's inflexible in this regard: he had to eat every 5 hours, so if he doesn't eat breakfast by 2pm or so, he won't eat with us. 

He does the dishes once every 3-4 days. I get home from work every night to see his 3-4 dishes from the night before sitting on the sink, and that was a stretch to get him to bring them out. They previously just sat in his bedroom for up to 24 hours. He showers only once every 2 days, which I find unimaginable. 

His room smells bad on semi regular basis. We've paid for window screens so that end of the house can be aired out but they haven't yet been installed. I have complained about the smell but been told numerous times that I'm just overly sensitive.

His nocturnal behaviour is waking one or both of us up during the night approximately 3 times a week, to varying degrees. He admitted to me tonight that he avoided brushing his teeth last night to cut down on noise, after I had a go at him for waking me up at 4:45. His response tonight was that fixing his waking hours wouldn't help because he'd still be getting up to go to the toilet at that time and would wake us up.

His behaviour towards me has made my husband uncomfortable. He used to touch me in ways that my husband found very alienating. He'd play with my hair and hug me a lot. This has toned down to *almost* nothing since its been raised with him numerous times. Regardless of this, my husband has continued to feel alienated somewhat and admitted to me the week before Xmas that he was considering spending Xmas with his family in a different state. This was devastating to me.

I feel very anxious and sometimes angry in response to J's behaviour. It's gotten to the point where I'm spending a lot of time in my bedroom reading and watching videos alone because I can zone out and not feel anxious. I'm not coping. I need to find out what the other side of the story is, the things I haven't thought about. I can't talk to anyone else about it because I'll be judged and get ""I told you so"". I mean, why would a married couple take on a housemate in this stage of their lives?

We really did it to try to help him, and thought naively that it'd work out.",23Jan2018,3

I’ve always wanted to be an actor; I was always told I had a natural flair for it, but I think I always put it down as a pipe dream and went down the more conventional route. Now that I’ve done that, I’ve discovered it’s not for me, and that acting is honestly about the only thing I want to have a career in. I know it takes a lot of dedication (and luck) to make a success of acting, but I honestly would prefer to be in a dead-end job to fund my acting ambitions than to be stuck as an accountant for the rest of my life. I know I could continue with accounting and still pursue acting on the side, but, as I’ve said before, I feel like for once in my life, I want to completely disregard what other people are doing, and what other people want me to do, and to just do what I want to do.

I think I may be making a mistake by not signing up for football for next year.


The thing is, i'm really trying to focus on my favorite sport, Basketball, as i'm planning to try out for the Varsity team next year. The intense and grueling football season may take away all my energy for the grueling basketball season. It also could cause me to be rusty or even worse, I could get injured.


But say i don't even make the Basketball team. Then what? I just missed out on the amazing brotherhood of high school football, and missed my chance on playing my *second* favorite sport, American Football, for a whole year for nothing. I could always sign up for senior year, but still.


Also, the position(s) I would play in football, Cornerback and Wide Receiver, is one of the hardest positions in football.


My smallest concern is probably how tough the coach is. 3 hours of practice after school every day of him screaming and forcing us to do sprints

There’s a potential opportunity for me to make about $6 more per hour, which I plan on pursuing, but it’s not definite. I have a friend [19F] who’s also trying to move out, and we’ve talked about getting an apartment together, but since she’s not going to school and has a new well-paying gig she’ll probably be able to afford to move out before me, which might leave me without a roommate. If we do get an apartment together we may also need additional roommates regardless, but don’t know anyone else to move in with.

About 5 months back I stated taking with her. Over time we became good friends and would meet every once in a while.

We come from a conservative society where weed is consider a taboo and i grew up with the same concept for most of my childhood, during high school most of my friends use to smoke weed and i was the only one in the group who did not smoke. One night as we were talking she asked me if i smoke weed, I told her the truth that i have tried weed 2 times when i was drunk and under peer pressure and she said she had also tried it once under peer pressure and she was not thinking straight back then. I believed her. There were times when she use to tell me she wanted to try or experimenter weed with me which gave the impression that she likes weed. I use to reply saying its Illegal in Texas and I am not risking it. And told her not to risk everything we got for weed cuz if we get arrested and the word gets back home, we could cause shame to our family and having a criminal record would destroy out careers. And I told her, if she smokes weed I might walk out of her life... back then i didn't think she would smoke weed....

Yesterday was her 21st Birthday and I went to pick her up for the celebration with her friends. I called one of her friend and asked if there were enough drinks for her , I got a response said, that what see really wants is weed and there is more than enough of it. THAT WAS IT FOR ME,,,, i didn't know what to say, it felt like a part of me died on hearing that. I am not sure what was the worst think knowing that she use to smoke weed even after she moved to US and if she caught and failed drug test,,, things might get bad for her or knowing that she was lying to me the entire time. Later that night while driving to the party we went to gas station and just to see what she would say i asked her if she needed any rolling papers ... she said her friend has prepare everything and she suggested she use to smoke and drink at her previous college at another state in US where she studied for the last 2 years before moving to texas.

When we reached the party, i was somewhat angry and really depressed. As they started drinking, they talked about how high and drunk they use to be at their previous college and how crazy thing were. For me it was getting harder and harder, I know it her life and i have no right to interfere. So when they stated lighting the joints, I walked out to my car, I felt as if someone had punched me in my heart. So stayed in my car as I had to drop her home when the party was over.

After a while she came to my car and was asking me why I was a behaving like that and staying i my car, she said "" I didnt call you to the part to stay on your car"" , i told her i was angry with her and as i don't like weeds and dont want to be near it... It not her or her friends fault that i dont like weed, it my own problem and i dont want to ruin the night because of me. And I asked her why she never told me that she smoked weed. To my surprise she said she has not smoked, although i can see that she is definitely high. I asked her again and again why she is lying but she kept on saying she only had drinks and didnt smoke at all. I wanted that to be true but I was not as I asked her friend if she had been smoking and they said she had been.

Later when it was time to go home, I knocked at the door and told her it was time to go. I would tell that she just took a puff before she walked out of the room as I could smell it over her breath.

The whole way back I was just think about it, Is it knowing that she smokes weed that made the felt bad or is it knowing that she has been lying to my face for months and telling me what i wanna hear. I could sleep the whole night and i still felt sad and depressed about it.

I know its not my place to decide what she wants to do, its her life and her choices, but i cant stop to think of what is best for her and this ends up hurting my self.

I know i might not trust her the same way i use to but i dont wanna lose the friendship we have over this small incident. And i am struggling to move over it

222,"Hi,
Well I'm looking for a piece of advice, if someone has any.

I'm 23M, almost 24, and I don't have any serious perspective for the future. I never worked in my life, and since I got my degree I'm looking for a job, but I don't really know what to do. I have a master degree in litterature, obtained one year and half ago. I used to be really interested in litterature but I ended up hating it (mostly after my last year in college when I ended up in conflict with the teacher who supervised my research work). Now I don't know what to do as I don't know to do anything else, and my degree is often see in my country as a superficial one, as it's not technical enough, and as litterature is way too abstract/pointless (can't say I totally blame them lol).
I could take any kind of job, just the time to see more clearly the future, but every day I feel like I dedicate all my strenghts to keep everything together. 

I feel like I have a long life to live and I don't know what to do of it. I don't have any self-confidence, I'm extremely shy and introvert, I'm way too much sensitive and I'm deadly afraid of failure. I live with my parents but even if they support me, they don't understand me and they see things in me that are simply not here, and, still, I can't wait to be independant and have my own place.
I feel lonely as my few friends live far from me, and the only one who's live not far from me have a very busy life and she rarely seems to have a time for our friendship (of course I don't have any trouble to understand she has a life but it still sad to see our friendship suffer like this). I never had a girlfriend or any kind of romantic or sexual experience with girls so it weighs on me because I feel like I'm not good enough (I'm really not that great physically and tbh I really feel like the lack of job, perspective for the future and experiences with girls are a whole bunch of redflags).

I know that most of my issues can be solved by gaining self-confidence. But I feel like I'm stuck in a weird situation, where it seems that I have a lot of things to aim for : finding a girlfriend, a job, becoming independent, etc., but I don't have the self-confidence that I need to do that. And ironically in order to gain self confidence, I need to achieve one of these things on my list like I can only gain some that way.
In the end, my issues are all connected with each other and are feeding themselves ; I want to do something with my life, I really want to, I want to change this situation, but I don't know how to do it. I don't know at all how to solve all of this.

TL;DR: I don't know what to do with my life and I totally lack of self-confidence to find my path

So if someone as an advice on how I can procede with this, it would be really great ! Sorry if this a long post, and if it's not always clear, english is not my first language.

227,"I am deeply insecure about my physical appearance. It is something I am slowly working on improving. Sometimes I wonder how I even have friends when I can't even stand to look in the mirror most days. Even though I know they're not shallow people, I still wonder how they can spend time with someone so physically repulsive.

Luckily, the physical is something I can change. What I need to work on is where I value myself for who I am rather than what I look like, and train myself to start believing that maybe my friends can see these values and qualities too.

228,"I work in insurance sales for an insurance agent. Very recently I thought I was getting the can for not hitting sales goals put on me and my other coworker. I understood so I started looking for jobs for other companies. I applied for a position at a fairly large bank as a teller and as a claims rep for another insurance company. I’m currently in the interview process for both of those positions, with no offer letter in hand for either. The starting pay as a teller is $15/hr, and for the claims rep it can range anywhere from $15-20/hr. Currently I make $10/hr plus commission (which is uncapped). I had a conversation with my boss last week and he was considering keeping me regardless if the goals were met or not if I wanted it. Yesterday he confirmed that he wants to keep me regardless of what happens with the goals, and is offering to raise my hourly to $11/hr, the commission structure is also changing for the better starting February 1st.

Now my issue is he wants to know if I’m 100% committed and I’m not sure. I really want to be but I’m not in a financial situation where I can live off of 11/hr and just hope my commission will make up for it, and the last thing I want is to tell him that I’m committed and then hypothetically get an offer next week and say “Oh yeah nevermind.” Normally I’d have no issue doing that but I can’t bring myself to do it at this job. He’s helped me out a lot personally when he didn’t have to and is just all around a good person. He’s gotten screwed over by other ex coworker and I don’t want to be someone else that he adds to the list of people that have screwed him over.

I would give him 2 weeks notice minimum if I happen to get another offer. I’m willing to help stay for training my replacement for as long as I can. I’m just not sure the best way to tell him that without making it seem like I’d bail at a moments notice, because this isnt a bridge I’d want to burn either. Any advice would be appreciated!

229,"My fiancé and I moved from Chicago to Texas in order to keep my $20/hr nanny job (they also pay my taxes and give huge bonuses and time off). Problem is, we've been in Texas for a year now and we HATE it. We're in the cheapest apartments in a really ritzy area, so we're constantly bombarded with glimpses of a life we will never be able to afford where the median cost for a house is in the upper $300,000's.

240,"I'm 39F and work and live in a mid-size university town and I work on campus. I worked for five years at old job. This past August, I left and started working at current job. My old job is now open and they've made some changes and they want me back. What should I do? 

Why I left old job: 

- I was tired of the work

- I shared an office with a crazy, angry racist 

- When I reported the crazy, angry racist (about one year in), I was told to be an adult and handle it myself

- I was particularly annoyed and done with one professor that was very needy and demanding and rude

- The people were okay, but super old school. My supervisor was very nice. I was the youngest one there by like 15 years. 

- Everything is very structured

- I was annoyed every day by all of the above and just felt DONE 


New job: 

- I didn't get a raise to move because I went to a lower pay grade. My salary stayed the same. 

- I like the work, it's different and I'm pretty good at it (so far)

- There's more to my job, but I haven't learned it yet despite asking many times to be trained. I'm kinda bored and still feel I don't really know what's going on. Everyone is super busy except me. 

- I'm left out of a lot of work-related decisions and plans. They apologize and say they'll fill me in and never do. 

- The people here are incredibly cool and fun. They take day trips to do fun stuff. They go out all the time. Sometimes on Fridays, we all put Bailey's in our coffee and blast music. 

- They leave me out A LOT. They'll order lunch and not ask me. They'll all go out and not invite me. They have meetings and forget to include/invite me. 

- They all went out on Friday and I only know because they're all talking about it incessantly. All of the IT department was there, too. I've really tried to show them that I'm game and can party and have fun. Other than leaving me out all the time, they seem to like me? When they include me, I always say yes. 

- I'm the oldest one here by a couple months. 

- It's very unstructured here. We'll take an hour and a half lunch just talking. When I'm included, I really like the people and atmosphere here. 


The person my old job hired to replace me didn't work out. They want me to apply, and I know if I apply I'll get the job. Here's what they've changed in the position since I left: 

- The position now has a private office on a different floor than the crazy racist

- The demanding professor left for another school

- The person who told me to handle the racist lady ""like an adult"" is not longer there 

- I'll probably get a raise if I go back

245,"So, some backstory may be helpful. My mom got into an arranged marriage when she was 18. Her relationship with my dad has been very rocky throughout. If she could, she would have divorced him a long time. Religious/cultural reasons/not having enough money is why she can't at the moment. My dad is a gambling addict, which is where most of the issues come from. Just last night, he didn't come home till 5:00 AM even though his shifts end way earlier. Last month or so, I've been noticing my mom goes into her room for long stretches of time and talks very quietly on the phone. I immediately thought something was up, because as a teen that's what I would do when talking to a boy she didn't approve of. Just today, I was listening in to some of the convo.

246,"I've been dealing with generalized anxiety &amp; depression for about 7 years now-- probably more-- the feelings go back almost as far as I can remember. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and a few different therapists for about 4 years. Medication like SSRI's only cause my depression to manifest itself into a dull, constant boredom instead of a deep constant sadness; and therapy has only provided some moderate help with my underlying issues. 

This has always been an issue for me, but I've always found ways to move forward. Even when my hobbies lose everything about them that makes them enjoyable, even when I can't get out of bed in the morning, even when I feel soul-crushingly lonely, I've always been able to get myself through the day hoping tomorrow would be better.

I feel like it might be important to note that I'm an experienced meditator as well, I've been meditating for 25 minutes a day for several years. Meditation has helped me much more than anything else I've tried for depression and anxiety, but perhaps I'm digressing from the point of this post.

Anyway,

Ever since my depression started in high school, I've looked to self-medication for relief. I started smoking weed because I didn't like how I felt so bored all the time, and slowly started smoking every day. I moved to xanax, then opiates, and ended up struggling with roxycontin for about 6 months. My friends were not positive influences on me at all, and many of my closest friends in high school eventually went on to use heroin and go into lengthy rehab programs. Being able to see my friends struggle with heroin was what made me finally kick opiates, I saw their lives falling apart and I never wanted it to happen to me.

After I kicked roxy, I still found that I was trying to fill some hole that was inside of me. I moved on to other drugs instead of opiates (particularly LSD) and although I was proud of myself for getting off the ""hard stuff"", taking hallucinogens on the reg was still not good for me. I was able to cut down my LSD usage, and that's when I discovered the beauty of microdosing.

I would take 40ug's before class every few days, It improved my mood to a significant degree that I never thought to be possible. I was attending classes, doing my work, making meaningful relationships. After I had some time to accept my problems and work on improving myself, I finally was able to get off of antidepressants. They were horrible-- the withdrawals, the numbness, the sexual indifference-- I just wanted to leave that all behind me and work on myself through meditation and therapy. After a couple weeks of being off of depression meds, I was able to stop taking LSD so frequently. It was a major crutch for me, and although it DID help my situation, I decided it was best to leave the trips for special occasions and move on with my problems naturally. 

I would order tabs online and save them for a special time, and trip maybe once a month or less. I was feeling even better, and eventually was able to quit smoking weed. 

After being completely sober for 4 days in a row for the first time in over year, I was feeling amazing. My motivation was high, and I was optimistic about the future. But that's when It all started falling to shit. 

I had ordered tabs about a month and a half before the ""incident"", and after noticing that they had gotten taken by customs, I realized that ordering this shit offline was seriously risky and not worth it at all. Without my knowledge, a reshippment was issued to my billing address at my university, so when I found it in my mailbox i was pretty surprised. I took it into my apartment and put it somewhere safe, and did not use any nor was planning on using it anytime soon (granted, I did not want to throw them out because, to me, the tabs represented a lot of money that I didn't feel right about getting rid of just yet).

After the aforementioned 4 days of sobriety (with the tabs j chillin' in my apartment) I received a call from my school's campus security asking me to come in to talk about a crime I was a potential witness to. I couldn't get out of the meeting, so before work, I took the bus to campus to see the officer who called me. After he met me at the door, he led me into a room with two federal agents waiting for me. 

They had the package that was seized, and long story short, I was not under arrest, but they needed my cooperation in taking down the lab that I bought from. I worked with them and called my attorney, but when they asked me if I had gotten a reshipment I hesitated and they then assumed that I had substances in my apartment. and after being threatened with a federal search warrant, I signed a consent to search form because I didn't want my housemate to get involved in this and hate me forever. 

Campus security along with the Fed's escorted me to my apartment and had me place my package into an evidence bag. I was still not under arrest, but now the university was aware of my situation.

As of now, I'm awaiting a hearing with my school, and I'm facing a year-long suspension along with several other repercussions. I'm so afraid that my education is going to be jeopardized, I had aspirations of attending Law School, but with this on my record, I'm finding it very hard to believe that I'd get into a valid program. On top of that, I'm about to lose my support network of friends who have empowered me to quit using drugs and have shown me how to enjoy life only to go home to a town where I have nothing and nobody. I'm terrified of falling back into a rut where I use substances to relieve my pain, and it's so unfortunate that something like this happened just as I was beginning to fully sober up for the first time in a significantly long while.

I'm at a total loss right now, I have no idea what to do and I'm finding it impossible to get my mind off the situation. If anybody has any advice, stories, comments, questions, etc. please post them, this is one of the most difficult times ive ever had to get through. Thanks.

TL;DR-- Microdosing LSD has helped me immensely with my depression, but now my uni knows that I bought it online, and is trying to hit me with a year-long suspension and drug rehabilitation program. Nobody got hurt, nobody else was involved, but I need help moving forward with my mental and educational situations. ",23Jan2018,1

248,"Hi all,

About 6 months ago I left to France from the US to do an 18 months secondment to the Paris office of my company. I’m really liking it here, and a few months ago I started going out with a French girl who I work with, and long story short we are very much in love.

I’m going back home in a few months to visit, and I think it’s time to tell all of this to my family. The problem is that my family is, depending on your perspective, either very close or very possessive (I would say possessive). They are also fairly observant Jews – on multiple occasions, my dad has said that if I marry a non-Jew, he would consider his life a failure and is not sure he could have a relationship with me. Personally I am an atheist and have no interest whatsoever in any religious practice, and she is exactly on the same page. 

An equally important point is that she has no intention of moving to the US, so I would have to stay in France indefinitely to be with her (which I am fine with, I like it here a lot and my employer has already said they would be happy to keep me indefinitely). This would absolutely devastate my family however. 

So basically in 1 conversation I would have to tell my family that I am dating someone non-Jewish and seriously considering staying in France permanently. I have no clue how I should approach this – should I just flat out say it? Should I tell them before I come home so that they don’t blow up and do something drastic when I’m actually visiting? I am really nervous about this because I know for a fact this will likely be one of the worst moments of their lives, and while they have some flaws my family really is wonderful in a lot of ways and I do care about them a lot.",23Jan2018,1

251,"Hello, I'm a 25 years old male and I've been considering a couple of things. I've been doing some serious thinking about these things and I really can't find answers. I'm really irritated about the fact that I've been half in a trance throughout my whole life and that this has caused several limitations to myself. I really have never been awake to life in a sense that I could never lead a life that gave me a sense of fulfillment. I feel very distant from everything, and not in an emotional sense. I feel like i'm not really present at this moment. During all of my child and teen years i've always been more dreaming than awake. It's a very surreal feeling, to be honest. My vision tunnels as it concentrates on a spot and I can see nothing else but this one spot and at the same time I begin detaching and my eyes start looking into the void, then I begin daydreaming and having different kinds of intuition. It's beyond my control! I've tried hard to control myself and not let this happen, but it's involuntary.

I really can't understand what is going on. This trouble I have on focusing on the here and now has led me to a video game addiction and a deteriorating life situation, where I have no friends or close ones, no money and no more ideas how to do anything with life. All I have left is overflowing health (because I've learned how to care for myself very well) and my family. It really is very disturbing. I space out a lot. My spirit goes somewhere else far away from where I'm standing and there's nothing I can do. I'm very eager to engage life and to be very present, to be awake and actually see the things that are right in front of me.

I have no ideas what is going on. People try to give me advice from a purely emotional perspective that is completely useless. I just wish I could break free from this cycle of detachment and daydreaming and lead a fulfilling, meaningful life.",23Jan2018,1

257,"First of all, here's some context. I have anxiety and have been troubled by it for years now, I've never really been as far from my parents like Rome. So this separation anxiety from my family as well as my home is really making nervous and really stress.


Second of all, I mainly signed up to the Rome trip because my friend was interested in it, and so was I (which was mainly due to my friend talking many good things about it). This was a couple months ago, and now we I kind of not talking to each other at all, due to my envious of him (he is quite smart in lessons, which I don't want to get in right now).


So I'm literally on the verge of cancelling the trip, even though my parents have paid for it!. It is also coming six days, and I don't know what to do.

We had to memorize Bible versus every week, if we failed to memorize them, we would receive spankings. We were not allowed to believe in santa (or anything like that). Not allowed to read anything that had magic, not allowed to take any Sex Ed classes and never were given any sexual education whatsoever, and constantly threatened with burning in hell. I am now a 24year old male, married, and have an open mind. Having said that, no matter what I do or how much I learn and use my logical abilities, I still find myself being governed by deep rooted ideas of going against ""God"" and burning eternally in Hell or feeling like I am doing something extremely wrong by questioning the religion that was forced upon me.

Today my girlfriend didn't go to work because she's ill and I wasn't talking to her all day.
When I got time to talk for a while via messenger I recieved a message:
 
""Don't be angry or sad ok?""
I replayed with ""What happened"" and she told me that she feels really insecure, she finds me really atractive and she thinks that other girls will try to get me and asked if I found other girls attractive.

I replied with ""Well I can tell if a girl has pretty face but does this mean anything? I can't change the way I look at people, cant change my eyes lol""

and she got super upset after that, sent me picture of herself crying and saying that ""I regret that I told You anything about that, I thought You would say I was the best and this would be it, You don't have any empathy, I just want to be the best girl for You""

261,"Did I do the right / an okay thing?

I've been working at this job that pays well for the past two years. Absolutely nothing wrong with it. This is my third year. 

A while ago, a recruiter contacted me on LinkedIn about a similar position at a healthcare thing. Healthcare is a better industry than what I have currently. I accepted the offer and was waiting for an interview. In the meantime, I felt that I should tell my boss. At the end of the meeting, he said that if the opportunity is legitimate, to talk to him as he might be able to offer me something competitive. I translated that to me that he wanted to keep me and was willing to give me a raise. I never got to the interview stage so I dropped it. Don't know why and it doesn't really matter. The same recruiter forwarded my profile to another recruiter because she knew recruiter 2 was looking for someone like me. 

A couple months later (last week), Recruiter 2 contacted me with another offer. Junior to my current position, same job, yet paying 10k better, room for growth, and better vacation. I accepted the offer and had an initial interview. Looks good so far. 

Remembering what my boss said, I approached him and told him the truth. Everything. What salary they were offering, that I had an interview, that it will start in a month if they take me, etc. He asked - with a smile - what I wanted from him and I replied honestly: a counter offer. He nodded and said that he will get on it as a top priority.  

That was at around 09:30 this morning. For some reason now (13:10), I have this fear that upper management will just spit on what i did, fire me, and say: if you want out, get out. 

What do you guys think?

271,"Not sure if this is the right place but here I go.

Let's call her Emily. Emily's family is renting an apartment here in upstate NY, and have been for about 3 years. A year in, they noticed the plumbing was weird. Ex toilet not flushing, pipes in the basement being loud, problems with the sinks, shower, and washing machine. A few months ago, the pipes had exploded downstairs and started flooding the basement. The landlord was blaming the neighbors for shoving wipes, maxipads, and paper towels down the toilet, because that was coming out the other end. This went on for a while and after the pipes had kept breaking (never actually fixed, just patched over and over, the plumber she brings has not resolved it) she started to blame them for shoving stuff in the toilet. Especially blaming her brother who is 18 but also has Asperger's (""you know how rebellious teens are."") No one in the home is doing it, and the neighbor next door is a gentle elderly man, it'd be odd for him to do that, especially since they never had problems with him and have been friendly.

About a month ago, the landlord finally got people to work on the pipes, under the street and they had said the very old plumbing is rotting away. They did what they could to fix it and left. Right away, the basement starts flooding whenever someone used the toilet. The plumber had checked their toilet and insisted it was the pipes that were worked on in the street's fault. Emily's family suspects it could be her since she's gutting out a third connected residence and has been known to accuse people easily.

Now, the landlord is trying to get them to move out because septic fumes are smelled throughout the house and whenever the toilet is flushed, it's audible throughout the house that the basement is starting to flood again. (What I've meant by flooding, has been sewage, and they've cleaned it up as much as they could to save furniture stored away.) Just yesterday she had told them to try not to use any plumbing, only ""sparingly,"" despite the fact they have been doing so for months but now more strict.

They've been having problems with this landlord since the pipes first started acting up. Besides that, she stops by whenever she feels like unannounced or ""I'll be there in about hour."" They have always had their rent on time despite having very low income, saving everything for the bills, but the landlord won't take it on a scheduled basis, only whenever she feels like it, whether she needs it now or couldn't be bothered to notify that she actually wasn't coming that night and wasted their time waiting.

Right now, she's starting to be forceful about picking up everything and leaving, even saying to find a local shelter. The family is Emily, 22, her mom, her brother, 18, and their dog. They share a car with Emily's mom, the only one having a Driver's license, but leaving is very impossible for them with the low income they have. All of them work, but it's just not possible. 

What can they do? They have been thinking of finding a lawyer as well for the fact they have to beg their landlord to fix the problem and to stop accusing them for breaking the pipes, and an assortment of other problems. 

TL;DR: Landlord trying to kick friend's family out over unacceptable but barely livable plumbing, and they have very little money (not much credit as well) and have no where to go.

277,"I have been working at a fairly high end car dealership for about 3 years now. I started off as a part time broompusher/clean-up in the large shop and slowly made my way into porting cars, and currently now am working as a lane assistant (which is basically a porter with more responsibilities). This includes everything from moving vehicles, customer service, customer greeting, quality control, delivering vehicles and customers, dealing with technicians, and much more.

About seven months ago I approached my manager about becoming the express lane advisor which we had an open position for. This would not only close to double my pay from 10 dollars an hour to a salary of around 700 dollars a week, but would also give me the experience in order to become an advisor almost anywhere. I truly want this career due to my enthusiasm dealing with guests and my computer/automobile knowledge. My manager seemed to really entertain the idea and I had a lot of support from the other advisors and technicians.

Since this meeting I have approached my manager multiple times up until close to Christmas. Most meetings have either been short and deflection filled, or ended with him saying he had a lot to deal with at the time. My manager approached me around Christmas and stated he hadn't forgotten about me, but due to how poor business had been recently it was difficult to justify it to the owner. I agreed and haven't approached him since.

My major problem is due to the overwhelming amount of work and stress I have to deal with. Not only do I have to answer to multiple people who push jobs onto me, I have to cover for the lazy porter that works with me, as well as covering when the shuttle driver leaves midway through the day. This, alongside of the pay, lead me to not even care about the possibility of being promoted due to the stress. It's exhausting waiting for something that may not occur whilst also working myself half to death. Not to mention I also have an hour long drive to this job(it was originally 25 minutes but I moved in with my current girlfriend who was unable to relocate due to school).

I feel like this is my only shot at moving up and making more than a decent living, but it almost seems not worth it. I'm tired of giving everything I have to a job that doesn't give a damn about me.

I'm unsure if I should keep at it in hopes of the promotion and potential of a good career, or just give up and settle for barely above minimum wage somewhere else.

If there are any questions I will answer as best as I can, I could go on for hours.

Thank you very much for your time and advice!",23Jan2018,7

Just as I was folding the last shirt my manager comes up to me and says “Hey it doesn’t have to be perfect. It’s almost 8 so let’s just start working on recovering since the regional manager is coming tomorrow.” I told him that I actually just finished to which he replied “okay great, perfect timing” I know this because I planned to finish at 8. He then tells me to recover all of the messiest items first and if we don’t get to the things that aren’t noticeable that it’s okay and I take too much time recovering.

285,"I think this is a common problem young adults run into, and it runs the risk of sounding too First-World Problems. I doubt my situation is unique and I think others have found solutions.

Since graduating college three years ago, I have lost what I would describe as a spark for life. In my early 20s I loved reading, learning new things, discovering new ideas, pushing myself mentally and physically, and meeting people I grew passionate about. You know. Living. 

Now it's difficult to read without becoming distracted. New thoughts and ideas feel reduced to cliche Facebook posts. Television shows are endless repetition of the same tropes. Running and exercise feel like the beginning of yet another false start. I've largely fallen out of touch with friends, and it's been years since I met someone I felt passionate about. 

I think some of it is growing older and being less impressed with myself. I was a cocky little shithead in college.

But details aside, the problem exists. Is it that I've let myself get wrapped up in short-term gratification? Self-defeating thoughts? That I'm too self-absorbed? I've also considered that I don't do enough to improve others' lives.

There was a brief respite a year-and-a-half ago when I began a new career that offered a lot of variety. I was later disillusioned with some walls I hit in the industry, but that's a completely different story.

294,"A year ago, I moved to a new town and went to the local branch of my gym spin class. One class in particular was run by an instructor who regularly has conversations with certain people in the class through the microphone, which blasts all over the class. Mostly football or vacations, but enough with the talking, you're supposed to be teaching class. But I could get over that. I could not, however, get over her heavy breathing directly into her microphone during the entire class, and I also didn't like how two of the regular class-goers used the entire class time to talk, laugh, and sing along with the songs while discussing the love lives of the singers. The instructor never told them to STFU and it was super annoying so I stopped going and found another class to go to at another studio. 

About two months ago, I started going back to this same spin class. It had been about a year and I forgot why I hated the atmosphere. Once I got there, I remembered, but I need the cardio and I like spin, so I decided to suck it up and look past the annoyances. Until today. This morning, the instructor started class, then lowered the music to announce how much she hates people from California and others in the class chimed in about how those from California who move to where we live (a ""red"" state) need to be ""taught how to vote"" and ""how we do things"" around here. One person went so far as to hope that all of the disasters lately would make the entire state of California break off into the ocean. I did not speak.

I worked a fast food job at the airport majority of the time and had a decent internship, I thought the internship would span out into something permanent but it didn't. The internship got super akward because they never had work for me to do an when I looked for stuff to help it just reinforced the fact there was no reason for the office to have a internship. Inevitably they told me the internship was coming to a close not that I minded.( It was 4 buses and a 3 hour ride each day).  My fast food job which i knew was more stable should be self described, I positively hated it especially after graduation because once your just working with no ""student"" tag to your name you really start to feel the full kick in the nuts of working  these jobs. I was arguing with proud high school drop outs over the dumbest of things having patronizing conversation with managers over absolutely ridiculous issues. (A lady threw a burger I didn't make over the counter because it had pickles, instead of doing anything the manager apologized to her and threatened continued employment in front of her the. wrote me up)  Eventually as I was busy doing dishes as was instructed the manager wanted to see me and that was all she wrote. 


Long story short I believe I found a job in my field that I really enjoy it definitely has the potential to expand into a career for the first time ever I have benefits and paid time off not 15 minutes of hiding trying to compose myself by saying ""I need this job"" I'm a lot more happier now I'm not working there. But I still kick myself  occasionally over all the lost time I wasted being miserable an being spoken to like a tool by randoms. Has anyone had a similar experience to this?

296,"Our holiday/vacation fiscal year starts Jan 1 and ends Dec 31. Annual Leave, Floating Holidays, Personal time cannot be carried over. Not sure about Time in Lieu and/or time owed.

Last year (2017), December, I was informed by management that I had 3h left of Time in Lieu to use. I used it and connected it with the stat holidays.

Jan 23, 2018, the time sheet for 2017 have been recalculated and it shows that I owe 9 hours of over time to the company.

What can I do? Obviously I don't think it's fair that I was told I had time to use and suddenly I owe the employer time. A huge part of the discrepancy is that the employer suddenly changed the late policy. If you're late for 10 minutes, you owed 30 minutes, the previous policy was 15 minutes. Unfortunately, none of this was written anywhere until management changed it to 10 min = 30 min owed.

**TL;DR: I got retroactively penalized from having 3 hours time in lieu left to owing 9 hours to the company.**

299,"Background:

My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 11yrs and unsuprisingly she wants to move out and have a place of her own with me. After years of hard work we are both financially able to move out and live comfortably. I want the same but my biggest concern is my mom, whom I live with now.

My mother use to be very independent but in the past 5 years she battled against cancer, and beat it twice. Despite her best efforts she is not the same anymore. Although she still prefers to do things on her own, there are everyday things she can no longer do without help. If I leave I know her life will be significantly more difficult day to day.

Also when I told my mother that I wanted to move out she has nothing but kind words and well wishes as she wants me to be happy. She insist that she will be okay living alone.

I've also proposed that my girlfriend simply move in as my girlfriend and mother are fond of each other but understandably my girlfriend still prefers to move out for the sake of independence.

So reddit, I'm stuck. I don't know what to do. I want to move out with my girlfriend but also be able to take care of my mother. What should I do?

. I'm a 17 Iranian student [Male]. Recently I found that i am highly perfectionist. I always want the best in all aspects. I even daydream about being a very wealthy person or even hero of the world. I think this is because that i hate myself. I don't accept myself as i am. Every day i become more and more addicted to wishful big dreams while i hardly even make a step to reach what i want. I spent most of my time in front of computer only to forget my problems and escaping from reality. I am destroying myself. WHY? i don't know. But i feel if i forgive my past everything is going to be OK. yet i cannot.

 One thing that really hurts me is that my 17 is very very DIFFERENT from my 16. Last year i was highly active and i had discipline. I was very happy (unlike now). My 16 was perfect. How did all this start? In Iran there is a competitive exam for entering to university. The exam is like 5 months from now and i haven't study yet (While my friends are doing well). I could have start study in past months but i didn't. My (stupid) excuse was :""I cannot pass the exam. I'm gonna fail cause i haven't start studying perfectly"" And now even when i became aware of my perfectionist and wrong way of thinking, I cannot change my actions. I'm still depressed because of my past and i cannot forgive myself. I still think in perfectionism:""Either the best university in Iran or no university at all"". 

Why Can't I accept myself as I am? Why can't I accept my mistakes? Do i really hate myself? How should i forgive my past? Please help me. thank you.

Anyways, I figured that I'll just drive something that allows me to steer a vehicle from the middle of the vehicle and I think motorcycles are the perfect answer.

They know celebrities whose sons or daughters died to motorcycle accidents and they won't let me drive a motorcycle, to the point where they said they would literally disown me if I drove a motorcycle.

I know they're not joking because they're not the kind of people that joke around like that. What should I tell them to convince them that motorcycles make me feel safer?

313,"Hi, a little backstory first. I got into major credit card debt and long story short, had to move in with my girlfriend's family because I couldn't afford to pay for my own place and my family is a no-show. 

It's been fine living with them, her mom is amazing and I love her. My girlfriend and I are as close as ever. We've had no issues before and everything has been going smoothly. I've even helped out a lot, I bought her mother a brand new washer and dryer ($3k), a new toaster ($50), a new toaster oven ($400), a new vacuum ($300) and so on. I've also helped out a lot, I clean as much as I can, do the dishes and I even redid their kitchen, it looks spotless now. 

Fast forward to today, we had an issue. My girlfriend, her mom, her cousin and I live here. They are all native French speakers from Canada but they also speak fluent English, Creole and Spanish. I only speak English and Spanish. The issue that we had today is I've felt a bit uncomfortable with the fact that her cousin speaks in French whenever I'm around, knowing that I don't understand a word. Even when my girlfriend responds in English, he sticks to French. I went up to him today and asked him if he could speak in English more often just so I could be involved in conversations and I wouldn't feel like an outsider. He blew up in my face and said he's not gonna change his language for anyone and that this is his house and he can speak whatever language he wants and that I'm a nobody who doesn't matter because I'm not part of the family and he is so I have no say in this. I retorted by saying that while I may be living here rent-free, I have spent a LOT of money replacing my girlfriend's mom's appliances and cleaning and paying for most of the gas of the family car whenever it needs it and pretty much doing anything I can to help so I should have a voice. We ended the argument and that was that. 

Mind you, he also lives there rent-free and actually contributes much less than I have, he always says he doesn't have money to pay for gas (even though he gets Amazon packages every other day) and he hasn't contributed to the new appliances or anything, it's all me. His mom doesn't even live here, this is his Aunt that's letting him live here for free just so he can go to school in this state, his mom lives in another state. He also got busted for getting drunk and passing out TWO separate times and got in deep shit. So I honestly feel like I've been less trouble than he has, even though I'm a ""nobody"". 

Am I wrong to ask him to speak in English more often so I can be involved? He speaks English and French both fluently, so it's not a language issue. He just refuses to.

So apart from moving somewhere else I don't see any chance. And moving away just to increase my chances of finding a girl is mad. I couldn't really live without my friends we're too close for that. ",23Jan2018,2

344,"My family has five drivers and three cars. My parents mostly share one car and the other two are shared between my brothers and I. My twin brother and I are both college students and I also work, so each of us uses separate cars mostly because of our differing schedules. My older brother does not work but he would still like to use the cars when he wants. That's reasonable, but he doesn't put gas in the cars very often. The other thing is that the cars have different gas mileages, so somebody is always complaining they pay more for gas. Buying another car is not an option as no one in my family can afford it.

345,"Hi. So I'm 31 and don't know what to do with my life. 

So I still live at home and I'm looking to move asap. My home life is shit and just stayed with me when it comes to talking to people.
I went to college and got two associate's but I didn't stick with my majors. Pretty much just went from job to job being bored and spending my money on stupid shit. Most jobs I had were seasonal year after year. The one that I could have stayed I quit because I just got bored or hated the people I worked with. 
I've been depressed on and off for years. That's another reason my life has just been blah/wasting away. Only now I'm starting to feel like a loser and want to make a change. I'm working part-time now and I like it but Im looking for something better/long term to get my life/future on track.

I like art, music, photography buy I lost my interest in making that my career because of my depression. Haven't had a girlfriend/sex since college. Don't really talk in general so making new friends is hard.

Can you guys/gals give me some advice. Not sure what I want to do. I know going back to school is not what I want to do. Still paying off student loans from the 1st time.

Will probably edit/add more details when I get time too.

Thanks is advance. I know I'm a loser so negative comments probably won't hurt...

Then when I moved in with her we had such a horrible relationship that it involved me screaming at her and leaving the location. Luckily the leasing office let us leave without penalty. Well, I found out after I moved my stuff that she never helped clean her part of the apartment! In fact she left stuff all over the house and never picked it up. The apartment office has called her three times with no answer. Then it goes to collections and I am left with the closing costs of the apartment!!!!! They call her to see about helping with the closing costs but she does not answer, but she has time to show up to gym class. Me and her are not on speaking terms and every time I see her I want to scream. What I have done though is find many ways to avoid seeing her meaning going to different classes, saying no to things that mutual friends will me too, etc. I have forgiven her but I just do not want anything to do with her.

Ever since I was younger she always told me I was a handsome kid and to never settle down with some whore or any girl that I should settle with a great one. Recently, she started acting a little strange. She now grabs my hands, looks at them, and says how big my hands are and how she likes guys with big hands. She invites me over very frequently now to sleep over. She treats me super good; (she cooks for me likes to help me in whatever way she can). The last times I went over, she would invite me to sleep in her bed with her and she would tell me to just sleep in my boxers. I just went along with it and just did it. When we would sleep, she would get really close and put her hand on my abs and just rub her finger on them. I also noticed she would wear shorter dresses to sleep with no panties on or no bra on. In the morning as always I had morning wood and would try to cover it but she would say that it’s okay and she had seen that stuf already so I just made myself comfortable. I caught her many times looking at me in a very sexual way and she would even bite her lips when she looked at me. I acted like I never caught her looking and acted normally. I don’t know; should I just let this slide and ignore what she is doing ir should I play this game with her?

He is extremely sensitive to criticism, cannot accept when things do not go his way, and reacts violently when he is faced with these things. He has psychotic episodes and rage episodes in which he claims to black out and not know what happened. We have had to call the police on him before due to the severity of his episodes.

He lives at home with my parents because there is no way that he can hold down a job with his oppositional behavior. However, my parents are elderly and cannot handle his outbursts. They also enable his behavior by giving him everything he wants and never giving him consequences to bad behavior (out of fear.) They do not seem very concerned with finding a place for him, but it's becoming extremely dangerous for my parents to be alone in the house with him.

I really cared for him a lot and it was really hard on me as well because I couldn't see a future with him no matter how hard I tried. We were just too fundamentally different and his depression, debt and pessimism was too much for me to handle and I quickly figured out I couldn't be the answer to his problems.

When we broke up he didn't day a word to me and started trashing his place yelled at me to get the fuck out and locked himself in the bathroom. It was really scary and devastating that he took it so poorly. I left and called his sister letting her know the situation and to check on him. 

Today I get a text from his coworker that didn't know we broke up asking if he was okay and informing me he was in the hospital. I texted his sister in a panic and she let me knew he was in the hospital due to attempted suicide and was doing better now.

359,"I am currently the master of a small cargo vessel (205ft LOA) based out of central British Columbia.  Following the events of this mornings tsunami warning, it had me pondering just what is the safest option in various scenarios.  It would be great to get the opinions of seasoned mariners and/or anyone with knowledge/experience with tsunamis. 

This morning we were tied up at our home port in a well populated town when we received the warning.  The two main options I felt I had were to attempt to get the vessel to deep water or to get my crew safely to high ground.  Considering we had vehicles and nearby road accessible mountain, I made the decision to evacuate ashore.  From when we received the warning in our bunks, myself and my crew were at 500ft+ elevation in less than 10 minutes.   Getting the vessel just out of the bay would have taken at least 20min of steaming. 

Myself not having the knowledge on how a tsunami would interact with a coast line like BC and Vancouver Island (narrow channels, inlets, numerous islands) I was hesitant to attempt to steam to deep water.  Completely open offshore water is at minimum 2.5hrs away for us. 

Discussions are now occurring within my company on tsunami procedure and the prevailing opinion with shoreside is that heading to sea is a better option.  To me this seems like the company just being concerned with the state of their vessel, putting the crew's safety second. 

I should also point out that there were storm warnings in place for our area during the tsunami warning (40-50kts).

Any opinions or experiences would be greatly appreciated! Sorry for the long read.

360,"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

My sister who is currently 27 years old recently told me that our uncle sexually assaulted her twice when she was 16 years old. She also told me that our cousin told her that she was assaulted by him too when she was underaged. 

This is our dilemma. My uncle has been married to my aunt for 27 years and don’t have any kids. I love my aunt very much and have no idea how she will react to this news. It’s also worth noting that our uncle doesn’t treat our aunt the best way but regardless of that, she’s stayed with him for so long.

We want to tell our parents but have no idea how they will react. Our mom does not take stress very well AT ALL, so we don’t want her health to take a hit from this news. They’ve known my uncle for nearly three decades and trust him entirely, so finding out something like this would cause a lot of... unpredictable emotions that we aren’t sure how to deal with.

It is very hard for me and my sister to be around him. He also openly displays some *creepy* actions that really affect my sister. For example, recently at a Christmas dinner, he started to massage my cousin’s shoulders and it became very awkward. My sister witnessed it and looked like she was on the brink of a panic attack and could hardly speak and it took a while for the atmosphere of the room to go back to normal. 

We have no idea who else has fallen victim to him and want him out of our lives. This has taken a huge toll on my sister’s mental health and it feels like she can’t cut herself away from him unless everyone does. She is still forced to go see him and my aunt whenever she visits but can’t talk her way out of it without causing suspicion. We are also just scared of him being alone with any other girls in our family just in case something will happen with them too. 

I had permission from my sister to post this because we need any advice we could possibly get to confront this situation. We definitely want to say something, even with everything at stake, so don’t worry, we don’t need any convincing. One thing to note, we know we can't do anything legally. We have no proof of the assaults so we have accepted the fact that the most we can do is get him exiled from our lives, which is more than enough. If anyone has any idea on how we can approach our parents and our aunt, please let me know.




**UPDATE:** My sister has decided to sit everyone in my family down together and confront our uncle in front of everyone. She’s doing this so everyone can assess how our uncle reacts to getting called out but also because it’ll be the most impactful. Don’t worry too much please, we WILL be doing as much as we can to make sure our family is safe but we feel like there really is not much we can do with him legally as we have no proof of the assaults (as we stated previously). If you have any advice on how we can do something legally without proof, feel free to tell us. But we figured that going to the police would be out of the question because of our lack of evidence. We can only hope that doing this will get him expelled from our family and sway him away from molesting anyone else after losing everything, but there really is only so much that we can do. Thank you for all of your comments and messages, they really helped us with everything. ",23Jan2018,52
361,"We have been living at our current apartment for five months. We have this neighbor who is unbelievably loud. She has 5+ dogs and our other neighbor said she has 3 bunnies as well. She also has a trash boyfriend with a giant truck and they wake me up at 1,2,3,4,5 AM going up and down the stairs. 

Our apartment is on the first floor so I hear EVERYTHING. I am over the situation. Basically these people should not be living in an apartment building and I am furious that their poor decisions have affected my life and my sleeping habits. I have not slept through the night once. I suffer from chronic pain and have anger management issues already. I do not need this in my life. 

About a month ago I got angry and slammed the front door because they kept leaving it open. It is a security door for a reason - and they were also letting all of the cold air into the stairwell. The neighbor starts screaming. I've left at this point and when I return she's made a sign and put her full name and apartment number on it. I didn't read the letter but basically it said I could go to hell. 

Today was the first time I've seen her since she left the note. She was coming into the building as I was going out. I opened the door, walked right past her and she giggled to her boyfriend. I have really bad anxiety and now I'm afraid to go home. I hate knowing that someone hates me and is making fun of me. I know I shouldn't have gotten upset and slammed the door but I just don't feel safe going home now.

My left eye is in constant pain.  It feels like something sharp is poking it gently all the time.    On a good day it's just a dull ache.  
On a bad day it hurts too much to keep my eye open.  It always gets worse As I grow tired.    It takes me about 30-45 minutes after waking up before I'm comfortable using that eye.  
  
Eye drops help.  but I don't think it's because my eyes are dry,  so much as the eye drops are cold and help take the edge off.  

This has been going on for years,  and it's progressively getting worse.   I'm at a loss as to what is wrong.

I felt pressure on my eye ball after they were frozen,  like there's something solid inside struggling to burst out.    I found it extremely dizzying and sickening.    I've had my eyes frozen before but never reacted this extremely.

He said he felt fine that morning, then at some point about 40-50 minutes into his drive sleepiness hit him like a truck, then his truck hit the center divide. No one was hurt luckily, but he was certainly freaked out. He also said that a lot of mornings he would get crazy tired like that

He got a different company truck and drove the same drive for about another month and a half with zero problems. The company just kinda said ""hey, people make mistakes and youre one of our better employees, everything's fine, just take this drug test."" Results came back clear, and he doesn't do anything really except for a couple of drinks a week tops.

Fast foreward to now and he has the old truck back because it's newer and written as ""his"" in the books or whatever and he's doing a drive of similar length and has started to complain about feeling tired in the morning drive again. It could be other things, but I'd rather try to rule out CO first. He has some back problems that could also be causing it, that's what we thought it was last time.

377,"I'll try to keep this short and simple (haha..)

I dated my ex for the first time from February 2016-November 2016. We were friends before, and while we were friends he had a girlfriend, but was also talking and hanging with me quite a bit. He and her broke up in January 2016 (after already breaking up for a month that previous october). After they broke up, we started hanging out and eventually we both confessed feelings.

He and I broke up because we were seeing less and less of each other &amp; things were slowly falling apart. I told him I was worried and despite us talking about it, things didn't improve. I ended things. We didn't speak for 5 months.

In february of 2017...3 months after I dumped him, he posts a pic of him &amp; his ex on facebook. They were back together. I was pissed. A month later, he reaches out (after not speaking since our breakup) and wants to catch up. I eventually find out that he had already broken up with his ex, they only lasted like 3 months. He said that he and her didn't work out, as usual, and he still can't get along with her the way he and I did. Soon after, He confesses feelings, wants to try again, but I turn this down. I had trust issues with him, but we kept talking mutually into the summer.

Although, after summer &amp; fall passed of us getting close again, around November I start catching feelings. In december I ask him to try to date again, and we become official just after Christmas.

Now here's where shit hit the fan. This past month (December 27th-yesterday) we were dating. His friends new, his family new (he was taking me over all the time) etc. It was going great for about 2 weeks....when I started getting this gut feeling that something was off. One thing I noticed was he'd always randomly bring up other girls, like girls we went to high school with. Random memories but he had to bring them in to it....like it was just weird. We haven't seen these girls in years and he still talked about them.

We went to a new years party together, and he kept getting really close to this girl who was there (who's his friend's girlfriend, by the way...) and it made me extremely uncomfortable.

He NEVER had his phone around/on him. Ever. I always had mine, he knew my passcode, I allowed him on my phone whenever the hell he wanted. But for him....I never ever saw his phone around. One time he did have it, but he'd tilt the screen away to unlock it....clearly I was suspicious.

So about a week ago I ask him if he's still talking with his ex (gut feeling...). He says yes, sometimes. I told him that he knows it bothers me (had a talk about it in November, when i was with him and he got incoming texts from her...resulted in me getting pretty upset.) He said he didn't think it still bothered me that much cuz we ""talked about it already"" but if i was still uncomfortable with him talking to her, he'd cut the contact. Which was great! That's all I wanted all along. How am I supposed to feeling comfortable with him constantly texting not only his ex, but his ex who he has gotten back together with 3 times??

So I see him this weekend, and I can tell he's off. I assume it's maybe b/c he's in the process of cutting the contact or something, idk. But he doesn't give me any updates on it for a few days.

Yesterday I was with him at his place and we started making out. I asked to head to the bedroom and he stopped me and said ""i want to say something first. I don't want you thinking I'm only in this for the sex, or something. THat's not the only reason I'm with you. And my ex has nothing to do with this. I just don't want you hurt you"". Of course this led to me asking what was up.

Bottom line, I discovered that he still had not cut the contact. After me asking and asking, he finally said that ""She's been in my life for years, it would be weird for me to cut the contact"". I said i got that, but I can't stick around anymore if he's going to choose to keep having her in his life. He said he understood where I was coming from. And so I said ""I guess this is the end then"" and he said he was sorry for wasting my time, and he'd miss me.

Basically, he was fine to date me as long as he could also talk to her secretly. He was beyond willing to have both of us. But the second I ask him to cut the contact with the person who he knows always comes back to him, and will always give him that wanted attention, he couldn't do it.

I cannot wrap my head around this. I feel like I wasted so much time, was mislead, and I'm pretty fucking pissed. No way am I talking to this guy ever again. Any comments or advice or opinions would be welcomed.

379,"When I find myself in-between activities for like 5 minutes or so, I tend to browse reddit or youtube to pass the time because it's convenient. However I've found out that, cumulatively, they take way too much time because they're easy to get hooked onto for hours and I've little self control. I've been trying to better myself lately, and taking time off the smartphone is what I'm currently trying to do. Yet I find myself not being able to do anything when I'm free (but only for a short time) or taking a break because the activities I have in mind would take to long and I'd eventually have to get back to the task at hand. What do you guys do/suggest?",23Jan2018,3
380,"I am currently about to graduate from high school in five months, and I still have absolutely no clue what I want to do. I had my heart set on accounting for a while, but changed my mind after a few months. I also had been thinking about secondary education, but lost interest yet again.
I am worried about choosing a major I might not like and regretting it later. I've already decided that I am going to go to community college first, then transferring to a university to get my bachelor's (in whatever I choose).
My girlfriend (who graduated last year) was unsure of what she wanted to do, so she went with majoring in liberal arts until she thinks of something. I'm not sure if I should just do the same or go in as undecided. 
Is there any advice anyone could give me?",23Jan2018,3
381,"Hey :) 

Let me give you some backstory.

This is the first relationship I have ever been in and I am madly in love with this girl but I think she is embarrassed of me.

She never public acknowledges me to anyone or made it ""Facebook official"" and the only people she has told about us are her Mother and Close, Close Friends.

If people ask her about me she says I'm her ""Best Friend""

We take a lot of pictures together but she never posts them on her Snapchat or Instagram. However, With her previous relationships she did post pictures with her boyfriends on her accounts.

We hold hands in public. However, If its in a place with people who know use she won't or will let go quickly. 

When she isn't around people she is very affectionate and loving.

I don't know if I'm over thinking things or just being dumb.

Thank you for reading.
