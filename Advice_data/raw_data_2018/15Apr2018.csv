1,"Hi everyone,

I hate to be doing this but I need some advice. I feel like this should be natural to me, but I can’t come up with a solution so I figured I’d get advice from my fellow reliable Redditors. 
I need advice in trying to talk to a girl. I hope this isn’t interpreted as me asking for advice in talking to girlS. No, just the one. 
Anyway, this girl seems pretty quiet and keeps to herself; she wears rock t-shirts here and there (not that I look at her, but I do; also they’re shirts on stuff like The Doors (great band btw) Led Zeppelin, etc.). I don’t know her too much; I have her for an intro sociology class that is big in size. I noticed she goes to the food court after class (which is close to the class). I’m trying to devise a plan to attempt a casual chat but I’m having a hard time. I am not good at talking to any gender of people (males, females, attack helicopters). Any tips?",15Apr2018,3
3,"Weird title. But my friend Jerico, his current FWB/fling thing, Allie keeps complaining to me about Jerico anytime she sees me. I don’t know why. I’ve never given her advice on him, I want to stay out of it. Jerico is my friend, I don’t really have any attachments to Allie and honestly don’t see the fling lasting long. 

Whenever she complains to me about him I just say different variations of “you should try talking to Jerico about that”.  And she goes “yeah I should, but blah blah blah” and keeps complaining about him. 

I haven’t talked to Jerico about this, cause I feel like if I do, it’s putting me in the middle? But I’m tired of her treating me like a therapist constantly. ",15Apr2018,1
4,"I have a bit of a serious situation and morally i don't know which route to take. So, about a week ago my younger sister was helping my dad fix something on his phone, when she saw a message from a woman (whose name i will not say) pop up and in the message she asked my dad to send her ""inappropriate pictures"". Of course this shocked my sister and she went digging a little more and realized the message came from a dating app, where there are a bunch of women messaging my dad. My sister wasn't able to really see if he was actively replying to the women. my sister quickly put thephone away and texted me all about it and to be honest I'm heartbroken. For some further background my parents are by no means in love, they don't really show any form of intimacy or affection towards one another. On the other hand my dad is a very manipulative, controlling, and emotionally abusive person, but he supports us financially. I feel like it is so shallow of me to say I only rely on my dad for money but it's true. He has put our whole family through a lot, so he has made it hard for us to want a relationship with him. He helps pay for a lot of my siblings college necessities and other things around the house. My mother does pay for things too but my dad tends to pay the bigger bills. My fear is that if I tell my mom what my dad is doing behind her back it could tear my family apart, possibly lose financial stability, and it would break my moms heart. My only problem if i do tell my mom right now is that everything will be by word of mouth and I will have no photo evidence of the messages my dad is getting on the dating app. So,should I wait, get irrefutable evidence that my dad is cheating and show my mom, or should my little sister and I keep it between ourselves and not tell anyone?

Their response to me pointing out something is usually similar to: ""so I guess we can't tell any jokes now."" or ""do you really think I'm racist?"" or ""well, I just wish you would curse less!""

I guess there isn't ever room for the truth to win out over belief. How do you work through that to provide people with a real understanding of our globalized world?

Well lets cut to the chase, so in December last year there was a gnarly fire in my area (thomas fire) and i had to leave town to take care of my mother and i let my boss know and he was fine with it. Well he decided what we agreed on wasnt what we agreed on. One thing led to another in a very one sided argument and I gave my two weeks notices. I got another job and ive been pretty happy for a few months now and ive been helping out at my old spot for extra cash and he offered me the full management position under him.

15,"So lately I have been doing this secret admirer thing with my crush. I have been leaving notes at his locker and I have given him my number. Recently, I gave my identity away to him through a note.  And today, something happened. I have given him my number before and he has messaged me before. It was; Hi I got a note with this number in my locker today 



It was the first message he ever sent me. Well that was a month ago. Today, I got a message from another number and they said; hey it's ***, i got a new number. want to talk.



See the huge difference between the message? I copied and pasted it so I altered absolutely nothing about it.




At first I just brushed it off. I was so excited that I saw he messaged me that I didn't think very well. So I went along with it. And then he asked me about this one specific class I am in, FCS. Then he asked who sits at my table. I told him but then when I asked him who sits at his table, he never responded to the question. Apparently he asked because he wanted to know if I was with good people. He then asked if I liked them and then after that he asked, ""what about **** and **** lol"" Who I know are my crush's friends. I thought that maybe he was just wondering himself and then I went and asked the question again after answering it. He then said ""that's good at least"". So I asked again because it seemed really odd that they kept avoiding this question. They never responded. I asked if they were really my crush, but they never responded. It has been hours since. I don't know what to do. Because I know that this is just some asshole who is pretending to be my crush and it may have been only like a really short chat but thing is, it kinda hurts. I genuinely believed that my crush actually cared about me, and wanted something to do with me. Wanted to have a conversation and actually talk but no, it is just some asshole who got my hopes all the way up for nothing. I don't know where to go off here. I don't know how to figure out who this person is. Or what to do in general. I want to know who is behind it so that way, I know who to stay away from. But I am not sure how to.",15Apr2018,0

For backstory, my mother and father were abusive. They kicked me out of the house while I was still in high school, after that I stopped speaking to them for some time.

20 y/o here. I'm commuting to college with a job. Been saving money and continue to do so. Currently driving a 2003 5-Speed Jetta but already have an offer on it (I'm going drive it next semester into next year) and then sell it to a close friend (who's overseas right now) and make a $3k profit off it from what I bought it the original price. Note: I won't sell it until summer of 2019. Don't tell me to keep it, I'm onto something new anyways, plus he wants to learn manual and at the same time I'll make a $3k profit off it.

By next year, having saved even more money. I'm debating between these as car choices Infiniti G37x (2008-2011), Lexus IS250(2009-2012), Mk6 GTI, B7 Passat/CC, Mercedes-Benz C300 (2009-2011), E90 BMW.

Please read this without assuming I'm a d-bag:

Do NOT tell me to ignore any of the cars listed above. It's my money and I have been working my ass off for one of these cars. I don't spend my money on stupid shit like booze or drugs. I'm highly motivated and a straight shooter. I have money put aside that I'm not even going to spend on the car that I haven't even touched in years. I let it earn interest. I take car of my current car perfectly and help my older parents with theirs. Do not tell me it's a financial mistake - that's not your business and I don't need you're advice on how to spend my hard earned money.

However it’s been a whole year and I still cannot warm up to this college and hate everything else about it. If anyone had any thoughts on if I should transfer or not I’m stuck in the middle and have no idea what I’m going to do. If I go back to the state university where I live I’ll be closer to home and I know I’ll like it, I actually have friends there and I would enjoy my time in college a lot more.

24,"Being totally honest, I’m physically attractive. I have boobs and an ass and I’m decently pretty. I’m definitely not a showstopper but I’m not horrifyingly ugly. Recently, I’ve improved lots on my confidence and self worth. Instead of wearing baggy, unflattering clothes like I’ve been doing for years to hide the body I was ashamed off, I wear things that I feel confident in, that show off the body I’ve learned to love. I don’t dress slutty, my mom would NEVER let me, but I wear leggings and lowish cut tops and shirts that are shorter. 

Now the problem. 

Ever since I grew mentally into my body, I’ve noticed older men engaging me far more than I have before. It’s nothing explicit or outright dirty, but it definitely wasn’t there before. While waiting in queues, instead of ignoring me like the past, they smile and try and make small talk, despite being a complete stranger. They seem like they genuinely care about what I say, but they don’t notice that I’m clearly uncomfortable with the situation. Employees I’m forced to interact with prolong the conversation in an attempt to make it personal with questions that escalate it far too quickly, even if I try and walk away.  Much older men stand far too close and don’t seem to take the hint when I inch away out of discomfort. 

I don’t want to sound like a whiny bitch, but the new attention makes me uncomfortable. Getting an opinion from an outside source will make it easier if I try and bring it up with my mom. So, reddit, am I overreacting? Or is this something I need to bring up with my mom? I realize I can’t stop the problem, if there is one, but talking to her would offer help as to how to deal with the situation and how to get me out. 

Please be honest, I have horrible anxiety and that might be making the situation into something more in my head. But I don’t want to ignore it if that’s not the case. Help? ",15Apr2018,1

Now I figure it's because of this huge change in my life and I'll eventually adapt.

I guess the thing that scared me most is how long it took for me to calm down and say ""that's not scientifically possible"" (my nightmare was about zombies). And I think what prolonged my panic attack was the fear that what if one day I can't differentiate between real and imaginary.
I guess I'm looking for advice on how to cope, this is the first time I've ever had a nightmare/panic attack in my sleep.

32,"As the title states, there is a girl that I am interested in, but I am not entirely convinced that building up my confidence to ask her out would be a wise decision. I have been picking up on a few signs that lead me to believe that the feeling may be mutual. Many of my peers have also expressed similar opinions to mine on this subject. I am fairly convinced that if I were to ask her out, she would say yes. I do have a few reservations though. I have made a list of pros and cons to try and decide if asking her out is a good decision, but I am still unable to decide. I would like to hear your opinions on the matter. I will try to outline my reasoning behind why I placed each pro and con in its respective section. My list of pros and cons is as follows:

Pros:

1. I find her physically attractive. I am aware that looks aren't everything and this is not the sole reason I am considering asking her out, but it does merit mentioning.
2. I strongly suspect that she is a good singer. This thing in particular is a HUGE plus in my book. I have always loved singing and listening to others sing (hence my username). Because singing is such a passion of mine and one of the things about myself that I love the most, dating someone who shared this interest with me has always been a dream of mine. I have not heard her sing more than a few lyrics during the time I've spent with her (and those few lyrics were not enough to form a complete opinion of her voice), but she has told me of how she has taken singing courses throughout school. 
3. She has a very similar sense of humor to my own. I have a particularly crass and self-deprecating style of humor. She often makes jokes along the same vein and seems to enjoy the jokes I make as well.  My ex-girlfriend did not have this trait, and I was constantly having to stifle my jokes or censor myself for fear of pissing her off or being scolded. This lead to quite a boring relationship and was one of the main reasons I broke things off with with my ex. Potentially finding someone whose sense of humor aligns with my own would be a refreshing change of pace from what I am typically used to in relationships.
4. She is accepting of the fact that I tend to spend most of free time binge-watching Netflix. I am not a person that enjoys huge social outings very much, so I tend to spend my free time watching and re-watching my favorite shows and movies on Netflix. She spends quite a lot of her free time doing the same and we have discussed at length our favorite shows and movies, many of which are the same or similar. 


Cons:

1. I work with her. I have heard many horror stories of dating co-workers and have even dated a co-worker in the past. I found the last time I dated one of my co-workers, it was rare that we would ever have a conversation that did not involve work. These kinds of conversations are always extremely boring in my opinion and tend to ruin the free time I hold so dear. Not only this, but dating a co-worker also tends to blur the lines between my personal and my professional life. It would be quite difficult to be able to treat her appropriately professional while we are working and treat her as I would someone I am in a relationship when we are not working. It would be a very fine line to walk and there are some serious consequences to not walking it properly. This is further complicated by both my status at the company and her's. She was recently promoted to my former position when I was promoted. I was the one who trained her when she took on the position and I still help her when she has questions or concerns. While I am not her supervisor, there are some in the company that have the opinion that I am, thus creating a sense that I'm her ""pseudo-supervisor."" I don't think our jobs would be in risk if we did get together, but it may cause a little bit of drama with some of our co-workers. Also, due to my promotion, I have also become close with both her direct and indirect supervisor. Because of this, I tend to be told things in confidence about other employees at the company. There already have been a few occasions where they were discuss this woman's job performance in particular. If we were to start dating, either her supervisors would stop talking to me about her performance directly (which I wouldn't really mind, I don't really like to hear about how much my co-workers suck at their jobs) or I would have to decide whether or not to tell her about their comments. The latter of the two was what occurred in my last relationship. This kind of put me in tough spot of deciding whether to tell my then girlfriend all the information I had and risk my standing at work or refuse to tell her and risk my relationship. As you can see, this one is a particularly pressing con for me. I really like my job and would hate to risk it in any way,
2. I have no experience with relationships at all. This one obviously has nothing to do with her and is more due to my own personal short comings. This is mostly due to my lack of confidence and self-esteem. I am working on building both of these up, but I am not quite there yet. The only other relationship I have been in was doomed from the start. I was too afraid to be myself for fear that they would not like who I was. That is obviously not a healthy way to approach a relationship, but I am worried that I will end up repeating my mistakes with this woman as well. The last relationship I was in really took a toll on me emotionally, and I'm not sure if I can go through that again. I desperately want to find someone who I can be myself with, but I'm constantly worried that who I am is not enough for anybody. However, you can't learn to swim without getting in the water, so maybe the only way to get past this is to just try being open with someone and hope for the best.


That is it for my pros and cons list. Please let me know what you think. Thank you in advance for your help.",15Apr2018,1
33,"A few months ago I moved from my aging Xbox One to a high end gaming PC (i7 7700, 1080 Ti, 32GB RAM), and I've been gaming on it ever since. But lately I've seriously considered either selling the PC or relegating it to the few competitive games and exclusives I like on it, and moving to a PS4 instead.

I definitely notice and appreciate some of the benefits of the PC over consoles

* The games look and run far better then they do on console
* I can get a lot of relatively new games really cheap because of steam sales and humble bundle
* I don't have to pay a yearly fee
* I can use a M/KB or Controller for almost any game
* Steam's refund policy is amazing 

However, there are just some things that, even though they're really minor, end up bothering me.

I HATE the fact that my games are fragmented over different services (Steam, uPlay, Origin, Twitch games, GOG, Battle.net) and each of those services have their own friends lists, overlays, storefronts, etc. It's just such a hassle to have to deal with them all.

I also dislike achievement support on PC. I love collecting achievements, and while many games have achievements on PC, a lot don't (especially games older then 3-4 years) and once again they're spread out over difference services. There also isn't that ""fanfare"" that you get on consoles that make them exciting.

Finally, I really hate the technical hassle of the PC in general. There are a bunch of minor things that aren't a big deal by themselves, but combined end up turning a minor irritant into frustration.

The main reason I'm considering switching to a PS4 instead of going back to my Xbox is because I really like the idea of starting fresh. At this point, I have a pretty large backlog of games on both my Xbox and PC, and I constantly have issues settling down to play and beat a game without getting distracted by something else I own or that is on sale. I don't have years of collecting games on the PS4 so I can be more focused with what I'm playing.

Sony also has a bunch of exclusives I really want to play, which is another big plus. 

Of course, I know that going from a high end PC to a PS4 isn't going to be sunshine and daisies.

34,"My friend Felix passed away about an year ago. He didn't consider me that close, but I loved him to bits.

I'm an artist, and he was an artist too, and we had a huge project we were working on along with his best friend Jay and a team of other artists with a similar goal. An indie RPG game, which was our favorite genre of games and what we used to play and nerd out about all the time, and it'd follow the lead of a story a friend of ours had written and left for us to get creative over. It was so fun We'd been working on it since 4 years ago, it was our everything, and Felix was contributing so much to it.

And when he passed away, I kinda... trashed and wanted to give up on everything, like everyone else.

But it'd be stupid to do so. It was Felix's dream and goal to finish it, and mine too, and I believe Jay's too. We couldn't stop. And so, we decided to keep going with the project and finish it for Felix's sake, to honor all the work he put onto it and onto everything in his carrier. 

A little bit of backstory in what each of us did:

I was a musician and a storyboard artist, but I've a good grip on illustration in general and I love writing so I helped a lot with the writing too. Jay's an illustrator and also did a lot of writing and some minor coding. Felix used to do most of the coding for the game and also a lot of writing and help with the music, he was SO AWESOME and it's absolutely impossible to replace him, but I think we can still honor his name with this if we try hard.

But then, months later since the day Felix passed away, when we started getting back together to work on it, *Jay took the lead.* Which is a thing we all agreed with since he knew Felix a lot and they were close, even closer than I was to him since I've always been really shy to approach people. At first I was fine with Jay being the leader, but then... I realized the disaster it would become.

Jay took the lead of the project, and split us in tasks. He decided he should be the one to make ALL THE ILLUSTRATIONS and left me to make just the music. Which, don't get me wrong, is really fun to do and I'd have a blast with normally, but... I don't wanna do JUST the music. This is a thing we'd been working on for so long and I wanted to make it into something Felix would enjoy and would be proud of me for. I wanna do my best. Not just the music while Jay simply slaps his illustrations all over the game's graphics and cover art.

My problem with it ISN'T the fact that I'll do the music only though. Nah, I could put up with that easily. The real problem is...

Jay is an ASSHOLE. That's the problem, He stalls on everything and takes so long to finish his stuff. It's been an YEAR since the incident and we still aren't even near completing half of the game, and it's not my fault, Jay is the one who keeps stalling. And by the way things are going I'm nearly a hundred percent sure that Jay is NOT gonna do SHIT for the next years and will just stall a lot like a little bitch.

And yes, I feel like an absolute asshole for saying this and I'm aware I AM an asshole. I'm selfish, terrible at teamwork, and a terrible friend. But... This is different than just me being an asshole in a regular situation, this is for Felix. If this was just a really random project I'd let Jay stall without giving a shit, but this is different. I hate the way Jay stalls so much.

Jay has been stalling with it for so long and I feel like I could do something better and worthy of all Felix represented to me. I have the resources, I have the time, and I even already sketched a lot of it out and how I'd go about it. I've always been the Jack of All Trades in the group, I'm a musician and an artist with a grasp of coding, I could make the game all on my own if I needed to or wanted to, *AND I WANT TO.* I don't wanna just sit and wait for Jay to finish his shit when he's clearly stalling, he's got a big reputation for stalling for YEARS on one of his OWN projects which still isn't even 50% done. I don't want this shit, I could do it on my own, I want to do it on my own, but Jay will just be on my dick all like ""Duuude, it's OUR group project, Felix wanted us to do it TOGETHEEER, REMEMBER?"".

And the worst part is that it's true.

I'm sure Felix would frown a lot if he knew what I'm thinking right now. He never liked my negativity and I admit I'm a really bad person on this aspect and many others. But I just... I miss him so much. I'm such an asshole. But hear me out, I don't hate Jay, I find him a pretty cool guy in fact even with all the shit that's happening. What I want is something that would be good for BOTH of us.

I don't wanna kick Jay out of the group or anything like that, I'd never do such a thing. I have a different plan, something that would work for us. *I wanna split projects*.

We'd split projects. I'd do my own thing and Jay could keep doing his thing, we'd make two different  games that revolve around the same story but ENTIRELY DIFERENT in plot. That's what I want. I don't want to just sit here and wait for Jay to finish his thing. I don't wanna just be in the back as Jay does whatever he wants with the game and I'd just watch as Felix's name is slapped on something that barely has a lot of his touch on it and is just COVERED in Jay's illustrations. I really fucking don't.

In just one night I've written about 7 different leitimotifs for the soundtrack of the game and I've planned out a lot of the story, I've even started to study coding more and more just so my programming will be worthy of Felix's name, just so he'll be proud of me. I wanna do my best on this, and I want it to be something really awesome, not just a side project that Jay stalls on and will eventually shit out after a really long wait.

I have the resources, I have the inspiration, I have everything to make it work and I want to put Felix's name right in front of everything with a big ""In Memorian"", I want this to work and I want this to be our fucking shit, like we always dreamed of. And I DON'T WANT Jay to just ruin everything and completely crush the soul of the project while he just stalls and spends his time with whatever he does. I don't want him and his friend to take the project over for themselves and just do whatever. I just wanna make something good for once, for Felix. I know I sound selfish and I might be really selfish indeed, and I know I suck at teamwork, but I just.. I wanna make something that would make him proud. I really do. 

Felix, I miss you so much. I wish I had gotten to know you better. I'm so sorry.

Agh, I'm sorry this ended up being so long. If any of you read this all, thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart, really! Can you guys give me any advice with this? What should I do? Should I go on with my plan or am I really just being selfish?",15Apr2018,2

41,"Hello I wanna try to make this post short but there’s a lot..that’s happened I’ll put a TL;DR at the bottom

I’ve been in this friendship with this person for two or something years..we’ve been through a lot but lately they’ve been playing victim and being selfish and we (another friend and I) had enough.. recently he put my friend at risk by forcing her drive while drunk (nearly blacking out) and then left her while she blacked out and threw up on her self (so he could go to a dick appointment) 

Here’s some other altercations we’ve had recently 

He pressures us to hang out with him (bc he never can do anything by himself) by pressuring us to smoke or drink with him (we both have chosen to quit and have told him that multiple times) 

He pressures us to go spend money or just drop off the face of the earth and go off the grid (he’s done it before) or just go on expensive trips knowing we can’t afford anything...

He let me borrow his air mattress when I moved to my new home which I’m sincerely thankful for honestly..but I poked a hole in it and as soon as I tell him that he starts panicking saying that his father was asking for it for months and that I have to buy a new one (which I don’t mind but I also didn’t know it belongs to his father OR that he was constantly asking for it back) 


I want to support my friend by backing her up when we talk to him about what he’s done wrong (most likely we ending the friendship) but we’re scared of two things;

Him attempting suicide due to having major depression (he has attempted before and we have saved him) were honestly his only and closest friends  OR 
Trying to harass us by via social media, attacking us verbally or sabotaging us..

For example he broke up with some guy that cheated on him in late November and then found out some other guy was talking to his ex so he planned a date just to ruin that persons life.????? Just bc they barely associated with his ex?? We told him it wasn’t right and it was petty and he should let it ago but he completely ignored us and went on with it anyway..

Personally I’ve vented to him about my toxic roommate issues and he now follows her on twitter so I’m worried he’s gonna retaliate and sending them screenshots of the insane shit I go through and I’d get kicked out..just for ending the toxic relationship.. personally I guess that’s what I deserve for opening my mouth in a time of need but I’ll hopefully deal with it later..

Anyway how should we go about this??? Any tips to tell someone who’s Ill tempered and stubborn to listen to our concerns without them doing something drastic to us or themselves? I’ve been stuck in a rut for a week trying to go about this..??? 

Thank you so much for making it to the end I appreciate all responses


TL;DR :trying to resolve a issue within our friend group bc friend is becoming really toxic (our friends life at risk by drinking and driving)  but are worried that person might harm himself or harm us (verbally). Has a past of ruining people lives and holding terrible grudges.. plays victim, is selfish and pressures us to do things we don’t want to.. person can’t let go of issues and retaliates by being petty..also deals with major depression",15Apr2018,1
42,"I was having an argument on Twitter earlier due to the trending tag of # Mission Accomplished and some were saying how killing Osama was actually one, so I disagreed, saying it wasn't, it was murder, etc.

I saw they disagreed, me saying about it being eye for an eye, unnecessary, they said normally they'd agree, but not with him. That 'we' did what was needed.

'We' didn't make sense, I doubt they had any hand in killing him.

Then, after that stuff, they said 'So be it' and something about 'CONservatives', so I defended conservatives, saying that I don't think conservatives, Republicans, Liberals, Democrats etc have conned people.

That they're not all the same.

They said that people who voted for GOP and DGT/DIT etc must be held accountable, saying stuff along lines of those voted, brought them in are to blame etc for current situation.

I disagreed and said I don't think voters should be help accountable. 

Are these tweets from them anything to worry about, or just someone that's angry, disgruntled going on?",15Apr2018,2
43,"TLDR: Got a girlfriend in my group of friends, we broke up, and now I think they abandoned me for her. Confused if this is actually the reason or not. Advice?

Last year I started college at a university known for smoking weed and lack of parties. In hs I was popular in freshman and sophomore years and had a lot of women that were attracted to me. In junior year I got a girlfriend who was a senior and drifted away from my other friends. We stayed together until the first couple of weeks of college when we realized long distance wasn't going to work. She didn't have many friends and, looking back, I definitely settled BIG TIME. I think during this time I missed out on a lot of social experiences that would have allowed me to grow with my peers. Nevertheless, in college I instantly had no problem meeting people in the dorms and started building a good amount of friends and a large amount of acquaintances. Everyone smoked weed, and being a stoner at the time it was very easy to meet people in the dorms this way. I started to settle into a group of friends that I thought were the coolest in my dorm and did basically everything with them. I was definitely on the shyer side of the people in the group and never formed a solid relationship with any singular person, which I am guessing is part of the reason they eventually lost interest in me. When I was with them as a group, however, I definitely contributed a lot to the fun atmosphere and we had some great times together. The whole year I felt like I was on the lower end of the social hierarchy in the group, but surprisingly the hottest girl in the group (and she was BAD, like definitely the most attractive girl I've been with in my life) started to take interest in me and we started dating. I soon learned she had a ton of emotional problems, but I projected an ideal image of her that blinded me from the reality of the situation. At the end of the year the group was looking to get a house together and they didn't include me in this. I started to think something was up because of this but I never confronted them about it. Some of their other friends told me they were talking trash about me when I wasn't around. Over the summer the girl I was dating said she didn't want to continue the relationship. Fast forward to the beginning of this year and I didn't reach out to them because I assumed from all of the red flags they didn't want me in their friend, plus I felt uncomfortable going to the house of my ex-girlfriend. 

This year I got a studio apartment on my own last minute and I have been practically isolated off campus since. I have barely made any friends and I feel trapped in my room with nowhere to go. I have made the harsh realization that I had a lot of bad habits in my social skills and lifestyle and I have made a significant effort to change them. I've already seen a ton of progress, for example I quit smoking weed and doing drugs. I realized that there was something about the way I acted last year that made some people in the group dislike me, and watching the videos I recorded of myself I can clearly see why; my personality was just lacking in so many ways. 

A few months ago I texted one of the guys I was closest with in the group to hang out and he agreed so I went over to the house and was welcomed by some of the people I was closest with, but there were other people that were extremely cold to me, namely the people that were closest to my ex. I have not gone back since because, honestly, I'm afraid. I'm confused as to wether the people that were welcoming were just being fake or were really glad to see me. None of them have reached out to me since. 

I have decided it's best that I transfer to a different university, not just for this reason (i.e. I don't identify with the stoner/hippie culture that's so big on campus). 

I have made a lot of progress mentally like getting over the depression I was in earlier this year from the solitude and setting life goals and achieving them. This has all been good, and I know that I am on the right track. Recently, however, I have been thinking about my old group of friends and how much I miss them. I guess if I have made other friends I would not be in this predicament, but I can't help it given my current circumstances. I'm so confused about so many of the events that happened last year and I just don't know what to make of it. If you guys could give me some advice on how to get over this I would very much appreciate it.",15Apr2018,2

She also commented about how she’s “earned” it because she’s been my friend so long.. she was VERY drunk when this comment was made, so I’m not sure if it was just a bad joke or if she actually intends to take advantage of me.. she has made “jokes” like this once or twice in the past as well.

 We broke up for a few reasons, and I understand deep down that its for the best however I get hit with waves of sadness whenever she pops into my mind for any amount of time, my sleep schedule is screwed and I wake up at random times.

53,"18 year old male

So we had an admitted students day at our college, and I actually knew a few people there, and we hung out for awhile. We all get along pretty well. There's no clear or obvious signs that they dislike me, but I just want to state my thoughts because this is all interlinked.

Some backstory: I was recently diagnosed with OCD, and I am seeing a therapist. I find it very hard to get thoughts of out of my head. Often they'll get replayed over and over and the seemingly disingenuous reassurance I give myself just turns into an endless loop of hell.

Essentially, I don't feel good enough for them. I feel like they're too cool for me. I essentially think, what would they want to do with me?

I think a lot of this stems from the concept that I feel like an outcast. Today one of them was telling a story about how he hooked up in his car last night, and another one told a story about how he hooked up in the past. With me being a virgin who has never even had a girlfriend, I just felt kinda sad inside, I felt like I didn't belong. Same goes for the partying that they're into. I just felt a great sense of shame that I didn't belong. But no, I didn't try to fit in.

Maybe they're just not my type of friends, and that's okay. Here's the thing, I don't just want to make friends with introverted nerdy people like me, because I do want to improve my social situation. Those types of people, while they will make good friends, will just leave my current social situation unchanged.

I almost feel sub human. I look at them and think I'm just less than them. Even in my current social situations now, I just view everything that way. I feel like some people look at me as just some person they don't care about, someone who is not worth being friends with.

I don't know what to do. I did see some very vague signs that maybe they're starting to dislike me, but that's most likely just some extreme paranoia. Please help me guys. Thanks.",15Apr2018,1

57,"Hi /r/advice, 
I need advice regarding a possible false accusation against me at my part time job. Last week the manager received a negative review about our store, specifically about the cashier's reply to the customer's complaint. I was just informed by a colleague that everyone thought I did it - except this colleague works at another store and she heard it from the another employee, who said the manager checked the camera and saw I was the cashier at the time of the complaint was logged.

I have multiple concerns about this, including that the time the complaint was logged might have been one or two hours after the incident, but especially because apparently everyone at the store thought it was me and no one said anything until today. I definitely had my suspicion about the accusation because during my shift after the feedback was sent, people were acting cold towards me. My other concern is that the employee who informed my colleague is close with the manager, and most likely have heard about it directly from the manager. Most of all, I'm 100% sure I never said that, otherwise I wouldn't have been working front desk jobs for more than a year. In fact, I was hired despite having no retail experience because of my customer service experiences, and having this accusation against me would smear my reputation.

How do I say this to the manager, considering I heard about all this from a third party? How do I bring up the information that they looked at the camera and saw me working as the cashier? And how do I bring up the fact that now everyone has a negative opinion about me based on rumors?",15Apr2018,0

Mother: Right, well here.
(At this point I hear a pill bottle rattle, I think she threw a bottle of pills at GF, was her prescription for Sertaline)
Mother: Just overdose on them.
(At this point it was mostly shock then GF started crying and hung up, I went and picked her up and stayed with her for a while, calmed her down before I had to take her back home)
I'm worried about her living in such a toxic environment and was wondering if there is anything I can do for her sake, maybe reporting this to a guidance counselor and to her psychiatric help as well? Could her mother get into any trouble for saying things like this?

63,"There is a local charity here that I worked for once upon a time. They are not a registered charity. I have seen them first-hand give out many of their main ‘products’ (which they collect donations to make) to celebrities just to get attention. They also use these ‘products’ as payments for dance, modeling and acting lessons for their daughter who is the face of the charity. I’ve seen this many times. 
The girl, the face of the charity, has gone on to win many awards. The mom is only concerned about getting the daughter’s face in the media, and right from the beginning that has been the main focus. Lucky for them, they now have the fame and the spotlight. Unlucky for us, we cannot ignore it no matter how hard we try.   
A few of us have noticed that they have not done any “charitable acts” in months, but have still been all over the news.

65,"What do you think of this?  A while ago there was an argument? Fight?  Between me and my friends regarding this;  is it that wrong to brag about writing fictional deaths?  Or murder?  

I find it enjoyable, and incredibly satisfying;  I think that it is my way of venting and I *love* writing it and what I love even more is if someone would react to it, even if it is a negative reaction.  

I had thought that they were joking before, but apparently me bragging about it had 'got old really fast' and I feel incredibly frustrated about that;  I don't understand, there are many things I'd say about if it I won't be ranting but-

I don't view death, or the murder of innocents as anything other than, I don't know, just the way it is? I don't completely get why they are so offended and uncomfortable at it; sure, I probably should just leave it but doing something without a solid reason and understanding gets on my nerves so I would really like to see what other people think about it.

76,"So.. when I was little our family was 👌🏻 and everyone was happy and all then something happened to me which changed everything.. mom turned into a bitch and well, fast forward she’s a horrible person. 

My mother is 50 something years old and she literally acts like a 7 year old. She gets mad because dad doesn’t beat us.. she always has to be right (she’s always wrong) and when we say so she gets furious and does the silent treatment on dad and I. Some other behaviors that shoes she’s 7 are she sticks out her tongue and means it as an insult (I never got how that’s an insult) she covers her ears when she doesn’t want to hear something then starts staying blah blah blah, she tells people childish insults such as melon head, stick (being skinny), 4 eyes, you get what I’m saying.

So, yesterday she was in the bathroom and for some reason she was mad (she’s mad 24/7) and closed the door when I was trying to get my toothbrush to brush my teeth and I stayed there begging for 2 min for her to open the door. I was telling her to stop playing because I was going to get a new tooth brush if she didn’t open the door so I got fed up once again with her bullshit (I had told her many times I wouldn’t take her bullshit like her husband does) so I went over to the thingy where we keep the new toothbrushes and got a new one and I have tooth paste in my room so I walk out of my room and she’s staring at me brushing my teeth and starts screaming about me getting a new toothbrush when I already have one and she runs to dad to tell him and she told him I just went over and got a new one because I felt like it so I told him what I typed above and that I told her I was done with her childish bullshit and he was like ok he got a new toothbrush whatever and mom was like arguing and they started arguing then mom said she was going to hide all the toothbrushes (when she does this (because she’s done this for LITERALLY every item) and I need whatever she hid she either loses it and there’s none when it’s needed or I have to wait around for hours ) so I went and I got a pack of toothbrushes for myself and mom was like yelling at dad to go grab them from me and dad was like whatever and mom got angrier because dad didn’t take them from me. So fast forward to today she’s been doing the silent treatment on both me and my dad and just doing childish shit in general. 

So.. in the house were at the point where everyone in the house takes moms bullshit because if they don’t she gets angry but for years I took her bullshit and I had enough of her shit and I stopped a few years ago and everyone is fucking mad at me for calling her out on the fucking stupid shit she does and I sincerely do not know what the FUCK to do anymore I have had enough of this bullshit. 

Now let’s get to the reasons why I can’t just pick up my shit and leave (even though I would fucking love to)

-first thing is, dad doesn’t want me to until I finish with college 
- I live in California the land of poverty. You can’t fucking live in California on a minimum wage job. 
-California 
-uhhh what else? Oh yeah! California! 
-can’t move out of state because CA has 👌🏻 colleges and if I move out of state tuition would apply 

TL;DR 
My mother is a bitch and everyone does what she wants because if they don’t she acts childish. And I stopped taking her BULLSHIT. Can’t move out because California.

98,"Hey all, my story is quite a long one and I'm hoping I could get some advice.

Basically, I started university in 2015, with a double major program, one in math and one in business. My marks were pretty high in high school, but nevertheless my marks suffered mainly due to a lot of procrastination and lack of maturity. Moving onto the next term, I took a reduced course load (4 courses), passed them but did poorly. In order to make up for the failed 1st term I took a 3rd consecutive term but screwed that up completely, due to stress and anxiety. My university forced me to take a year off and I resumed university in fall of 2017.

However, I was only accepted back into one major the business one, with probation in the other major, the math one. The thing is the 1st semester went well, but now I'm close to the examinations for my 2nd semester. Although, I've worked decently hard (could of worked harder), I keep thinking to myself is it worth it to try so hard to keep pursing this double major (as opposed to dropping down to a single major). I really enjoy the business major, but not the math major at all. 

The reason I'm thinking of this change is because I have my last math exam in 2 days. I feel that the math courses I have to take for my math degree as just too un-intuitive and difficult for me, not matter how much extra help I seek. I feel the sense of failure once again. This time I did not procrastinate during the term and worked decently hard.

I always hear my high school friends succeeding, while I feel rather stuck. I'm not sure I can take another blow like this (dropping a major, falling behind 1 more term)...

Do you guys think I should switch to a single major? My main problem is that my confidence is already at an all time low, and I'm not sure if I can take another hit like this. Being already 21 years old, and not progressing anywhere is having a very large impact on my mindset. Maybe some of you can share your stories to give me some guidance?

TLDR: Use to be top student, but keep failing out of one of my majors in a double major program. Should I drop the 1 major, and if I do how do I deal with the feeling of falling behind everyone around me.",15Apr2018,1

100,"My mother was raped when she was young. I found out about this a few minutes ago, at the age of 29. And it all makes sense now. 

As a brief primer to my family history, my parents had an arranged marriage (think a well known third world country), moved to the U.S., and started their lives here. The early days of their marriage were, for lack of better words, awful. Constant fighting (sometimes physical), bickering, and overall toxic.

Then I came into the world and their marriage suddenly had another component to it. But the fighting was so prevalent, that my dad offered to send my mother back home, and keep me in the U.S. so he could ""properly raise a son"" (as my mother tells it). Long story short, they reconciled for me.

My mom has always suffered from depression and I now know why. She would tell me it was because her father was an alcoholic that was not present. But in the same vein, she praised how doting of a father he was; I never reconciled the two, but then again I did not have the emotional capacity to do so at that age (pre-teen up until ~21). She is very emotional, everything is overly dramatic and somber, and she cannot for the life of her take even the littlest of sarcasm lobbed in her direction. Of course in hindsight, this is a very crude way of characterizing her persona; I had no idea up until now. My understanding is that rape, especially at a young age (I think pre-teen to teen) by a family member, is extremely damaging to the psyche. 

It is important to mention my father in this as well. He grew up as one of 9 children born to one of 6 wives. He was the youngest and his father barely spit in his direction (as my father tells it). So he had to work for his own. He ended up at a prestigious university in the U.S. and amassed a significant amount of wealth for himself. All wonderful qualities, except his emotional intelligence is almost zero. He is stoic, an academic, ruled by logic, but cannot communicate if you paid him to.

As you can imagine, my childhood was rough. My parents always fought (sometimes physically) and coming home was effectively rolling the dice; would they end up in a fighting match? or would we have an awkwardly quiet dinner that ended in platitudes about loving each other? 

There is more to the story but the above is sufficient for now. The reason this precipitated is because my mom claims my dad is playing emotional games (which he could very well be doing), but I cannot see it this way. Either I am blinded by the fact that he is my father, or his logical way of speaking coincides more with my thought process thus, winning me over. In a bout of frustration, my mother told me about her being raped, implying that my father is treating her badly since she told him (this was 3 months ago). 

This brings me to my underlying concerns of which I have many, but the following are the main themes that have prevailed throughout my life:

* I have purposefully distanced myself from both of them as I've gotten older and come into my own money; my childhood was too damaging and everyday I have to come to terms with it. It has been my defense mechanism and today is no exception. I don't financially need them anymore, so my gut reaction is saying ""run."" What do I do?

* My mother knows I am obviously affected by what she said, and she regrets disclosing it. How do I act with her going forward?

101,"I apologize in advance for the jumbled mess that this post is going to be, I’ve been drinking. 

I also apologize for the long post. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m trying so hard but it’s not working. 

I am a freshmen in college and I’ve been dating my girlfriend since sophomore year in high school. For all of high school we were “that couple”. We were inseparable and we love each other madly and everyone knew it. 

When we went to college she couldn’t handle the distance and she wound up breaking up with me in September. We wound up doing our approximately equal shares of stupid shit, but on thanksgiving we decided being alone together was better than being alone apart. 

And it went great. From November to March 21st we were great (Approximating). we were happy. 

And now I’m such a miserable piece of fucking garbage. I’m an engineering major at a difficult engineering university, and I basically work 60 hours per week to get by. She has a difficult major and is one of the most beautiful, amazing, intelligent women that I know. But she is in a college that encourages a more... social environment. She is in Greek life, I am not. She goes out often, I don’t. And I know some of it is misguided anger. And I know I’m the asshole in this situation. (Which is why I didn’t post this to /amitheasshole.) 

Basically I think I’m borderline depressed. My family doesn’t understand, my friends are either doing much better in school working equal amounts, or doing much less work and having more fun. and I’m trying to nurse a relationship that means the world to me even though we’re 1500 miles (idk ~2400 km) apart. 

I’m always convinced she hates me, I’m always convinced she’s cheating on me, and I feel like she is living an amazing life while I sit and waste it away. ( I’ve been working full time since I was 15 years old. I’ve always felt robbed in a way. Also, I’ve been cheated on before, tough not by her, and my paranoia is one of my many, many flaws.) 

Today  she told me she was ready to break up with me again, saying she is tired of trying when I just sit miserable all the time. It killed me inside because I know how she feels because I know exactly how I’ve been, and that’s exactly how I felt about our relationship in September, but I’ve been trying. I’ve been trying so hard to bury my depression and just be the amazing person she deserves. But I’m trying to bury my hatred, I buried all my joy. I’ve been mean, accusatory, and basically a hollow piece of shit for the past month. 

I just want her. It’s all I want. I just don’t know how to bury my own shit and be happy. 

Sorry. ",15Apr2018,1

111,"Well long story short, 5 years ago there was alot of bitterness within the family. It was mostly due to me quiting my job since it was making sick and depressed without another job being lined up. I managed to get another interview within a week but they had quicked me out by then anyway. So I had to move to my partners mother and eneded up being jobless for 8 months.

Well on the night I was kicked out a explicit video that was posted on my facebook trying to be me,I had my laptop at my parents(I took nothing with me since I only had a bike at the time). So it ended up that we never spoke again.

Well my grandad died and there was a funeral om Thursday which I went to and ofcourse my family were there. My mother hugged me and cried and there was no bitterness from any of the family. 

Well last night I had an email from my other Grandad saying that my mum was happy that I took the effort to come(since the funeral was about 40 miles from me) and basicly said to me that he had got the vibe that she would lile to have some sort of communication since the ""ice was broken"".

Well I was thinking about it and yeah it was nearly 5 years ago now and trust would need to be built again. I have an 1 year old daughter so her having her Grandparents from both sided of the family would be nice. But I am still conflicted,I had a rough childhood(majorly down to my own doing).

One girl even keeps calling me 'my white boi', I am not sure if she is trying to be friendly or not but it is really weird.

Plus some of the students are on drugs as well and there is lots of degeneracy happening. There was even a fight a few weeks back with one kid being hospitalised (and people have been knifed before in the schools catchment area).

I am doing well in class (the classes are very easy, which I dislike as school is supposed to challenge you academically). Unfortunately I have about 5 more years of this stuff before I can leave and go off to College.

Any advice please? As the entire environment of the school is anti-social. The only enjoyment I get during school breaks is feeding the pigeons that hang around the school.

I currently have a dilemma, I really would like to go back and attend school.

I'm a naturally quick learner, so when it comes to coding, I'll code like a beast. My main issue is tests and theory. I suck at them so much! I can't tell if I'm just lazy and stupid, or if this is an issue others have. Does anyone have any advice as to what could be done?

Alot of my humour is based on making fun of people, I do it in a way that is like a ""roast"", can you tell I'm a teenager yet? I often make remarks about my freinds clothing, and they usually laugh it oof, and encourage me. The only other person outside of my freind group that I make fun is racist and homophobic, and has told my freind to kill himself , becaus he was gay, and a girl to go back to Africa.

There were 2 events that made me relize that I was being an ass hole, the first one was when my friend was making fun of me so I said the following thing back ""look in the mirror and every time you hate yourself go for a jog"", yeah I know. She understandably got very upset and we are currently making up.

The second incedent happened just half an hour ago, Me and another freind were joking around when he told me that I had no personality, and that my whole ""gig"" was based of insulting people. I laughed it off but he went into detail, saying I occasionally make good jokes, and the rest are just me insulting people in public until they are embarrassed (he is the one that encourages me most of all) this really stuck with me, and here we are.

I would like to stop insulting people for laughs, I  want to still be funny, but I'm afraid that if I will stop than my freinds would no longer find me funny, and stop hannimg out with me. I am also afraid that I don't have a personality outside of being funny, and I think I do, but I'm scared.

127,"I am 23 yo. I started reading about science 1 year ago. Most of my available and free time I devote to developing my mental skills. I read voraciously about science, psychology, behavioural economics, kahneman, philosophy, philosophy of science, some history, much about religion.

I don't like wasting time doing nothing productive. I can't stand wasting time browsing Facebook or Instagram (what 75% of my generation does). I like to use all my time as best as I can. I read on average over 3 hours everyday on my phone. 

 I am an atheist and very proud of it, more like anti theist, I have a deep passion for rational inquiry, for logical and empirical thinking. I like dismantling religious thinking and showing it for the fraud it is. 

I am a humanist. I oppose religion and its 'ways' of a priori knowing some ""truths"" no mortal knows. I fight against its evil influences in the world. I am a secularist.

I know a lot about all the big free thinkers of our era(neil degrasse tyson, Richard dawkins, Christopher hitchens, Dan dennett, Richard feynman, Carl sagan). I have pictures of some of them on my bedroom wall.

I know alot about errors and biases in human thought. I studied kahneman extensively, I read alot about his heuristics and biases, also about logical fallacies and cognitive biases. I know when my thinking goes on the wrong path and I know how to correct it.

I studied statistics on my own and I know about the errors and preconceptions about numbers, statistics and randomness. Big thumbs up for nassim nicholas taleb.

I am a big promoter of science and its methods. I love it for the knowledge it brought us and its fruits - the technology we all enjoy. 

I am interested in astronomy and astrophysics. I have a deep passion for the cosmos and its workings and wonders. I love reading and studying about it. I believe every human who looks at a picture taken with the hubble telescope and goes like ""meeah, not interested, this is not worthy of my time"" is not a fully developed human.

I am an extremely big supporter and admirer of philosophy. I read the stoics voraciously and I love their mode of thought with all my heart. I believe society will benefit from learning from them. But most people are too dumb to even consider, let alone read their works. I also love Bertrand Russell. I have a poster of him on my bedroom wall. 

I slightly excel in other areas of thought. I have a deep passion for intelectual pursuits. I am thinking about writing a book in the far future(in 5-10 years from now) on philosophy and science. I will never stop reading about science and I will always try to expand my knowledge as much as I can.

As you can see, I am slightly (an understatement) overpowering most people when it comes to intelect and rational thinking. I have done my stint and I can speak from experience. I know my sh*t.

The problem is this intelectual gap between me and my generation has left me deeply uninterested in their pursuits. I'm not interested in Facebook, stupid everyday dramas that consume your most precious resource - time, I don't watch stupid TV shows and TV serial movies, I don't smoke and do drugs, in fact I hate it(it's an extremely stupid health hazard and I always draw attention to it when people do drugs).

You could say this overt intelectual advantage made me slightly hate philistines. I don't like bums and people who like doing nothing and who have nothing in their heads. I can't be interested in them for much time. I can't find people like me who share my intellectual passions and my way of thinking. There are very few people with whom I would have a lengthy conversation and enjoy every minute of it. 

You could say I view most of the people as mere mortals sometimes not worthy of my time. I never do or say this, not even implicitly , but sometimes it gets out inadvertently and I don't want it. I don't want to hurt people. But I don't want to waste my time with people inferior to my intelectual capacity. I want to find my match. I want to find a girlfriend who shares my passions.

This can be summed up with this quote :
""They will envy you for your success, for your wealth, for your intelligence, for your looks, for your status—but rarely for your wisdom.""

133,"I am writing this because I feel there is no one to turn to. I am 18, male, graduated high school last year, and moved out of home early last year. I am currently working on being a musician, so not working or studying full time at the moment.

Over the years growing up, I have been faced with homelessness and abuse from both divorced parents. I don't want to get into it, but I will say that I'm better off now. 

To get to the point, I've been damaged from neglect to where a daily slump of depression looms over me. I hate myself and the things that I have done, but I always told myself that once I overcome the abuse that I experienced growing up, I can finally love somebody. 

I'm on my own now, away from negativity, though I'm still very depressed and feel myself sometimes returning to my old, careless ways. I'm wondering if the way I am now is the closest I will ever get to 'overcoming the abuse'.

I was hoping to become the jovial person I was before, but I can't run from misery and truth. Everyone I know is able to pick up on my suffering, regardless of whether I tell them of my past or not. 

The bottom line is that, even though I am still severely depressed and have been dealing with the same demons for almost ten years, I don't know if I can ever be in love. Every girl I've met has only made things worse, and my suffering doesn't help with a relationship and finding someone beneficial.

135,"First off, I need to apoligize for any text or format errors in this post, its 4 am when I'm writing this on mobile and ive been stressing about this all night. 

Secondly some context: I'm a 19 year old college student who lives with his parents and has a large and very close knit group of friends.

There is a business trip that has been made available to me that may make me enough money to pay off my car and even help me in college. Close to 40k, however the requirements of the trip are heavy, I must leave my hometown and everything I know to work as a sales rep for a security company...for an entire summer. The work and money are obviously not the problem, but leaving town and risk not graduating on time, (I started college late, so I need to take summer classes in order to be able to transfer to university with a friend within a limited time frame) is a problem to me educationally and socially. I love my friends and me leaving without seeing them for so long bothers me especially since I DM a D&amp;D game that will be forced to be put on hiatus if I decide to leave. 

Another factor in this issue is the memories I might be sacrificing if I leave now, during borrowed time, a lot of my friends are heading to different paths soon, and I fear that if I leave them now, (prematurely, before everyone else splits off to their own paths), ill regret what could've been a summer full of fun games and trips to nearby cities. 2020 is the year that we all will probably leave eachother for different job opportunities and/or university's. We only have 2 years before we will stop seeing each other in town anywhere near as often.

However financially, and on a broader perspective, my mind tells me to take the job opportunity and get to know my coworkers who I must mention are pretty cool too. I can pay off my car early, and start to save up for renting out a place with my friend in 2 years to attend uni. But my heart is telling me to stay here and enjoy my friends company for as long as I can. 

This job opportunity probably will not happen again, because of regional purposes, they will probably move the state of operation next summer where I will not be able to participate. I will learn valuable business and communications skills that can carry me into many different industries as well. So objectively, this is a better option for me on a business perspective.

I need to mention the fact that I would be leaving my 3 siblings and my single mother alone, I'm the oldest brother and my next in line 18 year old brother will be leaving for military boot camp during this same summer. I don't remember how long that lasts, but long enough to put my mother through taking care of two little ones with only my very old grandmother to help out. Leaving that behind for 3 months would put a lot of stress on my family.

I've never needed the genuine advice of strangers as much as I do now. Guys, I know that this is a tough decision that ultimately can only be decided by me in the end, but I'm so lost in my own worries and emotions that I could use any sense of direction.

tl;dr should I value my friends/family and education more than a business opportunity that may never come again?",15Apr2018,2
139,"I want to try and get some things off my chest with this post. I think I’ll start this by listing off a few of my anxieties. For starters, my brothers (3, 11, 15) have all been taken out of school at some point within the last few years due to “behavioral issues”, and so my mom tried to home school them instead. That lasted a little less than a month. Since then, they’ve had absolutely zero contact with the outside world other than visiting our grandma for the occasional holiday. Luckily, I’ve managed to keep myself in school and on track to graduate in June. No credit to my parents. Other than driving me to school in the morning, no credit to my parents. Next on my list of worries and anxieties, my parents are hoarders. Severe hoarders. For years now, we’ve all slowly grown used to the trash. My bedroom is the only presentable room in our house, and even then it’s still rather gross. My brothers rooms are the worst. They’ve eaten every meal in their room for the past several years and it’s gotten to a point where the trash has grown taller then them. My parents have never once bothered to help them clean it, they’re only concerned about their own mess (which also doesn’t get cleaned). On top of that, they aren’t pressured to do anything. No brushing teeth, no sleeping schedules, no eating healthy, no showers, no nothing. Absolutely no life skills are being taught. I stopped spending time with them years ago. I wish I could paint you a picture of how truly severe the conditions are here. Moving on, I guess. Drugs. Everybody in my family (besides 3 y/o and I) are prescribed at least 2 different medications, and they’ve been taking them for years now. I have a strong feeling it’s fucking their brain chemistry up. They rely on these drugs to get through the day without having suicidal thoughts. That might be an over exaggeration, but I can see it in them. And since no one has a sleeping schedule besides me and my stepdad (for work), they basically pop one any time they’re just feeling angry or upset. It’s abusive. Whatever, next topic. Food. We do get fed, sure. But it’s strictly fast food and  microwaveable freezer junk. Sometimes when my mom gets a random hit of “giving a shit”, she’ll make an omelette or something. But other than that, nothing I’d consider healthy is being served to us. My mom is nearly 400 pounds. 15 y/o brother is 350. And my 11 y/o brother has been steadily gaining weight since he left school two years ago. I don’t know how much he’s gained, but he has two more chins then he used to. I have TRIED AND TTIED AND TRIED AND TRIED AND TIED to show them these things, and how I feel about it, and how it affects us. But she has a fucking excuse for everything, she’s a compulsive liar, and not a good women. From what she’s told me, growing up, she was heavily abused, and so I can’t help but feel empathy for her. All she really needs is help. We all kind of do. But they won’t even consider therapy because they’re worried someone will tell the therapist about the things going on at home. Sometimes I think my 11 y/o brother wasn’t kicked out at all, but instead taken out by my mom because she got a call about him mentioning the maggots in his room. She told him to never say that word every again, and so everyone here refers to them as “M Words”. It’s so fucked. I’ve never felt like a part of this family. I’m moving out a few weeks after graduation. And so here is the reason I come to reddit. I’m not very close to them, but I’m all they have. I have no idea how much worse things could get for them without me there to care for them. I’m worried they’ll become handicapped, or socially retarded. I’m tempted to just call CPS after I leave, but I can’t stand to see my parents in jail. Let alone see my brothers go through foster care.

141,"Hi there, thank you for reading. I am very lost in this situation and I feel as though everybody in my life would be biased to a point - so I'd really like to seek some advice from totally unbiased people.

More than 7 years ago, when I was 19, I moved to the other side of the world. It felt like the most exciting adventure of a lifetime. I traveled around the country for a long time, never settling down, working bar jobs, meeting tonnes of people and basically living the life. I lived exactly as I pleased - and everyone else around me was the same! The country I moved to is a hot country with a relaxed and fun lifestyle. The memories and lifelong friends I have made are incredible and something I will hold dearly to me forever. I have been to my home country twice since I left in 2011. 

I didn't experience home sickness properly until about a year ago. But when it hit me, it was severe. Ever since then, I DREAM of going home, all the time, every day. I miss my family dreadfully. I chat to them via voice chat every weekend, so we're on good terms. 

2 years ago I met my fiance, he is from the country I moved to. We've had a lot of ups and downs. I moved in with him and his parents a couple of months ago. It was not something I was in anyway ready for but due to the fact we want to apply for a partnership visa before my own visa expires later this year. Obviously things have become more difficult between us two since I moved in. I had never had a proper relationship before and there were certain things I that I never knew if they were 'normal' in a relationship. I feel so smothered all the time and I have absolutely no privacy anymore. His parents are the kindest people in the world but my SO never wants to leave his family home, mostly because he bought in to the property a while ago, and house prices are absolutely skyrocketing in the city we live in. 

To tell the truth, I've thought about breaking up for a while. I've had my doubts since day one, but always thought I could make it work. Now I'm not so sure. I think the whole process of paying thousands for my visa will add a lot of pressure onto an already rocky relationship. I'm very scared. I would dearly like to go home but the thought terrifies me - what if I am making a dreadful decision? I watch TV channels from my home and it always feels so bittersweet. Can I ever really belong in a country I wasn't born in? 

I picture going home so often but I can't imagine what it would be like, not really. The weather is famously dreary and I worry about that. But I'm so unhappy over here. I have no friends and my fiance doesn't like me to make new ones. Sometimes I wonder how he can possibly be happy in this relationship, he always says he is but I just can't understand how, I have no energy left after work and I cry every day missing my family, it must be awful for him. I just feel so wrong all of the time. I can't figure out what I should do next. 

Please help, any advice welcome",15Apr2018,2
144,"Yeah, there are a lot of things lately that are making me feel like this. Most of this stuff has been happening in the past few months. Or at least increasing. If it's relevant, I'm 18. Tl;dr at bottom.

I've been especially emotional in the past few months. It's been hard for me not to fly off the handle or to cry when someone pisses me off or says something hurtful. A few times I've chucked things at the wall but I haven't caused any serious damage to anything. The other night, I was sitting with my mom and brother. I got frustrated but I didn't raise my voice. My mom said ""we're sick of you screaming at us."" I said ""if you think that was screaming, then you don't know what screaming is, so I'll give you an example."" I then screamed ""THIS IS SCREAMING"" and they both get pretty upset. I apologized, but I felt like a freak for that.

I've always been a little paranoid but especially lately. About bugs. There are often moths in my room and it can cause some serious turmoil. Had a bit of a breakdown the other night when a moth wouldn't get out of my fucking face and I ended up crying. Flying things, I can't take them. I hate being outside in the evening because of the bugs flying around, I can't do it. I also feel very itchy all over a lot of the times and in general I'm almost always fidgeting or moving. 

Also about noises - I have to listen to music most of the time because I can't handle silence, and I have to listen to music when other people are talking(but not to me) so I don't have to hear them. In math class this table of girls next to me constantly giggled and snickered, and I felt like they were laughing at me the whole time, so I had to listen to the music at full blast or otherwise I'd feel extremely angry. In the car when the radio's playing and it's a talk show, I have to listen to my music. I listen to the same songs over and over again. I made a playlist and they're the only songs I like to listen to.

Sometimes when I'm riding my bike I get freaked out because I think I see a person, but then no one's there. They always look like shadowy figures. When I haven't slept much I see them all the damn time, but when I get enough sleep, I see them occasionally. I don't know what to think of that. It's always when I'm riding my bike or walking. 

I'm a writer. I'm writing a sci fi novel and it's something I'm passionate about. Been working on it almost every day for the past few months. I hear conversations between the main characters almost constantly when I'm not preoccupied, but sometimes even when I'm busy. I'm not talking to them; it's like I'm listening to them talk. I know it's not real, but it's annoying. It's annoying and it's helpful. Helpful for getting ideas down but annoying because I often cannot get them to shut up. That's a tiny part of why I listen to so much music.

I get worse at night, so much worse. I get obsessive and will do something for hours. Or I get very hyper and impulsive. Last night at 4 am I was playing video games with my brother and I ended up deciding to drink, and I drank too much. I didn't get sick but I felt very out of it. Normally I wouldn't do that. But I did it. 

Lastly, I can't sit down and watch anything. I can't watch a full movie without pausing it, thinking about something else, or doing something else at the same time. I started watching a movie 6 hours ago and I'm still not done with it. It's a great movie, too. Same with TV shows. The only things I can just do without stopping are working(I work at a grocery store, at the checkout) but there's incentive to that, and cooking. When I'm making stuff for family, it's easy; I have a task to do, rules to follow, and I do it. And I make it perfectly, and it yields great results. Same with working: simple rules, keeping busy, clear objective. There isn't any standing around because it's always packed. It's great.

Should I be worried or am I just a normal kid?

**TL;DR**: zero attention span, my characters are always conversing in my head, seeing imaginary shadow people, am a whiny little bitch, hyper, very noise sensitive, feeling like a weirdo.",15Apr2018,1
145,"First of all sorry for my english. I’ll try to tell you my situation. I’m 23 years old by the way.So i had paranoias and it wasn’t me anymore. I was totally low self condident, didn’t want to go out or didn’t want to hang out with my bestfriends. Because of these i went to doctor and he said i have depression and he gave me that pills called Lustral(50mg). I’ve been taking it for like 1,5 month now and i was actually doing good like last 2-3 weeks but then yesterday it happened again. I’m not sure if i can say it’s paranoia because it’s just so real. So i’m working as a piano teacher in a music school and the guy who also works there, he was my flirt like 3-4 months ago.. We’re friends now. And he has a girlfriend now. Yesterday i went work and he has showed me his new tattoo machine which his gf bought him. I was like “whoaaa that’s awesome!!”  and he was happy. I was talking to with my co-workers and also him and i said his new gf is not friendly to me and it’s really stupid.(because his gf knows that him and i were in a let’s say relationship). Everybody was like “oh no, she is so nice” and some of them was “haha don’t be jealous”(ANDDDD NOW IT STARTS)Everybody at school thinks that i am jealous about his gf and i was acting weird. I was really acting like i was jealous and don’t know what to do that moment. I couldn’t look my co-workers eyes and they saw that i was weird that moment. I was too nervous and couldn’t join the conversation but the problem is I AM NOT JEALOUS!!!! I don’t even feel anything to him. We’re just friends now. I have feelings for someone else. And after that i went out with my friends last night. We were at a concert and i was dancing. I am sure some people was imitating my dance. They were laughing. 
Please help me, i just can’t stand on anymore. Is it depression really? Does depression cause paranoias?? :(",15Apr2018,1
146,"I'm a male, In 2015-2016 I was friends with this girl. Near the end of our friendship we were spending a lot of time together and consequently I started to like her. So I hit on her. She did not like that I came onto her. She then told me to leave her alone. I did, but due to having a few classes together I would see her regularly for the rest of that semester. She hated me after then.

But I thought about her recently, and want to get in contact to see how she's doing. 

Is there anything wrong with this? Is me contacting her going to scare her? Is this borderline stalking? Should I just brush it off and forget about her

147,"I have a narrow nose bridge with a wide and bulbous nasal tip, and I'd like to scale it down through bulbous reduction surgery and an alarplasty (where they basically reduce the size and shape of the nostrils by removing the wings of each ends to make the tip appear slimmer). I want my nose to appear naturally smaller and thinner overall, but at the same time I hate the idea of a pinched Michael Jackson nose so I sometimes I fear my nose shape might not be the best candidate for a nose job.

149,"I got accepted to an art school in march starting in fall and this guy who I met at an art pre college who I had a thing with and things got very complicated and dramatic and nasty over the course of 4 ish months in 2016-2017, which pushed me into a very bad manic episode (I'm diagnosed with bipolar 1 and I have pretty bad anxiety issues as well) after therapy and medication and time to heal I'm now pretty much over the whole situation however I saw that he might be going to the same art school I'm going to and just thinking about has given me a panic attack. I can't handle the minuscule chance of seeing him in person again (we lived/live in different states) Ive been pretty stressed lately and this is just adding to the pile of stress. There's a good chance he won't be going to the school I'm going to but if he does I'm not sure how I'm going to handle it if I somehow bump into him because things were left really badly between us and I truly dislike him because he lied to and manipulated me throughout the time I knew him and I can't forgive him for doing so.

152,"My partner and I have been together for 13 years. We have a 9 (almost 10) year old daughter.

My partner has depression. It manifests in rage. Traditionally only directed at me but lately its also sometimes directed at our daughter. She'll yell at her for, well, you know, kids being dumb stuff (tonight it was because she used to many towels) but she'll go overboard on the yelling. Tonight she threw a wet towel at our daughter. She has never hit her, although once she ripped the head of one of my daughters toys just to upset her (I only know that from my daughter and I don't know 100% that it's true though). 

She used to be on medication but she stopped (self weaned) because she didn't like how they made her feel.

The yelling is constant at times, but then we might go a week or three without anything serious before it gets bad for a week or so again (no, it's not related to her period cycle).

My daughter is really upset by the yelling, but she loves her mum, so she goes from ""I want us to leave, just you and me daddy"" to ""but I would really miss mummy"" quite a lot.

Financially we're not in a great place, and life will be very hard if I leave, not to mention my daughter has a dog she wouldnt want to leave behind, but rentals almost never allow dogs in my city, and if they do it's really expensive, and as I said we're broke. I don't have parents or family I can lean on really.

So we were all hanging out, and he thinks it’s funny to start insulting me and my other friends in our groupchat.

Who without, you’re nothing. And because you fell in love with that trashy girl in high school, have fun in ten years being divorced with several kids. Just like your own childhood all over again.” I really wanted to say that because I felt like he deserved it. But if I said something equally as fucked up to him, he would pitch a fit, start crying and probably try to fight me. Truth hurts. But then I thought, I’ll take the high road. I’m not going to cause anymore problems by treating my friends that way. The simple idea I’m expressing here is, you cannot talk to other people, especially your friends, like that.

161,"I've been on Reddit for about 7 months now, and I'm contemplating whether or not I should leave the site behind. I'm not a notorious user nor do I have any problems with any fellow Redditors, but I do feel mixed about my experience on Reddit:

Here's a few reasons why I feel that I should leave:

* Lack of Community

I have mild depression, so a forum site like Reddit doesn't give me the sense of community I crave aside from subreddits with small member counts. Karma only does so much for me.

* Disinterest

Reddit surprisingly takes amount out my day. While that's not necessarily an issue, much of it is spent browsing various subreddit, hoping that strike up a deep discussion, which more or less is rare at best, leading to long periods of bored inbetween.

* Public Shaming

I haven't posted anything too personal about myself on Reddit, let alone the entire web for that matter, but I do feel that certain posts I've made dealing with my ideological and/or views could certain be used against me if someone was hellbent on doing so. I mean I could just delete all the post I'm weary about, but that would be time consuming.

There's really only one subreddit that appeals to me, but even then I don't think it's worth sticking around. If should leave Reddit, should I leave my page up (I wouldn't know if I ever felt the urge to comeback) or should I delete it all together? And if not, well... why not?",15Apr2018,0

So basically I am finishing my bachelors in economics in about a year from now. Time to think about the next step I guess. 

One option is to attend a prestigious university like harvard, stanford or escp. The other option is finishing a master on my current university for free (Vienna University of Economics and Business)

I have about 10k on my bank account right now with a 50/50 chance of getting another 40k by the end of this year so either way I would have to get a loan for the rest of the tuition depending on the school I choose. 

So the question is, how much would a master on either of these schools boost my career chances compared to my current university ( I would do the masters in Finance, Economics or Business Admin). Is it realy worth the huge investment? (Personally I tend to think it is).

Also what are my chances on getting in. My current grade average is 1,69 ( European measurement so 1 being the best and 5 being the worst) so its not the best but I intend to get better as I still have a lot of credits to go.

169,"Hey Reddit, so here's my situation. Sorry it's so long, but I want to make it as clear as possible. I work at a car dealership, where my job is to basically keep the lot in order &amp; clean what gets sold. I work part-time since I'm in college, &amp; I've been here for three years. The other guys I worked with all left, so there's two guys during the day during the week, &amp; I work nights &amp; every weekend by myself, which really sucks, especially when it gets busy, &amp; have been doing so for about a year. I didn't, &amp; still don't, intend on this being a permanent job whatsoever, as I want to get into the field I'm studying once I get far enough into my degree.

Recently, my GM, the same guy who hired me, left, &amp; that's completely turned everything on its head. He was a super cool guy, albeit hard to work with at times, especially over the past year. At the end of the day though, he is probably the best boss I'll ever have, period. The new GM is way different in basically every way. Where my old boss tended to micromanage to an extent, he was relatively laid back, let us do things our way, &amp; as long as everything got done, he didn't particularly mind how we got there. He didn't mind doing stuff for himself, himself if we were busy, he didn't mind how we looked as long as it was relatively professional, he loved being personable &amp; having fun with his employees. You get the idea.

The new guy is basically.... Well not lol. Everyone has to look &amp; act a certain way, whether there's customers around or not, everything has to be done exactly how he wants it, when he wants it, he won't do anything himself regardless of how trivial it is or how busy we are. So far, really none of us like him at all, throughout sales &amp; the service department. Which sucks, because I used to generally enjoy my job. I love most of the people I work with, but this just really sucks so far. The dude keeps getting more &amp; more finicky about how everything &amp; everyone works, looks, &amp; acts, &amp; it's really starting to bother some of the other guys I work with.

So I was recently talking with one of the guys in the service department about switching to a lube tech or something along those lines. Being that I'm around a lot of those guys throughout the day, I already know how stressful &amp; just flat-out dumb the job can be, but I'm strongly considering talking to the manager about getting in part-time, ideally with relatively the same schedule I have now. I'd have to learn everything I need to know as I go, but I'd actually have other people there to work with me &amp; help me out. Still, I don't intend on this being a permanent thing, just something to hold me over for a little longer. Actually, I've been thinking about leaving for a while now, but was too worried I wouldn't find something I'd enjoy as much or that'd be comparable to my current schedule. Plus I don't want to leave my friends.

I really don't want, &amp; can't afford, to look for another job. I'm in my early 20's, in college as I said, I have two cars that I need to keep up &amp; I help with the bills at my house. Currently I make a little more than minimum wage, which is fine for being part-time. It's pretty unrealistic to expect a fully livable paycheck at 20-some hours a week. I'm just a little lost as to what to do honestly. Like I said, I love most of the salesmen &amp; sales managers, my job used to be pretty fun, &amp; I get to drive some really awesome cars. But now that we switched GMs, I just don't want to be here anymore. I really don't feel like relearning the same thing I've been doing for three years, but in a more stiff-necked environment, just to appease a guy really none of us like. At the same time, I don't want to leave working around some of my absolute best friends.

If I try to get the service job, I wouldn't have to stay late when there's still customers (which can be a good two hours of not getting time &amp; a half, especially during Spring &amp; Summer), I'd probably make what I do now, work Sundays (which usually isn't that bad, idk with the new guy though), &amp; would very possibly work the same days otherwise, just coming in an hour or two earlier &amp; leaving an hour earlier. But on the other hand, what if I just really end up hating it? I'm kinda stuck at that point, unless I find a new job altogether. I'm absolutely terrible at dealing with change, so it's making it that much harder to do anything. Like my stomach is killing me &amp; I feel really terrible because of this, &amp; I hate it. I just really don't know what to do, &amp; would love to hear what you all think. Again, sorry this was so long -_-

TLDR - I used to generally enjoy my job at a car dealership, got a new GM recently, not so much anymore. I'm considering trying to get a position in the service department, but I'm going to miss being around the salesmen &amp; other managers since a few are some of my absolute best friends, &amp; I'm worried I'll hate it. Either way, I'm just looking for a job to hold me over til I can work in the field I'm going to college for.",15Apr2018,1

Then came the invites out, texting me, loaning me books I didn’t ask for, sending me selfies - all that shit. I was like polite about it, gave the odd response nothing huge, she would send me pictures of herself and her pet bird like every day even when I didn’t reply. 

So I also met another chick at work who I genuinely click with n she decided to have drinks at hers with us all.. a get to know you type deal. That night this first girl got wasted as, was grabby and in my face, telling me all these irrelevant  things about herself, name dropping, telling me we are gonna do xyz together, interrupting my conversations with other people n all that.. Just being heaps obnoxious. Literally storming into a group demanding the conversation stops so we can all listen to THE SONG SHE JUST PUT ON.. I decided she really isn’t someone I wanna be mates with now. I realise she was drunk but that was just the last straw I guess. 

Fast forward to a day at work with her when she fucked something up and she is pulled into a chat with the boss in the staff room - I’m outside and literally hear her throw me under the bus for this fuck up, saying I should’ve done something differently and it could’ve been avoided (I was legitimately not at fault and my boss quickly shut down her use of my name). Safe to say I’m pissed n this chick acts like we’re besties for the rest of the shift and I’m kinda cold to her, working while she follows me around trying to have a convo about her baby niece or bird or some shit.. Oh yeah, this girl does not even a QUARTER of the work I do, and when I confronted her about it her response was “oh I just watch YouTube to pass the time, our bosses aren’t like that, they don’t mind.” When I’m rostered with her it drives me crazy how she WATCHES ME WORK MY ASS OFF. 

After this shift she then texts the other girl I’m friends with saying how I’m mad at her and i didn’t even talk to her at work and she thinks I have a problem with her. WHICH I DO but why bring it up with my mate? It’s like she’s tryna stir shit up... I would’ve LOVED if she had come straight to me about it. She does this on other occasions when I have disagreed with her on the job, texts my mate about me straight away... I’m sick of it at this stage.. there are times when I’ve got “the call” from my mate saying ~what’s happened this time~ and I genuinely don’t have any clue but somehow ive upset her or given her anxiety. This job is important to me and I don’t want the drama of this friendship. My mate ends up telling her she better sort shit out herself.. the girl then texts me saying “are we okay?” says she doesn’t feel like I’m 100% with her etc pretty much a message you’d get from your SO. After a talk with my boss about it (letting them know the situation &amp; that I don’t want her friendship) I send her what is effectively a break up... saying i want to be professional and don’t want the distractions that have come with this relationship so far etc.. SHE RESPONDS saying that’s okay she wasn’t aware of what she was doing and that I am considered family to her.... I just don’t reply now. There’s nothing I can do to push her away short of telling her to fuck off. 

To this day she is tagging me in shit online like I didn’t just tell her I don’t wanna be friends. I can’t explain it I now have this irrational hatred lol.. I don’t want her tryna be buddies, it’s too much but I fully can’t get rid of her. You have no idea how much drama she has caused.. my boss is aware of it she told me “we all know what ____ is like, everyone has to like her or she freaks out” and they are fine and understand my decision to step back from her. 

I have stopped being chatty with her at work, keeping conversation to a minimum.. Fun fact this has made her work harder when we are rostered together, which is GREAT. She actually is doing more now. My next step is deleting her off social media. But I am literally nervous about the shitstorm of emotion that will follow. Help me guys what is the deal here?? Am I being mean?? This has NEVER happened to me. 

Any advice welcome. Be brutally honest. ",15Apr2018,8
174,"Been with my partner for 10 years. 2 kids together. Just lately I get the impression that he wants to be single again. Like this weekend I've just been away with the kids and took my mum along as he had plans to go out and play poker and watch football all weekend. Everytime i mention taking the kids away abroad he just changes the subject. He's going abroad for a  stag do in Sept. He has no hesitation paying or planning that. He's away for a night with the lads next month. See how it's all him him him? Anyway after talking with my mum I've decided I'm booking a holiday for 4 for next half term and if he doesn't come then I'm taking mum again. Whats your opions on this? And I know the best thing to do is communicate however when I do bring it up he says he's happy with the life hes got. I just think he wants to have his cake and eat it too. Well he can't honestly ladies how long would of you put up with this for? Why am I taking my mother on family holidays instead of him? Should I give him an ultimation? Am I over thinking or overreacting? I love him and it'll be hearbreaking to let him go but if he doesn't want this lifestyle anymore than who am I to stop him. 
Advice?

176,"Me and my Mother are no getting along lately at all :\(. Mostly due to school since i spend all my time revising for exams that are in less than a month but she is getting really pissed off that i can't help around the house and keeps telling me to wake up earlier and do housework. \(I wake up at 11 and then do my own thing up to 1pm. Then i revise until 9\-10pm and sleep.\) Mum keeps complaining that i should be doing work 11\-1pm and keeps calling me over every 20\-30 minutes for help so I can't even revise properly.

**TLDR: me and mum are not getting along.**

I made plans to go on a holiday with my best friend and his family around 2 months ago as he didn't want to go to a k pop concert alone and now mum is not letting me even leave the house so I am pretty sure like a day before we are meant to buy tickets\(In August, with MY money\) she will just say i am not going cause that's what she usually does, waits until the deadline to tell me. This is really unfair to my friend because he will then be on his own and prob get pissed off at me cause this was already planned out and all and he specifically told me to tell him if i am not sure that i can go so he can ask someone else just incase.

**TLDR : Mum may not let me go on a holiday that i am paying for with my friend.**

So my question is what i should do. I know that it is legal to leave on my own but my mum would prob annoy the other family and keep calling them and tell them not to take me cuz she's like that. I don't know what i should do. Do you think i should just tell her i am leaving anyway?

179,"My current major has a lot of laboratory based classes. Although I used to be (as a teenager) very eager to attend my lab classes in school, that is no longer the case now that I am in university. I struggle a lot in laboratory classes, I have to dedicate many hours previous to every class to look up videos on the procedure since the lab manual is (in my opinion) incomplete (and I need every single step to be explicit in order for me to do well). Most of the time I don't know what's going on, I am always afraid to ask for help because my teacher is extremely arrogant, I am by myself while everyone else has a partner and therefore is able to do the work much faster than me. I always find myself panicking before each class, afraid I won't have time to finish every procedure or that I won't have time to finish the lab report, I have to be medicated beforehand with betablockers so that my hands don't shake. Most teachers always act like the students were supposed to already know everything (I thought I was there to learn), even in the case they haven't given a single piece of information about the procedure (i.e. there is no lab manual).                   
I am concerned about my future, since I will most likely be valued by employers for lab skills, and I have none. I don't feel like I am learning anything.

180,"Hi everyone. To preface, I’m 16 years old.

Recently I have been getting a lot more angry for a lot more less reasons. The past 2 weeks there has been a problem with me. I try to play video games with my friend that’s across the state and whenever I die, or anything in generally, I just get really angry. This doesn’t really happen to me because while I’m on my ADHD medicine, I’m quite calm and if I die I get upset, but nothing super serious. This hasn’t really happened ever since I started playing sports. I go to practice everyday from 3-5, and I throw Javelin in Track &amp; Field. I really love it, but I feel like it’s a huge factor of why I’m so goddamned irritable. I also work every weekend which really sucks because I like to see my grandmother, and also have time to myself to work on stuff (and play video games lol), but that hasn’t really made me super irritable. I’ve been like this for the past 2 weeks, and it’s gotten to the point where if my neck kinda hurts, I literally can’t play any games with my friend.

181,"It's a long story but I had a mental breakdown and deleted a friend off of facebook to shield them from me projecting my problems on them. I'd just talked another old friend out of suicide and dealt with ptsd flashbacks of my own. I burnt myself out and explained as best i could to this friend why i was withdrawing myself. They had their own trauma they needed space from but because I lacked any support system i leaned on her too much. they must have taken it personal or maybe needed their space from me real bad because i'm blocked now.

As i'm going to therapy and learning about my own ptsd i'm recognizing signs from old conversations with her. she left an abusive relationship, had nightmares, withdrew herself socially very often and mentioned her abuser made her 'feel like she deserved it'

I'm afraid she might fall back into that feeling of deserving it and feel too ashamed to seek professional help. I want to communicate with her that its possible she too might suffer from ptsd from that trauma and tell her she may need to seek help as well.

I wanted very badly to be able to help but I took on too much from too many people while ignoring myself. Other than the pastor of her church who often ignores or takes days to respond to me i have no channels of communication anymore. I DO NOT want to find any 'stalkerish' forms of finding her. She may already feel unsafe and i refuse to add to that. I worry about this friend and am kept awake at night sometimes. I don't know if i can rekindle the friendship but more important than that is knowing she'll be okay. I keep telling myself to 'put it in gods hands' but i can't.

My plan is to work for around 16-24 months (because I want to go to college in 2020) and that's what I told the first company that I went to. They immediately hired me after interview because they need someone like me. (So it was basically the first company on my list of around 8 different ones that I was going to visit and they hired me)

During the interview and when we were exchanging all information regarding job, contract, etc. I never asked them about the salary, because I thought it would be inappropriate. Am I right? Or should I ask that before hand?


 The last job I had in a similar company but different city they paid  100% overtime and also on weekends. At this company, they don't do that. I found that yesterday from a co-worker on my first day at work. 


I know I could get an other offer relatively quickly from a competitive company, but I feel it would be a dick move on my part after all the stuff they have done for me yesterday. They seemed happy to hire me after we did an interview. I was saying that I am looking forward, and I like it here bla bla lol. They all seemed like awesome people. They provided me nice clothes also. 


Anyways, I fucking hate it that there won't be 100% bonus on weekends and there's gonna be a lot of weekend work during vacation which is something I am looking forward to. 


Should I just suck it up and accept that? I don't think there are other options now. I feel like I would be the biggest asshole to quit now after meeting so many new people lol.

184,"I am planning to leave my job in the Autumn to go back to university and I haven't told my manager or any of the senior people in my department yet because I didn't want to be treated like a temp or potentially be fired so they could hire someone else, especially because my circumstances could change between now and then. I told a couple of my colleagues (people on the same junior level as me) who I'm sociable with outside of work but stressed that it was a secret to be kept from the senior staff. At work drinks where a couple of senior people were present, after I had gone home early my friend (who was drunk) blurted out that I was leaving the company, when and why. The next day at lunch my other friends told me what she had done and she said, very light-heartedly, ""Yeah, sorry - but it's fine they promised not to tell anyone!""  And to their credit, the senior staff-members seem to have been very discreet and not even intimated to me that they know. Later on my friends (who were pretty shocked at what she did) explained that it was not even relevant to the conversation they were all having - she seemed to interrupt a conversation just to let the cat out of the bag. 

I'm quite angry with my friend about this - she could have put me in serious trouble (potentially getting me fired) if it had been a different member of the senior staff at the drinks. And while I understand that people say things when they are drunk that they wouldn't say sober, but she doesn't seem to think it's a big deal and I doubt she would have let me know or apologised if another person hadn't mentioned it.

186,"Here is the situation I am stuck in.  My work is cutting my hours.  My husband works too but we are just making ends meet.  I have applied to many jobs, both local customer service jobs and further away resident property management jobs.  Right now we have not had much luck.  Unfortunately though several management companies were interested in hiring me they require I be close to the position to even interview.  At the current time we have enough money saved up to move anywhere in the contiguous United States.  However most places when we get there we would have to already have a job waiting.  

Currently my goal is one of two things (whichever comes first):

1. Obtain an on-site position with a property management company.

2. Obtain a position with a local company that would allow me to save up enough money that we would be able to re-locate to the area of our choice and then obtain an on-site position.

The problem with most property management companies is that they are hesitant to hire someone out of state.  Pennsylvania generally favors people who have a degree for property management (or anything else really.)  Most positions available to me would have the same income I am getting at the moment without the union benefits making finding a local position difficult.

So I came up with an idea.  My husband is a writer.  I would like to know if I set up a website for my husband's writing, would people be interested in buying his writing if I priced it somewhere like $.50 to $1.00 a chapter?  All proceeds going towards the #2 option where we could move to the area we would like and would thrive in.  Pennsylvania is killing us, almost literally.

At home my parents where control freaks and I was very rebellious. And from about 7th grade my parents started throwing all their shit at me and blaming me for everything and favoured my brother over me,so after a while I distanced myself away from my family,it was hard but I had too do it for my peace of mind. 11th grade I decided I needed to change so I made a few real good friends and it changed me a lot and I became kind of a serious gamer and got crazy about music and YouTube too. 12th grade I fought with my closest friend and we never got back together but it changed me a lot,I started mingling with a lot more people, and built a lotta confidence and started talkin with girls and I built a lotta confidence and got into a relationship and was one of the most popular kid's at high school. My relationship helped me feel connected with someone cause I was lacking an emotional connection with anyone, never felt like a part of my family either. Did average for my 12th scoring a 3.9 GPA. Wanted to move back to the us, but ended up going to a college near my house, cause I didn't do well for any of the tests cause I was too busy playing League of Legends cause I hadn't played it before, and it was one of the very few games I've ever played on my PC, cause of my parents. I got a phone and computer from them only after my 12th, that's how controlling they where. After 12 is when things started to get real bad I broke up with my girl cause she was going to the us and I didn't believe in a long distance relationship. And I ended up joining an engineering college near my house, so with all this stress and anxiety I got into porn. I started off using it as a stress reliever, and then I started using it all the time when I was stressed, bored, practically all the time and I soon got hooked onto it. And it's now killed my confidence, I've lost most of my friends, been depressed, and now not able to do anything, and I'm so tired. Flunked 4 outta my 6 papers in my 1st sem, cause I didn't seem bothered for some reason, it's like my head became numb (I wanted to study but I couldn't).And now I can't seem to do anything for some reason, even things I used to enjoy I don't enjoy anymore. All I do now is Game, Watch porn and fetish videos, YouTube,  and Movies. And if I flunk another paper I'll have to sit at home for a year and I'll go nuts. Just started meeting a counselor a week back cause I nearly hurt my mom cause she was driving me nuts (I'm nearly 20 and my parents still try to control my life). If I fail another paper I'll move outta my house and cut my family outta my life forever cause they've done so much psychological damage to me. I'll have to get back to the us somehow and then maybe community college. Porn's made me become a creep too. Felt bad to what I was jacking off today.

This is really upsetting as I think that it’s because I’m not doing too well in my A-levels. This is actually partially due to my parents putting loads of stress on me.

200,"Let me preface by saying I realize I made a huge mistake by calling the cops.
I just moved into a new apartment complex about a month ago. We’ve had no problems with noise or neighbors at all— until last night. 
Our middle aged male neighbor right below us was watching movies at an INSANE volume, to the point it was rattling our floor, we could FEEL the subwoofers. 
I work weekends with very long days (14 hours), and so when I came home and this was going on, my immediate reaction was one of panic because I knew I wasn’t going to be able to sleep. My roommate and I talked it over for about an hour (at this point it’s 11:30pm) and decided to call the cops (our management security wouldn’t do anything) to avoid a hostile living environment that we figured might result if we went and talked to him personally, as he would know exactly who is complaining in the future if this continued. I realize it’s a weekend and before midnight but I also feel like if you live in an apartment you give up certain liberties that you’d have if you lived alone, one of which is being conscious of your neighbors and how your noises affect them. Now I realize that goes for me too, apartment living means dealing with other people’s noise, but I felt we were justified given our floor was quaking. 
However I feel that we took the most drastic measure possible, and should have talked to him first. I’m worried that since we just moved in a month ago, he may know it was us who called, and it might create a hostile living environment if he has a mind to retaliate. 
What are my options for trying to rectify this? Should I leave it alone? Am I screwed? Any chance he WON’T know it was us who called?

everyone tells me im the lucky one... it dont feel that way.
maybe if i had more disposible income..

but honestly i never thought id be this old and still single living in an apartment.

im just totaly beside myself on what to do.

everyone i grew up with has long since parted ways and i never really bothered to make new friends. i know people but im not really close to anyone.

my job isnt that great of pay but its super easy and gives me plenty of free time so im not giving it up.

i cant afford to travel.

i have no relationship prospects.

i just dont know.

im not angry or depressed or anything like that. just really unsure.

i dont even drink so bars and concert are even a challenge to go to and enjoy sober. i usually seem boring if i go out and not drink.

id rather not go out anyway.

i want a nice quiet life together with someone and even that seems far fetched.

any ideas?",15Apr2018,3

207,"I am a married woman. I have a lot of guys friends, 99% of them are married as well and their wives don't care that we are friends. I joke with them like a guy and I have never had a problem. We are all bros.

On Friday I went out for beers with my boss (we work closely together and are friends) and another staff member that is also friends with my boss from before he got hired.  I joked around and whatnot as usual, and nothing was abnormal. I started getting weird vibes off the other staff member but I was having fun and know how guys can be when they've had a couple of beers so I just left it alone (Mistake #1).

I drove the staff member home (yes, mistake #2, but he had no money and no way home), and when we parked he got very sexual and inappropriate with me.  We had all been making sexual jokes all night (general jokes! not personal!!) and he I think took that to mean I wanted to sleep with him. He also said some very nasty, sexual things.

Things got weird and I managed to get him out of my car after he kissed me twice (me with a closed, shocked mouth..I didn't see it coming cause i'm stupid, and pushed him off after he made contact) and put his hand on my thigh (I was in a skirt).
I feel so awful. I have never experienced anything like this in my life. I know I tempted fate and I will be so much more careful in the future. I don't know if I should tell my boss or not. I do have to work with this guy, but I feel like I can't tell anyone. It was not a big deal..it isn't like he raped me or anything. But I never cry or get emotional and I haven't stopped crying in 2 days.  I don't want to ruin anything at work, and I don't want to make this into something bigger than it is and ruin the guys job either.  I have not told my husband, as he would go on a rampage and forbid me to go out with my buddies anymore.

210,"OK so I bought my first car about a year ago and, to say the least, it wasnt the best purchase. So, now, a year later, I need to do a lot of repairs to it(5k). I don't know if I should do the repairs or just go and trade it in and buy a new car. 


Buying a new car

Pros: no problems/repairs needed and no worry.

cons: picky when spending 20k(dont want to buy something i dont like), expensive(will need loan), probably wont get much for my car (2-4k)

doing repairs

pros: allows me to continue driving my car which i have no complaints with, will, hopefully, get car past ""100k miles fix everything mark"". shop seems very knowledgeable, dont need to fix everything at once

cons: expensive (4-5K to fix all problems at once (but no extreme hardship), dont know if/when new problems will surface

We had joked around if he got a PS4 I wouldn't see him. To me, that sounded like a way to get some homework I've been slacking on done. 

In all, I'm leaning on letting him keep the sytem. If he buys a tv he'll get more use out of it. My question lies in the $100 he lent me a few days ago. I would love to keep it.

So I have been really struggling with this idea of the friends you have will determine who you will become. I believe its 100% true. Their characteristic become your own. I have recently distanced myself from many people because in my opinion they've fallen victim to the societal programming that exists within the US. By that I mean a lot of things

For example: Money buys you happiness. You should buy the biggest house and drive the hotness new car to impress people. College is the key to happiness. People will respect you if you have a lot of money. You should have kids, its only right. 

There are more but I can't think of them right now. The question I'm trying to really get answered is if its damaging for me to hang around people like this or should accept it, settle for less, and move on? Their not bad people but the way they think turns me off sometimes. I feel every should do what makes them happy no matter what society says.

Her problems are extreme. Daily automutilation. Atleast one suicide attempt a week. Mostly more. She hears voices and sees ghosts at night.

She's been through a huge trauma that she relives aswel.

I really do love her but after 7 months she still hasnt really improved while my life is on hold for her. I have to make work of my future.

But the institutions are so strickt that i feel really lonely most of the time. Unhappy more then the other way around. Living in fear and doubt. I actually feel chained to extreme misery. 

Also she has huge issues with a physical relationship. Which is something i really crave. Ive been waiting for 7 months already. I really need this, i really sound like a dick here. 

Ive done everything for her. All i could. More even. But my meds got trippeled in dosage during our relationship and i began drinking again. Ex alcoholic here.

About half a year ago, I met one of my dad's friends at his house. My dad always has loads of friends over, I'm not going into it but he does some shady business, so these are his ""colleagues"" (dad is 60, this guy is 30, I'm 23). I met this guy and we started talking, like, for hours we actually had a good conversation. The next day I saw him there again and we had a click. He left, one month went by and I realized I really fell for him. I decided to confess to him next time so, when he was there again a month later I told him (because it was really stressing me out, I just had to get it off my chest), not expecting anything in return...well, I was wrong. He reciprocated, we exchanged numbers, got a kiss on the cheek and a hug and didn't see him again for half a year. During this time we were texting but because he was so busy with ""work"" it was very sporadic (sometimes we talked every day, sometimes he wouldn't say anything for weeks, etc. emotionally very stressful but whatever, I know he's busy).

So, a few weeks ago he came back for the first time in half a year. He was here for like two days, had to sneak around my dad to come over to my place, obviously we did pretty much everything even though I barely know him but at this point I'm just head over heels.

Now he's gone again, I'm a complete mess, haven't talked to him for a week and I have no idea where this is going. Feel bad about going behind my dad's back, feel bad that I don't know what he's up to, feel bad that I don't know when I'm gonna see him again, or whether I should even want to continue this... I just don't know. I hope someone can tell me this is just a fun ride and nothing to worry about.

234,"So to start off with, it’s probably relevant that I have pretty negative views towards tobacco smoking. I’ve had close family members die of lung cancer caused by smoking over long, painful periods of time. I also have asthma, which makes it very difficult for me to tolerate the smoke, especially in smoking areas.

Recently many of my close friends (in a friend group of sorts) have been smoking increasingly often. Whenever I see them smoking, I get an awful feeling of dread that makes me feel sick and it bothers me maybe more than it should. Sometimes if I see my very close friends smoking, I’ll feel queasy and lose my appetite for the next several days, and will obsessively picture them smoking. They do not know about these issues I have, but do know that I strongly oppose smoking. 

My best friend (let’s call him Keith), to my knowledge, does not smoke often, but has some idea about how much it stresses me when friends smoke and has previously promised me he wouldn’t.

Just the other night, there was a bit of an incident in regards to this. They (including Keith) began smoking in a smoking area at a club and I had to sit alone downstairs for half an hour while waiting for them to come back. That whole time I just felt awful - queasy, stressed, and unable to think of anything other than them smoking. When they eventually came back down, I had an angry outburst at Keith for leaving me downstairs and going off smoking despite promising me he wouldn’t, to which he replied that it’s his body and his choice. Another one of my friends similarly said that it’s their bodies and it doesn’t affect me. We had a bit of a falling out and I left the club.

Since then (2 days ago), I have been unable to stop thinking about their smoking. I’ve had no appetite, and have only had one small meal which was difficult to finish. I’ve also had a great deal of difficulty sleeping (I’ve resorted to typing this out at 2:30 in the morning). I’ve constantly felt queasy and stressed. 

The problem is that my friends are very anti-drama, and are actually just pretending that nothing happened. If I tried to explain how much it affects me, they would treat me awkwardly for it or think I was just saying it so they would stop smoking. 

TLDR: For me, it’s the case that I can’t keep myself in a state of anxiety, but it will be seen as dramatic if I tell them about it and divisive if I ask them to stop smoking around me. (but I may just have to bite the bullet and do this?) For them, they think I have an irrational fear of smoking and want to control what they do with their bodies. I also cannot afford therapy to deal with the anxiety. What can I even do?

Side note: sincere apologies if this comes off as a smoker-bashing post, it is obviously not intended as one.",15Apr2018,2

I start a camp job in 2 months which I will be gone for 2 months, so I haven't gotten a call back from a lot of interviews because of this. So now I'm caught in a rift where I don't know what to do. I'm starting to feel like a fucking man child that sits at home and does nothing. I'm constantly trying to fill my time to do something, but I feel like I'm degrading. I feel like I'm a fucking 12 year old boy. 

I don't know what to do. I don't start college until this fall, I can't get a job because of my camp job, and I can't quit my camp job because I love that job, it's the only reason why I have an aspiration to become a teacher and if I quit I would potentially fuck over the entire program.

I try to meditate everyday, and often times I don't have the energy to despite having infinite amounts of time. I try to keep up with hygiene and decent grooming, but more often then not I'd skip it because of lack of energy. Every time I try to get myself to do the things I have to do, I fall short. Every fucking time.

I don't know what to do. I've tried talking to friends about this, and they for the most part take time to listen, but I can't help but perceive it as pity. Why am I like this. Why am I fucking destined to torture my fucking self. I don't know what to fucking do. ",15Apr2018,2
240,"I’ll preface this by saying that I don’t think my mom is a bad parent. She’s never abused me or neglected me and has done her best to be understanding. However, we have completely different personalities \(she’s more of a Type A and I’m more of a Type B\) so we clash often.

My mom embodies a lot of “asian mom” stereotypes: she’s very academics\-focused, strict, and she expects a lot from me. Due to this I’m almost never allowed to hang out with friends. The few times I did and didn’t come home within three hours she broke down crying and said I didn’t care about my future and was wasting my expensive education. 

I know she has a point. I’m 17, still not sure what I want to do in college, and my grades have started slipping recently due to a bad procrastination habit I’m trying to combat and a general lack of motivation for life \(ha\). I’ve been trying to get back in the swing of things, but I’m definitely not perfect. These things have been the source of a lot of arguments between us.

For the past year I’ve been feeling so suffocated by her that I started lying about going out to study for group projects and academic\-related things occasionally to hang out with friends. It was shitty of me and I’m not proud of it.

 Earlier tonight she went through my stuff and discovered a wristband from a club \(for minors, believe it or not\) I went to and exploded. She said she’d wasted 18 years of her life on me and that I was nothing but a shit\-spewing liar. She lay down on the floor and told me to start hitting her, because I’d “abused her enough emotionally so I may as well do it physically too”. I felt like shit, of course. I betrayed her trust. She also found a bottle of lube I purchased for myself and accused me of wasting my study time whoring myself. I’ve never been the “drugs alcohol and sex!” type of teenager and it hurt so much to hear her say that. I tried to explain everything but she said she couldn’t believe anything I said. I don’t blame her. She has no reason to believe me.

She then told me I had 30 minutes to pack my things and leave, because she wanted to put an end to our relationship. She took my belongings and began throwing them on the floor outside my room. When I tried to stop her she dared me to get in a physical fight with her. I packed my stuff and left around midnight. My dad eventually found me and brought me back home. He told me not to worry about my mom overreacting \(which is kind of hard when she’s screaming that you’re a piece of shit to your face\). I know he doesn’t agree with her but he also doesn’t try to defend me.

There's a step outside my room that SHRIEKS so loudly it wakes me without fail when someone steps on it. It's a very old home with lots of creaky hardwood and sound somehow gets amplified. 

Family goes out a lot and comes home drunk, often in the week (sister is off this summer so she'll be out a lot). Even on a regular night they're pretty loud.

I really wish there was a way to sleep through it - I don't want to be so exhausted I can barely function at work and can't do anything when I get home. I've done it for several summers where I can't sleep til the noise stops, and that ends up being late, and then I have to get up early and I feel like I only get a few hours. I'm very anxious about not sleeping too so that makes it harder.

Usually I'm a total zombie when working but I was awake enough that I could do the work. Now I'm doing a job that requires more brain power/analysis and self-teaching in my spare time so I'd like to be a little more rested. 

I'm thinking I either need

1) a way to block on the noise

2) a way to knock myself out at night

I'm not sure what to do about the noise - I'm already using a fan - but I'd be open to taking some kind of medication to fall asleep. I'm just worried about that because I don't want to become reliant on it.

Out of the blue, a former tenant/friend of my roommate who owns the house says he's down on his luck and has nowhere to go. He lets him take over the third bedroom under the guise of getting back on his feet and to his credit, he's been making an effort. The problem is that he's had his girlfriend over every single night since he moved in and neither of them make any effort to be quiet. 

Blasting TV late at night, no concept of an inside voice, you know, typical inconsiderate behavior. I've asked more than once for them to be quiet and he always says he'll try but that lasts all of twenty minutes. I feel like we're hitting the point where I'm going to have to tell him he can't have her over every night anymore. 

The problem I'm having is that this is a big dude. Like, twice my size. He also drinks way too much and seems quick to anger (judging from the phone calls he makes). I'm worried that if I try to assert any kind of authority, he's gonna flip out on me or potentially try to fight. Our other roommate is one of those guys who's barely home due to work travel and is also too much of a pushover to ever say no (despite owning the house and having the authority.) I'm hoping to move out in the next six months or so but that's still six months I have to live here and I'd rather it not be like this every day. 

Is there a way to go about this without potentially setting this guy off? I'm also worried he's just gonna immediately play the victim card to our other roommate and paint me as the bad guy. ",15Apr2018,3
247,"My best friend started dating this guy a few months ago and from what I hear they are very happy together.  However, another friend of mine works with my friend's boyfriend, and he told me that my friend's boyfriend has recently been making really creepy sexual advances towards another woman where they work.  I don't know if I should tell my best friend about this.  I do not want to hurt her feelings, but I feel like she has a right to know that her boyfriend has been hitting on another woman (who is married, by the way).

What makes it worse is they also found false eye lashes and eye brows under the sink (I have these so the doll doesn’t look too much like a mannequin)

I have no problems getting sleep. I have to work on Chess daily and when I start to work, I get really sleepy and I just can't seem to concentrate. So I just end up procrastinating and watching TV shows all day. It gets worse during tournaments,And sometimes by around 8 pm, I get really exhausted. I don't if it's just me being lazy or something else. I just have low energy for the rest of the day. I'm at home 90 percent of the time so it's not like I'm doing anything physically excruciating.

252,"I've been friends with this girl for many years and she's stuck by my side through a lot of tough times, but she's always had a subtle mean streak that she refers to as ""brutal honesty."" Now, I assure you I can take criticism, but it's gone far beyond that. She's very condescending, with a really strong ""I'm always right and you're always wrong"" mentality. I've never been very good at standing up for myself so I've always just sort of taken her mean comments and hoped that we'd just be able to keep having fun together. But recently, the bad times have outweighed the good. She's in an almost constant state of hostility: snapping at me, telling me why I'm wrong and stupid, and insulting and belittling anything that upsets me (lack of money, shitty old car, minor complaints about school, etc.) by telling me that she has it worse, so I can't complain. It feels like I'm always walking on eggshells, I never know what I might say or do to make her angry with me next. I've also noticed she only acts this way with me, and watched her sincerely apologize to others for snapping at them once, where as if I seem upset by something she says or does to me, she tells me to suck it up or acts like I somehow brought it on myself. I'm hurt and beaten down, I'm becoming increasingly insecure and unhappy with myself as the constant barrage of insults is impossible to avoid now. Even my mother has pointed out to me that she treats me poorly, and she only sees us interact if we happen to be around her. and I've decided I need to get out, but I have no idea how. Trying to talk things out with her doesn't work because she always believes she's in the right, so I fear trying to repair the friendship isn't even an option. I'm just not sure what to do. Breaking up with a friend feels so much more painful than any romantic breakup I've ever experienced. I just need some guidance. Thanks. ",15Apr2018,3
253,"So I’ve dealt with this problem for the past 5 years, and it’s really messed up my high school experience. All of my friends don’t really have strict parents, so they let them smoke weed without any consequences. Me on the other hand, well my parents would literally disown me if I smoked weed, especially my dad. Thing is,  I *have* smoked weed, but just because that’s the only way I can maintain the relationship between me and my friends. These are really the only friends I have, and I recently just started to lose a couple more to this. I feel like I’m completely stuck in this difficult position. I can either be an obedient kid without a social life and without friends, or I can smoke weed, have friends and avoid my parents. It would literally be the greatest thing if my parents let me smoke weed once in awhile, because I would still have friends. This whole situation has really made me realize that friendship is only dependent on common interest. I’ve literally lost my friends to weed. Also, almost all of the girls I know smoke as well, so the chances of getting a girlfriend are quite slim as well. This has literally been a situation I’ve been dealing with for the past 5 years, starting when I was in 8th grade. I’ve almost wanted to just tell my parents that I’m going to smoke whether they like it or not. Also, the times that I am high I never enjoy it because I’m too paranoid. It really sucks that my parents haven’t realized the burden that they have given me, and that I’m losing old friends because of it. What do you guys think I should do? ",15Apr2018,2

259,"4 months ago I was raped by my best friends boyfriend, who I had also considered as my friend. It's a long story of what happened that isn't really relevant to this, but I'm seeing a counsellor currently and it's all been a bit of a mess with telling my friend. 

Anyway, since then I've not had to see him much but last night I was out at a nightclub to celebrate my birthdays with my friends and he turned up with some of his mates, even though he knew I was going to be there. This was at about 1, and prior to this I'd had a bit to drink and was drunk but totally in control of myself. However, I remember that it was like everything came to a stand-still and I spent the next 10 minutes being hysterical with my friend in a corner, out of the way of everyone. From that point onwards, I must have drank a ridiculous amount and ended up unable to walk or talk and was being sick everywhere. I can't remember anything after getting in the taxi home.

Talking to my friends and parents, they're all very concerned that I'm not dealing with things how I should be, and I agree. When I don't see him I can try and get on with things but whenever I see him I completely shut down, and I struggle to cope with it at all. I'm worried that when I go to uni in October that I won't be able to cope with going for nights out or that if I ever see him again on a night out (very likely as we live close together) that the same thing is going to happen again.

Yes, I need to take responsibility for my actions and try to stop it myself, but I'm just looking for general advice on how to cope with potentially seeing him out and about, and how to stop myself going down the completely wrong path with using alcohol to help me cope with things.

262,"It was October when I cancelled my AT&amp;T services because I was moving out of state. I returned all my equipment and paid my final bill. Come January, I receive a bill from them for Oct-January. I called them the first time and they are also baffled by this and are telling me that maybe they never received the equipment even though that’s not what the extra bills are for. I cannot even log in to their website at this point since my account has been cancelled so I ignore it. 

February - I got another one of these bills. This time I tried to call them and they transferred me to multiple customer service reps for 2 hours and then the last person hung up on me because apparently my account had my dad’s name on it and she REFUSES to talk to me, so she hung up on me after I asked to speak to a manager. (My dad had a different AT&amp;T account number)

March - I got another one of these. Same charges. So I tried to call again. And again they tell me the same exact thing. Again, my dad had a different AT&amp;T account number. 

Then yesterday, I got a call from a debt collector that AT&amp;T hired on me about these unexplained charges. I have been trying to reach out to AT&amp;T to no avail.

I've been trying to contact her all day so we can things clear between both of us. Told her ignoring me wasn't a solution (she's been totally ignoring everything) and even ignored when I asked her for my son.  

What can I do now ? Just let her be and settle this with my lawyer ? I was told her outright ignoring everything is bad behavior on her part and could play against her.

My dad is quite lenient on the whole thing though and wished me a safe trip. 

Anyways, my mom is deeply concerned for my safety and says it is not safe for me to go alone (Despite the fact S Korea is among the safest countries in the world) and I should have used the money to pay off student loans or something useful.

269,"Dear people on Reddit,

Never thought I had to write such a story like this. Though I feel relieved I can share it and speak about it.

My name is Lars, I'm a 23 year old male from the Netherlands. So excuse my English if it's not correct all the time.

Well.. Let's start with the age of 18. I went to school and started the pre-education study for the army, I've quit after 6 months. It happens.. people making wrong choices. After that I've started an IT-study (computers etc.), I've quit after 4 months. I've started an aviation study and finished it (3 year study). 

I felt not ready yet to start working full time (age 21) so I decided to start a bachelor study economics. After 3 months I quit. Wrong choice..

I decided to start working fulltime at our national airport, after 4 months I was tired of the traveling (2h 30 min every day). I found a job more nearby my living place. I stayed here for 8 months. 

After that my grandpa got sick, he died 6 months ago. Sometimes I'm still having a hard time with his loss. This gave me the motivation to start a nursing study. Currently I'm still following this study but I'm in a big doubt, I'm not enjoying it anymore. I feel lack of confident and motivation even though I will be able to proceed to year two because I have enough study points to advance.

My biggest problem is I don't know who I am, what I want, what I enjoy and what I live for. No, I don't want to die any soon. When I overview my life based on relations I should be happy. I've got friends, family and a lovely girlfriend. Though I'm far from happy. I'm feeling inert, not progression, no motivation, no soul.

I want to share my story here since it relieves a bit.
Do people on here have some advice for me or experience the same kind of problems? 


Feel free to comment or sent me a inbox message.
Thank you so much in advance.

I was really depressed in undergrad (nearly failed out, but somehow recovered and graduated with a 3.8 GPA) and struggled to define myself, but came out in the end. My final year of undergrad a professor I truly respected accused me of plagiarism on a final project and I had to fight it, she changed my grade before anything escalated and I'm still confused about what happened.  After 2 yrs I still haven't gotten over that.

Now that I'm coming to the end of my Masters I've only had three jobs, I hate my one job right now, and just feel like I haven't had a variety of experiences.

Get international experience, meet new people, do new things.

I hate how my hair doesn't work properly.

I hate how my eyebrows don't sit on my eyes properly and even when I try to trim them they still look massive and ugly.

I hate the moles on my face.

I hate how I have a small and receding chin.

I hate how I'm not overweight by any means, 6'2 and 84 kilos yet all of the fat goes directly to my face.

I hate how my nose looks totally massive.


In short, I think my face is ruining my life because it keeps me from getting the confidence that I need to go out there and do things.

I don't know what to say but I've lived totally despising my face all these years. I'm ready to get told I'm ""average"" though, which is really just code for ""ugly"" so don't worry, go right ahead with your bullshit.

277,"My girlfriend (20F) and I (19M) have been together for about 3.5 years and we’ve had a great relationship for the majority of it. I’d say throughout the past year we’ve had a few more rough patches than usual, but we usually get back on our feet. I’m still in college for another 2-3 years, and she’ll be graduated in about a year. 

She is very adamant about wanting to get engaged, and I thought it was a good idea too up until recently. We’re planning on moving in together later this year (though I’m not so sure now) up to Los Angeles, and we also wanted to take a trip to Europe in the winter, and then we talked about getting engaged at the end of the year as well. At first it sounded like a realistic and fantastic year to have with her, but we talked it through and came to realize it’s just not possible financially (even though travel is the only thing we spend our money on— we’re both pretty good about keeping our savings). We’ve pretty much decided to postpone the trip and getting engaged and just focus on moving in this year and getting settled. I’d also come to realize that I don’t think I’m quite ready to get engaged either… I love her very much, but I really feel like I personally have some growing up to do before I can commit to marriage. I think that’s a valid feeling to have, especially at 19, but it’s hurt her a lot that I’ve redacted any hope of getting engaged soon. I realize that I shouldn't have gotten her hopes up in the first place if I even had an inkling that I couldn't follow through. I feel real bad about that. I was dumb to do that, but I wanted to make her happy.

This whole thing has become an extremely sore spot with us, because she’s talked for years about getting married. She’s looking at me now and thinking that I don’t love her as much as she loves me because I’m not ready to do that yet.

279,"I am friends with someone with autism. He is 34. He is working in a supermarket, but it's really not good working conditions and they don't seem to value him. He has a degree in graphic design and had an aspiration of working in the media or the creative industries but he's applied to so many places, and they don't seem to be able to accept his lack of people skills and his learning difficulties.

He lives on his own in a flat, and he scrapes by on his supermarket wage, what little he gets of universal credit, and £200 per month from his parents. His parents constantly are pushing him to apply for more jobs, to 'do something with his life' etc. They are very disappointed that he has not been able to 'make something of himself'. He comes from quite a rich family and his dad used to work in London in finance. He wants a similar life to what I and quite a few of his friends have - a professional job and a middle class income etc.

He has applied to so many jobs unsuccessfully. I have helped him with lots of applications and he always falls down on the interview. He just doesn't seem like he is able to get what he wants in life. I have advised him to apply for disabled applicant schemes and autistic-friendly opportunities, but he refuses to declare himself as autistic on the application as he thinks it would disadvantage him somehow - but really I think it's a bit of a pride thing - he refuses to consider himself 'significantly disabled'. His own self-image doesn't align with that. I keep telling him that he is significantly disabled but I think he just psychologically doesn't want to accept it.

His parents keep pushing him, saying that it is unfair that he keeps taking £200 per month off of them. I think it's unfair that they expect anything more of him when 68% of adults with autism are unemployed, even though they desperately want to work.

I used to have ""a thing"" with this girl, only knew her because our parents are friends, and it ended because we just stopped talking to each other. We're both awkward but she's really cute, I'm not the most attractive person. 

So I asked her to prom over text (ughhh), she said maybe, and then a few days later agreed. We have barely talked since, in fact, she's texting my friends more than me lately. But we're going and I have to go to her house with a sign for pictures that will be posted everywhere.

I honestly feel so ugly so I hate all the pictures that will be taken with me by this cute girl, and being considered the ugly friend. 

I don't like modern music and have never danced before. 

Everyone is bugging me about prom, and it's stressing me out and making me anxious. 

What should I do to get the best experience out of prom? I haven't seen her in real life for two years and proms in two weeks. 

Thanks guys, ",15Apr2018,2

294,"Let me start off by giving some background information. I grew up in a pretty religious household, where alcohol was never present. I consider myself to be pretty straight edge, but smoked a little bit of weed my senior year of high school.  The summer that I graduated, my mom found the little bit of weed that I had, and lost all trust for me. Understanding why she was upset, I stopped altogether. This wasn’t a problem for me because I did not smoke often at all to begin with, and had already made plans to not smoke in college, at least not a lot. For 3 years, I did not smoke at all. Throughout these three years whenever I came home, my mom would always tell me I smelled like smoke and threaten to test me, even though I was not smoking. Fast forward to today, and I now live back at home going to a college that is closer to home, just so I could work at my job more frequently and finish school strong. A couple of weeks ago, my mom opened one of my statements and saw that I purchased alcohol at a liquor store. She was very upset about this and did not talk to me for a couple of weeks.  I’m not really sure what I should do about this tight hold she has, or if there is really anything I can do about it because I live and home and her and my dad pay for me to go to school. In the next couple of weeks, I am doing an airbnb with a few friends because we are going to a concert and decided to make a weekend out of it. She does not want me to do the airbnb because she says that I’m going to be indulging in drugs and alcohol. I more than likely will not smoke just to prove a point, but I do not feel like there should be a problem with me drinking when I’m not at their house. ",15Apr2018,3

299,"I have had my driver license (permit?) for 2.5 __months__, I am 21. I drove abound 5km in 2.5 months in my car, a bmw 320d of '05.

The other driver was at least 80km/h on a 50km/h road and was not visible from the stop I was at, the road has a turn after the stop, he was on lower ground, tire trail indicate they were in the middle of the road and for a good 1m the rear right wheel left no marks on the road when they were breaking. I was already in the middle of the road with my 2 front wheels and half the car in my road. The other driver was in a late 90s Golf.

The other driver hit my car right on the wheel and bended it. The collision displaced the rear of my car about 1 meter and his car stopped 7 meters after the collision spot.


My relatives suggest to pressure the insurance and to say I have headache, neck pain etc. In reality, I have pain in my ear with some buzzing from the airbags even though it's been 2.5 days and I will get it checked tomorrow in the morning.

I think that pressing the insurance company will cause a more harm than good and might make further contracts(?) more expensive. I will be calling the insurance company tomorrow.

I have also found a decent car at eu2.500 and consider buying it. My previous car - to me at least - seems like a liability and not worth repairing it as it has over 341k km covered distance, issues with ac/heating, needs painting, oil change, has had multiple parts replaced and throughout the 7-8 years we have had it, the sum of the expenses it caused were more than the price of getting another used with less distance travelled. On the other side, we paid 1.5k on it 4 months ago. Some estimates I have been given by people on reddit, suggest the repairs cost 5k+.

I am beyond devastated. In the last few years I've often wondered if something had happened to my brother when he was younger  as he is always angry and literally hates everyone. 

My brother has been trying to find the person that raped him but hasn't been able to.  My brother is hellbent on revenge which I can  completely understand, for my brothers sake I hope he doesn't find the person.  But he also told that he feels like he's having a nervous breakdown. He's having serious problems in his relationship and feels like everything is falling apart. I've been there too but I know that what worked for me in terms of recovering from a breakdown, won't be the same for him. I also feel that male rape is not considered with the same impact as male on female rape. 

He's my baby brother. I'm heartbroken for him. I'm heartbroken that he kept this to himself all this time. But I know that's what's important now is to help him and I just don't know how to do that.

302,"For as long as I can remember I’ve been an anxious person. My dad always told me that he was like that when he was my age but it never felt right. The past few months have been hard for me (lots of friend issues, might be depressed?) and my anxious tendencies have gotten much worse. Now I can’t really control my anxiety like I used to.

Now here comes the fun part. About a week ago I told my parents that I believed I was depressed. They said I had just been in a “funk”. I let it go, but I didn’t think they were right. 

Today someone rang the door (neighbor coming to deliver something to thank us for snow blowing their driveway) and I could not answer it (too anxious). I started freaking out and desperately called for my parents to come get the door (I was not far from the door, both parents were upstairs). My dad had back surgery a few months back and today he was in bed from the pain, my mom was also occupied at the moment so she couldn’t come to the door. The neighbor left. 

My mom came downstairs and called me ungrateful for not opening the door. She said they had done “so much for the family today” (cleaning) that the least I could do was open the door. I got choked up and tried to explain why I couldn’t open the door but she just left angered.

Everything was good until i enter into college. Since i enter into college i became a ""different"" person, my wishes for life and vibe changed a lot and my boyfriend (now ex) wasn't in the same vibe as i am. But the real reason i broke up was because i met a new boy and that's where the advice i need enter. He used to be a very fuckboy, never had a relationship but for some reason we connected the moment we saw each other. We have the same vibe and all, he gave me adventure, passion and made me question everything in my life but life isn't as easy as that. See, he's a very unstable and hard to deal with sometimes, it's unpredictable. We fight sometimes and always made up later. We're almost 1 month together and it is a good relationship but it's hard. Hard because he never had a relationship before, he don't know how to communicate about his feelings then he hides jealousy/cute things etc. I'm scared. I like him very much, we have a very passionate thing but idk, I'm scared. All his friends tell me that I'm really the only one who made him feel that way, feel something, that they never saw him into someone that much.

304,So I have been struggling with depression for a few years and it does not seem to be getting better.

306,"I've had issues with depression in the past and I've learn to cope with it over the years.  However, this semester I started developing anxiety problems because of family, friends, academic stress, etc, and as a result developed eating problems as well, where I binge eat then purge by throwing up or starve myself entirely.  I get anxiety attacks every time I do not understand a concept in lectures or when I feel like I'm being chased by deadlines - my heart starts to beat really fast, I hyperventilate and become nauseated, sometimes causing me to throw up.  

Every time this happens, I have no other choice but to take some time off until I cool down in order to get back to my work.  I'm in my final year of university and I have been nothing but swamped with work.  My shitty mental health has been making me really inefficient, which is why I waste a lot of time just trying to gather myself to do something at my table - if I'm sat for 5 hours, I get around 1-2 hours of actual work done.  

I've somehow coped with deadlines until now (only got a month left until exams).  My mental health grew rapidly worse over the last few weeks.  I've had many meltdowns, where I've almost killed myself at one point.  My dissertation is due in 2 weeks, and all I have is around 40% of work in a bad quality.  The topic is maths and I find it extremely challenging to get things done while I'm in this state.  The last time I spoke to my supervisor was around 2 months ago, when he's asked me to do some coding, to which I haven't because I do not know how and the more I don't know, the more difficult I find it to learn.  I've decided I need to go see him and ask him for help, but I have no idea how much I need to tell him in order to explain why this is all the work I have so far.  I've gathered up all the courage I need to go admit to him that I haven't done much, and I really need his help so I really need to make him understand.  The thing is, he's only a maths supervisor and not the student counsellor, so I have no idea how much I can tell him in order to convey my seriousness.  I know I really need to get help, but I am so close to finishing right now and just have no time to put everything I've worked for so far behind me to seek help.

316,"I could use a little advice on this, the title is rather self explanatory but here is some info:

I go to a private catholic high school. I have friends to hang out with there, but none of them are close friends. I only have a few handful of people I hang out with outside of school. 

Truth is, I just don’t click with half the kids there. It’s not that I dislike them (They’re all cool) we just don’t “click.” 

I have never been invited to a “high school party”, and I have never tried alcohol before...besides maybe the wine at church but I guess that doesn’t count because it’s Jesus blood?  

Anyway, I decided to try and make friends outside of school. 

My main problem is, whenever I see other kids my age, they’re always with their own group. And I don’t wanna like, intrude on them. I always feel like I’m being annoying or something so I leave them alone.

And maybe I’ll see a cute guy or something and I’ll say like two words to him and leave because i don’t know what else to do. 

I also have no idea where to find them. (Yes I have tried club, sport, job.) but nothing comes up.

I just want more friends because, the friends i do have... I love them, but they never wanna go out anywhere or do anything. Only time they do go outside is for a superhero movie. I also have one friend that really likes to walk around Manhattan with me (NYC) but...only on special occasions. 

So it’s like when all three of my friends are busy what then? 

And if I do go out, (where? I dunno. I have no idea where teens hang out) everyone already has their group so I’m not sure how to approach them and become their friend.

320,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for over three years now. I can’t say the relationship has been the time of my life, been as many downs as ups, but lately my small attraction to one of our friends is turning into infatuation. The problem I have is that Im unsure if it’s the right idea to leave my girlfriend on the off chance my friend feels the same about me.

Some backstory:
My current girlfriend and I have been together for over three years now, as stated, during which we have shared some pretty good times. Unfortunately though, during one period of our relationship, things weren’t working well. We live together and I am generally an organised person with career aspirations and have the ability to stay motivated. At the time she shared none of these traits and me asking her to clean up her mess all the time was too much which in turn caused us to decide to take a break for a while. It hurt me at the time that she couldn’t decide if our relationship was more important than cleaning up after her self. Within 8 hours of moving my things back to my parents house, she slept with my at time best friend who lived with us. To skip out on details, I eventually forgave her but never allowed myself enough time to fully process what had happened. I believe she is genuinely remorseful but at the same time can’t forgive her for betrayal and utter lack of consideration. As time has progressed, things seemed well, I was generally content but never fully happy. I moved interstate for over a month for work, during which I missed her. Came back for her birthday and stayed a month, and have since returned to work interstate for another two months (which is currently coming to an end). During which, I confronted her about all the issues I’ve had with the relationship and found I wasn’t entirely satisfied with all the answer, yet told her I was as I just wanted to put all the stress to an end. But I’ve found myself talking to one of our close friends that we both share and have found I’ve really enjoyed talking to her and I feel a real connection. I struggle to talk to my current girlfriend as we share almost zero similar interests and a lot of what she does annoys me. She has made some vast self improvements and assured me she’s committed to our relationship. A part of me worries that the only reason I can’t walk away is because I can’t walk away from all the effort I’ve put into our relationship and the time I’ve spent helping my current gf get to where she is now with career aspirations and the ability to be self sufficient. Along with that notion I worry that if I end it and confess my feelings for our friend I won’t get the same feelings back and at the present time, my current relationship isn’t that bad, just I don’t feel like she’s someone I really connect with and it bothers me a lot.",15Apr2018,2
322,"I have a friend and I've technically known her for four years, but in the first three years, we were only ever just... Barely casual friends. Just sometimes the ""wave at each other in the hall when we pass"" friends or ""sitting and chatting next to our mutual friends in an assembly"" friend. I rarely saw her and I tended to talk to her brother more than her because he was in my class and she was in none of them, and because she made me nervous because I liked her. When she was with our mutual friends, she would primarily talk with me and I was getting the vibe that she liked talking to me,about which made happy. I realized my behaviors in the past may have impacted the present because I would wish her brother happy birthday never fully realizing that they were twins. Her being very socially awkward (to the point where I think that maybe she has autism), she never told me her birthday.

After the third year I knew her, we graduated from high school and we went our separate ways for a whole school year. I never got her number but trying to make friends at college made me think that she was a friend I wanted in my life, regardless if she reciprocated my feelings or not romantically. The summer after my freshman year, I reconnected via text and at first, I took the way she texted as uninterested and blunt until I talked with her brother and he said that she really likes the conversation I was having with her. So I continued because I liked talking to her as well.

Then a lot happened all at once. I opened up too much to her: I confessed to her, told her about my major depression, asked the rejection, and told her my attempt all in the span of two months. This happened within the first two months we reconnected (between June and July of last year). Though she was supportive of me through me telling her about my depressive episodes, I apologized for all those things I told her and having to deal with my depressive episodes. After that day, I stopped telling her about my episodes and went to get professional help because I didn't want her to resent me or hate me.

Anyway, I don't know where we stand in terms of how close we are in our friendship. We tend to talk about our mutual interests for majority of times, but after New Year's, the shows we talked about seasons' ended and so now it's back to general conversation. Sometimes I'd like to think she's close to me: she talks about her personal life with me often, from her troubled childhood to the things that happens on her college campus. She's become very nice to me and wishes me good luck/goodnight/have a nice day when the conversation ends. She also likes the idea of hanging out with me and binging a series together. When I text her, she usually texts me back immediately after I send them. Sometimes I can tell that she cares about me, and sometimes I think she hates me.

However, there are times where she seems distant. Sometimes she's really talkative, and others, she seems uninterested and her responses are significantly shorter. I notice her that when I talk about myself, her replies get one-worded unless she can relate to it. There are many times where she ignores what I say and continues talking about herself. I know I shouldn't do this but sometimes I expect to her to say something, and it's completely different from what I expected. For example, I told her that my birthday was coming up and I was wondering if she had any recommendations for places to go and all she say was: ""Chinese"". She didn't even wish me a happy birthday or anything, and she didn't even respond to my next text. I assumed she was busy but my mind wanders and paranoia talks over.

I worry about the future of our friendship, and I know I shouldn't but I do. I consider her a good friend and I don't know what she considers me. Some days, she tells me how much she likes her roommate and the people in her dorm, and I feel like she doesn't see me as one for thsoe people. I want to know what she considers me, and maybe ways that I could improve the friendship if it's still alive. 

For context, we rarely see each other in person (once a year because of school, and mutual friends working -- which is why I asked her to hang out with me, and she said yes) and all of our conversations have been via text since May 2017.

* I just realized that the return flight for the vacation I've had planned for a year now (that was very pricey, to boot) conflicts with the day of her wedding, which is on a Friday

* It is completely my fault for not realizing this sooner, but I had stupidly assumed that the wedding was going to be on a Saturday (with my return flight on a Friday, making me available for the wedding) and hadn't realized the conflict until now

* The vacation package is non-refundable and non-amendable, so I would either lose the $2,000+ cost of the entire 1.5 week vacation *and* alienate my boyfriend's family, who I am going on the vacation with, by pulling out of the vacation, or miss my cousin's wedding and pull out of being her bridesmaid

I’m friends with this guy who is 5 years younger than me who is still in high school, we became friends through a gaming group. For about a year we hardly ever talked and it was okay, but ever since Christmas break and even now we’ve talked a lot but...I’m not sure how much longer I can handle our friendship. He doesn’t really have any friends so I think he’s pretty lonely and has become clingy, getting upset when I am not able to message him back right away(even though I’ve told him I’m busy - I’m a full time uni student and work part time). When we do talk it’s unpleasant for me. He tries to be bossy and is very critical of things I enjoy or if I share something with him(like something artistic). He also wants to try and argue about things and I don’t have time to deal with this kind of petty crap. I’ve talked to him about it but I don’t think he understands. I don’t want to be mean but it’s became draining and puts me in a bad mood after I talk with him. How should I go about ending the friendship? I tried phasing out the friendship but it sort of backfired. He’s been telling me lately I’m one of his best friends and he keeps saying he wants to see me in real life and makes me uncomfortable.

334,"Title is everything. Details ahead. Sort of long sorry

My friend (gonna call her Lindsey) has her issues. Severe depression is the main one. Problem is, she's embraced it, and her entire personality orbits around ""Oh yes, did you know I have depression?"" However, up until recently, our entire friend group was ready and willing to help her out whenever she needed it. We managed to see past the whole part where she's basically proud of having a mental illness, and things were good. Sort of. A lot of things have been building up over the years, but they've been easy to ignore. Then an incident happened.

Long story short, Lindsey had a ""panic attack"" at a party, completely ignored our group's attempts to calm her down, and only got better when people she never, ever talks to came over and drunkenly told her to ""breeaaaathe"". 

The last straw was when this blonde, blackout drunk idiot (who's been nothing but an absolute cunt to Lindsey when sober) shoved one of my friends out of the way to stagger over to her and start screaming gibberish that went along the lines of how she too suffered from depression, and she understood everything Lindsey was going through. Since we're not assholes, we went over to try and save Lindsey from the discount Mean Girl.

Lindsey, completely sober, blew us off and said she wanted to hear what discount Mean Girl had to say.

Safe to say, everyone is furious. All the pent up, five year-old frustration is officially spilling out in our friend group, and it's incredibly stressful. Everyone wants Lindsey out. Me included.

Now me, I'm the type of person who likes to get things done as quickly and efficiently as possible. If it were up to me, I'd have politely told Lindsey that we're tired of her shit and want her gone. Problem is, she might hurt herself or worse if we take that approach. 

There's still hope, though. This is our last year together, so we can all just try to hold out till graduation. However, I know my friends - and quite a few are having trouble just being polite to Lindsey now. They've already snapped at her a bunch. Things are definitely going to explode, but I have no idea how or when. And I have no idea how it's going to turn out.

Essentially, I'm terrified. I don't want anyone to get hurt, but I need Lindsey out of my life. Which sucks, because I used to adore her. And out of respect for herself, I feel she should leave, because I don't think anyone would want to be in a friend group where no one can stand you.

My SO wasn’t to pleased with getting the cat but I clearly told him I would take full responsibility of all the expenses needed. Yesterday afternoon I came home from work and right away I realized my cat wasn’t home. Sometimes she goes out to the yard so I checked and she’s not there. I had a gut feeling that something happened. A couple hours later she’s still not home. I text my SO asking him. (He’s working) Night comes and still no cat. This morning I asked him about it and he tells me this BS story about taking her to the vet and him rolling the window down and she got out of the car. I lost it at this point. I feel betrayed and lied to. And absolutely heartbroken imagining what my cat can be going through.  Also the fact that she got lost about 5 miles from home makes it almost impossible for her to find her way home.

340,"Hi reddit, I’m really upset and looking for some help. I just had another screaming match with my mom, which is not uncommon, my mom enjoys arguing. It’s always been her and I, and for as long as I can remember my mom has always screamed and used physical punishment when she’s upset with me or I did something wrong. I was even in foster care due to her leaving marks on me but that was apparently all my fault and I made it up, she once said that I wanted to stay with my foster family because the dad was a pedophile and he’d come in to my room at night (never happened). 
  
Anyways, my mom has horrible anger issues and can’t control her impulses when she gets to a certain point. Since it’s always been my mom and I we are very close but when we argue it’s horrible. Sometimes we have a few weeks where we don’t argue but then something sets her off and we have a blow up. I’ve lived like this all my life and I truly believe it’s the reason I’ve struggled with self esteem and anxiety and depression issues. It makes me sad to even type this because I love my mom and I love when we get along, but it’s like she’s two different people sometimes. She will be loving and nice and we will go out and laugh and then other times she’s so negative and argumentative and escalates to abuse. 

I’m going to graduate high school in the next two years, my mom wants me to live at home to save money while I go to college. I’ve thought that it sounds like a good idea on the money saving front but i know families aren’t supposed to be like this. I love my mom but I don’t think I can live with her for six more years if things continue like this. So my question is, is it realistic to move out and live in a dorm / apartment while going to school and having a part time job? How do I do it?

341,"**Some background:** My job was a hostile environment where nothing was getting better, despite me trying to. My coworkers were extremely hostile, talking behind my back and creating a negative environment that was hard to be around (rumors, passive aggressive jabs, threw me under the bus multiple times to higher ups, harassment, etc). I tried to fix things by talking to my boss about it, but nothing was done. I also have an extremely controlling supervisor who hovered over my shoulder and treated me significantly different than my peers and a noticeable amount of favoritism occurred. Again, an attempt was made to fix this, but nothing was done. I was also severely underpaid for my job, and there is no room for growth in this company. An example of this would be recently a higher up position opened, and we did not even know it was going to be opened until we all notified of her replacement - an outside person. 

I have multiple examples, but that would cause this to become an essay. Basically, I was driven to the point where I was *miserable*. I wasn't proud of where I worked, I wasn't proud of my job, and I mentally checked out around December. The stress from my job also caused me to develop multiple health issues, physically and mentally. My asthma and my stress-induced skin conditions are constantly flaring up, and my immune system is shot. 

Also, I would go to work, adsorb all of the negativity, and come home with it to my husband. I started resenting the most important person in the world to me because he worked at a job closer to home and for much more money while doing half the amount of work that I do at my job. I would go to work, hate my life, come home and make him hate his life. That is unacceptable.

So, now, the **advice** part:

What now? Am I going to start job hunting? Should I apply for unemployment since I'm leaving under mental health strain? We have enough in savings and husband makes enough that we'll be okay until I get a new job. I want a job in an Office environment or at a local nursery where I can be around plants.

348,"So I've known this girl for around two years - she's one of the loveliest people I know - smart, funny and really beautiful. 

About this time last year I guess I was kind of hitting on her, not anything major, just some light flirting. She told me that she ""wasn't looking for anything serious at the moment"", I took this to mean that she wasn't into me and that was fine, we were already pretty good friends so I wasn't too upset. 

She started dating another guy a couple of months later, which was fair enough - what was weird was the first night she went around to his place she told me she was going to spend the night at one of her girlfriend's house. I only found out she was with her boyfriend because a mutual friend told me in passing.

Anyway fastforward a few months and she had broken up with this guy (she was going to university and they just weren't that compatible). Then in March on a night out, my friends and I bumped into the guy she had been dating the previous year. My friends are pretty friendly with him so we got a few drinks and sat around a table. They introduced me to him, and he told me that when he was with her the previous year, she wouldn't stop talking about me, which made him jealous.

I thought that he was just being overly jealous of me and didn't think anything of it. But I admit I did start to develop stronger feelings for her at this point.

Then, a couple of weeks the girl and I attended a party at a mutual friend's house. We ended up spending most of the night together, she drank and I remained sober (I don't particularly enjoy drinking). Then late at night, we ended up sleeping in the same bed with another guy and creating a weird spoon train (I know it sounds weird but it seemed fine at the time).

Then later still, when the sun came up, and none of us had slept very much she asked me if I wanted to go with her to find a quieter place to sleep, where it was dark. I was up for this (because, admittedly I thought she might be about to tell me she had feelings for me), but I didn't want to make any kind of move as she was quite drunk and I was completely sober and it would have felt like I was taking advantage.

Nothing happened at all, we just slept for a few hours, and when I woke up she was already up helping clean up the house. We didn't say anything about what had happened the night before, we just acted as we normally did: like friends. 

I've since talked to her every day, and sometimes it feels like there is a possibility that she might have feelings for me, but I really don't want to say anything in case she still sees our relationship as merely friendly and my admitting that I like her as more than a friend might make things weird.

Anyway, sorry for the long ramble - it's nice to type things out exactly how they are in my head, any advice would be very much appreciated. ",15Apr2018,2

Over time, I have learned that this obviously is rather pointless, and I know rationally that I need to accept the mistake, make amends, and move on.

All of this has also made me realise that I don't want to settle here long-term. I live in a small town and there's nothng to do here, the mid-sized city where I go to school is a 30 min drive and the nearest large city with attractions and experiences is 2 hours away.

So I let off the gas a little to make him want to change lanes and just go around me. He goes around and cuts me off and continues to tailgate everyone in front of him.

Now at this point I’m like whatever dude just gtf away from me and I let it go and he speeds up a little ways up ahead of me but I still keep my eye on him. Not too short after that he starts slowing down enough for me to pass by him and I look over and the dudes just texting away on his phone. I’m looking over thinking to myself “ Are you freakin kidding me” and the kid looks up at me and I just keep looking at him like tf dude. So he flips me off and I literally just stare back at him thinking “wow dude you’re cool” not really knowing how I should react. So I just start flipping him off too and of course it just escalates from there.

He starts pointing off to the side as in like he wants me to pull over and fight him I guess but being the not-so-aggressive person that I am I just keep my finger up and start waving it to him like I’m saying bye or something cause honestly I didn’t know what to do, I had never been in a situation like that. So I just keep on driving and he speeds up, cuts me off, and brake checks me, and I cut into the other lane and nearly lose control of my car.

We have been together since we were both 18 and just started college. I love her greatly and we are a perfect match; we both want the same things out of life, have similar interests, hardly ever fight, and just generally fit together.

However I have had this growing ""feeling"" for the last couple years for someone else, her sister.  I know its really messed up and I tried to push it away but it's just been building up over time. For the last 8 months or so I have been having dreams 4 or 5 times a week about her, just being with her and confessing my feelings to her. 

I think the worse part is that I feel like her sister shares some of the attraction; whenever we are together we basically block everyone out and just talk between the two of us, she always finds a reason to touch my face or my hands and things like that. She also stops by my work frequently to visit me. 

Anyways I am so conflicted on what to do, I feel like it would never work with her sister so I want to stop how I am feeling and I need to stop the dreams, they are driving me crazy!

I’m a male, and I’m not an active feminist by any means, but it was just common sense to me that generalizations like “all men are trash” and “all women are the same” don’t help either side. After seeing this, several of the females I know hanged up against me to say that it’s not wrong at all to generalize all men, and got into a heated discussion about the definition of feminism. Like I said, I’m not an active member in the feminist movement, not because I don’t support it but because I know that I’m not educated enough on the matter to speak on it. Even though I said this multiple times, they kept insulting me about how I was an entitled male, and that I was part of the problem. I tried to show my support, and they interpreted it completely incorrectly and attacked me with no context. It feels like everyone is against me and talking about me behind my back. What do I do?

TLDR: I made an online post about how generalizations aren’t helpful to any social movement and should stop, and several women I know somehow thought it was an attack on feminism. Everyone is teamed up against me and idk what to do. ",15Apr2018,3
361,"Today, I went to the store and saw one of my friends from school that I talk to all the time. The normal thing to do in that situation is to say “hello”, right? For some reason,I ran instead. I do this all the time when I see people from school. My parents think I’m crazy and need counseling.. Does anybody have this problem or have any idea on how to fix it? ",15Apr2018,2
362,"So by no stretch of the imagination do I have a bad life. I have a beautiful girlfriend, a good career and I’ve experienced a lot more than I thought I would by 26. My issue is, sometimes I feel like I’m too settled and too content. I kinda wanna shake things up a bit but I find myself backing down due to fear of losing out (mostly financially). 

- Does anyone have any tips on how to fight fear? 
- I want to travel more ( like I used to) but I’m scared of what happens when I come home. 
- I want to pursue a career that I didn’t just fall into. 
- i have a crazy family life and I want to have the guts to cut that part of my life away. 
- How do people make new friends outside of work and school? 

I guess I just want to feel some sort of excitement again and not feel so trapped in my weekday routine. 

Thanks x",15Apr2018,3
363,"I'll start off by saying im a gay male this is important. My friend who is female and I both had a massive thing for the same guy, she asked him out he said yes and told her that he is straight so I therefore give them my blessing as I realise I was kidding myself that I could be with him. A while after this we had a gathering with some friends and the two now flirty friends. During this I got very drunk I flirted with him he put his arm around me and just genuinely acted the way he originally acted to make me think he had a thing for me. After the whole group go upstairs to sleep I get in the double bed as I am clearly the most drunk and they all just put me there my friend who is talking to the guy shares the bed with me. After a while the group of guys who were there went downstairs for food. My friend voices that she wants to kiss the guy tonight and she asks if I will.move beds. I HEAVILY imply that im not okay with that and that would rather they make out somewhere I am not as I have feelings for him still. She retorts back with ""well you are being selfish especially as earlier I let him putting his arm around you and you flirting slide"". This annoyed me. If he is straight flirting shouldn't matter and how is it my fault he put his arm around me. I do move mainly because everyone else there wanted to see the romance. They kiss in the room and she broadcasts it as soon as the boys leave again. Can I be angry about her doing this? Or was I in the wrong? Also I am annoyed at the guy as I heard from another friend that the guy knew I had feelings for him on the day he was asked out. On that day he was so flirty I even kissed him on the cheek and he went with it. Is that not bluntly manipulating my feelings ugh idk.             


TL:DR- Im gay. Girl gets angry with me for not being okay with a her kissing a guy I had feelings for. And calls me selfish for flirting with an apparently straight guy that and gets angry when he puts his arm around me. The guy apparently knew I had feelings for him yet continued to flirt and allow me to flirt with him. Can I be angry at any of this? If so how should I address it? Or am I just being selfish?",15Apr2018,2
364,"Here's the deal, and I'll be very vague in case she happens to use Reddit \(I doubt she does though\).

I'm in love with a girl in my course. She is a very good friend of mine and we talk very often. She has a boyfriend that doesn't live close\-by, and because of that I don't do anything flirtatious and just try to be a good and appropriate friend.

A while ago she said that she will be moving out of her apartment soon, and asked if she could sleep at mine and my roommate's place until she found a new apartment. I happily accepted the offer, and I don't think I regret that choice at all \(there's a chance she'll find a place before that's an issue, so this may not actually happen anyway\).

Now, I'm not worried that I'll act inappropriately. She's a very good friend of mine and I have no interest in doing anything as she's taken. That said, obviously I do have strong feelings for her and I'm worried I won't be too happy with this whole arrangement \(whether I'll be depressed or nervous or anything like that\). I'm not letting it bother me too much, her situation is more important than the worries I have, so I shouldn't let that affect my decision on whether I should be a good friend or not, I'm just worried that I'll be feeling things out of my control, and in that case I don't know what to do about it.

It won't be relevant for a while, but do you have any suggestions?

Edit: Before you ask why she can't sleep at her boyfriend's place, when I say ""not close\-by"", I mean abroad.",15Apr2018,2
366,"Hi. I'm 19 year old male. I currently live with my dad and two siblings in the Chicago suburbs. I have depression (bipolar) and social anxiety. 

I'm currently unemployed and not in school. I did one year of community college but dropped out last august.

My dad said he would pay to send me back to school. But there isnt really anything I want to study. I just wanna be financially independent as soon as possible and I want to get married and have my own family.

I also really dislike my family and dont get along with them. I isolate myself a lot from them in my bedroom.

I was thinking about getting a min wage job here in chicago and saving up like $1500. Then use that money to drive to Arizona. And then find an apartment or place to stay and look for a job. If I can't find a job within a month, then I would drive back to chicago.

The reason I want to go to Arizona is because the rent there is a lot cheaper than the chicago area and also the weather is nicer and I already have some family in Scottsdale. And I would be able to be financially independent. I want to get away from my family and actually be able to accomplish something on my own.

Its very hard to be financially independent in the chicago area. I dont see how I would ever be able to afford rent here and be able to support a family unless I made over like $40k and any job that pays over $40k would require me to go back to college and I really don't want to. 

So is my idea good or bad?

This is seriously affecting my life. I can't poop in peace, I worry about what I eat, and I can't have sex. It's a contributing factor to my depression.

I'm going to see my doctor in a week or two and I have an appointment for a GI doctor in June. But, honestly I'm just so fed up with this fissure. I'm crying right now. And this isn't the only medical problem I have. I have many more. I also have a ton of personal problems.

I was wondering if anyone could identify what these lumps are that have appeared suddenly, or where to direct me to find out.

It’s difficult to see in the photograph, but there are two on my thumb and they are almost entirely translucent, as though they are sitting on top of the skin. 
Hopefully it’s nothing serious, but as I am a bartender and waitress, I frequently touch things other people have touched or drank from and I shake a lot of hands so I prefer to stay on the side of caution. Any advice is welcome, thanks :)",15Apr2018,2
371,"so me and my friend have fallen out because i texted her and she read my texts but she didn’t respond. i texted her many times yet she still read them and didn’t respond. i ask her why she is ignoring me but she just keeps blanking me. so, i obviously get annoyed with her so i spam her a bit (i assume she’s pranking me and she is ignoring me on purpose). she sees my spam but still doesn’t reply, so i get really worried. i tell her i’m worried about her and she yet again opens it and doesn’t reply. 11 hours after she read my texts, she finally responds. she acts as if nothing has happened and i call her out. she says she ‘just wanted a few hours to be by herself’ which i get but could she at least have told me she wanted that, instead of ignoring me and worrying the hell out of me? so we argue about it because she refuses to apologise for worrying me and ignoring me, and she says she’s the one who’s annoyed at me because i spammed her. so i say is that really what’s important right now, and she calls me a hypocrite because in the past i have read her texts but ignored them. and i say i thought we were over this but she says i can’t call her out for ignoring me because i’ve done it in the past, even though we got over it and i gave her a genuine reason for ignoring her


my question is - is she right to call me a hypocrite because i’ve ‘ignored’ her in the past meaning i can’t call her out on something i’ve previously done or am i right to be annoyed at her because she blanked me and didn’t apologise?


tl;dr - i fell out with my friend coz she ignored me. she called me a hypocrite because i’ve ignored her in the past (but we got over that past time). who’s right and who’s wrong)

372,"Only over the last 2 years have I come to realize how much certain looks matter to females. I used to think that If I had a better personality and acted with more confidence that I could overcome this problem to an extent, or at least at the back of my mind I always had that thought. But now I realize that having 'confidence' only gets me rejected and personality just equals a friend or associate. People just say it's my attitude and whatever that stops me, but I know that's not true. It has been like this long before I became how I am now, and it doesn't matter how positive I am for awhile or how I act, I always get the same response from them. People say things like 'just get a haircut' 'lose/gain weight' dress better etc.. I've done all that. I was a fool and thought that clearing up my skin, fixing my hair and buying heaps of new clothes would help but it doesn't. I've come to realize that it's all about face and if guys look ''right'' it doesn't matter what crappy clothes they wear or how awkward/bad/nasty their personality is they can still get people without hardly any effort. I've been trying for years to be able to get with someone I find attractive.. I stupidly tried tinder again after all the other failed times. Swiped on the whole population of my town and 3 other nearby towns and got about 20 something matches and thought ok cool.. then I saw they were all fat. Not a damn normal one. Here's where you probably call me ''shallow'' but I just don't understand what it is I'm missing that makes me unable to attract a single person that isn't overweight. Do girls like all have a collective opinion or something.. that anyone who is in relatively normal/average shape considers them self 2 good for the average guy? I get it.. I'm no male model type.. but those guys are a minority. I just hate myself for this but can't understand why I can't do something that I grew up thinking was normal... This has totally fucked with my head.  Last time I swiped like 2000 and got a couple of overweight people and a couple of fucking trannies.. Girls in public have never looked at me unless it's a scowl or rude gesture. Why do they hate average guys like me so much....   I know it isn't that big of a deal to be alone, but like any problem, if left for years it becomes big. At the end of the year I want to try going about getting cosmetic surgery as a last resort to see if that could help. I just don't want to settle for someone I'm not attracted to. It wouldn't fix a thing and I'd still hate myself for it. Any ideas for how to numb the pain.. ?  Alcohol and antidepressants only cover over the cracks but the problem is still there. Envy is a horrible thing and I don't want to live anymore.. ",15Apr2018,1
373,"I usually don’t ask stuff like this as I tend to solve my own problems but I’m in a bit of a dilemma.

So to cut to the chase, I feel like a co worker who is purely just maternity cover is trying to get me out of the job so that she may have a full time job at the end.

As the senior member of staff in the office I was asked to train this person to which I did on all processes and how it’s been done successfully etc. Things were going well as I never really see myself as above anyone we are one team, bare in mind there are 2 full timers and 2 part timers in my department.

After about 2 weeks I would notice a change in attitude of this co worker, being silent, and not communicating well, I had just thought “maybe they are shy” so as normal continued on. A day later I’m pulled in by my line manager questioning the way I am acting in the office and asking if I have a problem with working with them, and then several other things such as I leave my desk a lot. I had explained that not really and I have no idea what he is on about, and my boss starts naming things that he wouldn’t really know unless he was there, and it had dawned on me that someone has clearly said something. However I brushed this off and carried on, apologised to this person if they thought I was being brash or rude with them. ( Forgot to add I’m a pretty direct person, I see things as black and white no grey areas). They accepted things were normal again.

Suddenly last week, I’m pulled for being late...I had recently moved home so getting used to the bus schedule and leaving earlier than I did at my previous home however buses can’t be helped with traffic. I guess they are used to me coming in 25 mins early all the time.

Anyway my boss starts rattling off certain things that I am apparently doing, excessive phone use, leaving my desk excessive times (I don’t take a lunch so split my hour into 10,6 min smoke breaks) and occasionally I have other duties that my role requires, again my manager then rattled off names of people who have complained who also share the same office space but different department. I asked all later on bar the person who I suspect is trying to get me out of the job about these things and if they complained to which I got a “no we don’t care what you do, you get the job done and do it well” 

I then notice that this co worker was very off with me (they weren’t in earshot of convos with other co workers). Being silent, not communicating with stuff, not wanting my advice baring in mind it was just me and then I’m on my department that day.

So now I’m faced with the dilemma of do I go above my line manager and speak to his line manager about all this, or keep quiet. I’m starting to feel like this person sees a target on my back, and that I maybe forced out of my job. Am I being paranoid?

I do apologise for the long post, I can’t sleep and it’s 00:18 here.

We started dating in July and in October I cheated on her. I said to some other girl that I wanted to be with her and my girlfriend found out last night. I don’t know what to do. 

Obviously I love my girlfriend with all of my heart and it kills me that I’ve done this to her and I want to die. She said to me tonight that she thinks we might need to go on a break and I don’t know what I’d do without her.

She will constantly remind me by coming into my room and calling me names. Out of nowhere she'll confront me and say ""Wow, you are so f****** stupid. I'm so embarrassed to know you and I'm disgusted that my brother is such a failure"". This happens every 4 hours out of nowhere. It gets worse, she beats me up constantly. She will grab things in my room and hits me with them until she gets bored. Today she came up to me and said. ""HOLY S*** YOUR LIPS ARE SO STUPID LOOKING!"" I ignored her and then she said ""YOU LOOK AT ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU"". She took my Nintendo Switch and threw it at the wall and really damaged it. She tossed me on the ground and chanted ""stupid lips"" as she slammed my head on the floor. The worst thing she does to me is when she will record my terrible panic attacks and posts them to snapchat where a lot of my friends see them. People take me as a psychopath because of my anxiety disorder. I don't do anything wrong. My mom doesn't believe me even though I have marks from the beating. My dad threatens to take her phone but never does it. My therapist is like ""I have two kids this is normal."" The thing that pisses me off most is that I have such an amazing and beautiful friend that my sister and her friends harass solely because she's my friend.

384,"I (24) went to the bar with a mate. About 6 local/feral kids (19-20 year olds) steal my mate's phone as he's texting outside the bar. He's in shock and looking at his empty hands, they come back after 20 secs and ask for his wallet and he proceeds to put his hands in his pocket to give them his wallet; they aren't armed just 3 of the 6-8.

I run after them to get my mates phone back. All (3) of them run but one guy. He turns around and puts his hands up so I put my hands up quick and strike him weakly to scare him off and miss. We dance for a while till he lands a few punches and I punch his chest and it doesn't effect him. I keep going because i'm in too deep and if I back down he'll chase me till he's had his fill.

Now 3 kids join the guy who didn't run from me. Now it's 4vs1 me because they're getting confident after he lands a few punches to my face. Suddenly they all start running (idk) and I chase after them because my ego wants to get them back for being hit physical (to get even), which was idiotic of me.

There are more in numbers about 6 so I slowly walk backwards. An old man about 60 years old runs at them with his long beer glass and they all run away. People at the bar come outside and tell me not to chase them anymore because they may be armed etc. and start telling me what happened when a friend of theirs chased x y z...anecdotes)

I walk inside and buy the old man a beer and go home to meditate and log it in my journal which I will rip out and burn after. My mate is angry at me for not getting his phone back. Glad he can't text me to tell me how frustrated he is.

Now I have PTSD from trauma and abuse etc. Been stabbed, armed robbery, knocked out a few times. What I did was idiotic but It was impulsive. I wasn't thinking straight. It was pure instinct. Cancer was the cherry on top to give me an IDGAF attitude. But was very stupid in this sense.

I know I will physically heal (few bleeds) from this but mentally, I'm full of regret for trying to help my friend and not being able to defend myself. I went home to my parents expecting some ""validation"" or some counselling, but they said ""okay"" after I told them what happened and told me they had to go do something upstairs.

That's why I wrote it down in my journal. To say what happened, how it made me feel and a letter to myself counselling myself with gratitude included. But I still feel emotions like rage, shock, regret and pain.

Which i'm having trouble disposing. I've tried shadow boxing to remove the negative emotions but it won't help.

Is there a way of releasing these emotions w/o holding all my emotions inside? I used to hold them in and explode when it was built up.",15Apr2018,0
