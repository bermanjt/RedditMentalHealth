0,"Yeah I know I’m not going to have all of my plans go the way I want but I just really need some answers. 
So I’m now officially a senior in high school and I’m getting good work for this summer. My best friend moved last summer and she plans on living in South Carolina after graduation for college. She said she won’t be living on campus and would love to have me stay there with her, so we can be together and to help get a nice flat. 
First, I need to build credit. Any ideas on how to start? I heard about adding my name to a bill in my parents house (cable, internet, etc).
Second, what should I prepare for when moving out? And how? 
Third, what about security? What’s something to keep us safe in an apartment, thats not just a taser/mace? 
Fourth, budgeting for food, needs, wants, savings? how do I open a bank account and start saving for an actual house? Or saving for anything? 
And finally, taxes. Just.... wtf????? 
I’ve googled a lot of this and it’s just come up frustrating and confusing. I’ll take anything you’ve got. Thanks xx",02Jun2018,1
2,"This might be a long post so sorry. But I need some objective opinions. Trying to keep things a short as possible.

I got pretty fucked up last weekend and 'embarrassed' myself, I don't feel embarrassed but aparently my 'friend' think I should. I got really pissed off that this and its like the past couple months of keeping shit in just came out in a text. I basically told them to fuck off, said we were never friends and that they only speak to me to chat shit about other people, and be their safety net for when they fall out with everyone else.

Here's a small list of the stuff I'm talking about: not letting me speak,
only talking to me about other people, 
not asking me if I'm okay when I was clearly in a mood/ not even speaking to me when I was in a mood,
If I try to speak half the time she pretends not to hear me and the other half couldn't try to sound less interested,
Expect to listen to every tiny problem she has
Expect to listen to every boy she shagged when it clearly makes me uncomfortable.

Its been going on for months but I've ignored it, didn't want to cause any drama.

After I sent the message she saved it in chat and never replied. The next day, she sent a message asking for money which I didn't owe her. I told her I didn't owe her anything, but I payed her back anyway, it was only £5 and so I definately owed her absolutely nothing. Didn't get a thank you or anything after I sent the message, oh but when I walked into the kitchen and she was there she did say ""you don't have to be such a dick about it"" we got into an argument I said ""just the fact you haven't even tried speaking to me or anything just shows you don't fucking care"" and all she had to say was ""did you really expect me to reply to THAT message"". She walked off, and I went for a walk and had a small breakdown.

We haven't spoke at all since, if I'm in the kitchen she hides in the toilet until I leave, Nd if she's in the kitchen I just get what I came down for and leave.

The thing is part of me really doesn't care, like she's proved my point. But another part of me can't stop thinking I fucked it all up, like I don't know if we ever were close, but to me at least I considered her one of my closest friends at uni. Today I was completely fine, couldn't care less, and then I found an old Polaroid of us two and it's like I have fucked it up, if I just kept quiet and didn't say anything we probably would still be talking. Ive cried so much over this and had a anxiety attack just from being in the same room with her for 5 minutes. But I don't know if I should say sorry, I'm always saying sorry. I was in a pretty depressed mood a couple weeks back, and I had to say sorry to her because she thought I was upset with her.

5,"Hey guys,

So heres the situation:

I have a roommate that has been staying at my house for 8 months. Honestly, shes been great. However, this last week she let me know that her friend from cali was visiting and she was going to be staying at my place. Its my house for those wondering.

Anyways, the lease agreement that she signed states that people cant stay over for consecutive days and no more than 7 days a month.

When I reminded her of the agreement, she stated that she didnt think this was a big deal but that if that was the case, she was putting in her 30 day notice.

Im surprised that she first signed the agreement knowing the rules, but then reacted like this.

ALl in all, do you guys think my rules are too strict?

My other rules include absolutely no smoking and drinking and also no pets roaming around the common areas.

How strict are my rules?",02Jun2018,1
6,"I thought I graduated high school in 2009  like everyone one else but I guess not?

I was never told that the diploma i was given was different. 

I’ve tried to get my GED but it’s been extremely slow and frustrating. I’ve never been any good at academic stuff. And a lot of the stuff I’m going over for the first time.

7,"(not quite sure this is the right place to ask this; if you know other places to do so, please suggest them)

I am an editor for a student run philosophy magazine with a distribution of about 500. We aim to run high quality articles from academic philosophers and some student written ones.

This year we accepted a 1st year student on the editorial staff. So far he's done a fairly decent job and has shown some promise. Until he submitted this review he was going to do. Now, the review itself is quite bad -- it's basically just a summary with a bit of high praise at the end -- but what is really worrying, is that the book it's on is fairly straightforwardly fascist (and also just really bad it looks like) and that he just presents it as . It creates this grand narrative of traditional European culture being purposefully replaced by a modernist one, and that Jewish, socialist, and masonic conspiracies actively work towards this goal. I don't want to go into too much detail, but it is both pretty damn fascist and pretty far out there; drawing on esoterism, apocalyptic language and imagery, and numerology to name a few.

So, we're struggling a bit on how to approach this. Obviously we're not going to print it, and we will most likely throw him off the board. But, we really want to handle this correctly. Mainly making sure that we can have a dialogue on it with him, hear his story, and hopefully create the first steps in helping him move away from this awfully bad thinking (in multiple ways). Does anyone have any suggestions on how to talk to him? We are not sure how deep he is into this kind of stuff, but he ended the review saying that he hopes everyone will read ""so that they may be enlightened""...

Edit: I also really don't want him to think this is just another example of leftist academia censoring the right. Apart from it being fascist -- which in itself might be a very legitimate reason not to publish it -- it is also just very bad, and has very little to do with academic philosophy.",02Jun2018,1

9,"This will be taken down shortly after it goes up, because my wife occasionally checks my Reddit, and I don't want to make a throwaway.

So, my wife (24) isn't a big woman, by any means. She's 5'2, and I think at her heaviest she weighed maybe 150, and that's after 2 kids (but it didn't show at all). Well, a few weeks ago, she weighed herself, and told me she was 143. After that, she started slowing down her eating: only eating once a day, being *very* picky about what she eats. Two weeks ago, she basically stopped eating. No breakfast, no lunch, no dinner, only has 1 coffee for the entire day. I've physically seen her eat once in the last two weeks, and she said a co-worker bought her a salad yesterday, and thats it. The other day we made ""homemade""  cold cut subs, and she was barely picking slivers of lettuce off, and when I asked why, she blew up and refused to eat. Shes lost enough weight that a co-worker, who sees her everyday, commented on how much weight she's losing (approx. 10-15 lbs in 2 weeks).

She says when she takes her Zoloft, the thought of food sickens her, but she's been taking Zoloft for about 2 months now, and this is a recent issue. Am I just being paranoid about this, or am I justified?",02Jun2018,1

Once we find something I'll move up there, have a bit of money to live off for a month and during that month find a job so I can continue living.

My Mom tried to take her phone and she resisted, then hit her. When she was walking away she also hit one of out two dogs. She will never take responsibility for anything, she sometimes steals from us and is not modest about being a complete slob. I know I had my problems at that age but the abuse she’s deals out when my Dad is gone cannot be understated. She fears the repercussions, which my Dad will not shy away from. It often just brings my Mom to tears, and she is afraid of her I think and very sad. Anyways, any advice would be good.",02Jun2018,2
14,"Hi everyone. I basically made a reddit account so I could feel as though I could reach out to someone. I feel isolated by my situation. When I was 15 I started going to a psychiatrist for help with my anxiety. Long story short somehow the clinic's computer system malfunctioned  and released my information to my parents. And that ladies and gentlemen is how I was outed as a lesbian to my conservative Christian parents. My parents mostly ignored my sexuality. They told me not to tell the rest of my family \(which in hind\-site is wise. Some of my family members would not hesitate cutting me off\) They didn't want to address me as I was. So, ever since there has been a barrier between us that wasn't there before. It was a barrier that I could live with however. But now I have a girlfriend. The sweetest most amazing girl I could ever hope for. She is nerdy, hot, and is a huge romantic sap like I am. The only problem is that she is trans. This isn't a problem for me but I am terrified of losing my family entirely. I don't want to burden her with this so I keep this fear to myself. I have told my friends about my girlfriend too. I never told them that she is trans because I can just picture their doubts. The thoughts of how I am not really a lesbian, just some girl looking for attention. Which after all I have been through just to be myself would be crushing to me. Even if I do tell them now, I am sure that they will think that I was misleading them and no longer trust me. So as you can see, I have essentially isolated myself. I have no one to talk to. Is there anyone out there with any advice as to how I can tell my parents, friends, etc about my girlfriend? Are there any ways I can feel less alone? LGBT groups wont work. I am home for the summer and my parents wont let me drive. I think just typing this all out has made me feel a bit better.

15,"So I'm a student, and I'm part of a study association, which basically means we all have the same major and meet op every Monday at a bar. I do consider this group my friends, even though I only see them on those mondays and in class. But they all have little groups of friends which I'm not a part of. They all spend time going out, watching movies, chilling etc., but no one has ever invited me for something like that. I'd feel weird if I asked someone if they were doing anything, it seems like everyone knows what's happening but me. If there's a party, I'm never invited to the pre party, and I have to go alone. All the groups also go out together and I'm never invited. Today was the day after final exams, and I'm about to go to sleep, check Snapchat and see everyone dancing and laughing together and I feel absolutely horrible, lonely and left out.

I realize this is both petty and childish, and I shouldn't feel this bad over it but it just feels like they all have something against me, as if whenever they meet up, they always laugh at me and make fun of me.

16,"So prom is soon and I’m feeling extremely nervous about it. The main reason is because of my date. I originally intended for him to only be a “picture date” not an actual one and it’s been seriously stressing me out and is beginning to suck the fun out of prom. I know that he does like me but I really don’t want to date anyone. I’ve been rebuilding myself for the past year (recovering from an eating disorder and a not so great past relationship) and am feeling good being single right now.

People in my prom group have been adding pressure on this whole situation telling me to slow dance with the guy and act like I’m interested which is really pissing me off. Especially the slow dance thing. Is there any way I could kindly reject his slow dance offer if her asks?

19," To clarify, I already posted this to r/confession to get it off my chest but I'm posting here as well to receive advice because that's against their rules. This isn't just me posting in 2 different places for 2x the karma.

So, context time. I am in high school, and I have a girlfriend who I have been dating for about 7 and a half months. I care about her a lot but recently I haven't been as excited to talk to her and have been happier when I'm with others. I don't see her very often because she goes to a different school. I don't want to cheat on her, because I don't want to hurt her. I did think about breaking up with her once, but that's a story for a potential later post or a followup or something. 

At the school I go to, I have an unusual \(at least I think so\) amount of female friends, to the point where I'd say my friends are about 50/50 split between the genders.  We're doing exams right now in school, and today I had an exam\-length \(3 hours\) period for gym class. So, we ran the pacer test for about 5 minutes and then sat around for the rest of the day. 

I started out sitting with my male friends, but I wanted to go over to talk to two of my female friends. There was another guy with them that I don't know well enough to talk to, though, so I stayed with my guy friends for a while. We were playing 20 questions for about 15 minutes and eventually I got fed up with one of my friends for his object being ""hermit crab"" after telling us that his object a\) was not a crab and b\) had 4 or less legs \(hermit crabs have 10\). I used this as an excuse to leave and I went over to the two girls in the class that I had wanted to talk to beforehand. The guy who was with them had left school early along with a lot of other people, so the class was a lot smaller than usual.

So I sat down with them and we talked about some things for a while, and it got to the topic of bad pickup lines.  We told bad pickup lines to each other for a while. One of the girls \(the one who is not the subject of the story, for easiness's sake we'll call her A\) left and so it was just me and the other girl, who I'll call B. B and I were in the corner by ourselves and telling each other bad pickup lines, which to be honest made me happy, even though a\) I knew that they were just being said and b\) I have a girlfriend. Now, I'll be the first to say on this post that I have a little bit of a crush on B despite the fact that I'm not single and as far as I know she's not interested in me. 

After this happened for a bit A returned to us and we changed topics to Buzzfeed quizzes, which we took as a group \(i. e., we would all pick an option and then decide based on majority rule or an answer choice that was in between all three\). While A was there, B patted me on the shoulder a few times as part of a joke. After a while A left again with the goal of sneaking out and leaving school, so B and I were once again alone for a bit. 

While this was happening we were reading off my phone, and I was holding it in front of us and she got kinda close to me, as in like our legs were touching and her shoulder was up against mine, etc. I thought that maybe she was doing it to flirt or something \(as we had a short conversation about flirting earlier and she had said that she sometimes accidentally\-on\-purpose flirted with people and talked about that a bit\) but I feel like that might just be wishful thinking on my part, however bad it is to have wishful thinking about being flirted with by someone else when you have a girlfriend.  When A returned, B was still close to me and we stayed close for a little bit but after a little bit B took my phone and held it in front of her instead. From there until the end of the day we proceeded as friends normally would and as we normally would, taking quizzes and stuff, and minimal physical contact between B and I occurred \(other than the occasional bumping feet, etc.\).

TL;DR \(although if you are gonna give me advice I'd prefer you to read the whole thing for full context\): After hanging out for a bit with a female friend, she got close to me to look at something on my phone. It could be wishful thinking but it seemed a little flirty. However I have a girlfriend, although lately I'm not as excited about that as I used to be. I liked having this other girl close to me though and I was a little hopeful thinking about this other girl possibly flirting with me.

What do I do, guys? Some part of me hopes that the other girl is into me and was flirting with me, but the other part regrets feeling this way, and I don't want to hurt my girlfriend. Should I break up with my girlfriend? Should I wait for a while to find out the other girl's intention and decide from there? I'm very conflicted and advice on how to proceed would be very appreciated.

Also, I forgot a little bit of this story and if I remember it later I'll edit this post.",02Jun2018,0

21,"I've never been here before but I need advice on some family problems. Some of this is very personal but I know you need the full story. Please don't judge me. 

I am an 18 year old female and about to graduate high school and go to college far away. My parents have always been very controlling and don't really believe in me. This largely stems from my mental health issues. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I have a history with self harm and attempted suicide a few times in middle school. However, I have been doing very well recently. I haven't self harmed since right before 9th grade with one exception in 10th grade. However, they still are afraid of something happening again, which is reasonable. But they take it to extremes. They view me as a porcelain doll that will break under the smallest amount of stress. They constantly try to control me in many ways. One way they've done this is not letting me take a full course load in 10th or 11th grade. I was already credit deficient due to auditing the last quarter of 9th grade to be treated for an eating disorder I'd had since 6th grade but was just diagnosed in 9th grade. Because of this, I had a lot to do senior year. I had to pass a full course load and take extra classes. This has been very stressful, especially as the end of the year approaches, and my parents have only made it work. They tried to micromanage me and we had fights, sometimes to screaming, almost every night. This made home a **VERY** stressful environment and I couldn't work well. The last fight happened at the same time as me having massive problems with a teacher bullying me and being overall awful. The morning after the fight, my school counselor, who I get along well with, started digging into me over going to the principal about an unethical request from her and another teacher, upsetting me even more. A bit later, the problem teacher went off on me and said, among other things, that she wouldn't interact with me anymore and that I'm a whiny brat. At this point, I couldn't take it anymore. I left school  to kill myself. After being unable to run into the busy intersection by my school, I went to a train station nearby. Again, I couldn't take the steps. My fiancé and future mother in law (FMIL) picked me up there. Since then, I've been staying with them so I'm in a less stressful environment and able to get the work done that I need to to graduate. The plan was to go back to my parents after I graduate. However, as my FMIL talked with my family, she realized what a terrible environment I was in. After talking with her husband, they offered to let me stay with them until it's time to leave for college. I'll admit, I was tempted. But I wasn't considering it. I don't want to give up on a relationship with my parents. But today they told my FMIL that they don't think I should make my own choices. They also told her I have Aspergers. I don't. I was tested for it in 10th grade but it was decided that I don't. Despite this, apparently it's contributed to how they treat me. It's now apparent to me that they don't see me as an adult or even my own person. They are so stuck on my past they refuse to see how I've grown and changed. They have no trust or faith in me whatsoever. To them, I'm just a helpless doll that has to be protected at all costs. I've been living like that for years and have always held out hope I could prove otherwise to them. I see now that any change in that view isn't coming anytime soon, if at all. I don't want to go back to living like that. I was miserable! With my fiancé and his family, I'm supported, trusted, safe, and I feel loved. I'm happy here. After I realized things won't change with my parents and exactly how bad things are, I'm strongly considering packing the rest of my things and taking my fiancé's family up on their uoffer to stay with them. But I'd like some outside input so I'm here. Should I get out of a terrible situation where I can't be my own person, or go back my parents just because they're my parents? Any input and advice would be great. Thank you.

It was a great 4 hours. The next day, I felt that I needed to tell her I liked her, but I just couldn't, so I made a big mistake. I asked her if she wanted to instigate anything the day before and said I just wanted to be friends. I don't know why the fuck that was the decision I made, but it was. She said no, and a lot of the conversation after was me kind of back peddling, but I ended up looking like more and more of a douchebag as I went along. Later, after the argument was over, I texted her, 1 day later, no response. I then texted her, in my opinion, a very sweet apology, and now, 24 hours later, no response.

26,"We've been on 3 dates. We've been texting for way longer than that (consistently since late February) so we've built some rapport in that regard. However I feel that he is confused, as am I. I have been really into him up until a few days ago and I don't like what it's doing to me emotionally. I would like to either progress or detach and progress. I am looking for a relationship and don't want to be stuck in limbo like this. 

Initially I was slightly infatuated with him due to all the texting building up my expectations prior to meeting. His own actions have been inconsistent and before the 3rd date he even asked if I wanted to meet his family for a family event, despite his own prior claims that he wanted to take dating slow. I ended up dodging the question and he admitted on our date that it was too soon for that. After the 3rd date, however, it kinda hit me a few days later that I just don't know if I actually like all of him. 

As of now I feel that I care about him but all we do is text a lot every day and it's draining me. I saw him last weekend for our 3rd date and I've no idea if he wants to meet this weekend, but I feel that at this point his lack of initiative is hurting my ego and destroying my fantasies more rather than a real potential relationship as I just don't feel that magic anymore. It is turning into a virtual relationship and that's just a big no no for me. 

 If we end up meeting I will take the time to observe his actions and how I feel. Then what... I am not the type to ask him out especially now that I am feeling unsure.

I’m tired of being rejected, tired of being either too respected to touch or not respected enough. I’m sick of being seen as sweet and innocent.

It goes as far as, since they both fell like victims in every thing, though their trauma in the past was justifiable but do not live it anymore, they use each other to get ideas as to how to get away from responsibility. Neither want to get jobs or even a driver's license and when I ask them why it is never the same excuse, if they give  me one. It has gotten to the point that these two share the same idea that the ones to blame for their problems are myself and my mother, so they cut us off as ""toxic people"" and avoid all contact, even not leaving their rooms at all in order to avoid even seeing us. We do not do anything to them, I admit I was a POS when I was younger but am actually under control now and did not even raise my voice at them in years.  I am in my room most of the time I am at home and even being seen is an offense to them. They lie to their therapists, I actually got word from my mother that one said I break into their room and yell at them, an outright lie, she even goes as far as trying to turn everyone against me because I don't do what she wants and don't fall for the victim games, even called the police saying I threatened them and had to explain why it didn't happen.

40,"I have been working in retail since November after taking a break from my degree due to depression. Retail has depressed me so much and I finally got the courage to hand in my notice last Sunday, however, depression makes me indecisive so I started to regret handing it in and on Wednesday sent an email asking to rescind it. I later regretted sending that email. Today I agreed to stay and now regret that after having another shit shift and realising that I am miserable there. Obviously I can’t change my mind again without looking like a douche and getting a bad reference so my plan is to call in sick Saturday and email the following Sunday and come clean:

Dear ?,

I'm not going to be at work again today. The truth is that I'm suffering from depression and working in retail is really not helping. The things we spoke about on Friday were contributing factors to me wanting to leave but this is the main reason.

I dread coming into work every morning but put on an act to get through the day. Towards the end of my shift I am happy as I am about to go home so I always end the day thinking ""this isn't so bad."" This attitude is what has kept me going this long and I need to acknowledge the fact that throughout the day I am miserable. On Friday, I finally realised that after my chance to escape retail appeared to have gone.

I have tried to rationalise it and make it work hence my suggestion of moving to MDA but in reality this will not work. I'm an introvert and social interactions drain me. I thought retail may help with this and was one of the reasons I applied for the job but it has had the opposite effect. I've not wanted to say anything as it is embarrassing and I am a very private person, however, it is not fair for me to keep messing you around.

Please keep this between me and you as I have always been more comfortable speaking to you about things than other managers.

46,"I’m 22 living in Florida. 

My wife has a friend she made in college. My wife always showed an interest in these witchcraft things, and this friend would always encourage it. They only hung out like once a month, then it became more frequent, and now it’s an almost every day thing. One morning, I caught my wife trying to throw out all her possessions claiming she wasn’t human anymore and had to go. I calmed her down, discussed that I wanted her to stop smoking weed, drinking, and to stop talking to this girl, at least for a while. She had a problem before, was clean for three years then picked it back up again. It was casual, until it wasn’t anymore. 

So that morning she agreed and she left for work, told me she loved me and kissed me. Only she never went to work. She went straight to that girls house. She stopped communicating with everyone besides this girl. Only stating that she was fine, she was fine. 

I finally convinced her to see me so I drove 45 minutes there. We talked and she said that she loved me, and that she didn’t want to do it, but something (or someone) was telling her that she had to leave me as she required someone as “spiritual” as her. She kept saying that I was perfect for her, in every way, but that she still had to have someone else. She seemed to be arguing with herself internally. This is her friend giving her this advice. When I saw her, she still looked to be manic, breaking into tears over anything. She kept explaining that she didn’t want to be with anyone else but me, and didn’t feel like she should, but that she absolutely had to. She explained all the stress she had from working, to which I told her that she didn’t have to work, that I would just work and she could relax at home. At this point, her friend started moderating our conversation, reiterating that this is my wife’s home now. 

I feel like her friend is manipulating her while she’s having a mental breakdown. Additionally, she made my wife park her car elsewhere, and then drove my wife to her house, meaning that her friend is her only way out. This was the biggest red flag for me. 

I convinced her to come see me sometime next week, and she promised me at least that much. 

I don’t know what to do. Her family keeps telling me to just drag her out of there, but I’m not sure I can. 

What do I do? What rights do I have as her husband?

52,"Little background info: Im a first year uni student who recently moved out of home. I wanted to embrace uni life so joined the Drama club. Whilst there I met a girl, let’s call her Trish. Over the space of about 2 months we both auditioned and made it into the first semester production. In this time we were seeing each other 4 times a week for over 3hrs for rehearsals. Our relationship began as friends but slowly over time I began to realise I was getting feelings for her. I’ve never met a girl I’ve gotten on with like her before. We are always having fun and get on better than anyone else I have before. Over the course of the 2 months we began spending time outside of rehearsals together for example she would always offer to pick me up because we have super fun car rides or we would share our meals together sitting in her car before a rehearsal. We were also begging to do things together that to me didn’t seem like normal friend things to do like pretty much share every meal/ food we have together (I mean like every bit of food, we’d even like put the food in eachother a mouths). In my head it feels like that flirty dynamic super similar to Jim and Pam in season 1 and 2 of the Office. By the time opening night came around, I’d pretty much fallen for this girl, she was my best friend in the cast and we would always be around each other because we had an amazing time together. On opening night however after the show, none of my family was there so I go to find her and congratulate her. I open a door and see her kissing a guy, I quickly close the door and pretty much just leave. Skip forward 2 weeks in this time we continue chatting and bonding like nothing happened. At the wrap party, things got interesting, again we pretty much spent the whole night together as we just always have fun, however there was a thought lingering around that this would probably be the last time we keep seeing each other regularly. We’re playing pool together at the party, I’m making her laugh and then all of a sudden she starts crying and I ask why but she won’t answer, refuses to say why. Skip forward a bit and the nights mellowing down and she goes off and sits on a bean bag and asks me to come lie on it with her. We start flirting and joking around together when all of a sudden she puts here leg against mine and then starts kinda getting close. I’m kinda confused at this point and we look at each other in the eye for a good 5sec. Later that night everyone has left and it’s just me and her waiting for her to be picked up. We are getting emotional and starting to cry a little, neither of us saying why, until her mum finally gets there and we head outside. Outside as we’re about to head our separate ways she says give me a hug and we do for about 2min just kinda crying on each other. She asked why are you crying and all I can muster out is “because I really like you” she hugs me tighter and then we leave both going out separate ways.

We keep chatting and texting online for the next few days until she pops up saying “Hey my Bdays coming up who should I invite” I read my phone late and she had already made the group on Facebook and in it was the guy she kissed on opening night. I work up the courage to ask hey so is this guy like your bf I’ve always kinda wondered, and she replied “He’s not officially my man but he is my man I guess??? Weird hahaha.” At this point I’m feeling super kicked in guts and just end the convo. And there we are, all caught up. 

I’ve done some thinking and in my mind I think she’s confused and conflicted because she has this other guy but also has feelings for me. 

I really want to tell her how I feel however don’t won’t to ruin/ make anything awkward considering I’m going to her party in 2 weeks and the other guy is too. 

Questions that keep going through my head are: Should I tell her how I really feel? Did I misunderstand our friendship? (Surely not, there were too many moment I haven’t even mentioned that are an obvious spark) How do I act around her now? 

Also tomorrow I’m going to brunch with her and one other of our friends. How should I act? What should I do/ say?

So I have been working as a kennel technician for about 6 months now. Primarily through my school year. When I first got my job, I told my boss that I am unable to work on Wednesday’s due to practice for an academic competition team. 

She does schedules on the last day of every month for the new month and I am scheduled for 3 different Wednesday’s. Due to not working, this is when I schedule all of my extra “life-required” events as well. On the 6th I have a dentist appointment, the 13th my friend is in town, and on the 20th I have an MRE scheduled at the children’s hospital that is out of town. On these Wednesday’s, I also practice for my team. It’s a year-round event. 

I am under the impression my boss thinks I only couldn’t do Wednesday’s during the school year, but I can’t do them any time of the year. 

It’s just not possible for me to miss these appointments.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can approach this issue with my boss? It wouldn’t be a big deal, but she is very picky about having “absence notices” at least a month in advance.

Don't you know this ""respecting woman"" thing is a meme? Woman are interested in three things looks, money, and sex. Literally nothing else \(maybe some are interested in drugs\)!! They have no respect for you. Please just come to reality dude. Stop living your life like a white knight neckbeard soyboy.

&gt;**Finally, I must admit that you might be right that I would end up a lifelong virgin.** But I will not let that realization derail my ambitions.

Yesterday, my parents left for a date night and it was only me and her at the house. When they left, I asked my sister if she wanted to do something together like a movie or whatever. She said she wanted me.

She asked if we wanted to bang and of course I said yes since I love little girls so much (I’m 22). After that, we began to kiss and then we had some fun together.

I had sex with her for the whole night and the next day I realized that I didn’t pull out. I told her about it and then she said that abortion is always a option and there’s nothing to panic over. After that, we will keep this a secret until she gets a noticeable bulge on her stomach.

The excuse will be that she had sex with another boy and that’s why she’s pregnant and that I didn’t get her pregnant. This entire plan is foolproof and the best thing about it is that I can still have sex with her no matter what since she can only carry 1 baby at a time.

I’m at an important turning point in my life. I’ve just finished high school and now I’m being thrust into the “real world.”

My plan for what to do after high school went through multiple renditions over my senior year. At first I didn’t want to go to college. I’m going into filmmaking/video editing and I didn’t see why I needed an expensive degree when I could learn everything I needed to know myself. I’ve heard this echoed by others in this field, the only upside seems to be that more career opportunities present themselves in college. 

But my parents were 100% NOT on board with this. I can see their perspective, and I didn’t want to disappoint them. Everyone else seems to have the same attitude, that if you’re not going to college you’re destined for failure. And what would my options be if I didn’t go?

The job I currently have (in the restaurant industry) pays just above minimum wage, so I have no idea how I would move out if college was out of the picture. I’m toying with starting freelance video editing, and I have a certification for an editing software (Adobe Premiere Pro ACA) that could be useful here, as well as multiple projects I’ve worked on for a portfolio. Although I’d be working cheap at first because I’m so inexperienced. 

But again, I’d be without my parents help. My dad owns the car I use so he wouldn’t give the ownership to me. I’d be stuck if I didn’t agree to their wishes. I feel like there must be something I can do to get out of this, but I know I’d be disappointing so many people. 

So I played the college application game and got into 2 colleges. For the one I chose, the full cost would be somewhere around 80,000$. The thought of that makes me sick. If I work all summer like I plan to, all of that will just be drained into a degree that’s not entirely necessary. 

There’s this little part of me that just wants to say fuck it, save up for a cheap used car over the summer, drive out somewhere like New York City or L.A. and get a part time job while I try to jumpstart my career in film, and live in the cheapest apartment I can find. But that would be uprooting everything I know, might possibly destroy all relationships I have. My parents are so excited about me starting college. They bought me an expensive (1,000$) laptop to help out and want to help pay my tuition. If I didn’t go (and even if I do) I will definitely pay them that 1k back. But even though rejecting college scares me that fear makes me want to do it more. 

I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. I feel like conforming to what everyone else wants is a huge mistake. I know I have ambition and drive but it’s not for school. And I don’t want to start my adult life in debt, that sound so sad to me. What should I do Reddit? 

Tl;dr: I’m set for college by the end of the summer but I’m only going to make my family happy. What I really want to do is go out and try to make it on my own in the film/video editing field. I don’t know if that would be completely stupid or if I should take a chance. ",02Jun2018,1
72,"Good evening/day, reddit.

&amp;nbsp;

I really don't even know where to start. I have got to get this off my chest some how, and maybe I can find some guidance here...

&amp;nbsp;



I've been married to my wife for a little over 2 years now (been together for 8 years) and I've always supported and loved her through everything. I don't want to change that now. But I truly feel like her struggles are mine, and my chest hurts when I'm home with her and my step daughter..

&amp;nbsp;



It all feels like it stems from a lack of stability from her not having a driver's license. We live in the US and where we live there is no reliable transportation. She has hang-ups about driving from a past abusive relationship where she was banned from driving, but we are slowly working through that.

&amp;nbsp;



When I get home from work, I feel like I have to walk on egg shells around her and her daughter, and be a mediator so they don't scream at each other and fight like cats and dogs. I care deeply about both of them and can't stand to see them like this.. I feel like it's slowly getting better? but it seems like it just might never.

&amp;nbsp;

Some of her stress comes from not having money, and she wants to do more for her daughter, but no way to get anywhere and no money to afford an uber by the end of the month. My job requires I work about 50 hours per week. 10 to 8 most days, and my days off are usually during the week. I also drive my step daughter to school in the morning, getting up around 7am so by the end of the day I really just want to decompress. But i feel like I can't relax because a screaming fight could break out at any moment.. I will sometimes get a call when I'm at work about how the daughter has done this-thing or that-bad-thing, or has this-bad-attitude. And while I try to be fair and balanced, and let the daughter know she's being disrespectful and snappy, I feel I have to remind my wife to not shout back to avoid escalating the situation.

&amp;nbsp;



I just now see her sitting on the couch with mom though and everything is ok.... Is this normal for teenage years? Am I the one that is overly stressing too much and maybe I need to talk to a psychologist about my stress levels? I feel like I would rather be at work and just not come home some nights, and I hate feeling like this. Maybe a family therapy session? 

&amp;nbsp;


I just don't know... Anytime someone brings up therapy to my step daughter, she gets aggressively defensive and borderline offended about bringing it up

&amp;nbsp;


And for some strange reason, she and I get along fantastically. She will tell me about silly shows or vine compilations she's watching, and I'll engage and laugh/ask questions. I encourage my wife to do the same but she says ""I just... can't. I can't get into it. It's not funny or interesting to me"" ""But it is to HER.. it would help if you acknowledge what she likes, I think"" I respond.

&amp;nbsp;

My wife has also gotten into the habit of binge-watching shows till the early morning, and I feel this off-sleep-cycle isn't helping her. She insists that it's because she can't sleep because of this-pain or that-pain, or because insomnia, but I'm convinced if she simply weren't staring at a bright screen, she would sleep eventually



&amp;nbsp;

My wife seems all too ready to lament her problems, and I see the two of them getting into ""i have it worse"" contests. And anytime my wife offers solutions for her daughter's problems, her daughter just seems to shoot down any ideas, and that hurts her mother.

&amp;nbsp;


Ugh sorry, this is more to unpack than I realized... maybe I should just try and find a licensed therapist, but I don't even know where to start looking for one of those.

&amp;nbsp;

If you made it this far, thank you. And I appreciate any advice. I'm fully open to the problem just being me, and I honestly hope that's the case, as it's easier to fix me than fix someone else. (not saying that they need to be ""fixed."" Just trying to get all my thoughts out)

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you.",02Jun2018,1

He lives in a urban area, so his friends are close and there's so much to do. Me, on the other hand, live in a rural area, and I have no friends within 35 miles. He's always having so much fun, and although I'm happy for him, I'm stuck in a strict, religious household, just hearing from him for a couple minutes would make my day. And although I told him this nothing has changed. In the morning, he goes to work 6am-4pm, and I work 2pm-10pm. So there's no time during the day really to talk.

75,"NOTE: I am a teenager male

So I was playing a game with 3 friends and we met one nice British boy.  He said he was about my age and we became friendly once each other.  I invited him to a discord server of just me and 2 friends.  After a long period of talking Freddy (made up name of British kid), asks for pics of our faces to match up our voices to how we look.

Every face was posted but mine, then I posted mine on the server.  A couple hrs later my dad bursts into my room angry about posting a picture of my face with a stranger, afraid he may have a voice modulator or something.  

Now, me myself believe this by is genuine, considering how he showed me one of his friends to talk to, and is a pretty laid back guy.  Also, my 2 Bros don’t suspect anything wrong with him.

I immediately deleted all photos of myself when my dad told me I could get tracked down with it.  

I feel he is going to tell me to stop interacting with this boy, but he is a cool guy, and polite fellow.  

Should I stop interacting with him and tell my bros to stop talking to him?  Can I remain playing games with him?

Personally I would very much prefer to still play with him, as he is a fun guy to be with, but I don’t know what to do.

76,How do you get tougher skin? I have very thin skin and almost all insults or criticism i get very upset and take it personally. I'm not sure if this could have to do with anything but when I was younger (and sometimes still today) my mom always verbally abused me and/or physically fighting. I just feel like a weak person and I know people will try taking advantage of me so I'm scared to make friends or anything.,02Jun2018,2
77,"I've asked my closest friends their advice, but I wanted to see what strangers think of the situation as well. I'm seventeen with my first boyfriend. He's one of the nicest people I've ever met, has a great personality, and I love to spend time with him. 

But I'm not in love with him at all. He was my friend at first, and he asked me on a date. I agreed-- not wanting to say no-- and after that he simply assumed we were dating. I had no idea our friendship would turn into this-- but I was too afraid of hurting him to stop it. Now we're dating, and I don't want him to kiss me or even hold my hand. I see him as more of a brother so the entire situation is extremely uncomfortable. In fact, I'm not interested in dating ANYONE. 

I'm already stressed and this is certainly not helping. However, he adores me. He buys me the most wonderful presents and is extremely nice to me every day. He's also more of the sensitive type. I COULD continue to date him, but the whole thing feels like a lie and I hate being dishonest. Plus, I am extremely unromantic and he may catch on to my lack of feelings for him. The last thing I want to do is hurt this person. He is an amazing friend who is kind to everybody; I couldn't live with myself if I made him unhappy. 

What do you suggest? Thanks ⭐",02Jun2018,1
80,"i'm 24 years old. working full time as a server.

i can go back to my college in half a year (suspended) and try to raise my gpa up to 2.0 and graduate. I need about 20 credits but GPA is the limiting factor here, not the credits.

but I guess I don't know if I even try. First, I am a bit scared about going back because I failed a lot of classes and I don't know if I can actually raise my gpa. The school is one of thes top college and it's tough for me. And even if I do graduate, would i even be able to get a job? bad gpa. no internship. nothing...

I can start fresh at a community college and transfer to get a bachelor in another college. but that will be another 4 years and I just feel so behind my friends who are all moving on with their lives.

81,"Hi, i need some advice badly. I think i messed up when talking to this girl. We started talking like 2 weeks ago and i called her cute. Ever since then its just been super awkward between us. I've asked her to hang out and she's denied both times. I just think she thinks i'm gonna ask her out on a date or something. We are in highschool together and we were gonna hang after school. I just feel ever since the i called her cute its just been awkward. I need help badly. ",02Jun2018,1
83,"So, typically I am a man that gives advice, not needs it. But right now, I'm very conflicted. Besides for just the title, here's a much more in-depth backstory so you may understand my situation. 

So I've known my best friend for just over 6 years, and I've loved her ever since. She's one of the only people that truely make me happy. However, I'm sure she doesn't feel the same about me, but I'm fine with that. I'd rather her work through school and get her life started before I try anything anyway, to ease stress and distraction for both of us. 
Anyway, we've both said that we don't find the 100% appeal in dances and such related activities with the statement, ""Wouldn't it mean more to spend time alone with your significant other instead?"". However, I do really want to go to prom and I know that she is the only one I'd go with, and maybe the same vice versa. 
I'll be a junior next year and her a sophomore, so inviting her to prom would give her a special opportunity as she couldn't go unless invited by an upperclassman. It'd also probably mean a lot to her family and mine if we went to prom in general.
So, I've thought, how do I ask her? I'm not exactly rich, I have no job quite yet and I don't want to make it sound like we're dating. Although we do both love art....

I have plenty of time, but what should I do? I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you so very much for reading.",02Jun2018,1

But my friend asked James and he said he doesn’t like the girl. I want to ask her out but if I do, I don’t want it to ruin our friendship, because I like her as a crush and a person.

86,"Both of my parents are extremely catholic. My dad is a by the book literalist and also a sociopath who can lack self control when angered, and my mom is about to become an RCIA director and has been a religion teacher for many years.

Ever since I fully understood what the Catholic faith was, which happened after my first communion and reconciliation, I did not believe in any of its spiritual teachings. It has been about 6 years or so I assume that I have been an atheist(I am 17 now), while my parents think I’m some pretty catholic boy.

The eye opening experience I had on this entire situation happened in the car ride going to my confirmation. My parents and I were having a conversation and they were saying how being confirmed means I am forever being in the faith and such, and then my dad comes out and says “-and this is your choice too. This is your decision that you made”. NO. Not at all! My parents have forced me into a corner for my entire life and I feel I am just forcing myself to be who THEY want me to be.

What was I to do? Tell them right there no it isn’t and then explain the whole situation to them? I would have been left on the side of the road, not even exaggerating. I am so scared of how my parents will react once they find out I am atheist. My entire extended family is Catholic too so I would I feel it would be everyone against me. But I hate being forced to be something I am not.

I am not sure what to do. I am going away to college in fall of 2020, so maybe hold off until then and just not attend Church while there, telling them from a safe distance that I am not really their little puppet anymore? I still don’t know how they would react, like what if they stopped paying for my college? Or they wouldn’t let me move back home? I am so scared.

90,"Throwaway account because my sister and friends know my real one. This is super long and I apologise deeply.

I'm a 15 years old male. I live with my mother and my step dad who has adopted me in southern California. My father is not in the picture and lives in North Carolina. Other than that I don't know where to start.

I am currently sitting in my bathroom with the door locked and the fan on trying not to cry from all the stress I'm going through and have been for the past 2-3 years. I can't talk to my parents about anything personal because they say I need to suck it up. They think just because I'm a kid means I don't have anything to stress about. This is one fo the many things they pull. Another is they give me much more work and responsibilities than my siblings and my dad sits at his computer streaming all day while my mom takes her frustrations out on me. I have 2 brothers (one 16 the other 2) and a sister (18) who just graduated high school. My 16 year old brother lives with us on the weeks and 1 weekend out of the month, while everyone else lives here permanently. They don't give as much work to my 16 year old brother because he doesn't have much common sense (but the kid is really sweet and caring and they are too hard on him) and they give little work to my sister because she is in charge of herself and only herself now. She still lives with us though and the only things she pays for is her debit card, her phone bill, and anything extra she wants. Everything else lands on me and my mom. I try and do as much as I can to keep my mom from getting pissy towards my dad. When they do fight they have the maturity of 7th graders and use anything they can to insult each other even if that includes discrediting me for most of the stuff I do. Normally they discredit me to try and get me to do more, like watch my brother more and do more chores. My dad has the tendency to punch holes in the wall to channel his anger and he gets extremely defensive. Whenever I try and talk to them about stuff concerning them they get extremely defensive.

For instance my close friend who is also my crush is having a quinceanera tomorrow and I've needed a silver dress shirt to match the dress code. I've been asking my mom about it for a month or 2 and she always told me to ask her later then got annoyed when I asked her later. I confronted her about this yesterday and she pinned it on my dad saying we are tight on cash because of him (it is actually both of them). I don't know if I am even going anymore because I'm sick. This has done this before, the most prominent being when I had pinworms 2 years ago (I don't know how probably from infected food). WE got the paper for the prescription but my mom claimed he forgot to get it for 2 weeks straight. I never got the medication and I had to wait it out for 6 months for them to die naturally. I still feel the same sensation from time to time at night but I don't know if it's real or if it's my mind making things up when I'm super tired.

Another problem with my mom is she down plays things. My sister has had herpes simplex since she was little, so has my mom. I was concerned about me having it as well, she said I don't have the symptoms so I'm fine and how dare I even bring up something so stupid. 

I'm also worried about my baby brother. He is picking up a ton of bad traits from my parents. He has been cursing a lot (I don't curse at home) and he is really aggressive. I'm extremely worried about him and I have no idea what to do for him. I love him so much and he is so smart and I don't want him to turn out like them.

I also don't have a door to me and my brothers room. The original one was given a hole by dad and when they replaced it the door was crap and fell off again because it the nails were all stripped (they blame me and my brother for it). I now have a sheet in front of it that does a shitty job of blocking the light and stopping the sounds of my dad streaming Nioh until 3 in the morning. Parents refuse to get a new one because either we don't have money or they are worried we are going to pull it down like the last one (this changes every time I talk to them about it).

Now for my main problem right now. I'm sick and I'm not getting any better. I can't eat because it hurts to swallow and I have blisters on my feet that are now spreading to my hands. I stayed home sick yesterday to try and rest to let my throat heal but my mom dragged me around and had me working for a most of the day after I woke up. I'm not sure if I should go to the quinceanera tomorrow or not out of fear of getting my friend sick, and when I talked to my mom about it just now she did the same ""you are over thinking it"" bs. The medication she got me for my throat didnt reach deep enough to numb it, and we have nothing for the blisters.


I have tried time and time again to talk to my parents about this stuff but they always blow it off or get defensive and blame it on me or the other parent. They always ask for my trust and I try so hard to give it to them but they betray it every time. I can't stop I want to trust them but I can't.


All of this shit is stressing me out so much but I always bottle it up and once in a while I breakdown at school, may that be in front of my close friends, my English teachers, or my counselor. I haven't talked to my counselor in a while, and I'm doing that on this Monday but hopefully it won't cut too much into my time as it's finals week.

I don't know what to do other than bottle it up and cry about it. I don't want to try and stay at a friend's house like my counselor and my friend suggested because it would cause more shit than it would resolve, and I can never talk to my parents about it. I also can't talk to my siblings about it because I'm not comfortable about talking to my 16 year old brother about this and the last time I talked to my sister about this she told me I was being a generic teenager and to just take this shit like she did. She had the same issues I did and I don't want to turn out like her. She has trust issues and seems to be detacheded from everyone except out aunt who she spends all of her time with.

I'm really sorry about having this super long. I dont know what to do anymore, and asking on Reddit is the best I could think of at the moment.

To anyone who is even just reading this, thank you. Even more thanks to those who can help me.

I was also put in a Mental faculty four times in my 22 life span, three as a teenager and one as an adult, my parents are terrible people inside. Later finding out my grandfather abused my father to a point where he did the same to me but not so much physically but mentally since my mother did everything in her power to protect me, even though he says he tries not to, we have not spoken in a year because he told me he wanted to send me to jail and let a black man rape my butt (Said a lot worse and way harsher... but i dont think this community would allow that type of language). My mother was abused too... finding out later my father also cheated on my mother multiple times and when i mean multiple i mean over 30 females. I believe my mother is Psycho because she knows i had it rough and she will Protect me even if it means breaking me at points if she doesn't feel comfortable which leads me into a Financial Leash which i cant leave, i tried leaving this hell hole dozen of time's to start my OWN life but failed more times then i can count because it's not a reachable dream.

At first \(prior to high school\), I asked my parents what I should do with my life. Coming from a traditional south Asian household, I was surprised to find that my parents weren't ""pushy"" or imposing at all. I had to beg them to tell me what they wanted from me. My mother reluctantly said a doctor. Now, you may be saying they do sound like typical south Asian parents, but then again I had to BEG, and more importantly, their reasons were: ""be a good person"", they meant this in the religious sense \(good deeds etc\), the human sense \(saving lives \- being compassionate\), but also in terms of providing for my own future. Knowing that I still wasn't sure what I wanted to do, my main goal became keeping ""all doors open"". I applied to the IB program which at the time was super hyped up by my friends, and in the application letter I specifically wrote I wanted to have options open in the future. 

With that, I was going to venture on into high school. However, my family moved and I was no longer able to attend the ""pre\-IB"" program that I had applied for. I believe this to be a blessing in disguise. I quickly made friends at my new school, breezed through first year at high school \- playing DoTA as soon as I got home. Grade 10, I realized there were awards for academic excellence... and I WANTED those. This goes back to me wanting to prove I could do something better than anyone else, something I had in me for as long as I could remember. Grade 10, I won 8 awards, had the highest academic average in the school \(across all grades\), and had begun volunteering at my local hospital. I was set on becoming a doctor. I talked to my guidance counselor on other things I could do to strengthen my application for post\-secondary, and he said take on a leadership role. Again, I put my mind to it, and within 2 months, I had won the elections for student body president, and was on the school board student committee \(student senate\). Throughout those years I was also playing sports at a competitive level \(badminton, soccer, volleyball, Frisbee\). At this point in my life, I also lost a lot of friends. I felt as if I could do anything, and the results were backing that up. On top of that, I said some things that weren't related to school, but were stupid. 

Going into my third year, I had a significantly lower number of friends and was concerned it was going to affect me academically. I can't say they didn't. The first semester, I didn't perform as well as I had hoped. \- dropped a few percent. I was still the President of the student body, a senator at the board, and continued playing sports. Again, throughout these years I had it stuck in my mind that I was going to go into medicine and become a doctor. Due to this I believe I might have given less thought to other options. In my second semester, my current semester, I have a 99.5 average academically while taking biology \(11\) physics \(11\) law \(12\) and comp sci \(12\). Up until a few weeks, I felt unstoppable once again. Teachers from English, Bio, even Law had personally told me they had never seen anyone as hard working, or given out grades as high as mine. Again, this is all to prove why I'm lost, not to inflate my own ego. I didn't need my old friends, in fact I was doing even better without them. I made appointments with guidance counselors, asking if there was anything else I could do. They pretty much said continue doing what you're doing. 

Now, during the final weeks of Grade 11, I started thinking once again. Is this something only I can do? I talked to my most trusted friend, someone who'd helped me throughout the 3 years, and he, at first, didn't believe I was good at everything. After explaining to him that I didn't believe that either, but so far there had been nothing to challenge me into believing I wasn't, I had no clue what to do or where to go. Once again, I talked to my parents. I told them I wasn't sure about medicine, as it seemed too limiting. My mom told me, ""you'll might become a jack or all trades, but a master of none"", when I told her I didn't want to focus on one specific area. It made sense why she thought that way. I wanted to leave my mark, do something big, do something no one else could do \(again\). I didn't care about the money, sure helping people was nice, but that didn't motivate me either, I was and am purely motivated by the feeling of wanting to do something great. I don't know why I feel like I have something to prove, but I have always felt this way. Not to my parents, not to my friends, but to myself. Just to affirm my own beliefs. 

Skip to today, after experiencing mock trials in law, winning the case, being told by lawyers to consider law as my case was extremely well though out and I was ""unbelievably well\-spoken for my age"", my doubts began to intensify. I went to the most trusted teacher, and a ""motherly"" figure, someone who had helped me when my friends left me. I told her about the trials, and her being an English teacher, she told me, ""you'd do very well in law, and I think you'd enjoy it very much"". Then, she followed up with the feelings I had been carrying for the longest time, but was afraid to voice, afraid of being labelled cocky or arrogant. She told me, ""but then again, I think you'd be the best at everything and anything you put your mind to \- you have the talent and the work ethic."" I told her I had told my friend the same thing. The conversation ended with her saying, ""I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing"". 

I've been thinking about it my entire life, and all day, have talked to my friend, but am more lost than ever. I have no sense of direction, other than wanting to do something only I can do. I don't want to limit myself by focusing on one thing, and that's because there has been nothing so far that has shown me I wouldn't be amazing at something. I hope I get challenged enough to see where I might be lacking next year, but with ""decision time"" looming, I want to have some form of idea as to what I want to do. Sure I could continue to think about it in post\-secondary, but I also don't want to waste time. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope I didn't come off as too arrogant or cocky. This was written in one sitting in 20 minutes or so. If you don't understand anything or why I'm saying something please feel free to ask. Any and all advice would be  greatly appreciated.

He's extremely sweet and caring to everyone, especially me but lately i've been feeling a little bit smothered. For example, he seems to have attachment issues. I know his father left him as a young child so maybe thats why. I understand him wanting to see me often but it's like he wants to see me all the time and he doesn't mind ditching his guy friends if it means spending time with me. I think he's afraid i'll leave him because of other issues he seems to have and I feel like he's very attached to me.  I really like this guy and i know he likes me a lot too, so im curios as to if all of this will fade overtime and if it's just the ""honeymoon phase"" kinda thing. I love the affection he shows me, dont get me wrong but i just dont want him to feel insecure in the relationship. Is it normal for him to act like this so early on? Thanks guys. ",02Jun2018,10
98,"So I have this best friend of 5 years \- we've never met in real life. She lives in Virgina, goes to school at Penn State. I live in go to Illinois, and go to Illinois State. We are both super sucessful, and we are always there for each other and always have been. We are both 20. We've both never been in a relationship, and we have always been friends and never had any feelings or relationships for each other.

However, this past year at school I got extremely jealous of her. It almost ruined our friendship, but we got through it. It essentially boiled down to how she had all these friends, and gets free tuition due to her dad being in the military. I did not have many friends, and I'm so much in debt. ALSO, she is 3.5"" taller than me at because she is 6' tall.

In late April, she downloaded Tinder. She met this guy who she really clicked with, and really really likes him. She slept with him \(literally, just sleep\) and just spent time with him in the remaining like 15 days left at school. He just graduated. And apparently, she is going next weekend up to PA to meet up with friends and meet up with the guy and spend the night with him.

I am **SO** jealous and angered by her going and hanging out with her friends and staying the night with the guy. I just don't understand why! I've never been in a relationship, but I have slept \(literally, only slept\) with a girl so I am so double standards here. And again, I don't have any feelings towards her except for friends.

100,"My heart is broken. 

In May ‘04, my father went to the humane society with me after my birthday to look for the perfect kitten. 
My father looked into a window and pointed out a ball of white fluff in a corner, possibly asleep. 
It bored me and I went to look at the playful kittens down the hall. 

The next day, I came home and there she was. 
My perfect ball of Himalayan love. She was so small and precious. I named her Daisy after her perfect little orange nose and tips of her ears. 

My father passed away later that year and ever since I’ve had her as my best furry friend. 

Fourteen years later, now I’m here. 

She has kidney failure and hyperactive thyroids.
 Within the past two weeks she’s declined horribly.
 She’s lost a ton of weight over the past year but now she’s pretty much stopped eating. She can walk but has a hard time getting places as her hips are giving out. 
Daisy pees anywhere now, so it’s forced us to keep her in the basement, the porch or outside. But right now she’s in my room, I have a tarp on the floor and a litter box and bed set up with food and water. 

I picked her up the other day and she had blood on her vaginal area and her butt, it’s obvious she’s pushing hard to go. Fuck. 

I don’t know what to do because I’m obviously emotionally unstable and I’m trying to figure out what’s right without making a rash decision. 

She doesn’t seem like she’s in pain but I don’t want her to keep living like this if it’s stressful.

105,I unfriended a girl I had history with on Snapchat. She was dating someone and I was mad and deleted her on it. This was like over a year ago. How do I add her back without it being weird? (Were on good terms now),02Jun2018,1
106,"  Last year my supervisor hired a young lady who I'd say is an extreme introvert. Beings I was her trainer and lead we spent a lot of time together. Trying to converse with her was like pulling teeth. Sadly enough my fellow teammates were freaked out by her oddness. She did admit to being more of the loner type, with high anxiety. I found this as an opportunity to extend my friendship and open up about my own depression and anxiety in hopes to ensure her she's not alone and had someone there to listen. 
  Everything was off to a great start. Then the ""essay's"" began. We would have our daily work conversation which was minimal. The minute she got home from work the messages never stopped. I mean paragraph after paragraph.  I had trouble keeping up. Then things turned dark and personal. She would message me about creating crime  scenes with fake blood and would smear hand prints of ""blood"" all over her bathroom mirror and shower curtains. Visualizing people being murdered because they were mean and felt they deserved it. Destroying labatory equipment when something was out of her control. What finally put me over the edge was her stating everyone's lucky she didn't own a gun. I felt it was only right to make HR aware of this in case one of my staff members were ever hurt and I knew of this behavior previous. I also just needed some advice and asked if there were any outlets for me to refer her to for help. You have to admit these are not normal thoughts right? Yes they're only thoughts but was she able to seperate those thoughts from reality. Of course HR was unable to do anything beings she hadn't really done anything wrong. It was never my intention to get the poor girl in trouble or jeopardize her job. I just had to let someone know. 
  Her messages continue till this day, and have now spilled over into my bosses inbox. He's somewhat of a tortured soul himself (arent we all to an extent?) and finds this to be part of her sense of humor and she's becoming more open. Like calling people ""dumb faggots"" because they forgot to order certain tests...when I heard that come from her mouth my jaw dropped, and he just laughed..... I lost a lot of respect for her from then on out and have tried distancing myself. 
  Something minor happened last night at work out of her control and she came in to work today with it still hanging over her head. She couldnt even function and was found crying in the bathroom. Again. I understand anxiety and I'm not trying to pick on her but this is a weekly issue.  So we had her sit in the office to compose herself and I sent in HR to help speak with her. They were in there for over an hour and all seemed well. HR advised my boss and I that she is hypersensitive to pretty much anything out of her control and that we should accommodate her inability to relate. 
 Okay.....So here's the kicker. We dispatched her out for a job and we were laughing about something with a colleague (having nothing to do with her) she of course gets offended and just snaps with this ominous glare and says something along the lines this is stupid, I'm leaving. My boss is super confused and had this WTF look on his face. He proceeds to message her telling her she needs to come to his office immediately upon return. The message he got back from her was......""You know, sometimes I imagine bashing your skull in just to watch your blood splatter everywhere"". Wait, what? WHAT?! 
My question is what you think the repercussions should be? I demanded to be a witness for this counseling when she returned (I'm his assistant btw) What happened next blew my mind. NOTHING. Absolutely nada. He didnt want to make her feel like she was being put in a corner. After her telling him she wants to see his blood splattered everywhere after beating his skull in. There's so many other off the wall things this poor girl says and they're all focused on people deserving to die. Am I over reacting? All I care about is her not doing something to injure herself or others. Advice would be great, cause I'm about to lose it. ",02Jun2018,0

109,"I met a guy in person tonight that begged me to hang out with him for a week on pof. He was such a cool guy and we just clicked. It felt like we had been friends forever even though we just met. He told me he wasn't really looking for a relationship and was just looking for friends which I was fine with. We drove around and smoked cigarettes and he sang lol. When I was driving he asked me if we could park somewhere and chill for a while. We went to a parking lot and talked a little while longer and he grabbed my hand and held it and was like, ""you need to gain confidence. You're too hard on yourself. You're too tense."" We held hands for a while which was nice.



He put my hand toward his penis and wanted me to touch it. I felt very awkward but I told him I would touch his dick if he kissed me. At first he didn't want to because he wanted me to get kissed for the first time from someone that was going to be with me and have a relationship with me. However I told him I would touch his dick if he kissed me. He was like ""I guess that's fair"" and he gave two pecks on the lips. He guided my hand toward his dick and I touched it and he pulled it out. When he pulled it out I got freaked out and he was like, ""just calm down. It's just a dick. You're 23. You need to get out more and experience this. Do you want to give me a blowjob? I told him no and he was like ""why?"" Then he asked if I wanted him to touch me and I said no again. I ended up giving him a handjob and it was just extremely awkward. When I dropped him off he acted like he was trying to get me to kiss him but I just gave him a high five type thing and he gave me a hug. He was stoned the entire time. I don't feel grossed out by it but everything just happened so quickly. I have never hugged, kissed, touched, or held hands with a guy and all 4 of those things happened within an hour.

111,"Okay I need some advice here. I’m a 20 year old student currently trying to balance work, school, a relationship, and a place to live. Let me start with my current living situation. I live in a two bedroom apartment with four other people, a dog and three cats. I share my probably 11x11 foot bedroom with my younger sister. Basically each of us have a tiny closet and a bed. my mom has her room and my other two sisters sleep in the living room. 

My mom is single and supporting herself and four kids without a college degree and I know she’s doing her best but it’s not an ideal situation. I’m a student and I never have any room or quiet area to study. Also my mom is constantly threatening to kick me out, and is somewhat verbally abusive towards me. I work 35 hours a week (5 days) and go to school on my other two days. I have no time off ever and between that and living in this house I’ve become really depressed and withdrawn. 

I’m considering working less hours since at this time I don’t pay any bills except car insurance, gas, groceries, out of pocket for birth control, and any “fun” stuff I do. Working less hours would help me to focus on school and have some recovery time to myself. But I also want to move out because this living situation is making things a lot worse. I would like to have a roommate to cut down rent, either my boyfriend or preferably a friend. 

But rent around here is very expensive, like $900 min for a (shitty) two bedroom apartment not including utilities, groceries, car insurance, and I would like to have health insurance since I currently don’t. I’ve calculated that everything together would be about $750 per person(rent, utilities, car insurance, internet, gas, groceries) not including health insurance or fun money which I could do without. I make $9.25 an hour before taxes and I can’t really get a job making more than that. So I would have to work about 21 hours a week to make it by(probably more after taxes). Which would be fine. 

Except.. I’m currently going to school two days a week but starting. in January I’ll be attending nursing school four days a week plus three days of clinicals. So I don’t know if I’ll really be able to work enough days to make it on my own. I really need to be able to study and I’m not a good student and it’s hard for me but I’m trying to get my degree. It would be nice to not have to work as much but then Id be living at home which is really taking a toll on me. I also have a boyfriend and all the constant working and school and family stuff is taking a toll on our relationship and I really care about him. 

I just know that when I start nursing school things are going to get even harder and I’m going to need to focus on school a lot more than I am now. I do have financial aid but it won’t cover housing and I go to community college so dorms aren’t an option, it’s only apartments. I know this is long and drawn out so thank you if you’ve read this far. I understand that some people have it harder and still do this stuff but I don’t handle stress well and I’m not a good student. I’m so stressed out and depressed and I feel like all my mom does is yell at me and tell me I’m lazy and I don’t help around the house enough. And I worry that once I start nursing school I won’t be able to work at all really more than maybe a few hours a week. Would it be stupid to take out a loan in nursing school? I think that may be the only way I’ll get through it honestly. Like just for rent/food/gas/etc. I don’t mean to be complaining about my life so much but I really need advice. Any nurses how did you get through school? Or anyone really who has advice for me it’s so appreciated.",02Jun2018,1

114,"This one is gonna be a doozy 
 
  So, I have an extremely gay best friend who I’ve been friends with for two years. We have went through a lot of issues with other people together and he’s helped me out through a lot of my depression. I’ve tried to kill myself around two times in the last year and he was really the one who snapped me out of it all. He makes me feel happy when he’s around, I love his smile, I love how funny he is, I also love his soft spot for me.
   However things are not as perfect as they seem.
   He can be really the biggest asshole of all times at moments. I’ve gotten too close with him I fear. When it’s anyone else possible he will be extremely nice, listen to their problems, and say he will be there for them.  However when it’s me, he tells me to shut up, stop crying, and deal with it. Usually when we are talking in person and I’m crying about my life he will hug me and tell me I’ll be okay, but the second it’s over the phone he loses all sight of kindness. The thing is that this has recently been over some stupid job he has.
   He’s recently got a job with people around his job and he loves it and I’m happy for him, besides the fact he’s been ignoring me, and treating me like a bag of garbage. When I was going through a really tough time he said that he was working and continued to post and say what a good time he’s been having and ect. While I’ve been upset and just keeping it back to keep him happy. At first he was nice then he started saying how annoying I am and how I harass him, how I’m clingy and annoying. He normally gets like this when he’s interested in someone or he’s dating someone. Which is really making me consider if I should wait for him to stop being an asshole or not. 
   He told me to make new friends since I said I missed him and am lonely without him (which is what happens when you go from spending a week seeing someone everyday to not seeing them once).  So I made new friends and he got mad about who I’m talking with? Like he’s getting jealous over these new friends I’m making when he was the one who was ignoring me and told me to make them in the first point.
   I love him to death and he’s had a rough go at life, which is why I have so much patience but this is getting to be too much even for me. A lot of people say that the reason he messes with me so much and he’s so mean is because he know I won’t leave him. Which makes sense, but at the same time doesn’t. If someone legit does everything possible to make your life better, which includes buying you a birthday and Christmas present and being one of the only two persons who did so, waking up early to make sure you have breakfast, staying after work to give you lunch, and making sure that I’m always there when you need me to and constantly adjusting around you.

120,"Do you think that women who have been sexually abused as children are destined to be alone forever? Anyone have any insights into why as a 32 year old woman I keep winding up with perfectly nice partners that treat spending any time with me like a burden. They always tend to have lots of friends and are very social, but I inevitably wind up being disliked by all of the friends and then my partner will slowly stop inviting me. Then my boyfriend will start resenting me when their friends complain they don't spend any time with them. They start bringing it up whenever there is argument. I'm a pretty self-aware person because of my issues of trust and worthiness. The thing is though; these boyfriends are still spending most nights with their friends, just coming home by midnight instead of 4 in the morning. I am pretty prone to melancholy and am more of a house cat these days, but do love going out to the theatre, cinema and love a night at the pub. I realise I'm not the ideal girl in terms of social anxiety etc but do make an effort, but often come across as weird or snobby. Perhaps it's more severe than I recognised, because I feel like knowing my background, someone who cares about me would tell their friends to go easy or not be overly concerned about their opinions. I'm hoping to leave Australia within the next couple of years to head back abroad, hopefully to Northern Europe. I'm an artist and am spontaneous and adventurous but am starting to feel very alone and sad, especially when I see my friends marrying and going on adventures with their partners, and not alone (I've spent my whole life travelling alone). I'm starting to think there is something inherently flawed in my being that no one who comes to love me can stand me after a time. I have been to therapy and it doesn't seem to make much of a difference overall to this pattern. I'm relatively attractive and I think men only fall for me for that reason, but then tire of me after a year or so. I don't think I'm clingy and I think I'm a nice girlfriend. I think about my partners and factor their needs and desires into my decision making. I give them freedom to live their lives as before and don't expect to be the centre of their universe. I don't burden them with all of my fears and worries but maintain my own interests and have independent goals and pursuits. I don't go for super hot guys, or with good jobs or money. I just like guys that are nice and they are nice, it's just they always leave me and then wind up with someone else pretty quickly that all their friends seem to adore. I just feel like some sort of social pariah that will never find a life partner, please give me advice. 

Side note: It sounds like I have a lot of boyfriends, I haven't. The gap between my last two relationships was 2 years. ",02Jun2018,0
121,"So there’s this guy at my job. He is really sweet and respectful. I work retail so periodically during the day while I work the register, I have to check the fitting rooms and put back items. Ever since the guy and I have become acquainted and such he’s been doing all my go backs for me, keeping me company while I’m alone at the register , flirting on a regular etc. we never exchanged numbers though . My friends have been telling me to ask him but I felt like guys should ask first (I know it’s stupid to say that) but I didn’t ask him . Another thing is both him, his mom and his older brother work at the same store . And tonight one of my friends (a former worker at the store) texted his mom and said that I want his number etc. in reply she stated that he has a gf and she’s trying to remain neutral between us and that her motherly instinct already knew that he liked me but he’s in a relationship.

122,"* English is not my first language (so I'm really sorry if I make mistakes) 


We met two years ago in a weird Facebook-like page (not that kind of weird though), we started talking and getting along, he gave me his number and we continued to talked on whatsapp, at one point we send nudes to each other and start sexting but then we kinda forgot about that and then we genuinely just talked like normal people, months passed by, always talking about how cool will be if we actually meet someday but our countrys were so far away (15 hours difference). Then he starts travelling around the world and now he is here... In my fuxking country!  And I'm never been more anxious. 


A little bit about him:  physically he is really handsome and tall kinda dreamy and super hot but all that it's just a plus tbh because he is the sweetest, supportive, interesting, charming and funny guy I have ever talked to and I perfectly know that he might as well ended up being a completely jerk in real life and that everything seems way too perfect to be real but fxck idk what to do,  I don't pretend to be his gf or anything because we perfectly know It wouldn't work because of distance. We have talked about the possibility of falling for each other but as a joke (I think)  But the real problem here is... I'm not the same person emotionally and physically he met two years ago and specially this fxcking month that I have been through so many things, I don't want him to see me like this, but I know that the possibility of being again even on the same continent it's one in a million. 


Physically I have put on weight and I have told him that and he told me he doesn't care, but I'm definitely way more curvy, my hair is shorter which makes me feel less secure about myself (weird thing about me) 


Emotionally, uhhh let's say that I haven't take care of myself how I'm supposed to, and I just don't want to ruin his first time in my country with my problems. I really want to show him around and take him to my favourite places but I don't like being outside in the day bc I don't feel pretty, I just go to college then I came home and go out at night for a walk, I've tried to go out more so I can be more comfortable but I hate it, I hate being in public I feel like everyone judging me. And it's going to be so weird if I tell him that I can only see him at night, I've been trying on clothes that would make me feel more comfortable but that's just oversized sweaters and leggings and of course it's not flattering, all the clothes I own are black (well bc that's the only colour I've been wearing for the last 5 years)  and I have actually considered to buy something colorful so I don't look so sad!  Imagine how I feel to actually consider that omg. 


**TL;DR; : I'm afraid that he might not like me bc of both how I look (gained weight)  and how I'm acting bc of my emotional problems.(anxiety and depression)**

128,"So to start, I have a good, not great, but good relationship with my family. The worst thing my parents do is tell me to get a better job and get a start on my career (but that's for another time).  So at my work I have 2 coworkers that have family issues. 

One, their parents are in jail and lives with their grandmother who is verbally abusive and sometimes physically. And recently started cutting. 

The other, their father is controlling and abusive, and they hate going home, they will ask me or another coworker to give them a ride home, even though we won't be leaving for like another 2 hours or more. 90% of the time at work they're depressed, pissed, or both. Always walks up to me or another worker and is like, ""I'm so sad right now."". Their mother wants to leave the father, but can't financially and has a infant to care about. 

And after hearing, and trying to talk to them about it for months now, I'm at a point where I just don't care anymore. As bad as that sounds, I just don't. I tried giving some small advice, some quick tips here and there, but after hearing and dealing with it, day after day. I now, if they come up and start saying something about their issues, will flat out ignore it and pretend like nothings wrong. And I talked with another of our workers about it, and they feels similarly to me, but we don't want to say anything to them in almost fear they'll do something drastic. 

How should I proceed? I don't want to just stop talking to them because of my selfish reasons, but at the same time I don't want to keep hearing about it. Lost on what to do and any advice is appreciated. Thank you",02Jun2018,1
129,"Let me start this by saying that I've been through very deep clinical depression - I've tried to kill myself multiple times and I've been locked in a mental hospital for 2 years. So I know where this person is coming from, but I just can't help but be annoyed.

I've met this guy in a video game, we played together a lot and became sort of friends. At first he was fine but now he feels really close to me for whatever reason so he dumps all of his problems on me like I'm his therapist or something.

He's always negative, he thinks the entire world is conspired against him, and I get it, like I've said I've been like that once, But every conversation I have with him is like,

Him: ""I hate being broke""

Me: ""Then get a job""

Him: ""I'm fat and ugly""

Me: ""Then work out""

Like I know it's hard to pull yourself together and doing stuff that seem minimal to other people can take a great toll on you, But I just want to scream at him ""you can't expect shit to get better if you don't do anything!""

I can't send him a single fucking message without him turning it into a sob story about himself, like if I send him something like ""I love this tv show"" he'd reply with ""If only someone loved me"" LIKE I GET IT, YOUR LIFE SUCKS, JESUS.

I pulled myself out of my own depression by forcing myself to get out there and make good friends, and doing hobbies that make me happy. I'm a pretty apathetic person, I don't know how to counsel people, in fact I hate doing it, especially if it's an online friend because then all I can really do is just type back ""oh"" and I get mad at myself for being so useless as a result.

I'm too nice for my own good, I didn't stop him when he first showed signs of putting so much trust in me and now he's convinced I'm his best friend. I feel like a bad person because I remember what it was like to be in deep shit and wanting to have someone you can be close to, and feeling like you're a burden because of your illness.

I’m 23 years old. I have a bachelors degree. I have a well-off family that loves me. I have dear friends. But I’m sitting here thinking about my life and it feels empty. 

I know that I’m more fortunate than a lot of people in this world and that humbles me. I’m thankful. But, I can’t derive my happiness from that. 

I spent a majority of my time from 18-22 traveling around the country DJing and meeting famous people, living a dream,  performing for thousands and thousands of people and I absolutely loved it. I love EDM and I pursued it with all my heart. I lived experiences people dream of and have had memories that would last a lifetime. Unfortunately, my manager that made everything happen for me passed away in a plane crash a month ago and my DJ duo partner drifted from the love of the music about a year prior. 

I felt like my dream was to live through music and pursue something huge. I tried to wake up every morning and do it on my own but I felt like the passion for the dream was there but the passion for the work ethic wasn’t there anymore. 

I’ve been single for quite some time because I can’t seem to find someone fit for me. I loved a girl and was ready to be engaged but found out she was cheating on me for 8 months. That grew issues for me that I’m just now able to cope with. 

I’ve lost 4 grandparents, 2 best friends, my manager, and my own brother to death at such a young age and it’s amazing I still can attempt to find light at the end of the tunnel. 

I want to live a fulfilling life but I feel like I’m stuck in a routine. I don’t want to be normal. I want to be different and express myself in this world. I refuse to be part of the crowd and money isn’t the most important thing to me. 

If I’m feeling like I can’t put forth focus toward anything regardless of what I wish I had, what’s my purpose of being here? I need advice on what i should try to strive for personal development and how to be strong and independent. I don’t know what I want to do with my life but I know that I want to wake up everyday to something meaningful. With that being said, What’s your advice for self motivation?

There was a girl in the lobby waiting to be interviewed as well.

I discovered his cellphone was now someone else's number, his Facebook page had vanished, and when I googled his name, the top hit is his obituary. This makes me deeply sad. He died in 2012 at the age of 30. It was barely a year after we fell out of touch.

I know it sounds stupid, but I've been struggling with this and really want to know how a healthy man of 30 just dies. The problem is, his family never knew we were friends. It'd be horribly insensitive to bother them about how he died 6 years after the fact. I never even learned of the funeral because we shared no mutual friends.

Then he asked me to touched his. I didn't know what entered my mind at the time but I did. He wanted me to touch his so I did and I remember him closing his eyes as I did. I touched for like 5 seconds then I stopped, then he pulled up his pants and that was basically it.

151,"I have wanted to keep cats ever since I can remember. Except my parents hate cats. My mom is terrified of them and my dad finds them disgusting. We live in an apartment and cats can easily come to the balcony. I finally adopted a stray one and kept feeding it. I would always get in trouble for feeding it and I think this has really scarred me. Why do you keep spending money on the cat. Don't waste food. Humans are more important. Arguments like these were constantly thrown at me by my dad. Since my cat is female, and lives outdoor( except times when I sneak her in my room) she gets pregnant all the time. There have been times she gave birth in the balcony. Since kittens can't jump that high when they grew a bit older they start making a mess in the balcony. He has had kittens thrown away before and no amount of crying has helped that. I am devastated. I look at other families with cats indoor, no complaints at how much it's costing. And he won't let me get them neutered because that sort of money is not to be spent on an animal. It's not like we can't afford it, its just that he thinks it's a waste. Another problem is that my dad has health issues that are easily triggered when he gets angry, and he gets very angry very easily and very very loud and hyper. Today it happened that I had put my makeshift cardboard litter box on a surface a little higher, that I know the kittens can reach to encourage them to start going outside to do their business. Unfortunately I misjudged this and they made a mess. I woke up in the morning to my dad's angry shouts and I felt that the anger was getting out of control for his health. He made very mean comments that my refusal to throw the cats would case his death and that it would be my fault. It scared me very much and I had to do what he was saying without talking back or saying anything. He forced me to put my 6 weeks old kittens in a bag myself and drove us to a street corner where I had to throw the cats away and I was constantly crying throughout. The mother cat is mourning and calling for her kittens but I don't know what to do . My dad is trying to buy me things to cheer me up but I don't understand how a parent can break his only child's heart  in this manner. I know he loves me very much so I don't know how he can do this. I understand that the kittens made a mess outside, but I cleaned it myself. The problem would be solved if I could either get my cat neutered or get proper litter boxes with proper materials to maintain it.  I an an only child and with both working parents, my pets are my company most of the time. Arguments related to my cats have happened ever since I was 9 or 10 and I don't think I can deal with this on my own anymore. Since our balcony is accessible for cats, strays do wander in so I have always had cats. One after the other, or entire generations. I am at a loss.

I went to college in my home city so I am still living at home. I am done with college now and will start work soon so maybe I can give them treatment they deserve. But it's still their house.

152,I feel like I'm physically old enough to make decisions but mentally too young. I think this has to do with me having split parents who have very very different attitudes. When I'm faced with a decision like going to eat food I hear my dad's voice in one ear and my mum's voice in the other. When I try and sleep these voices take over depending on whether I'm at my mum's or my dad's. I need to release all this tension and go to sleep. I prefer my mum and try to keep everything I love there. But when I'm at my dad's I can't sleep. I don't want a diagnosis I want help. I'm not legally old enough to live on my own yet so I need to keep the balance. ,02Jun2018,1
153,"{Backstory}
I have a friend who was living under terrible conditions in Romania, he even got depressed. He was so miserable that i decided to safe some money and get him to Amsterdam, where i live.

{Situation}
My friend can not speak English or Dutch and is not familiar with city's like Amsterdam. He doesn't have any money to spend and getting a job is going to be a work in progress for him.
To support us i need to keep on working full time, but i don't like leaving him home alone for too long (he is really at his lowest).

{question}
What can i let my friend do in Amsterdam when i am working?
I thought about sending him to a couple of museums since he likes art, but he wont understand anything because it is all in English. It would be great if he could do something that teaches him to speak English and how the western world works, but i don't want to overwhelm him whit it either. Pleas help, he arrives tomorrow.

{Side note}
Please don't post stuff like: Send him to a hooker or buy him some weed.

Thanks in advance!",02Jun2018,1

I sometimes drive by her house to see if she's actually home like she says she is. Any time she doesn't respond I'm scared she's talking to someone else. We're still friends. We're just taking this break so she can find herself and learn how to live life on her own and not depend on me and everyone else for everything. She said she won't promise me we'll get back together and honestly I feel like I'm ruining any chance of that by stalking her and pestering her when she's on her phone in front of me asking about who she's talking to and stuff like that.

Whenever he comes down for the holidays or to take a break he will stay with me. This is fine as I very much enjoy his company. I have never asked for rent or anything as he only works part time and those funds will go to his landlady back home. He would usually stay with his mum but his stepdad is an abusive douche (I have witnessed this for myself).
Occasionally his mum will buy food to last a couple of days but that's about it.
It's important to know that i live by myself, and although I'm not exactly struggling, my income only caters for one.
Everytime I see my family they will ask, what is he contributing? Considering he stays down here for weeks at a time then fucks off again. Yes it's my house and I chose to have him here but it's starting to get me down. And I'm finding that the more I look at him, the more angrier I'm getting. I don't even know if it's my own anger or other peoples opinions getting in my head.
I guess I've always paid my way in life so this is very strange to me. But I don't wanna send him back home, and how are you to ask for contribution when I know he's broke?

162,"I [19F] have worked since the day I legally could for 3 years now. I did a lot of retail, and now I have two jobs: one for while I’m at school doing sound and lighting and one in a pub at home. It’s summer now so I’m working at the pub, it’s a fairly new job and I like the people there. 

The problem is that when I work at uni, I know I love the job despite the bad bits and could do it for the rest of my life. This pub job makes me miserable, despite only working 20 hours a week, it ruins my mental health.

I’m working on trying to get less closing shifts so I can get the bus home rather than a taxi, but I can’t tell if I’m just being lazy by wanting to quit this job. I think about all the people working 80+ hour weeks and how I’m not even close. But the truth is, I don’t really need the job. For the first time in a while I’m quite comfortable with money, and I’m always very frugal.

The externship coordinator was falling behind on her work and told us it would be awhile before she could assign our places to go. She bribed us by saying if we found our site she would cut some hours off. So I went ahead and started job hunting.  I applied at this clinic to be a medical assistant before I got my certificate. Having my interview the co-owner explains I have no experience but can offer me another position. It pays less, but it’s a way of getting my foot in the door. And on top of that they would sign off on my hours. Fast forward a few months later, my hours are finished and I take the national exam. I now have my certification and I talk with one of the owners. She seemed helpful and said I could train on my only day off from the other position. So I’m training once a week and having to go through a check list of duties which my trainer supervises and signs that I did the task correctly. So it’s been a little over a month now and the process is going too slow for my liking.  I went from training at busy location and transferred back to a slower.  I had gotten so many signatures from the fast paced area. But I was moved because they weren’t comfortable with me training there because apparently it’s too hectic. So I went back today and got nothing done on my sheet. I wasn’t allowed to draw blood and when I did triage, I was so stressed that I couldn’t read the blood pressure right (I’m theorizes I might be partially deaf). I saw 5 patients all day and pretty much followed my trainer like a puppy. This training process is taking too long and I hate my other job on the weekdays. My weekday position is a glorified baby sitting job and the lack of mental stimulation is driving me crazy. Every person in charge I ask about my future with the company.

164,"I started smoking weed (non legal state) because I couldn't handle the anxiety and the pressure I was receiving from my parents to do well in school. I never tried because I've been unmotivated to do anything since 7th grade so my grades have been poor. The weed helped and my grades started to go up and I finally felt like my life was going in the right direction. I got caught the day after my last day of senior year and I told my parents that they were the source of my problems and that I wanted to move out. 

They told me the drugs were talking when I said that and if I wanted to move out I wasn't allowed to take anything with me. I don't have enough money to move out on my own and I can't get a job until I'm ""healthy again"". They want to take me to a Dr. to see if I've permanently damaged my brain with drugs, then take me to drug counseling. I told them I'd rather see a therapist to discuss my anxiety problems and that in the long run I think that would help me, but they disagree. They are fully convinced that drugs are the source of my problems, even though I've been struggling with this long before I started smoking. I have no one else to turn to and I can't even talk to my friends because I'm not allowed out of the house to see them. I've been able to text them, but I just want to see them in person.

My parents have only tried to force me into talking and my anxiety is 10000x worse than it ever was before and it's making me suicidal. I feel like an animal that's been backed into a corner and I have no options other than to be miserable and put up with all this bullshit or kill myself.

166,"I'm a 20 year old male and I never worked. I want to get a part-time job to start earning money and buy my own things and start contributing to my college expenses. However, I struggle with anxiety. I lived a very sheltered life. I never really had any friends and I spent a lot of time in my house. I didn't go outside too much. I used to get bullied a lot as well. My father growing up was very critical, harsh, and judgmental of every thing I did. He would always give me a hard time on being so shy.

When I'm in public or around strangers, I get nervous. The only place where I feel most comfortable is my house. It's so irritating because this anxiety is holding me back from getting a job. I want to get a job in customer service, because I think it could help bring me out of my shell. But I get nervous of the thought of having to interact with strangers. What if I get nervous talking to a customer and they can tell, and they think I'm weird? What if I'm awkward interacting with them? The thought of my coworkers, customers, and manager observing me and judging me is difficult. How am I going to get through the interview? What if I can't think of an answer to a question? I'm afraid I will make a lot of mistakes at work and make a fool of myself. I'm also a huge people-pleaser. What if my manager won't like me? What if my coworkers won't like me? What if a customer gives me a hard time?

I hate that I let my anxiety build up to this point. I always had it but it was never this bad. I need a job because I need money. I'm sick and tired of being broke! I'm sick of being stuck in the house. I'm sick of having to rely on my mom and dad for money like I'm a freaking child! But my anxiety and fears are holding me back.

171,"Growing up, I endured neglect and physical &amp; emotional abuse from both of my parents to the extent of being diagnosed with PTSD and MDD.  In retrospect, I had a strong drive to do well in high school so I could get out of my situation. It worked - I landed a full ride to a prestigious college, William and Mary, and  I started attending in 2015 at 17 years old. I had a very hard time adjusting; I stopped going to class and hanging out with friends, and I just stayed in my dorm, very depressed. The school recognized this, but instead of failing me out and losing my scholarship, they placed me on medical leave and wiped out my grades for freshman year. My time at school was horrible besides having a hard time adjusting. I was raped after my first time getting drunk, had a very toxic friendship, and spent my first time in a mental hospital - all terrible experiences. Since my freshman year, I went back in Jan 2017 for the spring semester, and I could not handle physically being at the place where these traumatic events occurred, so I  placed myself on a voluntary medical leave. I'm 20 now and everyone keeps asking when I'm going back there, but I honestly don't know if I can. I tell myself all the time how there are people out there who have to pay back thousands--even hundreds of thousands--to go to college and how I need to take advantage of this opportunity to go to a school that's considered a ""public ivy"" for free. On the flip side, W&amp;M is not the only school that can give me a full ride. I maxed out on financial aid due to being low income, so any school I apply to that guarantees 100% need based financial aid, I would receive a full ride--but I don't want to take that for granted bc I feel like the stigma of my mental health and my wiped out transcript would prevent my acceptance from a school of similar caliber. W&amp;M did give me a separate full tuition scholarship bc I am ""a minority who overcame extreme adversity"" and it comes with a fancy title and exclusive opportunities, but regardless, I wouldn't have needed it. People still ask why I would go somewhere else if I have this guaranteed free education at an awesome school. Even my own psychologist, who is normally great at being impartial, showed me that she's leaning toward me going back to W&amp;M this fall instead of applying to another university. I know in my heart that if it weren't due to the pressure I feel from others and the full ride, I would never go back there. 

I have isolated myself from abusive people (including my family) and harmful habits to reduce my triggers and heal, so I just live with my boyfriend now, work, and go to therapy. I get this feeling sometimes that if I closed the W&amp;M chapter of my life, it would help my healing even more. But is that enough to just say screw this awesome opportunity? Help :(",02Jun2018,1

I ask the lady if there are any groups that are going to climb and she says no. ""Ok..."" I said. She says I should advertise the climbing wall to people by climbing a bit myself.

I’m a sophomore in HS, basically a junior at this point though (I’m 15, nearly 16). All of my friend are seniors (17/18)  and leaving me to go to college. Most of my friends are older because I get along with them better humor-wise, experience-wise, etc. I obviously understand we get older and need to move on, as it’s for the best. However, I’m stuck in HS for two more years and will miss them dearly. I can’t see some of my friends during their breaks, as they are moving in addition to goin to college.

And just advice on situations like this, as it is definitely a common thing. 
  Growing up is odd, and you learn so much about yourself and develop so quickly.

My friends hate me. They hate me so much. All I ever do is be negative and awkward. I have exactly zero redeeming qualities. Why anyone would ever want to be around me is a mystery to me. There is nothing good about me. I'm a waste of oxygen and I should just leave this world, but I don't have the  courage to kill myself.

180,"I think I need some help parsing reality. I'm 36, a mother to a seven-year-old autistic child, and certainly not a 10 in the looks department. I've been divorced almost two years. The ex has nothing to do with his child, does not parent, but he does send child support. I'm not poor and all of our needs are taken care of. My family helps me and I'm able to work full-time outside of my home. I have good friends. I should be happy, and I mostly am, but there is this nagging desire to have an actual adult relationship. This is likely due to my sex drive. I admit it's higher than the average woman. 

Despite whatever desire I have, the presence of my son, no matter how much I love and admire him, makes relationships impossible. If he was ""normal"", people would probably be more inclined to take a chance on me. I don't blame anyone for not wanting to be involved in it. My life certainly isn't ideal. I find most people are looking for accommodating situations rather than an actual relationship. My situation will likely never be accommodating or easy. 

In light of all this, I have decided the best approach is to somehow exorcise this desire since it is impossible for me to attract a quality partner. I have hobbies and such, but the sex drive is the problem. I stopped dating. Any suggestion on how to ultimately get rid of this desire would be welcome. It's not overbearing, just annoying. Work doesn't help as it's a very boring low-level job.  It doesn't require any mental power. Maybe I'm an idiot and it suits me though. ",02Jun2018,6

183,"My apologies for the long post, so I will start with the tl;dr - Daughter and I have not gotten along since I moved our family a year ago, and now wants to move back to her formerly shitty dad's house.

She gave me a letter yesterday explaining how much she loves me, appreciates all that I've done for her, but that she wants to live with her dad. We had a 2-hour drive to discuss it yesterday, as I drove her to her dad's for the weekend. We live 4 hours apart, and meet halfway. The conversation went well until we were almost there, and she told me she feels our arguments are really traumatizing to her, and she feels safer with her dad and stepmom.

We lived in a different state until last summer, when work changes forced us to leave the area. We had planned to stay until she graduated high school, and the whole thing was incredibly stressful and trying on our family. We moved to an area closer to her dad and my parents. I feel like things changed between she and I at that time. Since that time, she quit eating dinner with us, stays in her room, and keeps me at a distance. She rarely does her chores without being told, and has generally a crappy attitude towards everything. Can't get her to smile for a family picture, can't hug her, can't talk to her without her grumbling and interrupting with, ""Are you done yet?"" I've really thought most of it was just her age and the recent stresses, but it's been really fracturing our relationship that had been so good and close before the move.  She constantly complains that her stepdad and I give her too many chores and ask too much of her - her chores are taking out the trash, walking the dog twice a day (she takes him outside long enough to pee, refuses to do a full walk), keep her room clean, keep her bathroom clean, and help with laundry. Additionally, she is expected to help after dinner - I cook and do the dishes, and she generally puts the previous day's clean dishes away or puts dinner away. With her stepdad having had 3 days off in the last 8 weeks with 10-12 hour workdays, I've been in full charge of house duties including picking up/dropping off the kids. She has a number of after school activities and rarely rides the bus home. The last 2 months have been extra stressful on us, and it came to a head about 2 weeks ago.

She had a nasty test that she was worried about, and I told her I would have a surprise for her when she got home. It was a short day at work, so before picking her and her brother up, I made the dough and filling for an apple pie. When she got in the car, she crowned and said, ""Oh, I thought you were getting me chicken strips from the store..."" She trumped and pouted the rest of the way home, then glared at me when I showed her the pie ingredients -  ""Mom, I've told you a hundred times I hate apple pie"". Yeah, I DID NOT remember that, as her tastes change so rapidly these days. At this point, I really did lose it and had a bad night - the stress was just too much, the attitude and ungratefulness was too much, and I cried. I got angry. I threw the pie stuff away and told her that I'm just done with all her B.S.. At one point, she just kept glaring at me, and I told her I just didn't know what to do with her anymore, that she gets good grades but doesn't respond to any discipline I hand out - and that I almost wish she was on drugs or something, because at least I know how to deal with THAT. I told her maybe she should live with her dad, because I just don't know how to handle her anymore. We made up later that night - sort of. I apologized profusely, told her we really need to find a middle ground, I need to chill out, she needs to help around the house and be kinder, etc... The last two weeks have actually been a bit nicer - she has been doing most of her chores without needing to be reminded, has been generally a nicer person, and has been making an effort to not snap at me for every little thing. I have had a few moments of wigging out on her (came home after work when she was off school for the day with her brother, both still in pajamas, house trashed, and I yelled ""REALLLY??? It's 4 p.m., you aren't dressed, the house is trashed, and you couldn't be bothered to make lunch for your brother yet???? FIX. IT. NOW."" I felt this was a pretty typical ""argument"" between a parent and teen, but she feels moments like these are traumatic and abusive.

Her dad and I broke up when she was 1, and she lived with him for a few years. I took her back when she was 6, after finding out from his sister's that he had been living in a car, dumping her off at her aunt's house for days/weeks but not giving her any money, staying on couches of his drug dealer, etc... I was in a different state at that time, so wasn't seeing this firsthand. We were both too broke for lawyers, but he agreed that she would be better living with my now-husband and I. There was lots of other nasty stuff that I heard about later, but have no proof. I simply vowed at that time never to let her go back. He has since cleaned up his act, gotten married, and has a third child on the way. While his life is better now, I have a hard time letting go of the past, and I don't trust him. He was VERY emotionally abusive to me during our realtionship (Telling me my family is a piece of shit, I'm too fat to get a better guy than him, the fuck's my problem not having dinner ready when he gets home, etc...) He now attends church and says he has changed, but I don't entirely beleive it. Our daughter doesnt remember the bad days with him, and generally doesn't believe me. Her dad is DEFINELTY on a pedestal in her eyes. 

I know I can't force her to stay. I guess I'm mostly afraid that these past years of him not caring for her, not paying for school stuff, not being there will just get swept under the rug while I look like the bad guy. I'm afraid that all I have done for her means nothing to her. There is sooooo much more to the story than I can type here, but isn't that how life goes?

I would love some advice. I'm not going to force her to stay, but I still worry. She has 2 years of high school left, and has already switched schools/states a year ago. I'm worried that our relationship will be damaged for many years to come. I worry that her dad isn't going to help her with college stuff, AP classes, scholarships, etc... I worry that she will regret the move, but I worry more that she won't.",02Jun2018,0
184,"I don't know what's the best way to bring this up, but I guess I should start from the beginning. I'm really lonely and depressed. And one thing that I really like to do is listen to audios when I have no motivation to open my eyes, text,move, or talk. Just listen. 

I don't know if there are any good sources for what I'm looking for. Kind of like audio about a friendship? But it's a little more complicated than that. I'm a lesbian. I often browse /r/gonewildaudio because listening to the voices really calms me down. However, I recently lost all sexual drive and don't really care for it anymore. As a result, I can usually only listen to the first 3 minutes of an audio (foreplay, or just friendship, talking) before I need to turn it off and find another one. 

What I'm really looking for is just some girl time, in an audio if that makes sense. A girl chatting with me, talking about life, about hope, about everything. (Except boyfriends, as I get jealous easily even when it's something like simply an audio). I want a platonic friendship audio chat (1 sided, but she'll say stuff like ""You're so beautiful"" and ask questions and make little pauses while I think of an answer. 

If there's anything like that out there, I would really like to know. Thank you so much. ",02Jun2018,1

The union contract with the company states that for the first year of employment, the union allows the company to terminate an employee at any time for any reason. This is a probationary period outlined in the contract. After that first year, the full union protection is provided to the employee. I am a few months into employment now, and the union officers expect us to wear union lanyards and once a week wear our union polos to show ""solidarity."" I just want to keep my job and I don't want to seem like I am battling the company, since the managers are non\-union I want them to be happy with my performance and attitude since they are the ones at the end of the day deciding my fate.

190," I was unfairly accused of cheating on a test, I did not cheat and there  wasn't any proof. I answered most of the questions on the test before I  went for a short restroom break. I came back shortly and noticed the  professor had made markings to the 2\-3 questions I haven't answered yet.  Right before I went outside the classroom I was still answering a  question that I wanted to go back to when I come back to the classroom. I  was more focused on getting every question I haven't even started that I  forgot about the unfinished question. I didn't realize I have forgot  about completing that question until a few minutes after I turned in the  test. I wanted to ask but I thought it was too late. but I ended up  asking if I can complete it about 15\-20 minutes after I turned in the  test. I think this is what made him think I might've cheated on the  test. He probably thought I looked up questions for the 2\-3 last  questions I answered which I didn't. He said that I had a different  style of writing for a few of my questions. There is no way he can judge  me by my writing if everything was written very short and brief. This  class has already ended for the semester but we haven't gotten out final  grades yet. He did mention that he believed me and not to worry about  it but he still seemed like he didn't believe me when he said it. I want  to explain it more to him through email I just don't know the best way  to go about it. I want to mention this and also ask where my grade stands/if it's been affected by this. Can someone please give me advice on how to address this through email? I would also appreciate direct messages for advice.  Thank you ",02Jun2018,1
191,"My grandad has a bunch of house/yard work that he continuously tells me I have to do.

Yesterday I spent my whole afternoon  \(1\-5\) helping take more shit from the house to the shed, packaging stuff he doesn't want in 80 degree weather.  I'm not saying the work is super challenging or that I can't handle it, but it's time consuming  and strenuous after awhile. Normally i'll gladly do a favor for someone. I carry stuff for people in my family and get things for them all the time but they never expect me to work for 5 hours or more without giving me something in return. \(for example my  uncle wanted me to help him move and he got me lunch from my choice of restaurant\). My  Grandadad doesn't even thank me for the work i did/do for him. Its like he thinks like I'm obligated to be his worker just because he provides the basic necessities to live. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I kind of feel selfish but at the same time when someone fores you to do work you're not even getting paid for and don't even say please or thank you when you finish, I don't see how you can expect them to go out and happily labor away in the heat with no question over and over.

194,"I didn't need hobbies until recently because my free time was filled with hate and suicidal plans due to work. I set my goal to exit the work force in shortest time possible and luckily achieved it through trading stocks and currencies.

Now that I have full ownership of my time and life, things don't suck quite as much. However, fact remains I've literally never had a single interest and fleshed out hobby since I was born.

Luckily, I've cultivated ironclad self discipline. Even though the thought of any given activity puts me to sleep, I've still tried a lot of them. Running, lifting, karate, boxing, snowboarding, traveling &amp; sightseeing, playing with swords, programming, gaming, VR, 3d printing... None of them do anything but bore me to death.

I used to like games, but games in 2018 are repetitive garbage money grab at best. I'm looking forward to good games on VR, but we're about a decade away from that.

I like money. Money is freedom. I spend some of each day researching my next trade idea, but this is neither enjoyable nor a passion. I have no desire to better myself in this craft. I have never watched a single video nor read a single book about it, and never will.

195,"So, I've been working in the field that I went to college for for over a year now and I got my first performance review. I know that I've struggled at times with certain aspects of the job, and this was less of a wake up call and more of an affirmation of what I've suspected and feared. The job calls for taking control and being confident when working with clients on projects, and sometimes my anxiety and depression which I deal with on and off can get in the way of that and make it difficult to project confidence.

The peer review section, where coworkers anonymously discussed where they think I can get better, basically included the same sorts of comments. They want me to speak up more, exude more confidence, and be more outgoing and extroverted in general on the job. They also believe that I have stints of nervousness and anxiety, which one person pointed out in their comment. 

Overall, my boss told me he was excited and happy with how much progress I've made and what I've accomplished in a year, and cant wait to see where I am at the end of this year, and left me with a generally positive feeling and clearly they want to keep me. But now I just have these nagging thoughts in the back of my head about never being able to become more confident, or speak out more, and failing because of it. I'm worried it's just part of my personality that I wont be able to change.

I'd love any perspectives or advice from people who have had to step out of their comfort zone and become more confident, or more of a leader at their job and have been successful. Am I overthinking this because it's my first job after college? I do want to improve and change, and I know theres some truth to what my coworkers and others have pointed out, but the truth hurts and I'm just not sure where to start.

196,"Long story short, my ex boyfriend 18[M]  and I 17 [F] were at a mutual friends house party and ended up arguing. I was getting ready to take off from the party, sitting at my car in front of the house, talking with a friend before starting the engine and taking off. While I was there talking with said friend, another “friend” (We’ll call him JC)  approaches the two of us and asks me if he could borrow my iPhone and call his girlfriend (whom I still go to high school with)  cause his phone is dead and she was getting mad at him for being at the party. Sure yeah, why not. I unlock my phone and hand it to him while he walks off a bit to go and “talk to his girlfriend”. After finishing up the chat with my friend before finally being ready to leave, I ask my friend to go back into the party and retrieve my phone from JC. At this point maybe (max) 10 minutes have passed since I lent out my phone and I was under the assumption he was talking to his girlfriend the entire time. Friend brings back my phone, I leave and go home. 

While I’m at home I ask another friend of mine and my ex-boyfriends (D) to keep an eye on my ex-boyfriend.. to not let him do anything stupid like try and leave the party or drink even more. 
As I’m chatting with D on Snapchat, he tells me that my ex-boyfriend just fought JC for going through my ex-boyfriends phone. As soon as I read that message I double pressed on my iPhone to check the apps that were last used and sure enough, my photo gallery was one that was recently used and one of my booty pics was right there as soon as I opened the app. I check the call log, he was on the phone with an unfamiliar number for only a minute long, I’m assuming it was his girlfriend. 

I freaked the fuck out, finally realizing that JC went through my phone too, but as I panic, my ex-boyfriend calls and tells me that from his iPhone which he also lent JC, sent MY booty pics, tit pics and lingerie pics from his phone to JC’s phone. JC had ex’s phone for maximum 5 minutes. Ex caught him in the act and rocked his shit, leaving him bloody and bruised. Other friends there at the party took JC’s to phone and apparently deleted everything from his google pixel. I’m not certain that he didn’t send my pictures from my phone to his, cause he could have deleted the message history from my phone before giving it back. But ex- boyfriend has the picture messages sent from his iPhone to JC’s google pixel. 

I went back to the party, to pick up ex-boyfriend and to potentially fuck this guy up myself but when I arrived the perverted coward had taken off. I spent all night crying and wondering if all the pictures actually weren’t deleted, or if they could be backed up somehow or if he had pictures from my phone and the ones from my ex were the only ones deleted. I have no idea what to do, Reddit. Can I take legal action against him? Will I get in trouble for 1.) Taking those pictures at age 16/17
 2.) sending those pictures to my ex 
3.) having those pictures on my phone ? 
Please don’t call me stupid, I already know this is my fault.. I just want to fix this. ",02Jun2018,3
197,"I'm a female and I worked for my boss \(female too\) for a couple of months before I quit recently. At first that woman seemed nice, she promised many things she never gave me and she used me more than anything. She started her company \(a private school\) because she is going through her mid\-life crisis but doesn't care about it at all. She is careless about the kids, is not feeding them properly, is always late, lies to the parents... 

I've basically done everything I could for the company \(it's just the two of us\). Made the website for free, painted the walls, created stuff.... she has no skill in anything. She is super rich and is used to use people. She doesn't get how things work in real life and is always in the red because of that. She complains about money a lot when I get min wage and over worked everydays.

Well, the thing is I felt so disgusted I quit, but I'm afraid because I know she is worst than careless and toddlers need a responsible adult to look after them. I know most of parents like me way more than they like her and they related on me to take care of their kids. I have private contact with some and let them now what's going on at school. 

Lot of money is missing in my last paycheck. She didn't pay me what she legally owes me \(it's ridiculous, I told her to take care of it or I would sue her\) and she is not sending the legal paperwork she has to. I need it.

I'm SO mad at this horrible person. She lies to the parents, she steals the kids' food, she let's her own kid act very violently every day... She tries to manipulate the other kids so they don't tell their parents what's going on.

I would like to make her pay and stop her. Do you have any idea ?",02Jun2018,2
198,"I currently live with my father , my grandpa, my grandma, and my cousin . My aunt is moving back in because she got divorced and has 2 kids and one of them is autistic and it drives me crazy . I can’t stand noise at all , and I get mental breakdowns when I here them to much , Ive been put on meds for anxiety but in reality it doesn’t really work well for me . My dad is schizophrenic , he always does crazy things like how he jumped out my window because he said he saw someone and walked into the woods and I had to get my grandpa to go get him . My dad also walks around at 2am with a baseball bat and a flashlight , and he looks around for video cameras and always obsessives over the window, and he always blast the tv and I can’t sleep at night cause his room is right across but I can never say anything cause I’m afraid he will start acting up and I rather him watch tv and just lay there then go around making havoc around the house. My dad goes through “ fazes” as I call it where he’s crazy and then goes back to normal . He is on medication but no matter what he still gets these  “ fazes”.  Every-time my dad acts up my grades suffer from me worrying about my father and I have really bad social anxiety and have had to go home many times in school for it . When my dad acts up I usually miss school cause my brain can’t handle me not being near my dad when I know he’s going through his “ fazes”. My dad drives me crazy but no matter what he does I can’t hate him cause he can’t help it since he’s mentally ill. I use to previously live with my mom who lives a few hours away from my dad ,my mom got a new boyfriend while I moved and had a kid with me he’s about 2-3 now and go figure her boyfriend gets charged with all these child’s pedo crap from his previous wife who had a daughter and the daughter claims he touched her and then her cousin also claimed he touched her so my moms bf is in a big situation. My mom use to abuse me “ nothing like we’re I would be in the hospital “ but my mom has anger management and would take it out on me and I moved in with my dad around age 12 because she threw a large ass doll at me and I was petrified , and before I moved my dad didn’t Believe me but he did when I showed him a long zipper mark gash when my mom whipped me with my sweater cause I was taking to long to get in the bath and as soon as I got naked WHIP. I have a very bad case of insomnia and I always have nightmares when I found my dad have an overdose in the shower when I was around 9 and I saw him flopping on the floor like a fish . My dad has went to rehab he did for a few months and guess what he made friends with a bunch of guys in rehab and as soon as they all got out THEY ALL DID DRUGS TOGETHER. My dad doesn’t do hard drugs anymore is what he tells me, but he does smoke cigarettes and weed for sure since he always makes weed cookies . I have a bunch of mental issues and have gone to therapy “ didn’t work “ but nothing compared to my dad for sure. My grandma who lives were my mom lives offered me to live with her , she lives in the apartment building right across from my moms. Me and my mom have patched things up through the years after we didn’t talk for the first year and a half when I moved with my dad .

18 years ago, when I moved to a new city I've made a first friend. We lived in the same building and been friends although we didn't go to the same schools, and eventually developed different interests.

The day after tomorrow that friend is going to turn 31. He is severely depressed. On active medicament treatment for the last 5 years. He didn't finish College, never worked, never had a girlfriend. The only interest in his life is World Of Warcraft. 

I say he is ""addicted"" because WOW is not really an addiction, it's a distraction. I have a personal experience with depression and I can understand him to some level.

It's his birthday and I don't know what to get him. I guess that the new WOW expansion would be the gift that would have made him happy. But on another hand, I feel like I am participating in his self-destruction. He is killing himself slowly. He is playing wow, drinking 3l of Coca-Cola a day and sleeping. Day after day. For a long time.

But also, sometimes I think maybe he just needs to get totally saturated by that. And that might help him understand that he might need to explore other options.

214,"I am 24 years old, Indian resident. I would like to leave my country to find a better life for myself.  
I always wanted to pursue better education because the one my country provides is almost worthless. I am too poor to earn my way to success. I mostly educated myself on the internet, and I make just enough money to survive by writing content. And most of my clients don't even pay the agreed amount. Our legal system works at a snail pace, and the organizations are aware of this. So suing to get my money back is out of question. We don't have good health system or roads or food or anything that values human life. We have constant power failures and water shortages. Most of the people are abused by their employers and nothing can be done because we need to survive. I am sick and tired of battling the system and trying to survive. Unless you are rich, you cannot get by in this country.  


I do not have any family to rely on, and no one would miss me if I was gone. I am very miserable , I just want to live a decent life with food, water, shelter and a little respect. So, what are my options here? What can I do to migrate to a better life? Or am I stuck here for the rest of my life unless I find ways to make a lot of money or die?  


Please advice.

218,"Being here *again* is making me cringe internally. It's like I've learned nothing. It's really pointless too because advice rarely helps me and I just waste my time. 

I tried learning to draw once, had no idea what I was doing, just read some stuff, did the lessons at drawabox, drew some objects and bugs and plants and whatever. But I gave up because I had an embarassing episode and got overwhelmed and threw everything away and forgot about it.

Now I tried again. This time I even found a really respectable studio where I could take a drawing course! I'm on the waiting list in case someone gives up and a slot opens up for me to take in the second semester. It's 5 months and it's supposed to be an 'academical' course, teaching you from the ground-up, like, the first class would be about how to wield the pen/your arm etc. Literally from zero. 

But it just overwhelms me so much!!! I feel completely lost and everything seems so difficult and out of the ordinary and I'm also very impatient and lazy! The lessons at drawabox.com teach you about fundamentals like forms on 3d space, lines etc, i did a lot of them once but I don't want to do them all again because they're boring, so I've been mostly drawing stuff from pictures, without thinking much on any lesons just trying, I definitely learned something from them, and also from the 3 books I read ( not to completion ), but still...

It's so upsetting! I keep reading other people's rants about their frustration with beginning to draw and even made a post myself at an art subreddit. People can give such long, elaborate replies but...they just don't help me! They're too damn figurative, too damn vague and artsy and I have no idea where to go! I'm supposed to treat art as this challenging mystery of life that's supposed to be only overcome through my great ambitions or whatever but I'm not ambitious! I'm easy-going. I like things to be easy and straightfoward...I'm not sure if I want to become a great artist, I just wanted to ahhh... I don't know! I have a great imagination and I like art, especially the art from the games and stuff I play and read and watch! That's that. 

I don't know what I want! IF I get through the waiting list for the course I may join it, but it would only start after july! There's a lot of time until then, and I know I have to at least draw everyday but I just can't bring myself to try and learn anything because I'm afraid I'll just give it all up again! But I also can't just stagnate...I don't know. It's just such a mistery! You know all those artists on tumblr and deviantart? All those people just drawing things regularly and making funny and cool stuff, and all they talk about is about improving their art and their progress and whatnot? But their art already looks fine...It's such a big mistery how they got to where they are now...I just don't understand it at all. I don't understand any of it. And when I look at all the work other beginners make I feel threatened, because obviously they're around my level but they're just so much better! They're so much more diligent and seem like they have it all figured out but I'm lazy...I'm not stupid, so yes I can see this is just some standard self-esteem issue but whatever. 

Maybe I want some more solid, detailed advice? Some guidance? Tips? I don't know, I just want something I can grasp better than 'oh art is about mileage, it's an amoeba that sucks everything around it, it's not straightfoward and formulaic, practice practice practice ( repeat ad infinum ), keep drawing'. I've had enough of that...maybe the problem is with me, but none of that helps me. Enters through one ear and exits through the other. Flies right through me. 

Look, if someone would be so kind as to PM me I could talk about the art/artists I think I'm most interested about more in-depth, and maybe that would serve as some light as to what I look up to in art? I thought about them a little and I think I can describe them, I could also show some examples on discord to clarify things.

Im only 20 and have used braces in the past, so I’m worried about my gums they’re not all gone. Its just a little off the bottom middle teeth. My top gums seem unaffected.

221,"I just went to a known massage ""wellness spa"" (but it was actually a massage parlour) here nearby our area. It was being advertised on a site where massage with ES were. But I never knew that these wellness spa offered ES because they were featured on a video at YouTube that promotes how good their massage is (in a legit way). That's why I was curious about that wellness spa. So I went up to that place, and it was kind of normal spa. They have private room quarters for massage clients. It was clean and they really change the stuffs after a customer is. At first, I really think that they really offer ES, but I could be wrong at the same time. So, when the therapist came, I took off my robe, and I was wearing my underwear while massaging. The massage was good, but I felt that at somepoint of the massage, she was kind of pointing the pressure flow to my p***s that slowly I felt being aroused, but I tried to think of a difficult math problem and remember my lesson (I am reviewing for a big exam as well) to let me turn off. Then, it felt like a normal massage, but when she came back from getting a hot towel, she said that she would be doing ""lingam massage"" (a massage for the penis that would result as well to hj). At first she just did the lingam massage, then she suddenly told me that she would do the release for hj for additional. I had no choice because she was doing it already so I waited a few moments to get the release. At the end, I realized that the place was really offering ES. I realized that sometimes even on video or TV features that they provide a good quality, it may also mean bad when you are already there. It was first time as well to do this kind of thing. The reason why I did this HJ only was because I was afraid of STD, and HIV if I took the ATW (All The Way). I felt guilty because I am never this kind of person. But wait, that doesn't end the day. This happened in the afternoon.

After thinking of another very first class massage parlor in our area that I was curious as well, I went there too because I had been reading on forums about this spa. I went there, and when I entered there, I can't believe that what they wrote and post online about the place were what I really saw there. The place was very social, and it was indeed a expensive but satisfying for many. I then chose a masseuse from the so called aquarium (where they were watching TV from a hit evening show in my country, PHL, and while watching, they are trying to seduce me to look good when I am choosing), then I came back to the counter to tell the chosen woman I chose. Then, I was assisted by some guys to the room. There, the room was like in a hotel, only that it was cheaper room but like on a 3 star hotel like room. Then, a few minutes later, she came (the masseuse I chose). She then asked me if I was going to go for the massage only or with the you know.. At first I was kind of hesitated and very shy. It was awkward because I couldn't speak to her much because of how awkward I am. Then, she told me that she had a son already so I assume to my head that she was a single mom trying to do this job for her kid, before she took off her clothes. As she took off, I also took mine. I was still shy that I immediately went to the shower first, and I took it for me at the start. Then I realize, that it was really part of the service that both of us would get shower. So I just asked her like I don't know about it. Then, I asked her if it was okay to her. Then she agreed, and she bathed me. Then before I left her to shower herself, she touched my dick (who was erecting at that moment of time because we were both naked), and went on to the bed to wait for her. Then, she asked what do I want to do. I just told her that I want a massage first, then just a BJ and HJ only. The BJ was done with condoms so it was really protected. It was actually my first time with a naked woman in front of me and doing to me. There was no sexual intercourse like in the early massage I had on that day because of the usual issue. Then she realized after asking me that I don't have a GF and I am single, she then knew that I was a virgin (which I am still now). She was shocked that it was really my first time with her (but not in a coitus way).

I felt guilty because, this is not who I want to be. Although these things started because of fantasies in porn like ""nuru massage"" or ""happy ending massage,"" but it was mostly because of curiosity, and stress out in life. I felt that some people on the massage parlor I went on the second on that night was thinking of me as a pervert, which I am not. In fact, I had a chat with the masseuse after our session before giving her tip. She said that she got pregnant early, and that she is 24 years old now (which means she got pregnant way too early). I learned that before this massage, she worked as a waitress, cashier, service crew for a restaurant, and so on before ending up on the massage parlor. She said that she recently split up with her son's Dad so that makes her a single Mom. She just finished High School so that means she never studied or stopped on studying in college. I told her to try to study for her own good so that she wouldn't work on that place. That's how nice I am. I even shared some jokes, and she even told me that due to her situation, some massage clients of her offered to help her study to which she declined. (Because of course, lets admit it, these clients would just be nice to her in the beginning but just waiting for her to offer back the favor). So I also told her that scenario to which is why she agreed to me. She asked me also if I would have sex with her if she told me that she was single and no son. I just couldn't tell her the truth that I am afraid of having an intercourse due to STD and HIV even if there was a condom, so I just told her instead that another reason why I wouldn't have sex with her that she was cute and beautiful, but its more than sex to me, that it is more on the personality of the woman that I look on.

I just felt guilty after I used money just for a temporary pleasure. Though its my first time, and I never had sex, but I kind of need a way to forgive my self, and move on from what happened. I was just relieved that no sexual intercourse happened, but should I feel guilty for what I did? (using a portion of my allowance just for this), and lastly, what do you think should I do in order for me not to do it again (because I wanted to make sure that when I have a real sex, it would be to someone I love) I don't like to be a pervert. I am kind of a nice guy, though nerdy. I know that masturbating is morally bad, and I admit it was, but I think I still do it despite numerous times. From watching porn and masturbating, I got to upgrade myself (for this first time and hopefully the last one) to massage parlors. Do you think would I ever not go to the massage parlor again and expect ES? or would I really moved on to these whole thing?",02Jun2018,2
222,"I’ve been been dating this girl for 7 months and I think she’s great. We both love each other a lot, and we are each other’s first loves. She was raised Catholic, so we don’t have sex. For quite a while I have asked if we could go to third base on each other since sex isn’t an option, and she agreed but will not let me go down on her. However last night I found out that a few years ago, she let another guy go down on her. She dated this guy a shorter time than me and never loved him. 

I feel sick to my stomach thinking about it. She’s says it’s not me, it’s just that what she wants has changed, and I guess that makes since but I can’t deny that it still hurts my heart to imagine this other guy doing that all the while she is rejecting me.

223,"Gonna be long, but I appreciate advice. There's a TL;DR at bottom.

I took a class through what I'll call Office A (I believe that was in late February or early March) that explained the benefits of a certain loan type . After the class I immediately made an appointment to talk to Realtor A because I thought I had to go with that office since they were the ones who did that class. When I first met with her, she made it clear I was not signing a contract and I was free to choose whomever to be my realtor. 


Once my loan was approved, I gave Realtor A a list of a few houses I had saw and liked. She did not meet with me and show me available houses on the market in my price range and area of interest - she just waited for me to give her a list .  The first one we viewed I wanted to make an offer on, which when I asked Realtor A if making a full price offer and asking for a few appliances (washer, dryer, fridge) to be left sounded fair, she said it did - I'm a first time home buyer so I was depending on her to help me. The deal did not end up going through. I was discouraged but continued to move forward. My mom approached Realtor B (a friend of my parents) about that experience and Realtor B showed my mom houses that could work for me, but I wanted to stick with Realtor A since I thought (at that time) she was doing okay and I also felt like I couldn't switch. And it was awkward and I was stressing out - not good reasons, I'll admit.

I then provided A with another list of houses that we viewed, one of which was House SW.

When we viewed that house I took my mom with me and on Realtor As walk through, I saw no benefits to owning it since there were a few issues and could not see past the flaws, and she did not offer any possible resolutions. 


Realtor A showed me another house that I loved (House FK), but the taxes were too high for the loan - something she never knew was an issue or at least never told me - I was under the impression only the asking price and square footage mattered. This shocked me since the tax-cap affected a few houses we saw already which worried me since I had a time limit for my loan. She told me I would be capped at an offer $20K below their asking but she would contact the seller's realtor to find out of she would work with me. The payments would also be over $1200. Realtor A let me know that the seller wasn't interested in such a low offer but I could still submit an offer to ""try to get it"". When I told her it wasn't worth pursuing especially since that was a monthly payment I could not afford, I did not hear from her for 3 days. She never contacted me to offer to show me houses that she knew of or to see if I had others I wanted to view.


I have known Realtor B for a long time, and when I first told her I was submitting an application for the loan she was at my place of work and pulled several houses up on her phone to show me (early March). She advised me then questions I need to ask, what to look for and she recommended I make a list of needs in a house. I want to re-iterate that I didn't use her since I thought I had to go with Realtor A.

 Fast forward to after the House FK (which both my parents accompanied me to see) and viewing an additional one, my parents voiced concerns that Melissa was inexperienced and couldn't answer questions such as:  the value of the house, comps of the area, is the house worth that price, etc.. They asked me to go meet with Realtor B and schedule a showing. 


I did, and the house we saw, Realtor B blew me away with her knowledge. She explained to me boiler and heater brands and what to look for (leaks, evidence of regular maintenance or lack of), roof types, etc.. The house we saw was beautiful but Realtor B pointed out some foundation concerns and advised me to keep looking since this house for the price it was at and the errors we saw on the surface - it wouldn't be a good fit for me.


I texted Realtor A to let her know I was going with Realtor B. She responded and asked if she did anything wrong and to let her know so she can improve and do better. I responded and told her she did not do anything wrong, Katie just had better answers. (that was earlier on 5/8, before I saw Houses SW with Realtor B) I was attempting to be diplomatic, but I realize now a more direct and firm answer would have been better. 


Realtor B wanted to take me back to House SW (since I was down to my number 4 choice of houses) and when I explained my initial problems with the property, she pointed out the benefits of that house and talked to me about what could be fixed/ upgraded. She also advised me to offer less that what they were asking to get a better deal. After talking extensively to her, I decided to make an offer in the late evening of 5/8. A house that I once saw as a problem was now a house I could put sweat equity into and make it mine. The offer was accepted and we continued down the process. 

On May 10, Realtor A texted me, basically sarcastically explaining how realtors make money. I did not respond as I felt it was unprofessional on her part. She also left a voicemail for Realtor B demanding to know why I was now working with her, and then called and talked to her 2 times. 

So now Realtor A is saying B stole me away and is demanding the commission.

 Realtor B did not steal me away from  realtor A.  Once I walked through a house and saw all that A wasn't doing, I lost faith in her ability to help me and I wasn't sure she wanted to help me find a good house that wouldn't nickle and dime me, only to find one so she could be paid. B on the other hand, had more information than I needed and was honest in her opinions on the houses I saw. As a first time buyer, I needed that honesty. 

TL;DR - Ex- Realtor is unhappy I switched because of her lack of expirience, so now she's demanding the commission from my current realtor. I'm pissed and not sure what I should do. The brokers are involved,  and I sent the above info to my current real estate office's broker.

225,"I’m graduating high school next Thursday and I just feel like everything is ending, and it’s making me feel sad. I don’t want to fee sad about it, I want to look back on it and see how much fun I had, because I did have fun, but I keep looking back and regretting so much stuff now. I wasn’t popular but I was friends with all the popular people I just never hung out with them, we just knew each other and a few I knew more than others. I wish I was able to put myself out there, I wish I played football, did ASB, stuff like that where you’re introduced to much more people, instead I stayed closed off because at the time I was lazy and thought I had enough friends and didn’t seem it worth it. Now I’m slowly realizing I could have ended up with better friends and I just never took that chance. 

A lot of these “popular” people wrote in my yearbook that they wish we got to know each other better, and as cliche as it sounds I feel like I wasted so many opportunities to have more close better friends. I never talked much, I’m not too shy, I can talk in front of people without a problem, just in high school looking back on it I’m already regretting not talking a lot, not putting my self out there to make more friends, when I easily could have. 

I also have a super close family friend that’s been with me since I was 3 and they told me they were moving to North Carolina for college (I’m in California). Which is crazy because it just feels like everything is over and it’s scary having it all start again in college, it doesn’t feel right. I’m going to a junior college near my high school for General Ed as are the majority of people from all the high schools somewhat near me are doing. So I’ve been told it’s like a “second high school but without the drama”. So I think I’ll know a lot of people there. 

I would just like to ask for advice on how to turn this feeling of regret in high school into something I can use to better my self instead of dwelling on it and making me feel more sad. I wouldn’t normally say hi to many people in the hallway or when they walk into class, but I want to change that in this last week and when I go to college, I just don’t know how. I want to be happy and smile about us moving onto the next chapter instead of getting sad that I didn’t put my self out there.

227,"19M. I'm currently in the military, and if the army has taught me one thing, it's that you can control people through fear by being unpredictable, i.e. no one knows what you want or when you might lash out, so they exist only at your pleasure.

I've been practising this principle on my own parents, whom I extremely dislike, but also need to keep in line as I'll be needing their money for college. So basically one moment I'd be a normal and loving through slightly aloof son, and the next I'd be throwing things around and barking commands until I get what they want. Either that, or I'd completely ignore them when they speak to me, in order to keep them guessing at what I'm expecting from them; in this state they often act very cautiously because they know that the consequences of pissing me off won't be pretty.

So far my abuses of them have been strictly verbal/emotional, i.e. I haven't used physical force on them yet. I'm wondering if this method is sustainable though? So far I've only been using it for trivial purposes, but at the end of the day if my parents really withhold my college funds then there's nothing much I can do unless I employ physical force (and somehow get away with it).

235,"So, I'm having problems with my best friend.  For some reason, she just hates the idea of me bringing my boyfriend around.

Now, it wasn't always like that. In the beginning of our relationship, she would want to come to his house and hang out, and do stuff with us. We didn't mind, and there weren't any problems with that. He would join us when we hung out, and it was cool since we all started out as friends. 

For some reason now, I ask if he can tag along to little things like group movies, baseball games, movie nights \(only when we have the idea of inviting other people\), and she wrinkles her nose and tells me no. She says we're too clingy and all over each other, but to be honest, we've mellowed out since the beginning where she was doing everything with us. She didn't complain then, so we're a bit miffed she is now. 

Plus, anyone that has experienced us hanging together, says we are fine on the PA. My boyfriend doesn't like being too affectionate in public because he finds it a little inappropriate anyways, so we're never super romantic in front of others\- besides holding hands and like we occasionally sneak in a kiss. 

I get maybe we don't see it all, and maybe we make her uncomfortable in some respect, but another weird thing is that, when its just her and I, she brings around her guys \(yes, she has more than one\). 

She likes to bring two of the guys shes seeing around to things we do, and often times I will end up being a third wheel. Just recently, I was spending the night at her house, and she had one come over, where she would cuddle up to him and such. It didn't bother me in the least, but later in the evening, they ended up having sex while I was just outside the room. 

Today, i asked her if we could take my boyfriend along to baseball event we were going to. He's not from our town and hasn't been to a lot of sports things in our area yet. So, I thought it would be cool to have him there. We invited other people, and she even invited her guys, but no one could come. So, it wasn't like it was just the two of us kind of thing.

236,"I am 17 and have never really had a boyfriend or relationship. Something I'm going to put first but I don't actually know if it is relevant is that I am pretty sure I'm bisexual, I have never been in a relationship with a girl but again Iv'e never really been in a relationship at all so I don't know if this has anything to do with my problem. 

When I was 13-14 I had what I guess was probably was my closest thing to a boyfriend. We didn't go on dates or anything but we texted a lot and often hung out in groups were we would get drunk and then go off an makeout. Since then I have had this sort of odd thing that feels like a problem. 

I will talk to guys and have really great conversations and hang outs, I will be really crushing on this person and in my head will imagine us in a relationship etc and really would like a boyfriend. But almost always when a boy leans in to kiss me etc I will pull away, probably leave and then no longer talk to them. I don't know why I keep doing this especially as I genuinely really like them. Almost as soon as I leave I wish I hadn't, but am never brave enough to go back especially as I can't be sure it wouldn't just happen again. I don't even think about it either it will happen so fast. On the rare occasion that I don't pull back it will be a very short kiss that I will quickly end and wouldn't have enjoyed. Another thing is I don't mind them touching me in fact I quite like it when whoever I'm talking too is quite hands on with me on my thighs,bum, arms idk anything really, BUT as soon as they want to kiss me I'm no longer into it. 

I just don't get it. I don't even know I'm doing it, its like my actual body gets out of there before I even think about it. I usually am flirting/talking to whoever I am with the full intention of doing stuff and then I just don't.. or can't.. I don't really know. 
someone please either give me advice or explain why I might do this because I actually would like a relationship and I keep on doing this which obviously completely makes any guy I'm talking too think I'm not interested. ",02Jun2018,2
237,"My roommate( her parents bought house I rent from  and my roomate has her own agreement with them) has an eating disorder and is super super skinny/thin she’s awaiting treatment facility. All winter she has had the house temp set to 80 and then the basement fireplace full blast and she is always home using the oven. Therefore all winter house was 83-85. Which i could handle as I would open windows and being below 0 it would cool the place. I discussed with roomate before summer started I do not want house so hot we agreed keep at 77 and no fireplace. Fast forward to now hot humid weather. I will come home a lot of times and thermostat is SET to 80 and the fireplace is still on low. Right now we both keep just changing the temps I’ll change back down to 77 and she’ll turn it back up etc etc. I find it absolutely ridiculous having the thermostat set to that high and having s fire place. 

I understand she has zero fat to keep warm but she can buy a space heater or heated blanket. I don’t think I should have to buy cold fan or air con or something when we have an air conditioner.

239,"I'll start with the story, there's a big sports club in our community let's just call them Club A. Now Club A hosts different sports but mainly focuses on soccer, almost half of Club A's players are interested in hockey than soccer.

Club A do not handle the hockey rules and competition really well, the club tends to change the rule according to their will. A good amount of these players do not like that.

These bunch of players decided to create their own club, Club B which focuses on hockey using international rules and focuses on competitiveness.

Now here's the drama...

Club A does not like that these players made Club B. Club A wants to have the power to hosts all these sports.

Club B made the club so that it's for everyone, a person/team doesn't need to be a member of the club to participate in the competitions, Club B is also willing to accept other clubs to participate in the competitions.

Club A is playing the dictator card and forces their players to become members otherwise they can't join Club A's hosted competitions. Club A also restricts their members to join another club's competition especially Club B's.

Club A also made sure that members of Club B can't join Club A's competitions and events

Club A started to talk bad of Club B on social media. Club B decided that it'd be better to not retaliate and keep a good reputation.

Now for the advice. 

1.) What do you think Club B should do to get enough player base to be successful?

2.) How should Club B handle Club A's attacks and threats?

Any other inputs concerning Club B would be appreciated.",02Jun2018,0

How to come to terms that if you work you only get a slice of the pie and someone is getting rich off your ass

How to come to terms that in order to get money, you have to be someone's bitch and basically suck the dick of the boss or manager and get little pay and be incredibly disrespected and used and taken advantage of until you are no longer needed and then fired and thrown away because there is no employer/employee loyalty

How to come to terms that despite the amount of money I may get from any direction I get, it is going to worth less and less because of inflation and really rich people already taking advantage of the system to get even richer and I get thrown into the poor end struggling to survive; just trying to get food, pay bills and actually have some sort of safety net of money because anything related to the government is being removed

244,"Sorry this is a long one. Tl;dr accepted a job offer, romanticized the idea but once I actually signed and accepted my offer, started to have a lot of, what I feel are, valid reservations. 

The company I work for liquidated and I felt compelled to move out of state to Seattle or San Francisco. I landed a job in San Francisco, but now am really reconsidering it. I’m not in tech and will not be making nearly enough to maintain my standard of living (currently in the Midwest). 

They’re not paying for relocation either so my family would have to help out. In the end moving there could COST $10k before I’ve even received my first paycheck. I’d have to live with multiple roommates and potentially get a second job. Im 25 and do not want to be dependent on my parents forever, I’d like to start accumulating savings and hopefully by a house one day. San Francisco was never a place I saw myself settling down in so I’m not sure this is the right move now since it’s going to actually cost me money to work there. 

Secondly, family is really important to me. I’m extremely close with my family and right now I only live about 2 hours away from them. San Francisco is also not a city conducive to starting a family so I feel like this decision is opposite of that. 

I’m frustrated that none of this was on my mind before, it all came flooded to me once I signed that piece of paper. I don’t think I’m in a mentally stable state to make a move like this, even though I was so “sure” before, I didn’t realize all of the components because I had the idea romanticized in my head. 

I’m 99% sure I’m going to call them Monday and tell them after sitting down and really looking at all the costs with my family and searching for apartments I can’t reasonably make this move.

We’ve been married for a year, and are both practicing Christians, meaning we didn’t have sex before we were married.

Anyway, I used his phone tonight to text one of his friends on his behalf while he is sleeping. I’ve only ever snooped in his phone once before, but felt guilty and stopped quite quickly. Tonight though, I had a look in one of his chats with his best friends. In there, I found a list of all the girls my husband would like to fuck, or wishes he did before he married me. He also said how much he would love to “thumb the butt” of my coworker/friend, and said how he wishes he could have an exemption from being married so he could fuck has many girls as possible.

248,"I like to write, so does my best friend. She got me started on Wattpad, an app and website where you can publish books/stories and people can read them there (for those who don't know). 

On the app, you can see how many people have read and voted on a chapter. Whenever I post something new, she immediately votes on it (which might sound like a good thing but she does it immediately after I post and I usually post between 1,000-2,000 words a chapter, you don't read that in 1 minute). I know she doesn't read it. Then, she'll tell me it was such a good chapter with nothing else. No advice or tips or corrections. 

I know I shouldn't expect that from her because she's not an editor or anything. I read all her works and comment/vote and talk about her stuff with her. I don't expect the same from her but I also don't want to be lied to. 

She always says things like 'oh I can't wait to read your new chapter' but never reads it. 

I often go to her for advice. Early on, I didn't because I never wanted to spoil things for her, until I realized it didn't matter cause she didn't read it. Even now though, I'll say something about what I have to happen and she just agrees. She'll never be like 'oh well this reaction sounds more like x than z because x is more temperamental'. 

Again, I know I shouldn't expect this from her. It's just a bummer that she's interested but not enough to go the mile. 

I've already told her she doesn't have to read what I publish but she'll always respond with 'no, I like to read what you write' or 'your idea sounds very interesting, I want to read it'.

Anyway, how do I tell her that I know she's lying? She hates confrontation so I know she just won't respond until later and be like 'what were we talking about'.

249,"Before I give the backstory, I need to give some context (though some details have been changed). I'm essentially a TA for a musical youth group that has performed internationally biennially. Of course, since the performers are quite young, their parents come along for the travels. The person in charge is very, very cautious about the group's reputation and anything, or in this case anyone, that can ruin it. 

As anyone who has ever travelled overseas knows, a tourist in a foreign country is viewed as an ambassador to their own, and should act with utmost respect to their surroundings. This is especially true in the place we toured in a few years ago, where politeness isn't just a courtesy, it is a basic expectation. It didn't even take a single day for this Hellspawn of a parent to show everyone just how abhorrent at diplomacy they were. Hellspawn berated the hotel concierge because Hellspawn's credit card was declined, even though it was their own fault for not calling the company in advance. Hellspawn berated them again later the same day because ""their room was small and disgusting"" despite the room being very clean and the rates being one of the cheapest in a sea of expensive hotels. Even the next day, as breakfast was being served until a certain time, Hellspawn chose to take a smoke break outside the hotel, and came in to find breakfast no longer being served, and took it out on the concierge again! All of this in the span of 24 hours within entering the country. And that's just scratching the surface.

Hellspawn is also extremely manipulative, and has a habit of psychologically targeting certain children who rub them the wrong way. For example, one of the kids had a period where he felt unconfident in his ability, and suddenly he was making improvements to his playing faster than most of the group. As his confidence was growing, he made an offhand comment that he can play more pieces than Hellspawn's daughter. How did Hellspawn retaliate? By isolating the kid, admonishing him harshly behind every other adult's backs, and sending his confidence once again into a downward spiral. This isn't anything new for Hellspawn either. Hellspawn did the same thing to another kid who may have been a bit hyperactive, and his sister had the audacity to stand up for him and reassure her brother that he didn't do anything wrong. Hellspawn's response? Call the two children's parents privately and tell them all about their ""bad behavior"" in hopes of getting them punished. It almost worked too, since the parents called the group's director to apologize on their children's behavior, only to be told that none of it was true, and to the contrary, they were model students.

The trouble with Hellspawn is that we can't exactly kick her and her daughter out of the group. Hellspawn can easily tarnish the group's reputation if we do that, even if what Hellspawn says isn't exactly true, but a lie travels halfway around the world by the time the truth ties its shoelaces. On the other hand, if Hellspawn sticks around, then their actions will represent us. Damned if we do, damned if we don't. Either way, Hellspawn and their child are still going with the group to that country in a few months, and we need a contingency plan of sorts to deal with their shenanigans.

So my question is, how the hell is one supposed to deal with a person like this?",02Jun2018,3

258,"I went to this rather competitive school for a degree in acting. I pay a minute amount for school because of the generosity of scholarships and my old test scores from high school. I chose this degree and school mostly in part because of how beneficial it was in cost/prestige (which is somehow both relevant and not relevant in the theatre world). 



I have been ""booking"" summer shows and am currently in a show that is housing me and paying me the whole summer. Trying to speak without an ego, I can do my job well. I struggle with longevity, but I can do it well. I act and sing. Woo. 




But coming up to my last year, I realized through doing show after show back to back that I really detest the community that revolves around this craft. While the aspect is what got me into it in the first place, and usually what makes me stay, it has shown me time after time that there is a sincere lack of professionalism in the area. This is my first taste of the life of an actor (shows always) and I don't really enjoy it. The pay off is, what, ten seconds of glory and your high school Facebook friends sending you messages telling you good job?






Something inside of me wants to pursue some form of higher education. Something in which I can put the hard work that I do for something that doesn't even really require hard work, to use. I skated by in high school and bullshitted my way to GPA, using my memorization skill as a way to pass without diving into anything but theatre and the military. I've loved computers all my life and I've taken one Java class but I haven't done math or logistics in nearly 6 years. 






I want to use my brain for something. I cannot continue being a monkey. I am not an artist, I can only fake it. But I'm starkly terrified of how to dive into something else. My uncle, a huge influence in my life, tried to get me to do stem and I explained to him that I didn't have the scholarships to warrant paying so much for a bachelor's in science. He said something along the lines of ""do whatever for bachelors, just get the degree, then do something worthwhile for masters""




Is this true? Can I dive into something in which I've no experience thus far in? I'm just looking for some sort of guidance. I'm in an uncomfortable comfort in my current place in that I know I can do this as a career but I don't want to. Thank you for your time.",02Jun2018,1

260,"Backstory: So I graduated high school with this guy not too long ago. He was one of the very few people in my group of acquaintances \(I tend to stay in small friend groups, and usually made friends with smarter, wittier people\). Back in high school this guy was always a little off, he was smart and witty like most of my friends, but definitely needed some work in the socialization department. I should also mention that we were more acquainted with each other on a basis that we had some mutual friends, but were never super close. Anyways, In high school I was always a little weirded out by the things he would do. For instance, he would tell me the classes he was planning on taking, and then he would ask me what I was going to take. Then, all of the sudden, he would tell me the next week that he ""changed his mind"" and ""coincidentally"" ended up with the \*exact\* same classes I told him I was taking the week prior. It definitely seemed weird to me, but in high school I would've rather had at least 1 person I knew in the class as opposed to being in that class alone. It was really odd to me that out of anyone in our friend group, he was mimicking my life the most out of anyone, and we weren't even that close. It's a good thing that he ended up in different periods for some of those classes, but I still was spending about 60&amp;#37; of my day in the same classes as him.

Similar to the situation just mentioned, when the end of our sophomore year was coming around, he asked me what my plans for summer were going to be. I told him I was planning on taking a specific math course so that I could get ahead in math and maximize my AP/college credits while in high school. Only 2 weeks later, and he tells me that he now has the same plans as I do \(now I'm sure you can see the pattern\). At this point I knew he was flat out trying to follow me because something told me that he couldn't stand the idea of me being in a different class than him. It was around this point that I started thinking ""Just make it through high school, and try to lose him in college"". Interestingly enough, he applied to the \*exact\* same colleges I did, even the out\-of\-state ones. Also his top 3 favorite schools were the exact ones I had. Fortunately, he did not get accepted into my #1 pick \(which was also his #1 pick\). He ends up going to a school about 3 hours away from mine, but after about one year I heard he got kicked out and moved back home due to drug\-related charges \(by the university conduct committee, not the police\). Anyway, I finally got a break from this guy for about 2 years.

All of this brings us to where we are now. I've spent the last 2 years at college doing nothing but studying, and decided to take a year off to take a break and get some work experience back home. I never revealed these plans to him, but I guess a mutual friend ended up telling him that I was back in town. Not only does he know I'm back in town, but he also knows where I work \(I'm assuming either from social media or a friend telling him, but I also knew where he worked without him explicitly telling me\). About a week ago, I get a text from him telling me that he will be moving into an apartment complex that is maybe a 2\-3 minute drive from my house \(thank god I live in a gated community\). I kinda just ignored the message, I didn't want him to think I was excited about this. However, that's not even the end of it. Just yesterday he also sends me a text asking me if I will get him a job where I work and gives me the sob story about how he was ""fired"" from where he was working \(which is also a job that hires a lot of sketchy characters, so he must've \*really\* fucked up to get fired\). in a short message I tell him Ill try, but cant make any promises \(I will make sure he \*\*doesn't\*\* get a job where I work, and that every manager will know to avoid him\).

TL;DR an old acquaintance from high school who was kinda off is now aggressively trying to follow me. In high school I never thought much of it because I wanted to be around people in my friend group. Now that he was forced to part ways from me \(as a result of not getting into the same college\), he is trying extra hard to rekindle our acquaintanceship by moving right down the street from me and applying for a job where I work. How do I get rid of this guy? Like I said, I will make sure he never gets a job where I work, but moving down the street from me is beyond unsettling",02Jun2018,1
261,"I have a friend who I have been talking to exclusively for a year. Had ups and downs because of my depression but I never got into an argument with her nor have I blamed her for anything. Nevertheless, I would like to believe that she's closer to me than she was last year because of the first hangout we had. It was the first time we had seen each other Since last summer and I had a really good time. We laughed and chatted with each other, and she told the mutual friends we were hanging out with about our funny conversations, she smiled at me for all of the hangouts and always looked to me to talk to unless someone wanted to talk to her or vice versa. We even had a close conversation about homosexuality and religion on the way home, and when I dropped her off, we hugged and to be honest, it felt more like a cuddle than a hug. 

Then the second hangout came, and things changed. The only thing different was that her twin brother was there and he's not mean or a bad guy, he's cool. But I noticed she would criticize me a lot when he was around, and some of the things she said hurt my feelings. But then she'd come and say if I was okay (though I don't believe she knows she caused me to feel this way). However, she would laugh and chat with me. The hug I got was just that, a side hug, while all of my other friends got full hugs (even my guy friend). I even waved bye to her and it's like she half-assed it. 

This is very confusing to me because she was still nice to me, and chatted and laughed with me, but she would criticize and say bluntly mean things to me in the second hangouts. She didn't say anything mean or anything remotely bad to me during the first one.

We plan on hanging out with each other in a few weeks when she gets back in town so we could binge a series together. I don't know if I should bring this up with her, I don't know why I'm struggling with asking her this.

He didn't pay me any more money.

I found a $60 GPU and Purchased it, but he wanted to keep the $130 GPU, but didn't have the funds to pay for it at the moment.

after 5-6 months with the card, it stopped working. I can't figure out what happened, its just dead. He doesn't think he should have to pay for it, since I built the computer and I should have built him that wasn't going to break.

i put my $60 GPU in there for the moment.

I am only going to talk about the bad stuff, but please understand I know I do have a lot of good things in my life. 
I am overweight, an unhealthy amount.  I am always working on it, but never stick with anything.  Right now I am down 8 lbs. which is great but I feel like I am slipping back to my old habits.  (trying to cut down on carbs)
I have low self esteem.  I have tried positive self talk, but that is about it for that.  I don't know how to change my attitude/thoughts.
I am terribly shy.  At work it isn't a problem, but anytime I get out of my comfort zone I feel like I am a leech hanging on to anybody that will talk to me.  
This isn't my last problem, but I feel like it is the last important one: memory.  This contributes a lot to my shyness and self confidence.  I have a terrible memory for most things.  Unless it was traumatic or made me angry.   I forget names, I forget what I talked with people about, I forget movies, history...  The more nervous or frustrated I am, the worse it is.

However if I am to start the business I would most likely dropout of my studies. Some people have told me to concentrate on studies as it is difficult to complete studies later in life due to unavoidable responsibilities and other people are telling me that opportunities are rare and should give it all if it presents itself.

274,Hi guys I'm pretty new to this reddit thing but hopefully I'll get some answers. I have been with my boyfriend for almost 6 months and like the title says he happens to have a 2 year old daughter from his previous relationship. I didnt find out until we were dating for about 2 weeks and he never told me I kind of just figured it out on my own. Hes a great guy he loves me and treats me amazingly. His family really likes me too and so does mine. I guess where I'm trying to go from this is is it worth it being a stepmom? He wants a future with me but it's kinda hard for me when hes kinda my first relationship and I've never been with anyone seriously who had a kid. I've met her before shes really cute and she likes me as well but...I guess I'm just worried that if we ever have a kid it wont be the same and I do have to admit I get jealous of the idea sometimes. I've never talked to his ex or ever met her I've just seen pictures of her on Facebook. He did tell me that he still wanted to be with him but of course he told her no and that he loves me now. I guess I just want to see if there are other people in my situation or who's been a step mom? I've done my research and a lot of people say it's hard and that you'll always feel like an outsider and stuff. I'm kind of just confused on what to do :( I'd like to get some feedback.

276,"Yesterday was my last day of highschool and I’m royally fucked. I’ve had a problem with a prescription drug the last 2 months of school and it caused me to miss a lot of days because I didn’t want anyone to see me in that state. 
The last two weeks I finally got sober and beat the withdrawals. Sadly it seems it was a little too late. I passed all of my classes except a one semester math class. I worked my ass off the last few nights getting all of my work done. On Friday I took a test and a final in that math class. I literally had learned the content the same day within 45 mins and got an A on the test but a D+ on the final. I didn’t pass so I emailed my teacher about my current situation and I’m still waiting for him to respond. 

In the mean time this means I can’t go to my job in the military. I’m a smart kid (1350 PSAT in 11th grade, didn’t take a real one since I was going to the military). I prepared for the worst waiting for my teacher to email me back and tel me I had to do summer work to graduate. So I signed up to take the SAT in August. Is there any chance I could get into a non-community college near me based on a high SAT score? What should I be doing in the meantime while waiting on a response from the teacher?

281,"My girlfriend and I have secretly (kinda) been dating for a while. Everyone--her parents, my friends, her friends--already knows and wholeheartedly approves of the relationship; my parents are the only ones unaware (they know we want to but disapprove). We've had a couple arguments about the whole thing and they've made it pretty clear that they want us just to be friends.


Now, it's not really that they disapprove of her, it seems to be more that they disapprove of me being in a relationship in general. Some of their reasons have been:


**You won't be able to handle the emotional stress after leaving for college**


So basically we're both going to different colleges (about 2.5 hours away), so my parents probably think that it'll be too hard to keep up the relationship and I'll end up getting hurt. A second part of this is that I'll be going to a top 5 university, and they're making the argument that I'll waste my time with this relationship and not take full advantage of my educational opportunities.


First off, I honestly found this really disheartening and a bit insulting, since it's as if they don't trust me to make my own decisions and navigate my own life. All these years I've worked my butt off to get where I am now, and I've shown them that I'm able to manage my different responsibilities well. They don't think that I'm smart enough to know when things are taking an unhealthy turn and to deal with stuff on my own--even though that's what I've been doing for the past four years.


When I bring this argument up to them they just brush it off and claim that this is different, this is something emotional that I haven't experienced yet. Ok... then let me have the experience? Stop trying to protect me from it? Do you really think that I haven't had emotional experiences as a high school student? I fought really intense personal conflicts after transferring to a new school and developing an autoimmune condition, and it's only through facing my emotions that I got to the point that I am now... and it's like they choose to ignore all of that.


**I should wait until the first semester of college to see if I can handle it.**


Kinda related to the first one. But I really don't want to wait any more. I'm only going to be 17 once. Let me live my life. Plus, I've spent all my life preparing for the next step in my life--this is something that I want to do now.


And when I argue this way, they say that I'm being immature, and point to family members who have waited until college to start dating. Alright, for fucks sake, first off, I'm not them, and second off, why should I always act mature? If I have the chance to be young only once, why not seize it? My mom keeps telling me to give her time to think about it, but I dont have time. I'm not waiting for you to come around.

**Something in my intuition tells me that it doesn't feel right.**


CMON NOW. REALLY? You're going to prevent me from being with someone important to me because YOU can't place a good reason behind it and are just leaving it up to feeling?


**You're arguing too hard for this. It makes us nervous.**


... So if I don't argue for it, you brush it aside. If I do, then you claim I'm taking it too seriously. I also tack on that my parents are the ones taking it too seriously, but then they go back and say that if it's not that serious, then why do you argue so hard for it? This one really just made my brain short circuit.


**Here are some of the other things I've tried:**


* Pointed to my friends, who have parents that trust them to make decisions for themselves and be in relationships (long distance, age difference, etc.). They brush it off and say that they're different.


* Told them that they don't need to protect me from it, and that I can handle myself. They say that I don't know what I'm doing and that I shouldn't talk if I haven't experienced it.


* Told them that we're both smart enough to deal with this ourselves, and that if it doesn't work out in college, we've already agreed to break it amicably. They say yeah right, emotions don't work like that. Alright? Then you must understand why I'm arguing so hard for this? Girl in question is an insanely smart person (probably even more so than me) and we both trust ourselves to do what's good for us.


* Asked them why they don't trust me. They say when have I ever not trusted you? Uh... this thing? I've proven that I can be successful without my parents controlling me since in the past they have always trusted me to control my life, and it's really annoying that they don't trust me on this one thing just because they believe that I'm inexperienced.


Anyways, this has been a really long post and it's probably time to wrap it up. This is something that really matters to me and it's put a pretty big strain on my relationship with my parents. I feel like because it seems like they don't trust me, I don't trust them anymore, even though I've been working so hard both in school and in a job to make them happy. The only reason I did so was to make them proud, and now it's as if they look past all that. They seem to even take credit for it--one of their most infuriating arguments is that since you've gotten so far we must have done something right, so you should listen to us--which completely ignores my daily 2AM work nights or the stress I've gone through to get to where I am now.


What do you guys think? I plan to continue keeping it secret, but it would be so amazing if they would just say ""alright, that's fine"" and trust me to handle this aspect of my life. Thanks for reading.


TLDR: Parents disapprove of me being in a relationship. What can I do to change their minds?",02Jun2018,2
282,"Hi all.


  I'm a 23 year old graduate from the UK working in a finance company. My issue is that I basically hate the whole lifestyle of it.

  The role itself isn't bad,- the issue is that I don't enjoy working 9-5. I don't want to sound cocky in any way, but I'm quite good at my job, and I don't hate it either. I'm also very grateful that I have the job. It's just the fact that I have to be in that routine and get maybe 2-3 hours free time a day is what is killing me. I have to wake up at 6 am and be in bed by 10 pm max, which is something I hate. The fact that I'm lazy doesn't help. 


  Before I started the job, I was highly motivated and I knew I would be able to make it to the top. I've always laughed when people say that money doesn't bring you happiness, but now I can understand.

  I went on a short holiday to a town in the UK and everyone seemed much happier. Again, without trying to sound condescending, I know they didn't have the best of jobs, at least pay wise, however they seemed much more content with their lives. This is what triggered me to reevaluate my life and prompted me to make this post.

 An option which I'm considering is to work for a few months longer and just go travelling or do something else with my life. However this will set me behind both financially, and in terms of career development - and I really don't want to be behind in the latter, especially if I gain very little from the experience should I choose to do it. 


  I just would like to hear some thoughts on my predicament or something that can make me view this situation (hardly a situation) in a better way.

  Apologies if this sounds bad or I've said something stupid, this is the first time in my life I'm speaking about a problem I have, and so not sure if I sound bad.  Thanks.",02Jun2018,1

First and most importantly, this transaction was made through oplata.info , which as far as I know, isn't the shadiest site out there or anything

So I got into this acc, it's some 30 year old Russian guy with an anime profile picture, and he has about 20 games, Id say around 150-200 in value, including DLC. 

So I just assumed that he sold his account and this guy just couldnt sell it to anyone so he gave it away along with Far Cry 5. So I'm like ""well what a bargain!"".

I saw he had a game that Ive been wanting to play with friends for years so I started installing it, totally ecstatic about my newfound games.

Then I saw he had played a week ago.

So what do you think I should do? Im a bit too selfish to just let this go, JUST in case it is an unused acc. Maybe the guy selling played on that acc? Maybe his account was hacked? Maybe he just sold his acc a week ago and I just so happened to get a f*ckton of games?

Obviously, even if I wanted to, I couldnt change the password or anything because I dont have the email password

296,"4 years ago I met a girl online. We were both from Canada, but she lived in Alberta and I in Ontario, so though we both bonded over that similarity because of the distance I never actually got to meet her. 

There was a significant period of time where I would talk to her almost every night, and the nights when we didn't talk we made up for by sending each other humorous texts and playing video games together. Needless to say, me and this girl became very close to the point that I considered her one of my best friends. 

As the years went on she opened up to me more and more about her struggles with depression, she had been blackmailed by friends and ended up having to transfer schools, she had a history of abuse, and despite meds, therapy, and me talking to her it about it, it became evident that nothing was helping. On top of that, other underlying health issues with her organs made her life more difficult as things like her diet were restricted, adding to her depression.

Over the course of a year she sent me 2 suicide notes, both times leaving me panicking as I was too far away to do anything, each time she was hospitalized and came back with no talk about them every existing. 

The last year I knew her we became distant, I talked her fairly often but not as frequently as before. She had recently moved to the USA, and I was trying to finish school leaving us both distracted. During that year she was frequently in the hospital without any internet leaving me no way to contact her. I, trying to be polite, never asked why she went to the hospitals, and tried to leave it out of our friendship as she didn't seem keen on talking about it. 

Then last year in April she disappeared for good. I wasn't shocked at first as I assumed it was another hospital visit and nothing I should be concerned about and figured she would be home soon. But a few months went by after that and then I began to get nervous: I started frequently googling her name \(nothing ever came up\), and stalking her parents social media \(which were pretty private\), all lead to nothing. 

The next 3 months I still didn't hear from her, I stopped looking for evidence of where she was and I started up at a new school and focused most of my thoughts on that. Yet, I knew something was wrong. I always tried to justify it by saying she was still in the hospital despite knowing deep in the back of my head that there was no way it was true. It wasn't until 10 months since I last heard from her that when talking to a close friend, I admitted my concern about her. It took my friend one google search of her name to find her obituary, something I either chose not to acknowledge when I was googling her before or simply never noticed. 

I immediately messaged my internet friend's mom, explaining how I knew her and offering my condolences. I didn't demand any information on what had happened, at the time it seemed unnecessary. Either way, she never responded. That was 6 months ago.    

I am broken. For about a month afterwards I scoured the internet trying to figure out what had happened, half of my mind said it had to be suicide, another half said it was physically related, but there was way for me to confirm anything. All I know is that she was in a hospital for a few months before she died, making suicide not seem likely, but based on her past history and quotes from friends online such as ""I can't believe you thought this was the way out,"" it does seem that way. Often on her parents Facebook a website is credited to be about her ""recovery"" but when I try to go to it or click on it, it doesn't exist. 

So many people tell me to move on, they say ""She was just a internet friend."" or tell me that because I never met her I can't feel that bad, but It's killing me inside and I feel like I can't get the closure I need until I know what happened as shallow as that sounds

309,"I live in ireland and im from poland. Just finished school. My exams are starting Wednesday which will determine how much points I'll get and what college will accept me. 
 I've no clue what college to choose. I'd love to write and become a writer but the chances of that are slim to none. I don't want to spend 4 years in college on a degree that won't give me a back up and that's useless anyway.
 I can't stand of the idea of sitting in an office being told what to do and do some study bullshit all day long as I hate to study. I only do something if I really like it so something like a lawyer which is years of study goes out the window. 
 I'd like to join the army but ireland isn't recruiting and Poland is, well, in Poland and have a really strict requirements which I prob wouldn't get into . That kind of work would be ideal, in the field, doing exciting stuff. Same would go for a policeman but ireland doesn't even have them, just some bullshit guards which don't so anything and can't even carry a gun. 
 My mother is pushing for business or IT. I know that IT Is the future of the world but I just can't grasp it. My friends do coding and stuff like that or software development and I would be so lost. Business, accounting etc, I'm not sure about. Its boring. The only thing id like to do with business is probably investment banking as I'm somewhat interested in the stock market and it is somewhat exciting of the unknown. 
 Obviously money is a big factor to me, i hate being limited by cash as I know how it is at home and want to be better off When I'm settled down. 
I don't really know what I'm asking but I'm just constantly stressed and depressed about all this hitting me at once. How is an 18 year old suppose to choose what he wants to do for the rest of his life. I also don't want to spend 4 years in a business degree to end up being a cashier in a bank.

310,"Back story. End of last year I was brought into my managers office regarding matters that shouldn’t have been brought up. 
They shouldn’t have been brought up because 1. It wasn’t their issue to raise. 2. They broke confidentiality. They questioned my commitment which pissed me off. If someone else had said this my first response would be “so what part did you play in this” but I can guarantee I did very little to make this happen. I went to HR and was given some solid advice and I formally confronted the two managers about that meeting and asked their intent. No answer. Well no real answer. Since then they’ve been kissing my ass. 6 months later they are now bullying a work colleague (moved on from me) she’s getting it far worse than I did. The ceo knows our particular manager isn’t a people’s person but tolerates her because she does her job well. I am of the belief that it’s unacceptable behaviour full stop. 
The HR that advised me has gone and we have a new one but I’m unsure if I can trust her. 
The bullying in the office is getting worse. Morale is low. There’s 9 of us that work from a satellite site so it’s hardly seen or heard from others.
We can’t talk to managers directly because they don’t listen. Things only changed for me because of what I did for myself. 
I have advised colleague to do the same and she might but conversations with others we realise we need to do something as a collective. 
So I’m asking.. if there’s any advice on how to best address the bullying. 
The trouble is that the two tiers above will minimise this. Our only hope really is our CEO who is reasonable but he only gets involved if we can’t sort it out. If we address managers they will nod etc but they will low key make our lives hard. ",02Jun2018,1

320,"Hello Redditors,

So first off I am a college student. I have an internship thing that I am going to be doing part time starting in June, but I need to be busy and work while I am not doing that.

For the last 3 summers, I have been working at a warehouse. I really enjoy being at that warehouse, I love the people there, and I seem to know it pretty well by this point. However, being in the warehouse very negatively affects my head. I am not sure how to really describe it. It is something physical, I do not know what exactly, but something about the warehouse (maybe the insane amounts of dust or other debris) messes with my head so much. I get these feelings where I feel like I am a zombie: not being able to focus on anything, missing large portions of conversation and feeling like I am not even physically present. Last year I noticed it and suffered greatly but I thought it was a concussion. However, from my 3 days there so far, I have again been having these feelings. I cannot work there if I feel like I have been feeling, as it has made my life terrible the last few days.

So, as a rising junior in college studying computer science, what other options do I have for a part time job? Of course, I could apply to food establishments if I desperately need something, but is there something better for me? I was thinking some sort of IT, but I am not entirely sure if places hire for such a small amount of time.

His mother is the executor of his estate. I offered to buy out his part after he died -- at the price he put in. His mum told me that she had to follow probate law and insisted that the house be valued and he get back his proportion, under the assumption she'd get more than what he put in originally -- eating into my deposit (I put in 75%, he put in 25% deposit but the house ownersh was split 60/40 because we looked at the overall value of the house and mortgage, not just the deposit). I made the point that it wasn't what him and I had agreed and she didn't care, and forced the legal route. 

The house was valued for less than what we bought it for, and the calculations of his proportion came back about £7k less than his original amount, which I'd initially offered to pay. She agreed on the settlement figure and now two days later has come back to me asking for the original amount!

330,"Hi guys, long time lurker, first time poster:
So i'll explain the story: Basically i am 25 year old male and met my current girlfriend on the internet and moved country to live with her 1 year ago. While i have a proffessional industry i work in which basically means i could work in almost any country in the world, i still yearn to go back to my home country.
My gf(25F) works a regular job in a store, didn't finish high school and stuff like that and has no relevant education, she is an amazing person though, kind , caring, selfless, would literally do anything for me. While we do argue and things like normal couples do over mainly stupid things it feels asif over time, im confused as to go back to my country of origin where things are easier, life is easier for me and i can obtain a higher standing job there. 
She says the relationship will be over if i moved because she doesn't want to do long distance again, we were LDR for 1 year and lived together for 1 year. I gave up my car, my apartment, my job and such and have asked her to move back with me but she isn't willing to give things up to come back with me because she doesn't have enough trust in me that i wont just throw her out or something and she will have gave everything up for nothing. 
My main reasons for wanting to go home is just missing the freedom of being my own independent person, not having to consult someone else on a decision. Just taking care of myself and not having to worry about someone else. The people of my country have differen't culture to the country i moved in and the documentation is just far easier if you were born in the country you live in compared to the one i am in.
I understand the concept of: ""The grass is not always greener on the otherside""
I worry about my girlfriend much because i still care about her and her happiness that she wont be as financially stable if i leave and she may have to sell some things we bought together that she could not afford to run whilst on her own. She has never had much in life and we have invested alot together in things and this is as far as she has come in life and i feel like if i leave she has gone 10 steps forward and then immediately 12 back and im struggling with the guilt of that.
I have already gave 1 month resignation at my job and they are fine with it, but im worried am i throwing away a potential wife,children, future all for the sake of a few moments of happiness of independence.
Basically what im asking is, are there any people who made big decision and gave up relationships and moved and then decided the place wasn't for them, went home and regretted the decision.
I fear i will land back in my own country and 1 week later think ""what the fuck have i done""

She always puts me before herself and loves me like no other person in the world. As I grew up, I realize that she is not perfect. Most people have this realization about their parents at some point. 

Growing up, we rarely spoke of my biological father. When we do, she's usually saying something negative about him. I don't say much on the matter because I was scared of saying something wrong and her yelling at me. They separated when I was 2 so I don't remember him too well. I didn't even remember what he looked like until he messaged me on facebook one day when I was about 13/14. I told my mom about this and she immediately blocked him and his entire family from my account. I always wondered what he did that was so bad that she would take away his child from him. I got older and finally had the courage to ask her. Turns out it was just about the fact that they didn't get along \(I don't remember the specifics\).

I knew my only chance of survival is to pack my bags and bolt as fast as I can out my backyard. So after I came to that conclusion, I packed some clothes and then got all my banking and put it in a little bag for me to carry on the way out.

I then made a little fire in my kitchen and then bolted out the back door and ran into the forest that was behind my house. After that, I bolted for about 2 miles until I stopped in Albany, NY. 

Im now staying in a apartment I rented today and I’ll be staying here for now on. I’m so pissed since I don’t want to go back to jail and there’s nothing wrong with child porn anyways. It’s hot as fuck and that’s how it will stay in my heart. Not a sin, just normal.

336,"I didn't really lie... my friend and I are in a band together we had a show last night, at the show while we waited outside for the other members to show up, the person running the venue that night asked for our ages. I don't keep track of my birthday, but I just had one about 4 months ago and I still have a habit of saying my old age lol. This ticked off my friend so badly, he yelled at me and said ""that is not your age, stop lying"" I told him ""chill? I don't even care, It was a mistake and why does this matter?"" He didn't answer me and also when someone asked me how long I have been playing for(it was loud in the venue, and I honestly thought he meant how long have you been playing in your band for) I said ""oh for about a year now."" My friend again got really ticked off and yelled and said ""stop with the lies!!! You have been playing for 5 years."" Then my friend also gets mad I go by a nickname when we play out(its a ""normal"" name just something I go by sometimes) he says its lying (again, how is having a nickname lying?). Why does my friend act this way? He also had a mental breakdown outside after we set our gear up to wait just because his mom left and wanted to go to eat dinner real quick before we played... and guess what? He doesn't even like his mom watching him play so yeah I was pretty confused as to why that angered him so much. I'm 19 friend is 20. We only play at all age venues currently. But I am guessing the guy asked us our ages yesterday because on the other side of the venue was a bar/resturant... but the music side was all ages.

TL;DR: friend got mad at me that I accidentally said I was the age I was last year(even though I literally was 4 months ago), he got mad at me that I tell people my nickname is my name when we play out places with the band.

338,"I'm a 16 YO male who comes from a very poor family. I have 9 siblings with an 10th on the way. Programs like WIC are the only reason my parents can afford to have so many kids. This post is going to be hefty, as I have a lot I need help with.


Things have always been rough at my house, I was only able to get my own room after my dad partially converted the garage into a room. I say partially because he never finished it after starting around 3-4 years ago. Before that, I slept in the downstairs living room. The ceiling and two of the walls are unfinished. The room needs cords from other rooms run to it for electricity and light.


I have always struggled with depression and, as I became a teenager, insomnia. In the past it was manageable, but recently has spiralled out of control.


I've never struggled in school and have always had straight A's. My GPA dropped from a 4.0 to a 3.0 and I've failed multiple classes this year. The GPA is likely to go lower after finals this week.


For my sophomore year, I decided to take all virtual courses, as it was the easiest way to stay in band but also ""homeschool"". I was told I could go my own pace and would only have to come to school for tests and exams. 


Through the program they used, I had a test almost every single day, because I had 7 different courses. You could not progress any further in the class until you had completed the tests. They only activated them if you went to the school to take them. My parents have never been the most supportive of anything I do, and my mom refused to transport me to school ""at my demand"". She told me to instead ride the bus if I needed to go to school so badly. 


Now, as mentioned earlier, I'm insomniac. It is hard to sleep at night and I often don't sleep until the wee hours of the morning. Not having to get up at 5:30 AM to catch a bus is one of the main reasons I wanted to homeschool.


Beyond this initial problem, another issue began to come up. My parents treated my schoolwork as if it was only homework. They figured it was something that could be completed at a later time if they needed me to do something for them at the current time. They'd have me wash dishes, watch kids, or clean so they could run errands or catch up on some extra sleep. 


To make things even worse, my parents cancelled our WiFi without doing research and we had no WiFi for at least a month. It wasn't long before the director of the school's virtual program began to show concern with my progress. The director contacted my parents and told them I had mandatory attendance and would have to go to school regular hours.


Around this time, I began to have health issues pop up. Constipation, nausea, a burning feeling in my abdomen, random fevers, cold sweats, tiredness, and loss of appetite were just a few of the symptoms. This didn't mix well with the depression and insomnia I was already dealing with. I missed a lot of school. A lot.


When the end of the semester rolled around, they barely cared that I had been feeling ill. The extended my exams by a week. I managed to complete 5 of my 7 classes. They kicked me out of the virtual program and set me back up with traditional high school.


Since then, I've accumulated about 30~ absences (block schedule) per class. This semester, it's been the result of not being able to sleep at night and how I feel in the morning. 


I had a doctor's appointment where we experimented with gluten-free and dairy-free diets to see if that would help. It didn't help at all. Between the initial appointment and the follow-up appointment, I lost 10 lbs. I also had a fever both times. They scheduled me with a GI unit in a larger city nearby, but not until late July. I have a doctor's note to ""excuse"" the absences for now. My doctor is currently diagnosing and treating it as IBS.


Finals are this week, and as I mentioned earlier, it's not looking too bright for me now.


So, academics aside, there's also been a lot of family drama developing. My dad has always struggled with hoarding stuff. Thankfully though, for the most part, not trash. We have 5 closets in the house and none of them are usable. We also have a second garage, a tiny spare room, and a pullbarn which are all mostly unusable.


My dad has been the stay at home dad ever since I was little. I am the only child who shined academically. All of the other children struggle in school. They have trouble socializing and poor manners (never really learned how to do so at home). My dad's style of parenting included staying up all night, only to throw PBS on a TV when the kids woke up and sleep all day.


He's been in trouble with the police before, not for anything super big but he was raised in poverty in Chicago so you get the idea. My mom is very cryptic about what he's gotten busted for and has done in the past. I know that currently, he grows weed to help support our family, which I'll get to more in a second.


The house is an absolute nightmare. The downstairs living room that I used to sleep in is a clothes pile because no one does laundry. The kids' rooms look like those scary pictures of hoarding dens you see on TV. There's toys and food and trash stuffed everywhere. 


CPS has already visited our house once. I didn't call them, I believe it was a teacher from the school district. All the kids exhibit odd behavior and often dress poorly, sometimes in dirty or wrinkled clothing. I was only in 8th grade at the time and I honestly thought my life was normal when they questioned me. I think everyone told the case worker we didn't have any problems at home.


It ended with them telling us to clean up the house and they'd be back to check in a week. We did and they came back and said we were okay for now. The house immediately returned to it's state of chaos following the incident and has since gotten worse. 


My mom has been the worker ever since I was little. She got her associates recently and picked up a job as a nurse. After my parents 10th child, my dad got a vasectomy. My mom got pregnant again because my dad didn't feel like waiting for the testing to make sure he was all good, I guess. My dad convinced my mom to quit her job because he insisted they would fire her for so many missed days anyways. My dad had a part time cable working job at that point in time and then committed full-time. 


This was late Dec. / early Jan. so it happened around the time I was taking virtual courses. It's the main reason I had to watch kids frequently. It's been a financial roller coaster ever since my mom quit. My dad earns commission. Nobody lends them money anymore because they are always asking for help. My mom told me they have several maxed out credit cards.


My dad recently claimed he doesn't love my mom anymore and is going through a mid-life crisis. He refuses to go to counseling because last time he tried that with my mom, they used a family friend who ratted on my dad to the police, I guess. Anyways, my brother told me my dad grows and deals weed in our pullbarn (not legal in my state currently). My mom isn't allowed in the pullbarn. Some man visits daily and goes in the pullbarn. My dad stays out at nights a lot, claiming it's not worth the gas driving back from work.


I had to sell my TV and TV stand to help my mom pay bills while my dad was in Memphis for a few weeks. It was a big TV and pretty old but the stand was nice (I took most of the furniture in my room from the other garage or my grandma).


Anyways, I'm sure I've missed some stuff, there's a lot. I'm so stressed. I'm worried I'm going to fail sophomore year, none of the teachers care about my doctor's note. I don't know what to do. I have to spend at least an hour a day doing dishes. I also take care of the family pets (4 cats and a ferret) in the room next to me. There used to be 2 guneia pigs too but my mom finally stepped up and got rid of them because she never should've got them in the first place. 


I feel horrible for keeping the cats in the single room, but there's not many other places for them to go, idk why my mom bought four. I was depressed and asked my mom for a single cat companion that I said I'd take care of. But she had to have the cat's brother and sisters as well though because they were oh so cute as babies. No one else helps take care of them, not even my mom, it's my job on top of all the dishes and weekly mowing the lawn, as well as having to watch the kids on occasion.


Anyways, I got sidetracked, because like I said, there's a lot going on. I'm worried that if I fail sophomore year, I'll be forced to do summer school and besides not being able to bare that, I really wanted to work. I don't have much and I was thinking this was the perfect time to get the money for a laptop for video editing/programming on. If I have to do summer school, my boss said he'd look to hire other people and shrink my hours so I'd barely be able to work. If I don't do summer school, they might just make me repeat sophomore year. I'm not really sure what to do. It's like my academic life, home life, and personal life are just all crashing down.


What can I do to help my situation? Please ask questions in you need clarity on anything or need to know anything else.",02Jun2018,6
339,"[M18] I want to preface this by saying I don't think I have depression. 

So it's finally the summer holidays and until they started I'd been pretty happy, uncharacteristically happy bar a week where I was really sad for some reason. Here's the thing now that I have all this free time I've realised that I don't think my friends consider me anything more then a school friend. Which feels pretty shitty. I didn't realise but they almost never invite me out and when we do hang out it's usually because I organised it...

340,"My dads sister had a son , and we are the same age born the same year , just different months .

When we took baths together he use to tell me to pretend I was chained to the wall and he would touch me in my private parts .

341,"My boyfriend went down to the parking lot and found some fresh damage on the driver side of our car. Parked right next to us is another car that has what appears to be fresh damage on his passenger side mirror. The police said we had to go up to the station to make a report, they wouldn't come out. We took pictures and left a note for the guy to please contact us with his insurance information.


The guy called and said that the damage on his car is from several years ago and is unrelated to this incident. He claims that when he pulled up to park, there was a piece of scaffolding laying next to our car and he had to get out and move it to park. He says it must have blown off in the storm last night and damaged our car. 


In my opinion, the damage on his car looks new and the white paint matches our car. There is some gold paint it seems on the scratches on ours. At the same time, I feel like the damage on our car matches the scenario of something falling and placing downward scratches when his mirror would have put a long horizontal scratch. I'm confused here and would like some advice, on if this damage would have been caused by that and what we should do next.

350,"14, soon to be 15 m here


I get bullied a ton. Every day, sometimes during classes and almost every break. I don't wanna get into what ppl do because it will take way too much space.


If i tell my parents they will tell me to get my shit together and wouldn't think anything about it, they kinda hate me already.


I told the teacher she made the thing 5 times worse by making people shit talk me and tell rumors about me in class while i was sick. She didn't do anything with that information tho. I lost one of my best friends because she heard bunch of lies about me.


Idk what to do and i can't sleep because of it basically through the whole year and it's been getting much worse recently. Sometimes i go whole night without sleeping.


My parents make me go to bed at 1am which makes it even worse because i can't distract myself with anything. They are getting really mad at me for being awake at night.


My dad thinks that i can't sleep because i am displeased with myself and feel guilty about being lazy or that i sometimes sleep during the day (even though it's when i am really tired after i stay up entire night and it's only for an hour or two).


I don't know what to do, can someone help me please?",02Jun2018,1
351,"This is my first post ever so be kind to me please. 

I've always been sort of afraid of the dark. Growing up I liked to have the door open a bit with the hall light on so I could sleep. 

As I got older I got a bit better. I don't need a nightlight or anything now but if I turn off a light in a room or downstairs I will run away from the darkness as fast as I can. 

I thought this was normal and just a mild inconvenience in my life..but its started to get worse. I used to just get a mild fear or nervous feeling when being in the dark but it has now escalated to a severe fear. If I am in the dark alone my heart will start beating rapidly and my mind will start thinking that there is something there trying to ""get"" me.

Another strange thing is that I cannot stand next to my bed without that feeling as well. (Its a normal queen sized bed on a frame.) In my head I know that there is nothing under the bed but I will still get this feeling that something is waiting underneath, ready to grab my ankles. 

This has been happening for a couple months now and I have no idea what to do. I tried googling if anyone else feels like this but nothing is coming up. 

If anyone has any serious suggestions please let me know. I feel so embarrassed asking since I am in my early 20s and should not be afraid of the dark.

356,"Hey all! before I begin, this might be a little long, so at the bottom there will be no TL:DR summary, but my aim here is to share my life story as honestly as possible and perhaps receive some of reddit's infinite \(infamous amiright?\) wisdom. Thanks for your time!  


I was originally born in the state of Alaska in the early nineties, and my parents divorced early on due to use of drugs by my mother, and my father's emotional absence left my mother, err broken I suppose . At the time, I had one deceased brother, and a half sister, eleven years older. 

  
We moved to Florida where, at the age of six I began living with grandparents, nannies, my parents when either was able, or friends of the family. I immersed myself in books and developed strong intellectual capacities at a young age, not to humblebrag or anything. In Florida, I witnessed and endured a lot of things I'd wish on no humans, and for the western world were of extreme stressors on a child.   
From there, I moved to Illinois, Texas, and Wisconsin, living with various family members like my grandparents, as my dad continued in his work in Alaska's oil field, and my mother attended rehab. At this point, I moved back to Alaska with my father, and I was a bratty kid. Alas, I did well in school, but at the lack of making friends. My mother moved back to Alaska as well, and remarried, but she remained poor and struggled with numerous health problems, such as lupus. 

  
My father remarried here too, and this is when things start to get really rocky. I had a new step\-bro, who was pretty awesome, but my step mother was psychotic and bipolar, and my father remained absent emotionally, rarely providing anything besides the roof of my head. I wasn't grateful, and the relationship was tumulous throughout my tenure of high school. Nonetheless, I was in AP classes, began to make a lot friends, and was class president of my high school for junior and senior year. However, I began to party a lot, my grades slipped, and more importantly I got into some trouble for what was honestly innocent child behavior \(be happy to explain this in the comments,\) but this was the hair to break the camels back. My father kicked me out in winter, and I was homeless my senior of high school. Long story short here, I wasn't allowed to walk at graduation and all my accolades were stripped, but thankfully, I received my diploma, and hitchhiked down to Arizona for school. Couldn't attend school, because despite qualifying for FAFSA, school administrators determined that by using my health insurance plan I was on within the last six months, a product of my fathers employment, I wasn't ""technically homeless."" My mother and step father relocated to Arkansas not long prior, so I made my way there, but didn't feel I was ever going to make any forward progress, so I saved about a grand and made my way to Seattle next, on my 19th birthday. I worked there and couch surfed long enough for my father to call me back to Alaska with the offer of college being paid for. 

At University of Alaska Anchorage, I did well at first, studying Political Science, and found great life long friends and hobbies while attending. However, my sophomore year, I discovered pot, which lowered my grades, and my drinking was beginning to deteriorate my mental health, unbeknownst to me. Second semester, one of my closest, if not the closest friend I've ever had, a refugee from Sudan, was murdered by his cousin. Between that and some heart breaks, my solace was the bottle, and my dad cut off all support. So I cut him out, and midway through my junior year I joined the Army, selecting the infantry, caught up in the romanticism and all. Day one at Fort Benning, my mother passed.   


I elected to stay with boys, instead of attending the memorial and resuming training, feeling that my brothers were my family now, but this would be a decision to always haunt me. Months later, at Fort Riley KS, after training with my unit and after some leave back home, plus some more heartbreak, and a broken soul, I found solace in the bottle again. This time, it would lead to a DUI, and I was summarily chaptered out of the Army at 11months, 27 days in service. So you're aware, it's about three times worse in the Army, than in is being a civilian following a DUI. I got fucked over pretty bad, despite being a decent soldier. \(Guess its all about those OERs for the commander huh?\)   


More things continued to happen, like robbery of my home, betrayal by a close friend, my sister's passing, fellow infantry brothers passing, and my life spiraled out of control. 

Which leads me to now. I'm unskilled labor, working about 30 jobs in my life, between sales and customer service, construction, basically wherever would hire me, with management never disappointed in my work ethic. But pay is always pretty bad, and bosses usually worse, and although I'm enrolled in school here in Kansas, I'm so deep in the hole \(about 50k, including IRS, DFAS, credit cards, car payments, insurance..et cetera, not including college debt..\) that bankruptcy might be my only options with the exception of the French Foreign Legion. I have no family to turn to. Only about 2 years of college left, and financial aid will cover it, but my career dreams are likely shattered \(I've always wanted to work intelligence or diplomacy but I don't believe I'll ever qualify for a security clearance, at least not while I'm younger than 30.\) Even reenlistment is tenuous because of my chapter, and having a letter of reprimand in file means no cool\-guy schools, no matter how capable I am. No matter, I have health problems, like a disc herniation and cervical stenosis, stomach ulcers, pronounced bunions on my feet. Legal issues, because I was pulled over for driving while suspended. I hardly ever drink anymore, my vices are pretty damn limited.  I'm otherwise healthy and fit, I'm intelligent, and I've been told I am of good character and not too bad on the eyes. Things could be exponentially worse of course. 

I've endured damn near every hardship imaginable, and I've left out A LOT of things. Just I'm not sure what's left for me, even at 25. I've seen great things, the Northern Lights, and the Space Shuttles launching from Cape Canaveral. I've fallen in love and had my heart trampled, and fucked more pretty girls than I can count. I've climbed to the top of mountains, in \-30 degrees with 120MPH winds blasting my face. I've traveled the US, and have been out of country before. I've learned countless pieces of wisdom between the people I've met and the things I've been fortunate enough to see.   


My subsequent venture will likely shape the remainder of my life and I suppose I need help figuring out how to get there. I'm not sure what's in store for me, considering my hopes for my lifelong dreams are mostly smashed, and it will take great luck coupled with endurance and hard work to find myself out of the my financial situation. I guess what I'm really asking is what would y'all do? Start over in another country? Reenlist into a shite job in the military? Finish college and let the interest stack? Blow your brains out? Snort coke until blood drips out your nose on to a strippers ass?
